zzso zzso zzso causes late onset zzso and significant morbidity in zzso zzso zzso Animal models of zzso infection are useful in characterizing disease mechanisms and are an important approach to developing improved zzso and zzso Current zzso models of zzso bacterial infection employ zzso or subcutaneous routes at several days of age, and may, therefore, not accurately reflect distinct features of innate immune responses to zzso In this study we developed, zzso and characterized a zzso model of intravenous zzso infection in zzso mice zzso hours zzso old to describe the early innate immune response to zzso zzso mice zzso h old were injected IV with zzso zzso zzso zzso units zzso of zzso zzso a clinical isolate from a central zzso zzso A prospective injection scoring system was developed and zzso with only high quality injections zzso zzso mice were zzso between 2 and 48 h zzso and zzso liver, and blood collected to assess bacterial zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso High quality IV injections demonstrated zzso infection of zzso liver and zzso Within 2 h of injection, zzso induced selective zzso of zzso and zzso in the liver, and increased systemic production of plasma zzso and zzso Despite clearance of zzso and solid organ infection within 48 zzso zzso impairment in weight gain was zzso We conclude that a model of IV zzso infection in zzso mice zzso h old is zzso demonstrating zzso infection of solid zzso and a pattern of zzso rapid and selective innate immune zzso and impairment of weight gain typical of infected human zzso This novel model can now be used to characterize immune zzso evaluate infection zzso and assess preventative and therapeutic zzso
