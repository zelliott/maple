zzso have zzso properties, resulting in memory and learning zzso Red wine zzso has been linked to zzso but mechanisms are largely zzso The aim of this work was to test the effect of RW or zzso ethanol solution consumption on the expression of zzso and zzso receptors zzso in the rat zzso zzso were supplied to male zzso rats and after 8 weeks of treatment animals were zzso zzso was removed, zzso expression assessed by western zzso and zzso and zzso zzso determined by zzso The effects of treatments on zzso zzso activity were also determined, as well as the effect of several red wine zzso in zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso was increased by ethanol (to zzso but only significantly by RW (to zzso No difference was found in zzso expression among groups, whereas RW significantly decreased zzso expression (to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had no effect on zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso extract zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso 200 zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso The contribution of zzso in wine to the effect observed in zzso was investigated in animals treated for the same period with these compounds zzso zzso although no effect was seen in zzso activity, zzso or protein levels, meaning that this group of compounds had little contribution, if any, to the effects zzso Nevertheless, the increase in zzso expression induced by RW may corroborate the zzso ability attributed to this zzso zzso in the relative abundance of zzso expression may also play an important role in the zzso
