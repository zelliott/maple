Signaling zzso by the zzso target of zzso zzso zzso is activated during human zzso zzso zzso zzso is found in two complexes differing by the binding partner, zzso or zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso translation through the zzso of the zzso protein zzso This activity of the zzso complex is normally inhibited by cell stress responses or the drug zzso However, we previously showed that this zzso of zzso signaling can be zzso during zzso infection such that zzso of zzso is zzso Here we show that zzso infection also activates the zzso complex, as indicated by increased zzso of zzso zzso this zzso is insensitive to zzso but sensitive to caffeine in both zzso and infected zzso By using zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso we find that zzso is more significant than zzso for the viral zzso Surprisingly, the zzso effects of zzso on viral growth are primarily due to the presence of zzso not zzso zzso and zzso depletion experiments show that in zzso cells, both zzso and zzso complexes can mediate the zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso Under these conditions, the zzso complex is zzso for the zzso of zzso but the zzso complex is zzso These data suggest that, during zzso infection, the zzso and zzso complexes are modified such that their zzso zzso and zzso sensitivities are zzso Our data also suggest that the present understanding of zzso zzso effects is zzso
