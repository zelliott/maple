zzso zzso growth factor zzso is an important survival factor for zzso cells in hypoxic zzso High zzso regulates certain aspects of zzso expression in various cell types, including zzso zzso zzso Thus, ambient zzso levels may zzso the progression of chronic kidney disease, especially diabetic zzso zzso rat zzso zzso cells zzso were cultured for 24 h under hypoxic conditions zzso zzso with or without high zzso zzso zzso or with or without high zzso zzso zzso zzso included culture in zzso conditions and normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was assessed by real-time quantitative zzso and zzso protein in the zzso was assessed by zzso zzso increased zzso zzso This response was significantly blunted by high zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso increase for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso cells for zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso but not by high zzso It is interesting that hydrogen zzso also blunted this response, whereas zzso restored the zzso response to zzso in the presence of high zzso For determination of involvement of the zzso factor zzso element zzso pathway, zzso that were zzso zzso with zzso were cultured under the previous zzso High zzso also reduced zzso activity under zzso whereas zzso restored zzso In zzso experiments using zzso diabetic rats confirmed that zzso blunted zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment restored zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso diabetic zzso In conclusion, high zzso zzso zzso response to zzso in zzso This effect is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso
