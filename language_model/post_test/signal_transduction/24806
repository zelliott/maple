Both zzso and zzso toxins were used to label and study the expression of zzso G protein alpha zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of these proteins is zzso regulated throughout the zzso cycle with peak expression during early asexual development and in mature sexual zzso Treatment of zzso zzso cultures with zzso toxin causes an increase in conversion to sexual development, and at the same concentration has a marginal zzso effect on asexual growth and zzso Through precise zzso of the zzso asexual cell cycle, we have defined the period of sensitivity to this induction at around the time of invasion, one cycle before the development of the sexual zzso Fluorescent zzso confirmed that access of the toxin to the zzso is limited to the invasive form - the free zzso while further zzso studies revealed expression of a single G protein alpha zzso in these zzso These observations are consistent with the view that a G zzso signal zzso zzso is involved in zzso the zzso environment to commitment to sexual development zzso This means of artificially stimulating the pathways leading to sexual development can now be used to zzso follow the zzso of the zzso pathways zzso
