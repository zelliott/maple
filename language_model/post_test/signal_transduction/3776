zzso zzso cells are transient zzso located in the marginal zones of the zzso and zzso Recent studies have shown that they zzso and zzso the zzso zzso This zzso zzso protein has sequence similarities with cell zzso molecules and other zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso suggesting a role in cell migration and process zzso In zzso zzso mice lacking zzso the orderly zzso deposition of zzso cells during development is zzso indicating that zzso is essential for normal cortical zzso In the zzso zzso cells and zzso have recently been found to be important for the normal zzso fiber zzso of zzso from the zzso zzso These fibers are known to terminate in superficial layers of the zzso and zzso zzso regions in which zzso cells are zzso Both selective elimination of zzso cells by local zzso and zzso blockade zzso zzso of an important zzso near the zzso of zzso result in severe zzso of the growth of zzso zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso It is hypothesized in this review that zzso functions as a stop signal for both zzso zzso and growing fibers in the developing central nervous zzso
