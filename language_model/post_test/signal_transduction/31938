The zzso folate zzso zzso mediates zzso folate zzso and zzso zzso in this gene result in the zzso zzso disorder zzso folate zzso The current study, focused on a zzso analysis of this zzso identified zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso located in the fifth zzso domain as zzso that could not be replaced with zzso without a loss of zzso In contrast, function was preserved when zzso and zzso (the other conservative zzso motif in human zzso were replaced with zzso Similarly, zzso and zzso which constitute the only zzso zzso zzso motif in human zzso tolerated zzso zzso To explore the role of this region in folate zzso the zzso around zzso and zzso were analyzed by the zzso zzso accessibility zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso were functional and were inhibited by zzso zzso zzso this could be prevented with zzso zzso but the protection was sustained at zzso only for the zzso zzso consistent with zzso of zzso in the zzso folate binding zzso The functional role of zzso around zzso and zzso is consistent with a molecular structural model in which these two zzso along with zzso are accessible to the zzso zzso zzso zzso
