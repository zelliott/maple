zzso of zzso gene expression essential for formation of zzso in zzso zzso requires the components of the inner zzso zzso export apparatus and the zzso zzso regulatory zzso In this study, we characterized the zzso sensor zzso and how zzso of the protein is linked to the zzso export zzso We found that zzso is localized to the zzso zzso zzso and that zzso of zzso is essential for zzso zzso to the zzso zzso response regulator, zzso and expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso with incomplete zzso export zzso produced zzso levels of zzso and zzso but they were defective for signaling through the zzso zzso By using genetic approaches, we found that zzso activity is linked to and downstream of the zzso export apparatus in a regulatory cascade that zzso in expression of zzso zzso zzso By analyzing defined zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso that form zzso export zzso that are zzso incompetent, we determined that formation of the apparatus is required to contribute to the signal sensed by zzso to terminate in zzso of expression of zzso zzso zzso Considering that the zzso export zzso of zzso coli and zzso species influence zzso zzso gene zzso our work expands the signaling activity of the zzso to include zzso pathways of zzso zzso and possibly other zzso zzso This study indicates that these zzso have broader functions beyond zzso protein zzso including zzso of essential zzso regulatory systems required for expression of zzso zzso zzso
