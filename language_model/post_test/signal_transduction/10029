The zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role during development of zzso and zzso Although the molecular basis by which protein zzso A zzso regulates the stability of zzso downstream zzso factor zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is well zzso the mechanism by which zzso zzso the functions of zzso molecules in zzso remains zzso Here, we report that zzso of zzso retains zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity promotes nuclear zzso of zzso zzso analysis identifies zzso as a major zzso site determining zzso protein zzso In the three-dimensional structure, zzso resides adjacent to the basic zzso cluster of the nuclear zzso signal zzso zzso of this zzso zzso is predicted to alter the local charge and consequently the zzso zzso Indeed, zzso of this zzso to zzso zzso results in more zzso zzso whereas a zzso to zzso zzso leads to more nuclear zzso zzso of the zzso causes zzso to be more zzso We find that the change of zzso zzso is correlated with the change of its zzso zzso These data provide evidence to support a model that zzso regulates zzso zzso and its zzso activity, in part, through modulating the zzso zzso
