A zzso zzso produced by zzso rats with zzso zzso zzso cells from zzso mice, had an zzso effect on zzso zzso 4 zzso proliferation and differentiation of zzso B zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso exerted these zzso effects at an early phase of B cell proliferation and zzso Nevertheless, the zzso response of zzso to zzso was not inhibited by zzso In addition, zzso inhibited neither the B cell proliferation induced by zzso 2 nor the B cell differentiation by zzso zzso zzso experiments, together with zzso analysis, revealed that the zzso recognized by zzso appears to be an zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping analysis using zzso gene zzso showed that zzso zzso is dependent upon the expression of the first alternatively spliced zzso of zzso zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso to an zzso of zzso zzso but not zzso had similar zzso effects on the zzso zzso response of B zzso These findings suggest that the zzso molecules associated with zzso and zzso zzso are probably related to a signal zzso provided by zzso in B zzso The possibility that different pathways are operative for zzso signaling between B and T cells has to be zzso
