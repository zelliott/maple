Multiple myeloma zzso is characterized by zzso expansion of zzso plasma cells in the bone zzso and their zzso into peripheral blood with progression to plasma cell zzso Our previous study defined a functional role of zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso and zzso In this study, we examine signaling events zzso zzso zzso cell zzso We show that zzso zzso using either soluble zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and activates its downstream zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso also activates the zzso zzso zzso pathway, evidenced by zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso zzso of zzso and zzso as well as zzso expressing zzso and zzso expressed zzso we demonstrate that zzso and zzso activities are required for zzso zzso cell zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso only partially zzso prevents migration, suggesting only a minor role in regulation of zzso zzso zzso We further demonstrate that zzso zzso nuclear factor zzso B zzso as a downstream target of zzso zzso and that zzso of zzso B signaling using specific zzso zzso and zzso completely abrogates zzso zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso B target zzso is induced by zzso and conversely, that zzso induction via zzso is blocked by zzso and zzso B zzso Our data therefore indicate that zzso zzso cell migration is primarily zzso via zzso of zzso B zzso and further suggest that novel therapies targeting this zzso may inhibit zzso cell migration associated with progressive zzso
