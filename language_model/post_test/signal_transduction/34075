zzso cells of the zzso zzso series differentiate in response to zzso This is accompanied by increased expression of both zzso and zzso and has been shown to be zzso zzso zzso zzso The events downstream of zzso that regulate zzso zzso gene zzso however, remain to be fully zzso In the present study, we show that incubation of zzso cells with zzso brings about zzso of the zzso zinc zzso zzso zzso factor dependent upon zzso In addition, we show that the zzso promoter regions of both zzso and zzso contain functional zzso binding sites that are zzso zzso zzso zzso of the putative zzso elements abolished zzso binding to the promoters of both zzso and zzso Not only did zzso treatment increase zzso DNA binding activity to these sites, but it also zzso cellular levels of zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a markedly blunted response to zzso for induction of both zzso and zzso zzso transcript zzso Cell surface expression of zzso and zzso was also reduced, but to a lesser zzso Taken together, these results show that zzso is involved downstream of zzso in a zzso signaling zzso leading to zzso cell differentiation and zzso of zzso and zzso
