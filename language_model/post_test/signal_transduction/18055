A specific zzso zzso zzso for oxidized low density zzso zzso distinct from the scavenger zzso in zzso has been identified and zzso In this study, we examined the regulation of zzso by oxidized low density zzso zzso and determined the role of zzso in zzso zzso of cultured human coronary artery zzso cells zzso zzso of zzso with zzso (40 zzso but not native LDL, for 24 hours markedly increased zzso expression zzso and zzso After 48 hours of zzso of zzso with a specific zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was suppressed zzso In contrast, treatment of zzso with sense zzso had no zzso zzso also induced zzso zzso by terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso of zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso played an important role in zzso zzso of zzso because zzso zzso inhibited this effect of zzso zzso acid and zzso 2 different chemical zzso of zzso also decreased zzso zzso of zzso Nuclear factor zzso was markedly activated in zzso zzso The critical role of zzso zzso became evident in experiments with zzso zzso which abolished zzso zzso zzso In this process, an zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso of zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso its own zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by the action of zzso In this process, zzso zzso may play an important role as a signal zzso zzso
