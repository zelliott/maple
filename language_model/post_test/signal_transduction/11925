In zzso zzso the zzso small zzso zzso zzso surveillance system encodes more than 30,000 unique zzso zzso which silence a variety of foreign zzso zzso What mechanisms allow zzso zzso transcripts to evade zzso by the zzso zzso One likely candidate in a protective mechanism is the zzso zzso which interacts with zzso zzso that are zzso to nearly all zzso zzso Here, we use an in zzso zzso zzso zzso to demonstrate that the recruitment of zzso to a transcript licenses expression of the transcript, protecting it from zzso zzso Licensing occurs mainly at the level of transcription, as we observe changes in zzso levels consistent with zzso zzso when zzso is zzso Furthermore, the recruitment of zzso to a previously silenced locus zzso activates its zzso Together, these results demonstrate a rare positive role for an zzso zzso zzso in zzso licensing and protecting zzso zzso
