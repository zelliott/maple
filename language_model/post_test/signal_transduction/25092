zzso cell resistance to zzso by complement zzso complexes depends on zzso and zzso zzso Cell membrane regulatory proteins and zzso interfere with complement zzso and zzso processes of protein zzso and synthesis support cell resistance and damage zzso zzso human zzso cells treated with zzso complement doses become protected from zzso doses of complement within 50 zzso The early signaling processes leading to cell zzso to zzso zzso were zzso Treatment with calcium zzso or zzso zzso zzso rapidly induced in zzso cells protection from complement as well as synthesis of a large protein complex similar to the large zzso protein complex zzso induced by zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso protection were blocked by treatment with protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso C, zzso and zzso zzso zzso protection almost completely, whereas zzso inhibited it only zzso Since zzso is a selective inhibitor of the conventional zzso type, it is proposed that zzso complement doses activate both conventional and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso cells demonstrated zzso zzso zzso of the conventional zzso and zzso from the zzso to the plasma zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso is an early obligatory signal in cell zzso by zzso zzso or calcium zzso
