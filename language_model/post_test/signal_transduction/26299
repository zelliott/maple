The zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso has been implicated in zzso stem-cell zzso and zzso but little is known of its role in cell cycle zzso Here, we show that zzso is targeted by the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso at zzso by zzso enhances its association with and zzso of zzso which results in zzso delay upon zzso zzso zzso of the zzso or the zzso zzso zzso delay upon zzso and results in decreased cell zzso zzso stress and zzso also induce zzso zzso of zzso and cells lacking zzso or zzso display reduced viability to these zzso zzso cell survival to various stresses depends on zzso zzso by zzso that zzso zzso zzso Together, these findings provide a novel molecular mechanism by which cells can delay cell cycle progression to maximize cell survival upon zzso
