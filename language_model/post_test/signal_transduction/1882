The zzso zzso is characterized by a dramatic zzso or tissue zzso The zzso zzso has been shown to be a key regulator of zzso polarity for hairs on the wing, zzso in the eye, and sensory zzso on the zzso We have investigated the genetic relationships between putative zzso zzso downstream genes zzso fuzzy, and multiple wing hairs zzso zzso and upstream genes such as zzso zzso and starry night zzso zzso Previous data showed that the zzso genes were zzso to the zzso genes when the entire wing was zzso We extended those experiments and examined the behavior of zzso clones in zzso zzso We found the zzso zzso of zzso clones was not altered when the clone cells were simultaneously zzso for zzso multiple wing zzso or zzso but it was blocked when the entire wing was zzso for zzso fuzzy, multiple wing zzso or zzso Thus, for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and multiple wing hairs are needed in the responding cells but not in the clone zzso zzso a number of zzso zzso genes in a zzso across part of the wing zzso wing cells in that zzso We found zzso fuzzy, and multiple wing hairs were required for a zzso of zzso starry night, zzso or zzso expression to zzso wing zzso These data argue that zzso fuzzy, and multiple wing hairs are downstream components of the zzso zzso To further probe the relationship between the zzso and zzso genes we determined the consequences of altering the activity of zzso genes in wings that carried weak zzso of zzso or zzso Interestingly, both increasing and decreasing the activity of zzso and other upstream genes enhanced the zzso of zzso zzso and fuzzy zzso We also examined the relationship between the zzso and zzso genes in other regions of the zzso For some body regions and cell types zzso zzso the zzso genes were zzso to the zzso zzso but in other body regions zzso zzso that was not the zzso Thus, the genetic control of tissue polarity is body region zzso
