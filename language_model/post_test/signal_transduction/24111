The reaction mechanism of the zzso is thought to involve a number of zzso zzso zzso The specific zzso acid zzso responsible for binding many of the important zzso have been zzso however, details of the specific zzso changes produced by zzso binding are largely zzso The experiments described in this paper begin to identify interactions between zzso of the zzso zzso that depend on the presence of particular zzso The major zzso loop (between zzso and zzso which we have previously shown contains the zzso domain, was zzso in bacteria either with a zzso tag or as a fusion protein with zzso zzso We have observed that these zzso associate in the presence of zzso zzso with zzso under conditions that result in zzso of the full-length zzso did not result in zzso incorporation into either the zzso tag or zzso zzso fusion zzso The zzso association was strongly inhibited by prior modification of the fusion proteins with zzso zzso or by simultaneous incubation with 10 zzso zzso indicating that the effect of zzso is due to interactions within the zzso zzso These data are consistent with zzso zzso within cells via interactions in the zzso zzso Although any functional significance of these associations for zzso transport remains zzso they may play a role in cell function and in modulating interactions between the zzso and other zzso
