The zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso and transforming growth zzso zzso elicit differential zzso processing of zzso and zzso zzso which impacts long-term cell signaling zzso These differences arise from the higher affinity of the zzso interaction versus that of zzso in the zzso conditions of sorting zzso To determine whether zzso occupancy in zzso might also affect short-term signaling events, we examined zzso of the zzso zzso zzso pathway, an event shown to be essential for growth zzso cell zzso We found that zzso continues to stimulate zzso zzso zzso of zzso following zzso while, as expected, zzso stimulates markedly zzso The resulting higher level of zzso zzso by zzso however, did not yield higher levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso over those zzso by zzso By altering the ratio of activated receptors between the cell surface and the zzso zzso we found that only cell surface receptors effectively participate in zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated zzso with the total level of zzso zzso by either zzso indicating that the functional zzso of internal zzso cannot be attributed to an inability to interact with and zzso signaling zzso We conclude that zzso signaling through the zzso zzso is zzso restricted at a point between zzso zzso and zzso zzso perhaps because of limited access of zzso zzso to its zzso in zzso trafficking zzso
