When zzso zzso zzso cells encounter zzso in the growth zzso they perceive it simultaneously as a potential zzso to be zzso as a zzso toxic drug to be zzso and as a zzso agent from which to protect zzso Each of these zzso requires a dedicated zzso response that involves a large number of zzso We used DNA array technology to decipher the interplay between these responses in zzso zzso zzso subjected to a short challenge (15 zzso with zzso We then compared the results with those in cells exposed to zzso (a zzso zzso zzso and zzso (a specific zzso of the lower zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The resulting expression profiles suggest that the bulk of the available zzso machinery is reassigned to endure general stress, whereas only a small share of the available machinery is redirected to the degradation of the aromatic zzso Specifically, both zzso and zzso induce the zzso pathways and a dedicated but not always productive zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso the expression not only of the lower zzso zzso but also of the zzso and potentially deleterious genes for the metabolism of zzso zzso In addition, zzso (and to a lesser extent zzso inhibit zzso functions as an unequivocal response to aromatic zzso We argue that zzso is sensed by zzso zzso zzso as a zzso rather than as a zzso and that the zzso by the aromatic compounds of many functions we tested is the zzso for zzso stress tolerance genes at a minimal cost in terms of zzso
