The zzso zzso are zzso for the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that promotes vascular maturation and stabilization, whereas zzso is a partial zzso involved in the initiation of zzso zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso of zzso would be more effective than zzso for enhancing the zzso recovery in the zzso zzso zzso recovery was markedly impaired in zzso animals at day 35 in a model of chronic zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso at 7 days post zzso artery zzso enhanced recovery and improved zzso as assessed by zzso scores, whereas zzso or zzso zzso had no zzso In addition, zzso together with zzso resulted in greater improvement in zzso and collateral vessel formation than zzso zzso Similarly, conditional zzso of zzso in mice improved zzso limb blood flow recovery, while zzso zzso was zzso These data from zzso zzso deficient mice zzso for the first time, the importance of the zzso zzso in spontaneous zzso in response to chronic zzso zzso Moreover, they show that zzso of the partial zzso zzso but not zzso enhanced zzso hind limb zzso recovery and zzso suggesting that a coordinated sequence zzso and zzso activity is required for effective therapeutic zzso
