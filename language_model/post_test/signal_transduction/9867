According to the International Agency for Research on zzso approximately zzso new cases of zzso zzso zzso developed in 2005, making it the fifth most common cancer and third most common cause of zzso death zzso zzso is a complex and zzso tumor with several zzso zzso There is evidence of zzso zzso of several signaling zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso Recently a zzso zzso zzso has shown survival benefits in patients with advanced zzso It has been proposed that signaling zzso disruption in cancer can be grouped in six function capabilities, some of which need to be altered for cancer development: self-sufficiency in growth signals, zzso to zzso signals, evading zzso zzso zzso potential, sustained zzso and tumor invasion and zzso The aim is to integrate these concepts into the molecular zzso of zzso It has also been proposed that there are common disturbances universal to all liver zzso on top of the more specific zzso Based on this basic research, a molecular targeted agent has recently been zzso There have been no effective zzso agents for advanced zzso zzso an oral zzso zzso has set a milestone in the management of zzso in that it is the first agent to significantly improve the overall survival in patients with advanced zzso in a zzso zzso phase III zzso Clinical trials testing new agents for zzso and zzso agents, as well as in combination with existing treatment options such as zzso zzso or zzso infusion chemotherapy, are zzso The results of these trials are therefore eagerly zzso
