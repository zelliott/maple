zzso zzso is a well-documented human zzso associated with zzso of the skin, zzso liver, and zzso However, the underlying mechanisms explaining the zzso role of zzso are not well zzso The present study explored a potential mechanism of cell transformation induced by zzso zzso Exposure to a low dose zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso caused transformation of zzso zzso zzso In addition, in a zzso mouse model, tumor growth of the zzso transformed cells was dramatically zzso In zzso transformed cells, zzso group zzso zzso including zzso and zzso were activated resulting in enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, tumor zzso zzso and zzso zzso and protein expression were dramatically zzso Introduction of small hairpin zzso zzso or zzso into zzso zzso cells resulted in suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso returned to normal in zzso or zzso zzso zzso cells compared with zzso or zzso cells after zzso zzso As a consequence, the expression of zzso and zzso was recovered in zzso zzso or zzso zzso Thus, zzso cell transformation was blocked by zzso of zzso zzso Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are required for cell transformation induced by organic zzso zzso
