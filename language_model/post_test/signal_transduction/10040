The zzso growth factor zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor or zzso binding to the zzso results in the coordinated zzso and integration of zzso signaling events to mediate cell growth, migration, and zzso One mechanism the cell zzso to orchestrate these events is zzso zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso Identification of proteins that regulate the zzso movement of the zzso complex is an important first step in zzso how specificity of zzso signaling is zzso We examined the role of the small molecular weight zzso zzso protein zzso zzso as a regulator of the zzso stages of the zzso zzso Through the transient expression of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells, we have determined that zzso activity directly zzso with the rate of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, when zzso zzso of zzso are zzso the zzso zzso complex accumulates in zzso zzso that are characteristic of the late zzso zzso Thus, we conclude that zzso regulates the zzso trafficking of the zzso complex by regulating its zzso zzso
