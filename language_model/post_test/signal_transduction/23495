zzso cells are divided into distinct zzso zzso with unique identities and specialized zzso zzso Communication between zzso must take place to regulate the size, shape, and composition of individual zzso as well as to coordinate transport between zzso The zzso zzso zzso forms an expansive membrane network that contacts and zzso in zzso with several other zzso in the cell, most notably the plasma membrane zzso zzso junctions have well-established functions in the movement of small zzso such as lipids and zzso between the zzso and zzso Recent discoveries have revealed additional exciting roles for zzso junctions in the regulation of cell zzso zzso shape and architecture, and PM domain zzso
