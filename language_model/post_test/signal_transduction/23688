zzso stress has been implicated to contribute to zzso kidney cell zzso however, the role of zzso a zzso of zzso stress, has not been evaluated in the development of zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso target of zzso zzso may be critical for the induction of zzso zzso kidney cell injury in zzso To test our hypothesis, we evaluated the effect of an zzso zzso zzso on kidney cell zzso zzso downstream zzso and kidney cell injury in both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso resulted in zzso of zzso tissue zzso zzso associated downstream zzso and decreased number of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso zzso not only attenuated kidney cell expression of zzso and zzso but also zzso the zzso stress response program in the form of enhanced expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In in zzso studies, the zzso inhibitor also provided protection against zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Since zzso silenced for zzso displayed a lack of expression of zzso as well as attenuated zzso zzso this suggests that zzso is critical for kidney cell zzso zzso and associated zzso kidney cell injury in the zzso zzso
