In the zzso zzso zzso stem cells zzso and zzso zzso stem cells zzso are arranged around a group of zzso zzso cells, termed the zzso which produce a variety of growth factors contributing to the niche zzso that regulates both stem cell zzso Here we show that zzso but not zzso maintenance requires zzso zzso zzso in addition to zzso zzso zzso zzso clones unable to zzso the zzso signal are lost by zzso whereas zzso zzso leads to an increase in zzso However, unlike cells zzso zzso zzso targets, the additional cells generated by excessive zzso zzso remain confined to the zzso tip and retain the ability to zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso also controls zzso cell populations in the fly zzso and the zzso zzso Our observations might therefore point towards a higher degree of zzso zzso between the zzso components of zzso across the sexes and zzso than previously zzso
