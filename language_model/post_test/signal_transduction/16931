Studies in humans and in animal models show negative correlations between zzso hormone zzso levels and zzso zzso signaling is implicated in maintaining and zzso zzso zzso at multiple levels, notably centrally in the zzso but also in peripheral zzso The question is thus raised of how zzso signaling is modulated during aging in different zzso zzso zzso actions on zzso and heat production are obvious candidates to link negative effects of zzso to zzso zzso effects of excess zzso include zzso oxygen species and DNA damage, 2 factors often considered as aging zzso zzso caloric zzso which can zzso aging from zzso to zzso causes a rapid reduction of circulating zzso reducing metabolism in birds and zzso However, many other factors could link zzso to aging, and it is these potentially subtler and less explored areas that are highlighted zzso For example, effects of zzso on membrane zzso inflammatory responses, stem cell renewal and synchronization of zzso responses to light could each contribute to zzso regulation of maintenance of zzso during zzso We propose the hypothesis that constraints on zzso signaling at certain life zzso notably during maturity, are advantageous for optimal zzso
