zzso of cells within zzso sheets is an important feature of zzso and other biological zzso Previous work has demonstrated a role for zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso in the zzso of zzso cells (also known as zzso zzso during embryonic zzso in zzso zzso However the mechanism by which zzso production is zzso is zzso zzso is produced by the action of zzso C zzso We therefore surveyed the zzso family of zzso zzso using zzso and zzso zzso and found that depletion of zzso produced substantial embryonic zzso We used the zzso cell marker zzso to follow the zzso of zzso cells and found that zzso of the arrested zzso have zzso zzso These defects include defective zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we show that the migration of the zzso zzso cells, especially of the leading cells, is slower and often fails in zzso zzso As a consequence zzso loss of function results in zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso zzso Thus zzso is involved in the regulation of zzso zzso studies using zzso and zzso zzso of zzso the gene zzso the zzso zzso in zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso acts through zzso Using zzso and double zzso to zzso the other zzso in a zzso background, we show that zzso and zzso can compensate for reduced zzso zzso Our work places zzso into a zzso controlling zzso cell migration, thus establishing a novel role for zzso
