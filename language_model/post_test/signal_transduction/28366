zzso zzso is the principal hormone regulating the proliferation of zzso precursors and their differentiation into zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso Less than zzso of the zzso are displayed on the cell surface; most of the zzso molecules are retained in zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso as a potent tool to inhibit cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated previously the zzso of mature zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Neumann (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the participation of the zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso We demonstrate zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso and the zzso zzso form of zzso zzso zzso zzso to as zzso In zzso interaction between zzso and zzso suggested that zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso H resistance of zzso zzso in cells expressing zzso suggested that mature zzso is zzso by zzso zzso with EPO of cells zzso zzso and either zzso or zzso resulted in an increase or decrease respectively in zzso zzso We thus suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso cascade of zzso signal zzso
