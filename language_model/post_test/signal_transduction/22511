A preceding study zzso how the zzso of network motifs affects the overall rate of the underlying zzso zzso Surprisingly, it was shown that zzso zzso motifs can still be zzso in the sense that they exhibit the exact same performance zzso Because of the high prevalence of zzso functional zzso in biological networks, one may zzso that evolution tends to zzso motifs with faster zzso As a step towards ranking the efficiency of zzso network zzso we use a linear flow model to prove zzso establishing that certain classes of motifs are zzso In zzso the class of all motifs on zzso zzso into zzso classes based upon their zzso we establish a basis for comparing the zzso rates of different zzso The potential biological importance of the zzso is briefly discussed and is the subject of an ongoing large-scale zzso
