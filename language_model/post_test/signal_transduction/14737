The infection of T cells by zzso virus zzso may result in zzso syndrome zzso through enhanced zzso zzso particularly tumor necrosis zzso zzso by zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso One bewildering observation of zzso patients is zzso disease or progression to zzso zzso This finding raises the question whether zzso zzso T cells may survive and zzso in the zzso milieu of zzso To explore this possibility, we tested the sensitivity of zzso T cells to zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso and nuclear zzso zzso in T zzso The zzso T cells then became resistant to zzso zzso Interestingly, the expression of zzso was remarkably zzso by zzso in T zzso Furthermore, the zzso downstream death signal zzso death domain protein was zzso recruited by zzso and the activities of zzso zzso 3, 8, and 9 were zzso zzso of zzso successfully reversed the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso not only activates T cells to zzso but also zzso resistance to zzso zzso via zzso of zzso in the zzso milieu of zzso This finding provides a potential mechanism to explain the disease persistence or progression to zzso zzso in zzso zzso
