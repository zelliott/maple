The role of zzso in disease zzso following viral infection is beginning to be zzso We have previously reported that zzso C virus zzso infection in zzso zzso zzso However, the biological significance of zzso zzso has not been zzso zzso has recently been identified as a novel component of the innate immune system against viral zzso In this study, we found that zzso of zzso protein zzso 1 zzso or zzso protein 7 zzso in immortalized human zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso when they were infected with zzso exhibited increased expression of zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso and zzso protein 27 zzso zzso of the zzso signaling pathways in comparison with infected control zzso A subsequent study demonstrated that zzso infection in zzso zzso displayed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso 

The disruption of zzso machinery in zzso zzso activates the zzso signaling zzso and zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso zzso zzso the innate immune zzso
