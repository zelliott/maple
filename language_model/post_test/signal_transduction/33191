zzso mechanisms were investigated in human zzso zzso by determining characteristics of zzso changes in zzso calcium concentration zzso zzso zzso were freshly isolated from zzso zzso allowed to attach to zzso and loaded with the zzso indicator zzso Changes in zzso were studied in response to exposure to individual zzso or zzso zzso composed to distinguish between zzso pathways zzso by zzso zzso zzso mix zzso or zzso zzso zzso mix zzso Overall, zzso of zzso produced one or more zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso of all zzso zzso tested responded to zzso exposure with a change in zzso As in zzso zzso from other species, the data suggest that zzso exposure zzso calcium influx via zzso pathways involving zzso or zzso Unlike zzso zzso from other species that have been tested, some human zzso zzso responded to zzso with decreases in zzso Also in contrast with zzso zzso from other species, human zzso zzso were better able to discriminate between zzso zzso in that no zzso responded to more than one type of odor or zzso These results suggest the presence of a previously zzso type of zzso zzso zzso and raise the possibility that coding of odor qualities in humans may be accomplished to some degree differently than in other zzso with the zzso zzso itself making a greater contribution to the discrimination zzso
