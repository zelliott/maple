zzso syndrome zzso is a progressive childhood neurodegenerative disorder associated with a DNA repair zzso caused by zzso in either of two zzso zzso and zzso These genes are involved in zzso zzso repair zzso of DNA damage from ultraviolet zzso light, other bulky chemical zzso and zzso oxygen in zzso active genes zzso repair, zzso For a long period it has been assumed that the symptoms of zzso patients are all due to reduced zzso of zzso DNA damage in the brain, together with unexplained unique sensitivity of specific neural cells in the zzso Not all the symptoms of zzso patients are however easily related to repair deficiencies, so we zzso that there are additional pathways relevant to the disease, particularly those that are downstream consequences of a common zzso in the zzso zzso zzso associated with the zzso and zzso gene zzso We have found that the zzso zzso results in altered expression of zzso and cell cycle genes and proteins at the level of both gene expression and protein zzso We find an zzso of zzso due to reduced protein zzso possibly due to the loss of activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Increased levels of zzso can result in growth zzso reduced repair from the zzso interaction, and increased generation of zzso zzso zzso with increased zzso oxygen levels we find that zzso and zzso cells grown under ambient oxygen show increased DNA zzso as compared with zzso zzso zzso Thus the complex symptoms of zzso may be due to zzso independent downstream targets of the zzso zzso system that results in increased DNA damage, reduced zzso coupled repair, and zzso of cell cycle progression and zzso
