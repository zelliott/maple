zzso zzso factor zzso which is identical to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a ubiquitous zzso essential for zzso zzso zzso a zzso growth factor, and maturation factor zzso zzso the differentiation of human zzso cells, enhances the zzso and zzso ability of tumor zzso zzso activity is elevated in the serum or urine in patients with zzso zzso Here, we constructed an zzso gene using zzso zzso and zzso into two tumor cell zzso zzso of zzso enhanced zzso zzso into the culture media in both tumor cell zzso However, zzso of zzso and zzso ability was found only in zzso zzso cells expressing an zzso zzso zzso and was not found in zzso zzso zzso Thus, not only serum zzso activity but also zzso in tumor cells may be required for zzso zzso zzso With the use of zzso zzso we detected two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor beta and zzso motor zzso as well as zzso zzso The zzso message and protein expression of these two molecules was confirmed to be zzso suggesting a possible association with zzso signaling for cell zzso and zzso
