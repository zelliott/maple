Despite aggressive surgery, zzso and chemotherapy, treatment of zzso zzso remains zzso Although the concept of cancer stem cells reveals a new framework of cancer therapeutic strategies against zzso zzso it remains unclear how zzso stem cells could be zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso signaling plays an essential role in retention of zzso of zzso cells zzso and describe the underlying mechanism for zzso zzso induced zzso expression of zzso a zzso zzso and this induction was zzso by zzso a direct zzso target zzso zzso of zzso signaling drastically deprived zzso of zzso by promoting their zzso and these effects were attenuated in zzso zzso with zzso or zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso with zzso signaling inhibitor exhibited less lethal potency in zzso transplantation zzso These results identify an essential zzso for zzso the zzso pathway, whose disruption would be a therapeutic strategy against zzso
