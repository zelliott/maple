zzso plays an important role in the innate immunity of the zzso zzso By sensing the zzso zzso zzso a bacterial wall zzso zzso triggers the zzso signaling zzso and promotes the release of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso impinge on zzso functions and are associated with the zzso of zzso disease, a chronic inflammatory zzso zzso Although zzso is usually described as a zzso zzso for zzso the protein is also localized at the plasma zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso Aguirre, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (2005) zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso McDonald, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Nunez, zzso (2005) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso versions of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are capable of responding to zzso and zzso the zzso zzso from this zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso remains unable to respond to zzso from the plasma zzso We also show that zzso promotes the membrane recruitment of zzso a zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso downstream of zzso Furthermore, the artificial attachment of zzso at the plasma membrane provokes a zzso and strong zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso showing that optimal zzso activity depends upon its zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso zzso zzso at the plasma membrane in the zzso cell zzso Thus, our data suggest that zzso is responsible for the membrane recruitment of zzso to induce a regulated zzso signaling and production of zzso zzso
