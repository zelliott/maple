The default fate for eggs from many species is death by zzso and thus, successful zzso depends upon suppression of the maternal death zzso Little is known about the molecular triggers which activate this process or how the zzso signal suppresses the default maternal zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso family member, zzso plays a universal and critical role in several stages of zzso zzso zzso and zzso results in zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso and other zzso family members, zzso and zzso provide opposing signals to regulate zzso however, it is not known whether zzso play a regulatory role in egg zzso nor whether suppression of zzso by zzso is zzso by zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso are involved in zzso egg zzso and we investigate the relationship between the zzso induced signaling zzso and zzso zzso zzso is active in zzso eggs just until zzso onset and then zzso zzso and a third zzso are zzso and remain active through zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso is necessary for zzso and newly zzso proteins are required both upstream of zzso and downstream of zzso for zzso of the full zzso zzso zzso causes a dramatic rise in zzso zzso and we report that zzso provides a necessary and sufficient zzso zzso The zzso zzso following zzso of both young and aged eggs causes zzso to be rapidly zzso but zzso cannot rescue aged eggs from death, indicating that zzso zzso is not sufficient to suppress zzso
