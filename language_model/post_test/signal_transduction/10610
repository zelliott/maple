Death zzso signaling is initiated by the assembly of the zzso signaling complex, which culminates in the zzso of the zzso zzso either zzso or zzso A family of viral and cellular zzso known as zzso plays an essential role in the regulation of death zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and short cellular zzso zzso inhibit zzso by interfering with death zzso zzso The structure and mechanisms of zzso and zzso remain largely zzso Here we report a high resolution crystal structure of zzso a zzso derived from the zzso zzso virus, which is a member of the human zzso zzso zzso the two tandem death zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso associate with each other through a zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis suggests that this interface is zzso in the tandem zzso from other zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso the overall packing arrangement between the two zzso of zzso resembles that between the zzso recruitment zzso of zzso and zzso In addition, each zzso of zzso contains a highly zzso binding motif on the surface, to which zzso zzso in zzso zzso These zzso in conjunction with published evidence, reveal significant insights into the function of zzso and suggest a mechanism by which zzso and zzso inhibit death zzso zzso
