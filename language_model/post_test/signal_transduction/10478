The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso has been shown to serve as a zzso for the zzso factors zzso and zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso mediates many zzso signaling zzso including calcium zzso Two truncated zzso of the zzso lacking the zzso zzso activity, signal through a yet unknown zzso zzso signals zzso the surface expression of zzso which is localized in considerable amounts in zzso zzso These zzso pools has not been specified so zzso We therefore investigated the zzso distribution of zzso by zzso zzso In contrast to the unspecific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso pattern very similar to zzso zzso in adult human skeletal muscle zzso zzso techniques revealed in different types of zzso cells that zzso is bound to zzso zzso This observation was confirmed on isolated zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and the specific zzso marker zzso c zzso was also zzso Western zzso analysis of isolated zzso from rat brain and skeletal muscle verified that a truncated zzso of zzso is present in both, brain and muscle zzso and full-length zzso is additionally present in brain zzso Our results imply that zzso can be stored in zzso and possibly act as zzso molecules on zzso
