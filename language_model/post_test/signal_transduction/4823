zzso evidence has shown that inflammation is involved in pressure zzso cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in the inflammatory zzso However, the mechanisms underlying the zzso of zzso expression remain poorly zzso In the present study, we examined the hypothesis that an increased production of zzso oxygen species zzso mediates the zzso of zzso In a zzso rat heart model with abdominal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C reduction zzso showed that zzso generation in the zzso increased significantly at 1 week by zzso zzso zzso peaked at 2 weeks and maintained these high levels for 4 zzso The zzso of zzso was paralleled by the increased expression of zzso and left zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The oral administration of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 2 or 4 weeks, significantly attenuated zzso production by 69 and zzso respectively zzso zzso as well as left zzso zzso zzso treatment for 2 weeks also significantly reduced the zzso zzso and protein levels by 52 and zzso respectively zzso both zzso but had no effect on blood zzso In the rats with zzso at 2 weeks, when zzso expression and inflammation changes were zzso zzso with zzso zzso revealed that zzso regulated zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso protein zzso were zzso zzso administration attenuated zzso zzso but had no effect on zzso Our results suggest that increased zzso production may play an important role in the increased expression of zzso in pressure zzso cardiac zzso zzso is likely involved in the signaling zzso
