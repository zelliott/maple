Breast cancer patients often receive both zzso and zzso acid as part of their treatment, and these drugs are reported to have synergistic effects on the induction of zzso of breast cancer cells in zzso We have found that the synergistic interaction is drug sequence dependent, with zzso levels of zzso achieved when cells are treated with zzso followed by zzso acid, as opposed to the reverse sequence or simultaneous zzso The synergistic interaction persists at clinically relevant zzso and incubation zzso We report that the sequential treatment is associated with cell cycle changes and depends on breast cancer cell zzso with hormone independence, zzso zzso status and presence of zzso gene being associated with higher levels of zzso Finally, we have found that the synergistic induction of zzso is via zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
