zzso is a zzso zzso that appears to regulate the assembly of focal zzso and thereby promotes cell spreading on the zzso zzso In some cells, the C zzso of zzso is expressed as a separate zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and, in addition, delays cell spreading and focal zzso zzso Thus, zzso functions as a negative inhibitor of zzso signaling and provides a tool to dissect the mechanism by which zzso promotes cell zzso We report here that the zzso effects of zzso expression can be rescued by the zzso of zzso zzso and partially rescued by zzso inactive zzso of zzso However, zzso of an zzso site zzso of zzso which fails to bind the zzso domain of zzso or a zzso that fails to bind zzso did not promote cell zzso In contrast, expression of zzso and zzso zzso cell spreading and zzso zzso of zzso but did so without inducing zzso zzso of zzso These data provide additional support for a model zzso zzso acts as a zzso zzso that recruits zzso to zzso zzso promoting cell zzso In addition, these data point to zzso zzso of zzso as being a critical step in focal zzso zzso
