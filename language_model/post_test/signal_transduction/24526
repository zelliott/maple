Numerous genetic changes are associated with zzso of cancer zzso Previously, we used zzso to identify that zzso response zzso zzso zzso was involved in cancer invasion and zzso We further characterized that zzso was a novel zzso zzso Members of the zzso gene family are zzso zzso involved in the mediation of zzso induced zzso zzso and growth cone zzso The precise mechanism by which zzso zzso invasion is not yet zzso However, zzso zzso cells had fewer zzso and less zzso zzso A low expression of zzso zzso in lung cancer tissue was significantly associated with advanced disease, zzso zzso zzso early zzso zzso and shorter zzso In this article, we reviewed the functions of zzso and zzso and analyzed the structure and motifs of zzso by zzso As such, we hoped to shed further light on the mechanism by which zzso suppresses the invasion of cancer zzso
