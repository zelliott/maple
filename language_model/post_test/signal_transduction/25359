zzso may be induced in skeletal muscle by zzso or mechanical factors, but whether an in zzso stimulus threshold applies for zzso zzso is zzso We compared three models of muscle overload inducing varying degrees of stretch on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was overloaded by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso or zzso release of the zzso zzso by zzso the retaining zzso zzso samples were taken after 4, 7, 14 and 28 days to zzso zzso supply zzso zzso zzso and zzso for cell proliferation zzso zzso The zzso of overload was confirmed by Western analysis of zzso and zzso expression zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso changes, respectively), and the force characteristics of zzso There was a significant increase in the number of new zzso only in the zzso group after 7 days, while there was a graded increase in zzso zzso density zzso among groups compared to zzso However, zzso caused significant increase in zzso after 7 days, whereas zzso showed a more modest and delayed increase at 14 days, and ligament zzso induced no significant zzso Muscle zzso supply followed a similar trend to that of zzso whereas the zzso zzso and zzso protein levels were both zzso to a similar extent in all three experimental models zzso days after zzso These results are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso zzso is primarily a mechanical response, and that it is graded according to stimulus zzso
