A flexible zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso system identification has been developed based on a description of the dynamics of the system in terms of kinetic zzso A set of related methods are presented that include increasing amounts of prior information about the reaction network structure, resulting in increased accuracy of the reconstructed rate zzso The zzso is based on an zzso least squares solution for a set of linear equations to determine the rate zzso In the absence of prior information, all possible zzso and zzso reactions among the species in the system are considered, and the elements of a general kinetic zzso are zzso zzso of prior information is facilitated by zzso of the kinetic zzso in terms of a zzso zzso or a more general set of representation zzso A method for determination of the zzso zzso beginning only with zzso concentration data is zzso In addition, we demonstrate that zzso that arise from linear zzso among the species can be avoided by inclusion of data collected from a number of different initial zzso The zzso provides a flexible set of tools for analysis of complex kinetic data, in particular for analysis of chemical and zzso reaction zzso
