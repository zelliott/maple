The roles of two zzso zzso factors zzso zzso 5 zzso and zzso zzso zzso in inducing zzso zzso during low temperature treatment were studied in zzso In all zzso tested, low temperature significantly induced zzso zzso only in the presence of zzso In the absence of zzso or zzso the low zzso zzso zzso was significantly impaired compared to that of the wild zzso Moreover, in the double zzso zzso no significant zzso zzso was induced by low temperature even in light, suggesting that the low zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso Through the zzso zzso expressions of several zzso genes in zzso zzso pathway, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso by low temperature in a manner that is at most partially dependent on zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso was found to be zzso in a manner that was almost fully dependent on zzso Thus, zzso of zzso in a zzso manner may address the question of why low zzso zzso zzso relies upon zzso In addition, we found that zzso expression was enhanced by low temperature in wild type zzso zzso that low temperature zzso zzso zzso at least in part, through enhancing zzso protein zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso and zzso are two necessary regulators that play a pivotal role during low zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
