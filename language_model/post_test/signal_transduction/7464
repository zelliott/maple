zzso cues are critical to control stem cell function and can be zzso to develop smart zzso for stem cell zzso The challenge is to deliver these cues in a restricted manner with spatial and zzso zzso Here we have developed zzso films of zzso zzso zzso for delayed cellular delivery of zzso zzso to promote muscle stem cell zzso We demonstrate that zzso particles are zzso from the zzso surface, which allows for direct delivery of the drug into the cell and a delayed and confined drug zzso zzso of particles loaded with zzso which block the zzso zzso pathway, promoted efficient differentiation of zzso The particle zzso were fully zzso and did not interfere with the inherent differentiation zzso We further demonstrate that zzso commercially available, zzso zzso scaffolds with zzso allows for a free standing zzso for cell directed drug zzso
