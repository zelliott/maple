Drugs of abuse such as cocaine induce long-term synaptic plasticity in the reward circuitry, which zzso the formation of zzso memories and addictive zzso We reported previously that repeated cocaine exposure in zzso zzso long-term zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso area zzso by reducing the strength of zzso zzso and that zzso long-term depression at zzso zzso zzso constitutes a mechanism for zzso reduction of zzso zzso The present study investigated the downstream signaling mechanisms and functional consequences of zzso in the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling has been implicated in long-term synaptic zzso zzso learning, and drug zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso activity is required for zzso and zzso long-term synaptic plasticity and behavioral zzso We show that the zzso of receptors required for zzso increased zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso blocked zzso We further demonstrate that zzso mediates zzso reduction of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Finally, we show that cocaine zzso place preference zzso training (15 zzso four zzso increased zzso zzso in the zzso while bilateral zzso injections of a zzso zzso or an inhibitor of zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso and the zzso but not the zzso of zzso to zzso Our study has identified the zzso and zzso signaling cascade as a key zzso of several forms of zzso synaptic plasticity and provided evidence linking long-term synaptic plasticity in the zzso to rewarding effects of zzso
