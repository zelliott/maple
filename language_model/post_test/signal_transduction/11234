The zzso of zzso at sites of vascular injury is essential for primary zzso but also zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso or zzso The zzso of zzso function is therefore a major strategy to prevent and treat zzso zzso zzso stimuli like zzso zzso or zzso zzso activate receptors that are coupled to zzso G proteins to regulate zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso through these receptors has been shown to involve signaling through various zzso G zzso The G protein zzso which is able to link receptors to the zzso pathway, has recently been shown to be critically involved in zzso zzso and to play an important role in zzso zzso zzso The zzso signaling zzso may therefore be an interesting new target for zzso zzso
