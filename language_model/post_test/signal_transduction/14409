To explore the role of protein zzso C zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the signal zzso cascade in the expression of zzso zzso by peripheral blood T zzso from allergic zzso 

Twenty-five allergic zzso patients and zzso zzso of zzso zzso persons in the zzso T zzso were isolated and zzso from peripheral blood of each person and randomly divided into 3 groups: group A, blank zzso and zzso group B, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso group C , zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was used to assess the expression of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso of zzso 

The percentage of cells of active zzso zzso protein in zzso of allergic zzso T zzso zzso with zzso were significantly higher than those of allergic zzso T zzso zzso without zzso zzso zzso zzso and with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso than those of zzso of zzso zzso T zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and without zzso The percentage of cells of active zzso zzso protein in zzso of allergic zzso T zzso zzso with zzso and zzso were significantly lower than those of allergic zzso T zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso but significantly higher than those of allergic zzso T zzso zzso without zzso and those of zzso of zzso zzso T zzso zzso There were good positive correlation between the percentage of cells of active zzso and zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso may participate in the signal zzso of zzso expression of zzso in allergic zzso T zzso This suggests the zzso of zzso signal zzso cascade of T zzso may play an important role in the zzso of allergic zzso
