The zzso zzso plays a vital role in development and disease and regulates zzso through a complex composed of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and genetic studies argue that the zzso is activated through zzso zzso however, the dynamics of signaling remain largely zzso We monitored signaling and zzso dynamics and found that although zzso zzso zzso to the nucleus under continuous zzso zzso zzso of direct targets is zzso Surprisingly, zzso nuclear zzso is confined to short zzso that coincide with zzso zzso Upon zzso the dynamics of zzso correlate with zzso nuclear zzso rather than with zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso shows zzso zzso bursts of nuclear zzso but activated zzso are zzso Thus, zzso relay graded information about zzso levels that is integrated with intrinsic zzso control reflected in zzso into the active signaling zzso
