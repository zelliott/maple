Cell zzso molecules of the zzso zzso zzso have been shown to zzso growth factor signaling and follow complex trafficking pathways in zzso Similarly, several growth factors, including members of the zzso family, undergo zzso retrograde transport that is required to elicit their full signaling potential in zzso We sought to determine whether zzso that enter the zzso retrograde transport route zzso with zzso zzso We identified activated zzso cell zzso zzso zzso a protein involved in zzso zzso and development of the zzso zzso to be associated with an zzso zzso compartment that contains zzso and their zzso Although zzso enters carriers that are transported zzso in motor zzso zzso it is predominantly zzso with the zzso zzso zzso toward the cell zzso zzso was found to specifically zzso nerve growth factor zzso differentiation and zzso The zzso domain of zzso is both necessary and sufficient to zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso is required for this novel zzso Our findings indicate that zzso zzso with zzso to induce zzso zzso raising the possibility that it functions not only as an zzso zzso but also in the zzso of growth factor signaling in the nervous zzso
