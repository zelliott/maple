E protein zzso factors and their natural zzso Id zzso play critical and complex roles during zzso zzso In this article, we report that partial maintenance of E protein activity during positive selection results in a change in the cell fate determination of developing zzso cells, with a block in the development of zzso cells and a parallel increase in the zzso and zzso zzso Because the expression levels of the zzso factors that drive these alternative functional fates zzso zzso zzso and zzso are not altered, our results suggest that E protein activity controls a novel checkpoint that regulates the number of zzso precursors that choose each zzso
