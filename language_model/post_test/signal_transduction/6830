zzso stress is a well established hallmark of cardiovascular disease and there is strong evidence for a zzso role of zzso oxygen and nitrogen species zzso zzso 

Improvement of cardiovascular complications by genetic deletion of zzso producing zzso and zzso of zzso degrading zzso proved the involvement of these species in cardiovascular disease at a molecular zzso Vice versa, zzso of zzso producing zzso as well as deletion of zzso zzso was demonstrated to aggravate cardiovascular zzso 

With the present overview we present and discuss different pathways how zzso zzso interact zzso with other sources of zzso stress, namely zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso oxide zzso The potential mechanisms of how this zzso proceeds are discussed in zzso Several examples from the literature are summarized (including zzso zzso II zzso vascular dysfunction, cellular zzso nitrate zzso aging, zzso zzso stress and others) and the underlying mechanisms are put together to a more general concept of zzso zzso of different sources of zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso play a key role in this concept providing zzso triggers for zzso damage in the cardiovascular system but also act as amplifiers to increase the burden of zzso zzso 

Based on these considerations, the characterization of the role of zzso zzso formation in cardiac disease as well as inflammatory processes but also the role of zzso as potential therapeutic targets in these zzso states should be addressed in more detail in the zzso
