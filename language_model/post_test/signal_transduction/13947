zzso ligament zzso cells, a major component of the tooth supporting apparatus, share zzso characteristics including their responsiveness to zzso hormone zzso Clinical studies have already pointed to the benefit of zzso in supporting zzso processes in the zzso zzso However, those reports did not analyze which cells zzso the zzso effect on the zzso zzso The aim of the present study has been to further zzso the mechanism of action of continuous zzso application on human zzso mimicking a local zzso application and to analyze its zzso zzso pathways to widen the theoretical basis for future development of reliable local zzso delivery zzso zzso of zzso of extracted human teeth as well as cultured human zzso demonstrated strong expression of zzso by immune zzso To examine the effect of short time continuous zzso treatment on zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and protein expression of the early zzso marker zzso revealed an enhanced zzso Pathways analyses zzso the zzso effect resulted in a similar effect when zzso were zzso with either the signal specific fragments lacking the zzso domain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by stimulation with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso abolished the zzso effect These data indicate abundant expression of zzso within the zzso and a zzso effect of short time continuous zzso on zzso cell differentiation towards an zzso zzso and suggested local zzso application protocols as a possible treatment option in zzso zzso
