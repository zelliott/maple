zzso zzso cells zzso are involved in adult zzso and maintenance of vascular zzso zzso data have been provided for the individual effect of elevated free fatty acids zzso on zzso This study was designed to investigate the association between zzso signal zzso changes and the zzso of zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso 

After zzso culture, zzso were zzso with different zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with or without zzso zzso or zzso The proliferation and ability of zzso migration and tube structure formation of zzso were observed and the level of zzso zzso protein expression and zzso protein expression were zzso 

zzso with zzso and zzso acids at zzso of zzso zzso or higher inhibited zzso zzso significantly reduced migratory rate, reduced zzso to zzso and impaired ability of zzso to form tube structure in a zzso zzso A simultaneous zzso NO generation and zzso zzso decrease as well as zzso expression reduction at protein levels were also zzso However, all of the zzso effects were attenuated by zzso zzso with zzso NO zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, zzso zzso and zzso acids zzso effects on zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso and zzso acids zzso zzso signal pathway, which contributed to overall poor function and decrease proliferation of zzso These changes induced by zzso and zzso acids in signaling offer a novel explanation for the overall poor function of zzso in diabetes zzso
