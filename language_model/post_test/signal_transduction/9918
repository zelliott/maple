At the end of zzso in zzso and zzso the zzso germ layer is an zzso sheet of zzso Over the next zzso zzso zzso forms a primitive tube and becomes regionally specified along the zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso and zzso stage zzso in the vicinity of zzso zzso that gives rise to the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso adjacent to zzso zzso expresses the zzso genes zzso and 2 suggesting that zzso respond to an zzso signal in zzso Here, we report the first evidence suggesting that zzso signaling is required for establishing gut tube zzso along the zzso axis in zzso At the zzso stage, exposing zzso to zzso zzso protein results in an anterior shift in the zzso and zzso expression zzso These expression zzso remain sensitive to zzso levels throughout early zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso the anterior zzso markers zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling directly patterns zzso and not via a secondary induction from another germ layer, as shown by expression of zzso zzso specifically in zzso which results in zzso anterior expression of zzso zzso studies using the zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso signaling is necessary for establishing zzso gene expression and for maintaining gene expression boundaries between the zzso and zzso from zzso through zzso Moreover, zzso signaling in the primitive streak is necessary to restrict zzso expression to anterior zzso These data show that zzso signaling is critical for patterning the gut tube by promoting zzso and zzso anterior zzso cell zzso
