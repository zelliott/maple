zzso fatty acids zzso such as zzso acid zzso have been shown to zzso a number of inflammatory zzso zzso cells play a critical role in the initiation and maintenance of inflammatory zzso However, the effects of zzso on mast cell functions have not been fully zzso We zzso examined the effects of zzso on the high affinity zzso zzso zzso mast cell zzso using zzso cells, a rat mast cell line, that were cultured in the medium containing zzso acid zzso zzso or the AA zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso In zzso cells, the zzso zzso and zzso release, calcium zzso influx, and some protein zzso zzso including zzso and zzso for zzso of T cells zzso were zzso zzso in zzso or zzso cells, they were not changed when compared with cells cultured in control zzso In zzso cells, the enhancements of zzso release and protein zzso zzso were zzso Furthermore, in zzso or zzso cells, zzso zzso production of zzso oxygen species zzso that is required for the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso influx were enhanced when compared with the other zzso Thus, zzso of AA or zzso zzso zzso zzso in mast cells by affecting early events of zzso signal zzso which might be associated with the change of fatty acid composition of the cell membrane and enhanced production of zzso The results suggest that some zzso can zzso zzso mast cell zzso and might affect zzso zzso zzso such as allergic zzso
