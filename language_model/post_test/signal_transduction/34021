zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso tissue plays obligatory roles in the induction of oral tolerance and ignorance to zzso However, little is known about its zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso of zzso zzso T cells, comparing them with zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso T cells were zzso and expressed low levels of zzso zzso in response to zzso or zzso cell zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso T cells is linked neither with changes in the regulatory T cell population zzso zzso nor the zzso zzso Rather, zzso zzso T cells showed zzso of T zzso zzso and reduced expression of zzso signaling molecules such as zzso zzso zzso zzso with reduced zzso of zzso zzso zzso motifs zzso Among the zzso in zzso signaling zzso defective zzso expression is the most zzso and reversal of the zzso state by zzso zzso restored zzso expression zzso zzso we suggest that reduced zzso expression and defects in zzso signaling mediate the zzso state of zzso zzso T cells, which play a critical role in maintenance of zzso tolerance in zzso zzso zzso
