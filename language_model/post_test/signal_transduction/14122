zzso of a silent zzso program is a critical step in successful zzso zzso following zzso Yet how such a program is unlocked after injury remains largely zzso We found that zzso injury in peripheral sensory zzso elicits a zzso calcium wave that invades the zzso and causes nuclear export of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear export enhances zzso zzso to activate a zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear export is required for zzso zzso as expression of a zzso zzso zzso prevents zzso zzso whereas enhancing zzso nuclear export promotes zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso of this zzso zzso failed to be activated in a model of central nervous system zzso These studies reveal a signaling mechanism from the zzso injury site to the zzso that controls zzso growth competence and suggest a role for zzso as a zzso switch controlling zzso zzso
