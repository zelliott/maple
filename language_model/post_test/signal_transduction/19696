zzso signal zzso systems enable cells in bacteria, zzso and plants to react to zzso zzso A sensor zzso zzso zzso detects such stimuli with its sensor zzso and zzso the input signals to a response regulator zzso by zzso This zzso reaction requires the formation of a complex formed by the two interacting zzso The complex is stabilized by transient zzso The nature of the transient interactions makes it challenging for experimental techniques to gain structural zzso X-ray zzso requires stable zzso which are difficult to grow and zzso Similarly, the mere size of these systems proves problematic for zzso zzso methods can, however, complement existing zzso The statistical direct zzso analysis presented in the previous chapter reveals the interacting zzso at the contact interface of the zzso zzso This information can be combined with the structures of the individual proteins in molecular zzso simulation to generate structural models of the zzso The general approach, referred to as zzso was tested on the zzso zzso zzso complex, the zzso pair, delivering crystal resolution zzso The zzso method is described here in a zzso zzso The developed parameters are zzso to other zzso zzso
