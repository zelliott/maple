The zzso zzso zzso is among the most dominant zzso species on zzso rocky shores in tropical and zzso areas and is thus a target zzso in zzso zzso After being released from adults, the swimming zzso zzso six zzso cycles and then zzso into a zzso Using paired zzso a competent zzso actively explores and selects a suitable zzso for attachment and metamorphosis zzso known as zzso This selection process involves the reception of zzso signals and subsequent zzso signal zzso To investigate the involvement of zzso oxide zzso and zzso zzso zzso during zzso settlement of zzso zzso we examined the effects of an NO donor and an NO scavenger, two zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso and a soluble zzso zzso zzso inhibitor on settling zzso We found that the NO donor sodium zzso zzso inhibited zzso settlement in a zzso zzso In contrast, both the NO scavenger zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso significantly accelerated zzso zzso zzso of the downstream zzso zzso zzso activity using a zzso inhibitor zzso could also significantly accelerate zzso zzso Interestingly, the settlement zzso effects of zzso could be attenuated by zzso at all zzso zzso In the zzso expression profiling of zzso and zzso the lowest expression of both genes was detected in the zzso stage, a crucial stage for the zzso decision to attach and zzso In zzso we concluded that NO regulates zzso settlement via zzso downstream zzso zzso
