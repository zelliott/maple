zzso previously known as melanoma differentiation zzso 7 zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso and is mainly produced by zzso cells and activated zzso zzso of zzso to either of its two zzso receptors zzso and zzso triggers zzso and consequently zzso of zzso and/or zzso in target zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso There is accumulating evidence that skin represents a major target tissue for zzso and related zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso To date, the zzso properties of zzso are incompletely understood but available data indicate that it affects zzso functions by increasing proliferation of zzso cells, suggestive of a possible role in zzso However, the initial interest in zzso did not arise from its zzso zzso properties through its zzso receptors but rather because this zzso has been reported to efficiently kill cancer cells independent of zzso expression and zzso zzso These potentially intriguing properties have led to the development of zzso expressed zzso which was reported to induce selective cancer cell death in many different zzso by zzso or zzso of a continuously growing list of distinct signaling pathways without harming surrounding healthy zzso In the present review we critically revisit and discuss the potential of zzso to become a selective and cancer zzso zzso drug and put these tentative properties into context with recent data on the zzso properties of this zzso
