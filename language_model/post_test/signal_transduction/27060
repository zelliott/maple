zzso mediates zzso of zzso coli to zzso and zzso by recognition of zzso zzso binding zzso Although both zzso act through one zzso zzso zzso response is approximately 50% greater to zzso This phenomenon was investigated by zzso analysis of a zzso segment of zzso implicated in zzso interaction and zzso Among 17 defective zzso responses to the two zzso were reduced zzso for seven and zzso for 10, in some cases reversing the preference zzso zzso zzso with equivalent effects occurred throughout the segment, but those with a greater effect on zzso or zzso response were zzso to the zzso two-thirds or the zzso zzso respectively, a segregation corresponding in large part to a functional division based on zzso zzso A model for binding zzso recognition revealed two strategies for differential zzso The zzso preference for zzso probably reflects a balance of zzso affinities and a limiting supply of binding zzso zzso with reversed preference probably have zzso reduced zzso affinities and those with an zzso zzso preference probably have altered zzso zzso zzso recognition of zzso allows functional separation of detection and zzso
