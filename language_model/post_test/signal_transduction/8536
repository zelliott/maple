Time course zzso data consist of zzso expression from a common set of genes collected at different time zzso Such data are thought to reflect underlying biological processes developing over zzso In this article, we propose a model that allows us to examine differential expression and gene network relationships using time course zzso zzso We model each zzso profile as a random functional transformation of the scale, zzso and phase of a common zzso zzso about the zzso zzso parameters allow us to examine differential gene zzso zzso about measures of functional similarity based on estimated zzso functions allow us to examine gene networks while accounting for features of the zzso zzso We discuss applications to simulated data as well as to zzso data on prostate cancer zzso
