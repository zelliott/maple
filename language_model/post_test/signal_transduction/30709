zzso zzso which controls zzso cell division through interactions with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso signals from various zzso zzso zzso by orchestrating its own zzso zzso and zzso zzso flexibility allows zzso to act as a zzso for sequential signaling zzso by zzso and zzso zzso and zzso While the structural features of the zzso domain of zzso are zzso how the zzso regulatory domain coordinates zzso signaling leading to zzso degradation is poorly zzso We show that the zzso zzso zzso domain is extended and flexible when zzso is bound to zzso zzso We propose that the intrinsic flexibility of zzso provides a molecular basis for the sequential signal zzso zzso that regulates zzso degradation and cell zzso Other zzso zzso proteins possessing multiple sites of zzso modification may participate in similar signaling zzso
