zzso zzso is a zzso for vascular zzso growth factor zzso During zzso vascular smooth muscle cells zzso and zzso zzso the function of zzso zzso zzso that mediate zzso in human zzso zzso remain to be zzso We studied various zzso zzso to identify factors that increase zzso expression in zzso Treatment of zzso with basic zzso growth factor zzso induced expressions of zzso zzso and protein whereas zzso growth factor, zzso growth zzso and zzso did zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and nuclear factor zzso B zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso blocked the ability of zzso to induce zzso zzso zzso but zzso of zzso zzso or zzso activity zzso did zzso Further, the increase in zzso expression by zzso enhanced zzso migration in response to zzso This effect was dependent on the binding of zzso to zzso as blocking zzso to zzso but not zzso inhibited zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso increased zzso expression in zzso that in turn enhance the effect of zzso on cell zzso The enhanced migration of zzso was zzso through binding of zzso to both zzso and zzso as zzso of zzso on these cells blocked the effect of zzso cell zzso
