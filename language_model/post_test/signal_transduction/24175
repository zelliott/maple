There is growing evidence demonstrating the complexity of zzso role in modulating a diverse number of zzso zzso This complexity could be attributed to the fact that zzso receptors belong to two distinct classes of zzso that is, the zzso coupled zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso family zzso which makes them unique at the molecular zzso Also, within the zzso coupled zzso family of zzso the zzso and zzso receptors can couple to multiple and distinct signal zzso zzso whose zzso can lead to unique cellular zzso Also, throughout the 24-hour cycle, the zzso sensitivity to specific cues fluctuates and this sensitivity can be modulated in a zzso fashion, that is, by zzso itself, and in a zzso manner, that is, by other cues including the zzso or zzso This sensitivity of response may reflect changes in zzso zzso density that also occurs throughout the 24-hour zzso cycle but out of phase with circulating zzso zzso The mechanisms that zzso the changes in zzso zzso density and function are still not zzso but data is beginning to show that zzso events and zzso zzso may be zzso Even though this area of research is still in its zzso great strides are being made everyday in zzso the mechanisms that zzso zzso zzso function and zzso The focus of this review is to highlight some of these discoveries in an attempt to reveal the uniqueness of the zzso zzso family while at the same time provide thought-provoking ideas to further advance this area of zzso Thus, a brief overview of each of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the signal zzso zzso to which they couple will be discussed with a greater emphasis placed on the mechanisms underlying their regulation and the zzso within the receptors essential for proper zzso
