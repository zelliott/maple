We explored whether substance P zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling and zzso oxygen species zzso formation in zzso in association with zzso zzso We evaluated zzso activity and zzso as well as pelvic nervous activity in zzso rat zzso with SP zzso Our results showed that zzso SP via zzso not zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso An increase in SP by electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerve or an increase in zzso SP by zzso or zzso administration can facilitate zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, exaggerated SP release increased zzso in the zzso and whole blood via increased mast cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a primary source of zzso in the inflamed zzso Treatment with zzso zzso or zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso and ameliorated the zzso zzso zzso Our study indicates that the mechanism by which SP zzso in the zzso zzso may be complicated by its zzso activity and its ability to stimulate zzso zzso
