zzso human zzso zzso zzso cells zzso are capable of self renewal or differentiation into several different zzso including zzso zzso and zzso However, upon prolonged in zzso culture, zzso tend to undergo spontaneous zzso zzso Here, we address the possible role of zzso zzso bone zzso proteins zzso in in zzso zzso differentiation of human zzso Human zzso consistently express biologically active zzso zzso and zzso in addition to all zzso zzso which are functional as shown by the induction of alkaline zzso zzso activity and zzso of zzso genes zzso zzso collagen I and zzso following zzso zzso Since zzso zzso have been implicated in the zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso we reduced zzso cell surface zzso by zzso treatment and found significantly reduced zzso gene expression and zzso activity, suggesting that this was partly due to the reduced biological activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity led to a significant reduction in the zzso activity and zzso of the zzso factor zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type I zzso function with zzso demonstrated that zzso osteogenesis was independent of zzso zzso but was dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso significantly reduced zzso gene expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso following zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso could contribute to spontaneous osteogenesis through zzso zzso zzso
