zzso in the zzso family mediate the majority of zzso transport between the nucleus and the zzso Eleven of the 19 known human zzso and 10 of the zzso zzso zzso mediate nuclear import through recognition of nuclear zzso signals or zzso in their zzso This zzso process is essential to cellular viability as proteins are translated in the zzso but many have functional roles in the zzso Many known zzso interactions were discovered through studies of the individual zzso rather than the zzso and this information is thus widely scattered in the zzso We consolidate information about zzso that are directly recognized by zzso and review common characteristics or lack zzso among zzso of different import zzso zzso of zzso interactions is also critical for the development of nuclear import zzso and the understanding of their mechanisms of zzso This article is part of a Special zzso zzso zzso of Signaling and Cellular Fate through zzso of Nuclear zzso zzso
