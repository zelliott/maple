Research on the zzso tumor zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso patients has continued at a feverish pace following exciting developments linking energy metabolism and cancer zzso This review summarizes the current state of research on the zzso tumor zzso The weight of the evidence currently indicates an evolutionary zzso role for the protein in the regulation of various aspects of cellular polarity and energy zzso We focus on studies examining the concept that both cellular polarity and energy metabolism are regulated through the zzso zzso signal zzso zzso Recent studies from a variety of model organisms have given new insight into the mechanism of zzso development and cancer formation in zzso patients and the role of zzso zzso in sporadic zzso zzso zzso mouse models have outlined a zzso context for zzso zzso and suggest that zzso may affect different zzso zzso zzso zzso of the molecular mechanism responsible for zzso syndrome will undoubtedly reveal important insight into cancer development in the larger zzso
