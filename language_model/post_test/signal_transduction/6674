The zzso zzso receptors zzso are members of the class of zzso coupled zzso 5 zzso genes have been cloned and zzso The zzso zzso have a characteristic tissue distribution which zzso with their pharmacological and functional zzso The zzso appear to be zzso in their active zzso They conform to a common generic zzso The zzso zzso chain is believed to traverse the zzso membrane 7 times, forming a zzso cluster which contains the zzso binding zzso zzso zzso important in zzso binding have been identified both by zzso and zzso sequencing, and by zzso zzso and expression zzso The zzso domain of the zzso is composed of 3 zzso zzso and the zzso tail of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain zzso zzso and activates specific zzso zzso proteins zzso in an zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso then mediate a wide variety of events, which include, in the case of zzso the zzso of zzso zzso the breakdown of zzso the opening and closing of zzso channels, and the production of zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that the zzso portion of the third zzso loop of the zzso sequences is important in conveying specificity for zzso zzso The zzso sequences contain a number of additional features which are functionally zzso These include potential zzso sites for zzso zzso and a zzso zzso which is likely to be zzso
