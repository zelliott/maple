zzso such as zzso zzso ticks serve as zzso for many human zzso The zzso gut presents a pivotal microbial entry point and determines pathogen colonization and zzso We show that the gut zzso of zzso a major zzso of the zzso disease zzso zzso zzso influence zzso colonization of zzso zzso the gut zzso of zzso ticks reduced zzso zzso and zzso larvae displayed decreased expression of the zzso factor signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression corresponded to lower expression of zzso a key zzso scaffold of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that separates the gut zzso from the zzso The integrity of the zzso PM was essential for zzso to efficiently colonize the gut zzso These data zzso a functional link between the gut zzso zzso and pathogen colonization in the context of the gut zzso barrier of an zzso zzso
