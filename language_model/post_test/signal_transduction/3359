The zzso box zzso factor zzso is a global regulator of fruit zzso However, the direct targets modulated by zzso and the mechanisms underlying the zzso regulation remain largely zzso Here we identified 41 protein spots representing 35 individual genes as potential targets of zzso by comparative zzso analysis of a zzso zzso in tomato zzso Gene expression analysis showed that the zzso level of 26 genes correlated well with the protein zzso After examining the promoter regions of the candidate zzso a variable number of zzso binding sites were zzso Five genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified as novel direct targets of zzso by zzso zzso The results of a gel mobility shift zzso confirmed the direct binding of zzso to the promoters of these zzso Of the direct target zzso zzso and zzso which zzso zzso zzso and alcohol zzso respectively, are critical for the production of characteristic tomato aromas derived from zzso zzso Further study indicated that zzso also directly regulates the expression of zzso which encodes zzso zzso another zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Loss of function of zzso causes zzso of the zzso pathway, leading to a specific zzso in the generation of aroma compounds derived from this zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso aroma formation by direct and rigorous regulation of expression of genes in the zzso zzso Taken together, our findings suggest that the regulatory effect of zzso on fruit zzso is achieved by targeting specific molecular zzso
