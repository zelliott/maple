zzso family zzso zzso are implicated in signaling via zzso zzso zzso Both kinds of molecules reside in opposite leaflets of the same zzso zzso in the zzso plasma membrane without making direct zzso Under zzso conditions, we isolated a zzso plasma membrane zzso also containing zzso zzso selectively associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso released the zzso zzso yielding core zzso zzso limited amounts of which could also be obtained by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso containing both zzso and zzso proteins was much lower than in core zzso zzso but was strongly zzso by zzso zzso The zzso mechanism acting on zzso and zzso zzso in these zzso was independent of the zzso zzso zzso and was characterized as a mixed, zzso zzso We propose that in zzso plasma zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibit optimal activity when juxtaposed to the zzso and zzso core zzso but encounter zzso conditions in surrounding membrane areas that are rich in zzso and contain additional zzso zzso
