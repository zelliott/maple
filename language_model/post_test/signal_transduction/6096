The differentiation of pancreatic zzso zzso cells into zzso zzso cells has served as an important model for both zzso in zzso zzso differentiation as well as potential application to zzso engineering of zzso zzso zzso zzso possibly working through zzso zzso 2 and/or zzso 3, as well as zzso zzso (a zzso zzso zzso zzso have both been shown to induce zzso differentiation in zzso zzso In this study, we present evidence of significant interplay and zzso of these two pathways as well as potential zzso between the zzso In particular, zzso differentiation seems to entail an zzso drop in zzso 2 and zzso in zzso 3 in zzso zzso The latter appears to be dependent on zzso transforming growth factor zzso zzso release by the zzso cells and may serve as a mechanism to promote zzso zzso The drop in zzso 2 may mediate early zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and, specifically, zzso zzso zzso led to a dramatic zzso increase in insulin zzso levels, supporting a novel synergistic and zzso relationship between zzso signaling and zzso zzso zzso
