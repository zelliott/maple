zzso zzso activate zzso in a manner specific to the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso provoke drastic zzso zzso that leads to programmed cell death or the zzso state of responding zzso To characterize the signal zzso zzso initiated by zzso zzso lines derived from the human zzso zzso line zzso were tested for their zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso cell line, which lacks zzso expression and lost zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso was activated by zzso zzso in a manner indistinguishable from the zzso cell zzso In contrast, the zzso 01 cell line, which lacks expression of functional zzso showed severely impaired zzso The role of zzso appears to be replaced by another zzso family zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso was rapidly zzso and activated after zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso significantly suppressed the zzso against zzso zzso E in zzso cells, and the expression of the active form of zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso E in zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso activate zzso in an zzso zzso and that zzso plays a critical role in the zzso
