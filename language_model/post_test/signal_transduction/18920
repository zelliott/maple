The purpose of this study was to determine changes in the expression of regulatory molecules in normal zzso zzso cartilage throughout development up to 18 months of zzso The hypothesis was that expression of these regulatory molecules would decrease from birth to zzso zzso was harvested from normal zzso or zzso zzso from 34 fresh horse zzso zzso were placed in four age groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso months zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso months zzso zzso zzso and zzso 15-18 months zzso zzso zzso Indian zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression levels were evaluated by real-time quantitative zzso zzso tissue zzso and protein expression was determined by in zzso zzso and zzso The expression of zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group, while zzso zzso expression significantly increased zzso zzso zzso No significant difference was found between groups for zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, there was significantly increased expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group, and zzso zzso zzso zzso remained elevated in the zzso zzso The expression of zzso significantly increased from prenatal to zzso groups zzso zzso zzso while zzso expression increased during zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The changes in expression of zzso and zzso signaling molecules in zzso cartilage during zzso development have not been shown zzso The increased expression of zzso zzso and zzso factors during zzso may indicate maturation of the deep zzso layer during this time zzso
