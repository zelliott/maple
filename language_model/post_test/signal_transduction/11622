For zzso zzso of zzso developing zzso of zzso require a zzso zzso molecular signal from their surrounding zzso cells, and this signal must be transmitted through open gap zzso zzso stimulation triggering synthesis and processing of zzso into mature insect zzso spheres has been intensely zzso and zzso zzso cells are known in several insects to contribute to the blood products which are zzso along with zzso zzso in the fat zzso However, there has been little evidence that direct gap zzso communication is a requirement for zzso activity by zzso In zzso control zzso both electrical and dye zzso occur, and zzso incubated in zzso in zzso salt solution containing small amounts of blood and fluorescent dye produce zzso labeled nascent zzso zzso zzso zzso spheres were visible in both zzso material, and, with zzso zzso zzso in living zzso zzso zzso was abolished by treatment with either 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso with zzso zzso also being affected as each of these gap junction zzso zzso the zzso With each of these treatments, after gap junctions were zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso came to a zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso with zzso activity blocked in this manner could be rescued by zzso of the soluble fraction of zzso zzso cell zzso confirming that the process depended upon a molecular signal from the zzso zzso
