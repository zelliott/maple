The inappropriate expression of zzso in growth arrest contributes to zzso progression in human colon zzso zzso Early stage, zzso colon tumor cells show a zzso of zzso in growth arrest and require both nutrients and growth factors for re-entry into the cell zzso In contrast, highly progressed cells zzso zzso during growth arrest and require only nutrients for zzso Given the importance of zzso in zzso zzso this work addressed the regulation of zzso expression in the early stage colon zzso cell line, zzso zzso zzso cells zzso the expression of zzso zzso and, in turn, zzso zzso These zzso cells continued to express high levels of zzso zzso but zzso zzso was zzso Cell cycle re-entry required zzso growth factor zzso of the zzso by insulin or zzso This zzso zzso resulted in S phase re-entry and was accompanied by an approximate zzso induction of zzso expression along with zzso zzso at 1 h following release from growth zzso zzso of zzso occurred within 5 zzso of zzso zzso Previously identified DNA binding proteins which bind to a unique zzso response element within the zzso promoter were similarly induced following zzso zzso The addition of zzso zzso zzso abolished the activated zzso zzso S phase zzso Moreover, disruption of the growth arrest associated zzso of zzso in zzso cells by zzso zzso expression zzso the requirement for zzso zzso for cell cycle zzso zzso this study indicates, for the first time, that zzso zzso zzso components of the zzso zzso loop resulting in zzso zzso zzso which was critical for zzso zzso re-entry into the cell cycle from the zzso zzso
