The zzso zzso mediates zzso interaction in many zzso zzso Multiple proteins regulate the zzso pathway, among these are the products of the fringe zzso The first fringe gene was identified in zzso where it is involved in the formation of the zzso border of the wing zzso It has now been found to be crucial for determining the zzso border of the zzso zzso In zzso fringe genes play roles in the formation of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso border in the limb zzso and in the development of zzso zzso The roles of fringe in the neural tube or the eyes of zzso zzso are not clear, although it is unlikely that these roles are zzso related to those in the same zzso in zzso zzso zzso suggest that Fringe protein functions by modulating the zzso signaling pathway, perhaps through differential regulation of zzso zzso by different zzso however, the mechanism underlying Fringe function remains to be zzso
