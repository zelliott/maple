The present study investigated zzso zzso mechanism involved in zzso production of zzso zzso zzso zzso in cultured vascular zzso zzso smooth muscle cells zzso zzso with zzso zzso increased the steady state levels of zzso zzso and the generation of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the effect of zzso on the generation of zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso generation from zzso zzso toxin zzso suppressed zzso increase of zzso zzso Treatment with 5 zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso or 1 zzso zzso C blocked zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 10 zzso for 3 h strongly zzso the generation of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso The responses of zzso zzso to zzso or the zzso on zzso generation were comparable to that of growing zzso The results of the present study suggest that zzso zzso G proteins and a zzso C are involved in zzso generation of zzso in zzso which may transmit signals from occupied zzso zzso to protein zzso C and thereby increase the generation of zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso may zzso regulate the generation of zzso from vascular zzso
