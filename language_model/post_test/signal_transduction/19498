The candidate tumor zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso involved in the regulation of cell zzso although the molecular mechanisms governing its function remain poorly zzso zzso was recently shown to interact with and zzso the zzso regulator host cell factor 1 zzso Here we show that zzso assembles zzso complexes containing numerous zzso factors and zzso including zzso and the zzso factor zzso Yang 1 zzso Through its zzso zzso zzso directly interacts with the zinc fingers of zzso Moreover, zzso interacts with the middle region of zzso encompassing the zzso domain and is essential for the formation of a zzso complex with zzso and zzso in zzso zzso activates zzso in an zzso manner and regulates the expression of a variety of genes involved in numerous cellular zzso We further show that zzso and zzso are recruited by zzso to the promoter of the zzso zzso which encodes a zzso protein used here as a model of zzso gene zzso Our findings zzso establish a direct link between zzso and the zzso control of genes regulating cell growth and proliferation and zzso shed light on a novel mechanism of zzso regulation involving zzso zzso
