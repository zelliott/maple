zzso zzso of synaptic contacts are crucial for synaptic zzso The formation of new zzso spines and zzso is known to require zzso zzso reorganization specifically during neural zzso zzso Yet the zzso and zzso mechanisms modulating zzso dynamics in mature zzso are not well zzso In this study, we show that zzso dynamics in spines is regulated by a zzso zzso and targeting function of zzso zzso zzso A zzso independent of its zzso zzso On neural zzso zzso bound directly to activated zzso and recruited it to the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso This focal targeting of activated zzso induced spine formation through zzso dynamics downstream of zzso zzso zzso with the scaffolding role of zzso zzso zzso mice exhibited defects in zzso of zzso by long-term zzso zzso This zzso resulted in a reduction in the reorganization of zzso zzso structures in the synaptic area of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso mice showed deficits of synaptic plasticity in zzso path and in zzso memory zzso These data support a novel model in which zzso is critical for the spatial and zzso regulation of spine zzso zzso synaptic zzso and learning and memory via an zzso zzso scaffolding zzso
