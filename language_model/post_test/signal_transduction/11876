In chronic inflammatory airway diseases such as asthma and chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso changes in zzso zzso are present and contribute to airway wall zzso zzso and vascular leak seem to be prevalent in zzso while zzso and vascular leak seem to be prevalent in zzso The functional meaning of zzso vascular zzso is not completely zzso The increase in vessel number and size as well as the vascular leakage may zzso to the zzso of the airway wall and to the narrowing of the zzso zzso zzso pharmacological control of zzso vascular zzso may be crucial for symptom control in asthma and zzso In zzso zzso steroids can zzso vascular zzso by acting on zzso factors, whereas zzso zzso seem to be mostly effective in decreasing vascular zzso In zzso there is less available experimental evidence on the effect of the currently used drugs on airway zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor, the most specific grow factor for vascular zzso is zzso involved in the zzso of the airway vascular zzso both in asthma and zzso The zzso of vascular zzso growth factor and its receptors has the potential for the treatment of the vascular changes in the airway zzso
