zzso cell death or zzso plays an important role in the development of zzso organisms and can also be induced by various stress zzso In the zzso wing zzso disc there is little zzso in normal development but zzso can induce high zzso levels, which eliminate a large fraction of the disc zzso Nevertheless, zzso discs form adult patterns of normal size, indicating the existence of zzso zzso We have zzso the zzso response of the wing disc to zzso and heat shock and also the zzso consequences of compromising zzso We have used the zzso inhibitor zzso to prevent the death of zzso cells and found that it causes increased zzso cell zzso invasion of compartments and persistent zzso of the wingless zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose that a feature of cells undergoing zzso is to activate zzso and zzso probably as part of the mechanism to compensate for cell zzso If zzso cells are not zzso they continuously emit zzso and zzso signals, which results in zzso zzso We suggest that a similar process of zzso zzso initiation and cell death may occur during zzso formation in zzso zzso
