zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly associated with elevated circulating zzso levels resulting from pregnancy, oral zzso and zzso replacement zzso however, the mechanism of zzso acquired zzso zzso remains poorly zzso zzso evidence indicates that zzso zzso signaling can indirectly zzso the expression of target genes at the zzso level by modulating the expression of zzso zzso and zzso have also been demonstrated to be involved in the regulation of zzso 

To investigate the mechanism of zzso zzso of zzso expression by the zzso zzso 

zzso analyses of the zzso zzso region zzso were performed to identify putative zzso sites, and direct targeting of the zzso zzso by zzso was determined with dual zzso reporter zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso sequence with deleted zzso sites were also analyzed with zzso reporter zzso The effects of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso levels in zzso cells were determined by quantitative real-time zzso and zzso changes to zzso zzso levels in culture zzso of zzso cells were measured with an zzso 

The zzso zzso sequence contains three putative zzso zzso zzso directly targets zzso and zzso levels are zzso following zzso treatment in zzso liver cells in association with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The results from this study provide the first evidence for zzso zzso of zzso by zzso and suggest that zzso is involved in the mechanism of zzso zzso of zzso zzso
