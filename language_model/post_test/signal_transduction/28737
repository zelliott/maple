Ras signals for the transformation of zzso cells are apparently zzso through zzso zzso The zzso zzso family member zzso generates independent signals that regulate the zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso However, the molecular mechanism of signal zzso from zzso to the nucleus remains to be zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been found to bind specifically to zzso In this paper we studied whether zzso zzso zzso signals to the nucleus directly, or through other zzso zzso Using zzso and Western zzso analysis, we found a nuclear zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells, as opposed to a zzso zzso in zzso zzso In agreement with the nuclear zzso a putative nuclear export signal was identified in zzso and zzso Furthermore, the interaction of zzso with zzso was shown to be essential for the nuclear zzso of zzso zzso of zzso (a zzso binding domain of zzso inhibited cell growth and movement, indicating that zzso signals are zzso to the nucleus through zzso This is the first report providing evidence of a novel role for zzso in zzso zzso signals directly to the zzso
