zzso of the zzso domain zzso factors by zzso has not been zzso In this report, we investigated the role of zzso zzso in regulating zzso domain protein zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso of zzso in a zzso and zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso of dominant negative zzso by zzso gene transfer blocked zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso of a zzso DNA binding zzso reporter zzso This zzso was zzso by zzso active zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of the reporter gene was completely attenuated by both zzso and zzso One of the targets of zzso zzso factors is the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso inhibited zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso 3 zzso and dominant negative zzso increased zzso gene transcription, suggesting that suppression of zzso 3 zzso zzso may induce zzso in zzso cells via zzso of zzso zzso However, expression of dominant negative zzso by zzso did not induce zzso in zzso cells, suggesting that zzso zzso mechanisms also zzso Together, our data demonstrate for the first time that zzso zzso zzso domain zzso factor by zzso zzso and that suppression of zzso zzso is not sufficient to induce zzso in zzso zzso
