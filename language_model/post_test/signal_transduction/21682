The zzso coli ammonium transport protein zzso has become the model system of choice for analysis of the process of ammonium zzso by the ubiquitous zzso family of inner membrane zzso Over the past 6 years we have developed a range of genetic and zzso tools in this zzso These have allowed zzso analysis to develop zzso offering insight initially into the membrane zzso of the protein and most recently leading to the solution of high-resolution zzso zzso zzso analysis has revealed a novel regulatory mechanism that is apparently zzso in zzso zzso proteins and genetic approaches are also now being used to dissect zzso relationships in zzso zzso The now zzso zzso between the zzso zzso found in zzso zzso zzso and plants, and the zzso zzso found characteristically in animals, also means that studies on zzso coli zzso can potentially shed light on zzso relationships in the clinically important zzso zzso
