zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso are essential for cell survival and zzso A decrease in zzso zzso levels is associated with zzso In this study, we used zzso of zzso zzso to examine the effect of zzso zzso A combination of zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso levels and induced cell death in a zzso zzso B cell zzso These cells exhibited zzso features including zzso zzso and zzso DNA zzso zzso of zzso zzso reversed the observed features of zzso cell zzso Similar effects were also observed in other cell zzso a human B cell line Ramos and a human T cell line zzso zzso of zzso induced zzso of zzso and disruption of the zzso membrane potential zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activities by an inhibitor prevented the zzso nuclear changes but not Delta zzso m disruption induced by zzso zzso zzso of zzso an zzso zzso family zzso completely inhibited Delta zzso m zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso These results indicate that the depletion of zzso zzso triggers the zzso zzso for zzso resulting in zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso
