zzso zzso are known to affect zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso can cause cognitive zzso In this study, we wanted to evaluate zzso zzso zzso following zzso zzso 

zzso zzso cells were exposed to zzso zzso for 2 zzso zzso Western zzso was used to measure zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso 1/2 and zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso 

After exposure, zzso zzso 1/2 zzso was reduced to 58 zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso At 30 zzso after the end of zzso administration zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso remained reduced to 57 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and was at 120 zzso zzso zzso zzso still reduced to 63 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso compared with zzso At 360 zzso after exposure, zzso zzso 1/2 zzso had recovered to 98 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso compared with zzso In contrast, immediately after zzso exposure, zzso zzso zzso was increased by zzso zzso 37% zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but had returned to control levels at 30 zzso after exposure, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso exposure has differential effects on different zzso zzso zzso On one hand, we observed a prolonged zzso of zzso zzso 1/2 zzso that persisted even when zzso zzso close to detection zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso was increased twofold during zzso exposure, with a rapid return to baseline levels after zzso We speculate that the effects on zzso zzso zzso observed in our in zzso model could be of relevance also for zzso zzso in zzso following zzso zzso
