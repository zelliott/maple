Several studies have implicated the zzso zzso system in the cardiac zzso induced by zzso zzso However, whether zzso type 1 zzso zzso is critically required to the development of zzso zzso zzso as well as whether the zzso mechanisms that are triggered by zzso are able to contribute to this zzso model is zzso To address these questions, we employed a selective small interfering zzso zzso 50 zzso or an zzso blocker zzso 1 zzso to evaluate the specific role of this zzso in primary cultures of zzso zzso submitted to zzso (10 zzso zzso The zzso zzso with the zzso zzso presented reduced zzso zzso P zzso zzso and protein zzso P zzso zzso expression of zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso blockade totally prevented the zzso zzso zzso as evidenced by lower zzso expression of zzso zzso factor zzso P zzso zzso and skeletal zzso zzso P zzso zzso as well as by reduction in protein synthesis zzso P zzso zzso The zzso treated with zzso demonstrated a rapid zzso of zzso signaling pathway, which was completely inhibited by the use of zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso and zzso 200 zzso In addition, we demonstrated that the zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso signaling pathway, since the zzso zzso and the zzso blockade attenuated or totally prevented the zzso of this signaling zzso We also reported that local zzso zzso zzso zzso levels zzso P zzso zzso and the zzso expression zzso P zzso zzso were rapidly increased by zzso zzso These data demonstrate for the first time that the zzso is a critical zzso to the zzso zzso zzso as well as to the zzso of zzso signaling zzso These results represent a new insight into the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso indicating that the zzso zzso zzso zzso to a potential zzso of the zzso effect exerted by zzso in zzso
