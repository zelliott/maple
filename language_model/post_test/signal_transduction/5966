The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene maintains zzso stability by zzso a key zzso checkpoint in response to DNA damage, zzso instability or zzso zzso zzso zzso of the gene causes an zzso zzso disorder, zzso characterized by zzso progressive zzso zzso zzso zzso defective zzso premature zzso and a high zzso of zzso Here we show that zzso has an essential function in the zzso capacity of zzso stem cells zzso but is not as important for the proliferation or differentiation of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso mice older than 24 weeks showed progressive bone zzso failure resulting from a zzso in zzso function that was associated with elevated zzso oxygen zzso Treatment with zzso agents restored the zzso capacity of zzso zzso resulting in the prevention of bone zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene product zzso in response to elevated zzso oxygen species led to the failure of zzso zzso These results show that the zzso capacity of zzso depends on zzso zzso of zzso zzso
