zzso tandem zzso zzso are present in 5 out of 11 zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso for the zzso zzso of zzso 2, 5, and 6 is zzso whereas those for zzso 10 and 11 remained enigmatic for zzso Here we used the zzso zzso zzso zzso which has an zzso tandem zzso domain closely related to those of the zzso zzso as an zzso system to identify the zzso for the human zzso 10 and 11 zzso zzso We report that a zzso between the zzso zzso domain and the zzso zzso was zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso had only low zzso zzso increased zzso in a zzso manner and did not affect the zzso for zzso of 27 zzso In an analogous zzso construct with the tandem zzso domain of human zzso zzso was identified as an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that increased zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso contain an zzso zzso motif present in all zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso the zzso within this motif in both regions and found that zzso signaling was considerably reduced or zzso This was in line with all data concerning zzso zzso with an zzso motif as far as they have been zzso The data appeared to define those zzso zzso as a distinct zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso for which we propose a tentative zzso zzso
