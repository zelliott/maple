zzso zzso leads to dramatic changes in numerous biological pathways controlling cellular division, and results in the initiation of a zzso program that promotes zzso zzso it also triggers an irreversible cell cycle exit called cellular zzso which allows the zzso to counteract the potentially zzso uncontrolled proliferation of damaged zzso zzso a tight zzso control is required at the onset of zzso zzso zzso both positive and negative regulation of gene zzso Not surprisingly, numerous zzso zzso contribute to the cellular response to zzso zzso While these zzso zzso were initially thought of as mere zzso of the cellular response to zzso stress, recent studies have uncovered a direct and specific regulation of zzso zzso by zzso zzso We review here the diverse functions of zzso zzso in the cellular response to zzso stress, and discuss the implications of these findings on the regulation of cell cycle progression and proliferation by activated zzso
