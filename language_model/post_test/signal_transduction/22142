Studies of the effects of zzso zzso on longevity in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso identified zzso highly zzso zzso pathways that influence zzso In each of these very zzso related species, single zzso which zzso or zzso reduced insulin, zzso growth factor zzso or zzso zzso zzso can produce significant increases in both average and zzso zzso In mice, most of the zzso zzso described to date reduce zzso zzso hormone zzso and zzso zzso The reported extensions of longevity are most robust in zzso and zzso mice, while suppression of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso produces effects that are generally smaller and often limited to female zzso This could be due to zzso influencing zzso by both zzso and zzso zzso In zzso that have been examined in some detail, increased longevity is associated with various zzso of delayed zzso and extended zzso The mechanisms that probably zzso the extension of both lifespan and zzso of these animals include increased stress resistance, improved zzso zzso zzso in insulin zzso zzso zzso combined with improved insulin sensitivity in some zzso and insulin resistance in zzso a shift from zzso to zzso profile of circulating zzso reduced zzso target of zzso translation and altered zzso function including greater zzso of lipids when compared with zzso
