The zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso has a prominent role in cell survival and zzso in part, by regulating gene expression at the zzso zzso Previous work using global expression profiling identified zzso and the zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso as key targets of zzso zzso signaling that lead to the induction of zzso and cell cycle arrest genes in response to zzso of zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso downstream of zzso zzso signaling by analyzing the effects of zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells, which have zzso zzso compared with zzso cells expressing a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso partial resistance to zzso induced by zzso of zzso zzso Global gene expression profiling combined with zzso and experimental analysis of zzso factor binding sites demonstrated that zzso along with zzso zzso and zzso contributed to gene induction in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso 3, leading to zzso of zzso by zzso Many of the genes targeted by zzso were also targeted by zzso and zzso zzso factors, indicating that zzso functions zzso with these factors to regulate gene expression downstream of zzso zzso zzso
