We studied the zzso responses to different zzso zzso zzso by four doses of zzso zzso 0, zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso We compared the degree of zzso release (via zzso with zzso zzso activity and whole brain maps of cerebral blood volume zzso changes (via pharmacological zzso zzso 

zzso increased zzso release in the zzso zzso and zzso activity in the zzso nucleus zzso zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso zzso in a linear zzso manner zzso zzso zzso The zzso data suggest that, zzso signal zzso induced by D1 zzso is stronger than that of zzso zzso at the higher doses zzso zzso zzso showed that, while higher doses of zzso (3 zzso zzso zzso 7) and 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso induced significant zzso increases in the zzso and zzso the degree of zzso increase was much smaller with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 8) induced significant zzso decreases in the zzso zzso and zzso The sign switch of zzso in response to zzso from low to high doses likely reflects the switching in the balance of zzso stimulation zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, degree of zzso signal zzso is zzso correlated to the zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso binding may dominate the overall zzso zzso at the lower range of zzso zzso
