The zzso zzso is the primary bone zzso zzso zzso formation and activity is regulated by local factors produced in the bone zzso We recently identified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a novel inhibitor of zzso formation and bone zzso that is produced by zzso zzso is a zzso zzso membrane protein (16 zzso related to the mouse zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in human zzso zzso zzso zzso unit zzso bone zzso cells, and zzso zzso We used zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso analysis, which further demonstrated that zzso zzso strongly enhanced zzso zzso expression in bone zzso cells and zzso Similarly, zzso zzso also enhanced zzso zzso expression in zzso To determine the participation of zzso in zzso zzso of zzso formation, we tested the capacity of a zzso zzso specific to zzso zzso to inhibit zzso effects on zzso cell differentiation of mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specific zzso partially neutralized zzso zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso However, zzso did not affect zzso zzso in these zzso Western zzso analysis further demonstrated that zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso associated factor 2 zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso However, zzso had no effect on zzso expression in these zzso These data show that zzso enhances zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso and that zzso zzso zzso formation through suppression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso
