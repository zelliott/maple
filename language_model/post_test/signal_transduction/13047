The expression of zzso zzso zzso 1) in human zzso increases during aging both in zzso and in zzso This zzso increase in zzso expression has been zzso to contribute to the age related decline in tissue function by increasing zzso of zzso zzso but little is known regarding the regulation of zzso zzso We examined the role that the zzso zzso zzso plays in zzso expression during in zzso zzso of zzso normal human lung zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso signals, acting through the zzso zzso factor zzso can regulate zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso negative forms of zzso increase zzso promoter activity in early passage zzso zzso whereas an active form of zzso suppresses steady state levels of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso In addition, the activity of a synthetic promoter containing zzso binding sites, as measured by zzso activity, is much higher in zzso cells compared with early passage zzso zzso These results indicate that members of the zzso family of zzso factors play a role in the regulation of the zzso promoter and that increased activity of zzso zzso factors may zzso the increase in zzso expression observed during zzso zzso
