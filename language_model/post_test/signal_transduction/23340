The zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso on zzso loop zzso upon zzso zzso zzso thus zzso intrinsic zzso activity and triggering zzso zzso To understand the molecular zzso of intrinsic zzso activity, we used X-ray zzso and zzso zzso to analyze zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso in zzso zzso These structural analyses revealed a zzso dynamic equilibrium model zzso the zzso toggles between an zzso structurally rigid ground state and a more dynamic and zzso active zzso The zzso zzso have different abilities to shift this equilibrium toward the active zzso The increase in the fractional population of zzso receptors in the active state zzso with the degree of zzso activity and clinical zzso Our data demonstrate that the fractional population of zzso in the active state determines intrinsic zzso activity and underscore how a slight increase in the active population of zzso can have grave consequences for human zzso
