The nucleus zzso zzso is one of the important brain regions for the acquisition of zzso zzso place preference zzso which is a valuable paradigm for detecting the rewarding effects of zzso However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely zzso In the present study, we investigated the role of zzso and nuclear factor zzso B zzso in the zzso in the acquisition of zzso zzso The results showed that repeated zzso treatment induced the acquisition of zzso and increased the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso inhibitor zzso into the zzso prior to the application of zzso prevented the acquisition of zzso and inhibited the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso zzso a selective zzso zzso into the zzso blocked the zzso but also the zzso of zzso zzso induced by zzso It is concluded that the zzso of zzso zzso signaling zzso in the zzso plays a critical role in the zzso zzso
