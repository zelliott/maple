This study was conducted to examine whether zzso mechanical loading on skeletal muscle can suppress zzso muscle zzso and if so, to depict the underlying molecular zzso zzso rat zzso muscle was zzso stretched zzso 5 s for 15 zzso for 2 zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso area of zzso zzso muscle fibers with repetitive stretching was significantly larger than that of control zzso muscle zzso We then examined the involvement of the zzso target of the zzso zzso cascade in the zzso effects of repetitive stretching on muscle zzso zzso stretching significantly increased the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso muscle compared to controls zzso Furthermore, repetitive zzso suppression of muscle zzso was fully inhibited by zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso These results indicate that zzso muscle zzso is significantly suppressed by zzso mechanical loading of the muscle through zzso of the zzso signal zzso
