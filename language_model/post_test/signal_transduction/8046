The basic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor 2 zzso is expressed in zzso but not zzso zzso and in zzso and vascular smooth muscle zzso Mice zzso for a zzso zzso of zzso die zzso from a spectrum of cardiac zzso raising questions about the specific functions of this zzso regulator in individual cardiac cell zzso Using a conditional zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso deletion of zzso in mice results in zzso zzso of zzso genes in zzso zzso with an associated impairment of cardiac zzso and a unique distortion in zzso of the right zzso zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso gene expression in zzso zzso mice, forced expression of zzso in zzso zzso is sufficient to repress zzso cardiac zzso These findings reveal a zzso zzso zzso function for zzso in the suppression of zzso cell identity and the maintenance of zzso cardiac zzso
