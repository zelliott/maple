zzso injury is associated with a decline in zzso zzso and insulin sensitivity due to zzso in zzso insulin signaling zzso We have reported that blockade of the zzso system with zzso an zzso II type 1 zzso zzso blocker, improves whole body insulin sensitivity and zzso metabolism after burn zzso This study examines whether zzso improves insulin signaling pathways and zzso zzso transport in skeletal muscle in zzso zzso zzso were injured by a zzso zzso zzso burn and treated with zzso or zzso for 3 days after zzso zzso signaling pathways were investigated in zzso zzso muscle taken before and 90 s after zzso insulin injection (10 zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and plasma zzso zzso zzso were substantially increased with zzso treatment in zzso animals zzso above zzso zzso zzso zzso was decreased with burn injury, and this decrease was attenuated with zzso zzso In a separate group of rats, the effect of insulin on zzso transport was significantly impaired in burned as compared with sham zzso muscles, in zzso however, treatment of burned rats with zzso completely abolished the reduction of zzso zzso zzso These findings demonstrate a cross talk between the zzso and insulin zzso that zzso zzso insulin zzso signaling and suggest a potential role of zzso system blockade as a therapeutic strategy for enhancing insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle and improving zzso zzso zzso in burn zzso
