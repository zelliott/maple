zzso zzso receptors are a zzso of zzso zzso zzso with an important role in the physiology and zzso of central zzso zzso levels of zzso influx through the zzso zzso can contribute to zzso loss in acute trauma such as zzso and traumatic brain injury, as well as certain neurodegenerative diseases such as zzso zzso However, normal zzso patterns of zzso zzso activity can promote zzso against both zzso and zzso zzso As a result, zzso zzso blockade can promote zzso death outright or render zzso vulnerable to secondary zzso Thus responses to zzso zzso activity follow a classical zzso zzso zzso both too much and too little can be zzso There is a growing knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying both the zzso and zzso effects of zzso zzso activity, as well as the factors that determine whether an episode of zzso zzso activity is harmful or zzso It is becoming apparent that zzso stress plays a role in promoting zzso death in response to both zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso Increased understanding in this field is leading to the discovery of new therapeutic targets and strategies for zzso disorders, as well as a growing appreciation of the harmful consequences of zzso zzso zzso
