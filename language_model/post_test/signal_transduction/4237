Bone zzso proteins zzso which have been implicated in the patterning of zzso are members of the transforming growth zzso zzso zzso We have investigated the roles of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso (another zzso zzso in early development by generating zzso versions of these growth zzso zzso were generated by altering the zzso sites that are required for maturation of the active zzso forms of zzso zzso and zzso These zzso zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso result in zzso that allow for zzso of the zzso but are incapable of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso but not zzso in the zzso marginal zone of the zzso zzso results in the development of a secondary zzso similar to that seen by zzso expression of the truncated zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso interfere with zzso signaling during zzso zzso We also found that expression of zzso or zzso in animal cap zzso directly zzso zzso The neural induction was specific for zzso and zzso because zzso expression of zzso or zzso did not mimic the same zzso zzso study of neural patterning by zzso and zzso revealed that only anterior zzso markers are expressed in response to these zzso These results suggest that the zzso are involved in the zzso of zzso in zzso development, and that neural induction requires the removal of zzso signals in the zzso We propose that neural induction occurs by a default zzso zzso the zzso of zzso signaling is required for the conversion of zzso to zzso in the developing zzso zzso
