Sonic zzso zzso signaling plays diverse roles during animal development and adult tissue zzso through differential regulation of zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling activities have been linked to birth defects and zzso Here we report that zzso an zzso zzso zzso factor, has dual functions in regulating zzso target gene zzso Using a zzso conditional deletion in zzso neural zzso and zzso we demonstrate that zzso is required both for repression of the zzso expression and for the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso target zzso In developing zzso deficient for zzso zzso target genes were zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso precursors failed to respond to zzso to increase their zzso The zzso function of zzso was zzso through zzso and both the zzso and zzso functions of zzso appeared to be independent of its zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to the regulatory regions of zzso target zzso providing a possible mechanism for its positive role in zzso zzso Our results thus reveal that a complex zzso regulation mechanism zzso the precise zzso outcomes of zzso signaling and its diverse roles during zzso
