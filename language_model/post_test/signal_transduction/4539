zzso can differentiate into various cell types with unique zzso depending on their zzso Under certain inflammatory conditions, zzso zzso expression of the zzso cell marker zzso together with zzso and zzso zzso These zzso changes indicate zzso differentiation into a specialized subset of zzso cells zzso often referred to as zzso zzso or inflammatory zzso zzso considered important zzso of immune responses under inflammatory conditions triggered by infection or zzso To characterize the relative contribution of zzso and zzso under conditions that induce strong immunity to zzso zzso we analyzed the behavior of zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso We found that under sterile inflammation in mice triggered by zzso zzso zzso zzso can rapidly and zzso exhibit signs of zzso including a surface zzso typically associated with their conversion into zzso These inflammatory zzso remain closely related to their zzso zzso preserving expression of zzso scavenging function, tissue distribution and poor capacity for zzso presentation characteristic of their zzso zzso In addition, zzso d after delivery of the inflammatory zzso these cells reverted to a zzso zzso typical of the steady zzso These findings indicate that, in response to zzso treatment, zzso zzso are activated and express certain DC surface markers without acquiring functional characteristics associated with zzso
