zzso stem cells zzso are maintained in a zzso state in bone zzso zzso niches by intrinsic and zzso zzso The mechanisms regulating the zzso and zzso of zzso however, remain zzso In this study, we report that the expression of zzso protein zzso is decreased during zzso zzso In zzso mice, the long-term zzso zzso population is decreased and zzso and its capacity to repopulate is rapidly zzso These effects are associated with zzso zzso zzso an active cell cycle, and reduced zzso expression under conditions of zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso and zzso interaction between zzso and the bone zzso and impaired zzso and retention in the zzso zzso resulting in mobilized zzso zzso we propose that zzso is essential for maintaining zzso zzso and the interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso
