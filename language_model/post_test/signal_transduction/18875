Numerous reports suggest that zzso zzso promotes survival and proliferation of tumor cells through the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso and its role in proliferation of this tumor has been zzso Thus, agents that can suppress zzso zzso have potential for the treatment of zzso In the present report, we demonstrate that most zzso cell lines had zzso active zzso and that zzso zzso a zzso safe agent in humans, inhibited zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso Nuclear zzso of zzso was also inhibited by zzso The zzso of zzso zzso by zzso was zzso although even 24 zzso after zzso zzso only partial reversal zzso Besides zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso When compared with zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso was more rapid (30 zzso zzso 4 zzso and more potent zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso was also a more potent inhibitor of zzso cell proliferation than zzso Overall, our results demonstrated that zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso and zzso zzso zzso This mechanism may be at least partially responsible for zzso ability to suppress proliferation of zzso zzso
