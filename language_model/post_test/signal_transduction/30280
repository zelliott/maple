In rat zzso skeletal muscle, contraction inhibited the zzso and zzso rates of protein synthesis by 75 and zzso respectively, while increasing zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso on the other hand, zzso protein synthesis (by zzso and increased zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso initiation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso over zzso zzso zzso stimulation had no effect on zzso target of zzso complex 1 zzso zzso as reflected by the lack of reduction in zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but did antagonize zzso zzso after stimulation of the zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased rapidly on electrical stimulation reaching a maximum at 1 zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso slowly increased to reach zzso after 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not activated after 30 zzso of contraction when zzso was zzso This could not be explained by the expression of a zzso zzso of zzso in skeletal muscle lacking the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in this skeletal muscle system, the zzso zzso of protein synthesis could not be attributed to a reduction in zzso zzso but could be due to an increase in zzso zzso independent of zzso zzso
