Environmental temperature cycles are a universal zzso cue for all zzso systems at the zzso level with the exception of zzso zzso We report here that resistance to temperature zzso is a property of the zzso nucleus zzso network and is not a zzso property of zzso zzso This differential sensitivity to temperature allows the zzso to drive zzso rhythms in body temperature, which can then act as a universal cue for the zzso of zzso zzso throughout the zzso zzso experiments show that network interactions in the zzso are required for temperature resistance and that the heat shock zzso is integral to temperature zzso and temperature compensation in zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso ancient temperature zzso response can be used in zzso animals to enhance internal zzso zzso
