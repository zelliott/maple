zzso zzso zzso is activated by a variety of growth factor receptors and the zzso zzso signaling zzso is a key regulator of cell proliferation and zzso The downstream targets of zzso zzso signaling include direct regulators of cell cycle progression and zzso as well as a number of zzso zzso Growth factor stimulation of zzso cells leads to robust zzso of zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso and re-entry into the cell zzso A lower level of zzso zzso signaling is also required for the proliferation and survival of cells maintained in the presence of growth factors, but the gene expression program controlled by zzso zzso signaling in zzso cells has not been zzso 

We used zzso analyses to characterize the changes in gene expression resulting from zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso The genes regulated by zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells were distinct from genes induced by growth factor stimulation of zzso cells and highly enriched in genes that regulate programmed cell zzso zzso analyses followed by zzso zzso demonstrated zzso binding to both previously known and novel sites in promoter regions of approximately one-third of the zzso zzso consistent with zzso of zzso and zzso in response to zzso of zzso zzso zzso binding sites were similarly identified in promoter regions of over one-third of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso bound to promoter regions in cells maintained in serum, however binding decreased following zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso signaling activates zzso via the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the genes targeted by zzso and zzso regulate cell proliferation and zzso including several regulators of zzso that were not previously known to be targeted by these zzso zzso 

zzso zzso signaling in zzso cells regulates a novel zzso program that is highly enriched in genes that regulate zzso At least one-third of these genes are regulated either by zzso zzso factors, which are activated following zzso zzso zzso or by zzso which is activated by zzso zzso via the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
