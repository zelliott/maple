Studies involving zzso interactions provide an opportunity to unravel plant defense signaling in root zzso In this study, we have characterized the roles of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso in plant defense against the migratory zzso zzso zzso in the zzso model plant rice zzso zzso zzso with zzso hormone applications, zzso zzso and zzso lines were executed to test the effect on zzso zzso zzso in rice zzso Our results demonstrate that an intact zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a prerequisite for defense against zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso treatment drastically compromised the rice defense towards this zzso Gene expression analyses using quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso demonstrate that the zzso effect of zzso is likely to be the result of an zzso interaction between this hormone and the zzso zzso defense zzso zzso in rice defense against zzso zzso at least three zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso are important, while zzso plays a negative role in zzso Our results suggest that the balance of zzso and zzso signaling is an important zzso for the outcome of the zzso zzso zzso
