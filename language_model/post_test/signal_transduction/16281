The propagation of zzso zzso through zzso zzso is dependent on effective dissemination of zzso inside the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso face the challenge that their spread inside the host depends in part on the zzso capacities of their host zzso In response, these zzso influence the efficiency of dissemination by altering adhesive and/or zzso properties of their host zzso zzso zzso do so by targeting zzso pathways that control host cell zzso zzso The resulting enforced polar host cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso by establishing focal zzso and invasion structures at the leading edge of the infected zzso This zzso strategy highlights mechanisms of zzso regulation that are also likely relevant for immune or cancer cell zzso
