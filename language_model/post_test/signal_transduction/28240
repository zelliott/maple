Recent studies have suggested that zzso signaling through zzso growth factor zzso zzso might be involved in generating or maintaining an intrinsic polarity in tissue cells, possibly via spatial zzso of zzso zzso The difficulty of experimental investigation of zzso signaling makes especially valuable an application of zzso modeling for critical hypotheses about the dynamic operation of the underlying signaling zzso both zzso and zzso Toward this end, we develop and analyze here a zzso distributed dynamic zzso model of zzso zzso zzso Under certain conditions, the model spontaneously zzso into a state wherein sustained signaling is zzso localized on smaller than cell dimension, zzso a polarity to the otherwise zzso model zzso zzso of a sufficiently large rate of zzso zzso zzso release and of a sufficiently small zzso zzso concentration are zzso consistent with experimental observations of zzso zzso Thus, zzso analysis supports the concept that zzso zzso signaling circuits could play a role in helping generate and/or maintain an intrinsic cell spatial zzso possibly related to migration as well as tissue zzso We additionally offer particular suggestions for critical zzso in the zzso signaling circuits governing this zzso zzso
