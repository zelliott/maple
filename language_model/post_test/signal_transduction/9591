Multiple myeloma develops and expands almost exclusively in the bone zzso and generates devastating bone zzso zzso cells produce a variety of zzso including zzso to stimulate bone zzso by enhancing zzso zzso and suppress bone formation by zzso zzso zzso leading to bone destruction and rapid loss of zzso The emerging role of the zzso signaling axis provide a molecular rationale for consideration of targeting zzso in a bone disease in zzso Given formation of vicious cycle between bone destruction and tumor zzso zzso zzso signaling may also contribute to the suppression of myeloma zzso
