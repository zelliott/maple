In this study, the ability of zzso zzso to prime rat and zzso diabetic zzso mouse zzso for zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso zzso zzso expression by rat zzso is zzso with zzso expression occurring in response to zzso zzso zzso neither zzso zzso zzso nor 150 zzso zzso stimulates zzso expression or zzso production by rat zzso However, a zzso pulse of rat zzso with zzso followed by washing to remove the zzso and continued culture with zzso zzso zzso for 40 zzso results in zzso expression and zzso production to levels similar in magnitude to the individual effects of zzso zzso zzso A zzso pulse with zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso that is zzso by the expression of zzso and increased production of zzso zzso zzso also zzso for zzso zzso expression and zzso formation by zzso mouse zzso The zzso actions of zzso appear to be selective for zzso as zzso zzso for zzso zzso formation by primary zzso and zzso zzso cells, but not primary zzso The zzso actions of zzso for zzso zzso expression do not require de zzso protein synthesis as zzso of zzso cells with zzso does not inhibit zzso zzso zzso under zzso zzso The zzso actions of zzso on zzso zzso expression persists for extended periods of up to 7 days and are associated with persistent signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso A zzso pulse of rat zzso with zzso stimulates zzso zzso and zzso remains zzso for up to 7 days following zzso zzso In addition, zzso remains nuclear for up to 7 days after zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso via a zzso zzso zzso These findings also provide evidence that the zzso actions of zzso for zzso zzso expression by zzso are associated with the prolonged zzso and zzso of zzso
