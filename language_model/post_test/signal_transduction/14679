To study the protective effect of zzso sensitive zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso following focal cerebral zzso zzso and its signal zzso zzso 

Two hundred male zzso rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham operation group (A group), zzso group (B group), zzso zzso opener treatment group zzso zzso and zzso zzso opener and blocker treatment group zzso zzso The middle cerebral artery zzso zzso by zzso zzso method was used to reproduce cerebral zzso and zzso was restored 2 hours after zzso Five rats in each group were zzso Brain sections were made 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours after zzso injury, and zzso zzso was detected by terminal zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso end labeling zzso The expressions of zzso and zzso proteins were detected by zzso zzso Another five rats in each group were used for assessing the expressions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso 

The number of zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso zzso and protein in B, C and D groups were significantly higher than A group at all time points zzso or zzso The number of zzso zzso the expressions of zzso and zzso zzso and protein in C group were significantly lower than B and D groups at all time points zzso or zzso There were no differences between B and D groups at all time points (all zzso 

zzso zzso opener can significantly mitigate zzso zzso and inhibit the expressions of zzso and zzso zzso and protein after cerebral zzso zzso This result indicates that zzso zzso opener can decrease zzso zzso by zzso zzso signaling zzso
