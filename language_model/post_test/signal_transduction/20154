zzso zzso regulatory circuits have been employed as platform to design and construct zzso bacterial zzso for reporting zzso A new generation of zzso with improved performance and a wide application range has emerged after the application of synthetic biology concepts to zzso zzso zzso zzso directed evolution and domain swapping were applied to upgrade signal detection or to create novel sensor zzso zzso of the genetic circuits allows improving the zzso and reduces the zzso of the response between individual reporter zzso Moreover, the assembly of natural or engineered zzso to zzso platforms provides innovative zzso expanding the range of application of these zzso from monitoring zzso and zzso to killing targeted zzso
