zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to activate zzso in response to zzso We have explored the involvement of zzso in regulation of the zzso gene in the zzso zzso cell line zzso by examining its effect on zzso zzso reporter gene zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso with zzso displayed high levels of zzso zzso increased zzso zzso reporter gene expression (which was dependent on zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso was zzso however, to increase zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso induced similar responses and again failed to increase zzso protein zzso A dominant negative zzso inhibited reporter gene expression and zzso protein production in response to both zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatment and zzso or zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso Only zzso treatment zzso the induced transcripts with 50% being zzso at 20 h post zzso The zzso zzso induced in zzso or zzso cells was depleted by zzso at 6 h post zzso These data zzso zzso and zzso in zzso regulation of zzso gene expression via zzso and provide direct evidence that zzso lies upstream from zzso Neither zzso nor zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso which is required for zzso protein zzso
