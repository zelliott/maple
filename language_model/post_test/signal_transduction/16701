zzso evidence supports the role of inflammation in the development of a variety of chronic vascular diseases such as zzso transplantation zzso and zzso after vascular mechanical zzso Thus, identification of mechanisms to control inflammation may provide novel therapeutic targets to limit such disease zzso zzso growth zzso zzso is a zzso growth factor with potent zzso effects on cells important to zzso zzso formation including zzso cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, zzso and T zzso The mechanisms responsible for the zzso zzso effects of zzso have recently become zzso This review focuses on the emerging role of the downstream zzso signaling zzso termed zzso as regulators of vascular zzso These findings are beginning to establish a zzso scaffold with which to understand the zzso specific function of zzso in the development of chronic inflammatory vascular disease zzso
