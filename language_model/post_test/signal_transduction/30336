zzso are structural zzso of the insect zzso hormone zzso Plants comprise rich sources of zzso in high concentration and with broad structural zzso zzso have a number of proven beneficial effects on zzso but the hormonal effects of zzso have been proven only in zzso Their structures are somewhat similar to those of the zzso steroid hormones but there are several structural differences between the two steroid zzso Despite of these essential structural differences, zzso exert numerous effects in zzso that are similar to those of zzso hormonal steroids, and they may serve as effective zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso do not bind to the zzso steroid zzso instead, they are likely to influence signal zzso zzso like the anabolic steroids, possibly via membrane bound zzso The application of zzso is a promising alternative to the use of zzso steroids because of the apparent lack of adverse zzso The prospective use of zzso may extend to treatments of pathological conditions where anabolic steroids are routinely zzso One of the most cited aspects of zzso application (on the zzso is the increase of muscle zzso However in this field too stringent research is needed as an adequate zzso explanation is not yet available for the zzso This paper reports on the most important structural differences between zzso hormones, their synthetic zzso and zzso The zzso effects and the possible mechanisms of action of these compounds are also discussed as concerns the skeletal zzso
