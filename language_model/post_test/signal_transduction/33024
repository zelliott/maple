To establish the specific contribution to protein zzso of zzso and zzso retrieval zzso we have determined by zzso electron zzso and cell zzso the zzso distribution at steady state of the zzso and zzso versions of human zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and zzso expressed in zzso rat cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Jackson, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein is represented by a single form, initially zzso only about half of it is located in the zzso zzso whereas more than zzso of the total is present in the intermediate compartment and zzso zzso In the latter zzso zzso zzso with zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and shows the higher density of zzso zzso about zzso of the total zzso protein is localized in clusters on the zzso zzso where significant zzso with zzso zzso zzso is observed, and zzso and initially zzso forms apparently constitute a single zzso Altogether, these results suggest that zzso and zzso retrieval motifs have different zzso effects on theirs own at steady state: the first results in a specific enrichment in the intermediate compartment and zzso complex, and the latter dictates residency in the zzso zzso
