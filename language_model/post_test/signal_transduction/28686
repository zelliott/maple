One potentially important mechanism for regulating class zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is zzso of the zzso alpha adapter zzso on zzso by the intrinsic protein zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso as this zzso the zzso zzso activity in zzso Here we investigate whether this zzso can occur in zzso We find that zzso alpha zzso zzso alpha zzso in zzso with significant zzso However, zzso beta is far less efficient at zzso zzso alpha zzso identifying a potential difference in the mechanisms by which these two zzso are zzso The zzso alpha zzso zzso was increased by treatment with insulin, zzso growth factor, and the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso The functional effects of this zzso are highlighted by zzso of zzso which results in reduced zzso zzso activity and reduced association of the zzso alpha zzso zzso with zzso zzso The importance of this zzso was further highlighted by the finding that zzso on zzso was impaired, while zzso zzso activity was increased, in a zzso alpha zzso recently discovered in human zzso These results provide the first evidence that zzso of zzso plays a role as a zzso switch in growth factor signaling and contributes to the differences in functional properties of different zzso zzso zzso in zzso
