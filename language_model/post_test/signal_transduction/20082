zzso zzso zzso zzso protein of 76 zzso is an zzso protein that is essential for T cell development and T cell zzso zzso signaling zzso Previous studies have identified an important negative feedback regulation of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso 1; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso mediates zzso zzso resulting in the zzso of zzso zzso and downstream zzso however, the underlying mechanism of this action remains zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso is zzso and targeted for zzso degradation during zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso is identified as a zzso site of zzso Loss of zzso zzso of zzso results in enhanced zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results reveal a novel regulation mechanism of zzso by zzso and zzso degradation of activated zzso which is zzso by zzso zzso leading to zzso of zzso zzso
