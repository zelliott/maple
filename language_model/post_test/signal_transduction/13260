zzso oxygen species, generated by zzso zzso zzso have been recognized as one of the major zzso of zzso and zzso injury in the zzso zzso oxygen zzso cerebral events are zzso in part, to the change in zzso signaling molecules including zzso protein zzso zzso Big zzso zzso 1 zzso also known as zzso is a newly identified member of the zzso zzso family and has been reported to be sensitive to zzso zzso In the present study, we examined the effect of zzso on zzso activity in zzso cells, and we investigated the zzso implication of zzso zzso showed that zzso was rapidly and significantly activated by zzso in a zzso manner in zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso was inhibited by both zzso and zzso which were reported to inhibit zzso as well as zzso zzso was suggested to be involved in zzso zzso from the experiments with zzso A and zzso specific zzso of zzso family zzso zzso of zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso treatment of cells induced an enhancement of DNA binding activity of zzso a downstream zzso factor of zzso in zzso zzso Finally, zzso of cells with zzso and zzso resulted in an increase in cell death including zzso by zzso in zzso zzso cells as well as in intact zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso may counteract zzso cellular damage probably through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
