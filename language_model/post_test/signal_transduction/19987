We investigated whether zzso zzso II zzso and zzso zzso are involved in zzso zzso induced by tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso rats zzso days old) were cultured and zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso was blocked by several antagonists, including zzso (4 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso content, protein zzso zzso volumes, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated by the Lowry method, zzso zzso a computerized image analysis system, a zzso imaging system, and Western zzso analysis, zzso zzso induced a significant increase in protein content in a zzso manner from 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso to 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso and in a zzso manner from 12 h zzso zzso zzso to 72 h zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly increased the zzso of spontaneous zzso zzso the total protein content, cell size, and zzso incorporation in cultured zzso which was abolished by 4 zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso The increases in protein content, cell size and zzso incorporation were abolished by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the expression of zzso by zzso and that of zzso by zzso compared to zzso These effects were abolished by 4 zzso zzso which itself had no zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso increases in zzso zzso and zzso and promotes cardiac zzso zzso we zzso that the zzso and zzso signaling pathways are involved in zzso zzso induced by zzso
