zzso cells treated by zzso develop the zzso adherent zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso We focused our study on the identification of the zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso and its downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Acquisition of the zzso zzso was evidenced by cell adherence zzso and a sharp increase of CD 36 and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso surface zzso zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso prevented zzso zzso synthesis zzso and protein zzso and cell zzso To identify the zzso zzso we took advantage of the zzso cell line, an zzso cell zzso deficient in zzso gene zzso This zzso prevents zzso to induce the differentiation zzso zzso zzso by zzso did not zzso zzso nor become zzso However, in zzso cells either zzso by zzso acid that zzso zzso gene expression or zzso with zzso zzso zzso significantly activated zzso synthesis and zzso of zzso zzso of active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells showed a preferential and sustained zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso over the zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly attenuated this zzso zzso zzso and zzso both highly specific zzso zzso efficiently prevented zzso zzso synthesis zzso and protein zzso and cell zzso whereas zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso did zzso zzso obtained from zzso and zzso cells indicate that the zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression involves a zzso zzso other than zzso In conclusion, we propose that the zzso zzso zzso is a potential linear route for zzso synthesis leading to zzso changes and adherence linked to zzso differentiation in zzso zzso
