The adapter proteins zzso and zzso associate with a wide spectrum of receptors in a variety of innate immune cells to mediate zzso signaling pathways when their zzso zzso is zzso These adapter proteins are coupled to their receptors through charged zzso within the zzso regions of the adapter and zzso zzso and zzso contain specific protein zzso zzso to as zzso zzso zzso zzso that serve as the zzso and zzso sites for zzso allowing amplification of zzso signaling zzso Recent research has broadened the repertoire of receptors that zzso these adapters for signaling to include not only novel zzso zzso members but also zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso There is abundant evidence that these zzso signaling adapters also mediate zzso activity, zzso signaling from zzso receptors and other zzso zzso In this review, we discuss the newly described receptors that zzso zzso and/or zzso adapters to zzso innate immune zzso
