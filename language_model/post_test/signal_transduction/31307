The unexpectedly long, and still zzso path towards a reliable mathematical model of zzso and its regulation in zzso zzso is zzso The model of this comparatively simple zzso was to be deduced from in zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso of the key zzso zzso As to be expected from any zzso inverse problem, zzso challenges were encountered in the zzso determination of zzso values of the zzso Some of these were successfully zzso whereas others are still awaiting improved techniques of zzso In addition, rethinking of the model zzso became necessary, because some generally accepted assumptions during model design are not necessarily valid for in zzso zzso Examples include zzso relationships and the zzso of cells and their zzso Finally, it turned out to be useful to model only some of the zzso while using time courses of ubiquitous compounds such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso input zzso With respect to our specific application, the zzso process has come a long way, but it is not yet zzso Nonetheless, the model analysis has led to interesting insights into the design of the zzso and into the principles that govern its zzso Specifically, the widely observed zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso is shown to provide a crucial mechanism for positioning the starving zzso in a holding pattern that allows immediate zzso of zzso as soon as it becomes zzso
