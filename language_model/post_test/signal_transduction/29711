zzso zzso zzso is a most powerful zzso mechanism for zzso protection against zzso zzso It is now apparent that zzso oxygen species zzso generated in the zzso respiratory chain act as a trigger of zzso zzso mediate signal zzso in the early phase of zzso through the zzso modification of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso serves a scaffold for interaction of proteins recruited by G zzso receptors and growth factor receptors that is necessary for amplification of zzso signal zzso zzso zzso C zzso plays a central role in this signaling zzso A crucial target of zzso is the zzso zzso zzso channel, which acts as a trigger and a zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are thought to exist downstream of the zzso signaling zzso although the role of zzso zzso in zzso remains zzso The late phase of zzso is zzso by zzso gene zzso This mechanism involves zzso zzso of zzso factors through zzso and zzso zzso signal zzso pathways that are in common with the early phase of zzso The zzso proteins then act against zzso necrosis and stunning presumably through zzso of zzso stress and zzso zzso zzso of zzso complex signaling processes will help in the development of more effective pharmacological approaches for prevention of zzso zzso zzso
