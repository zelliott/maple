The zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso is a major zzso of stress responses in zzso Similar to other zzso protein zzso zzso zzso activity is controlled by a cascade of protein zzso and by protein zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso associate with scaffold proteins that zzso their activities and cellular zzso The zzso zzso zzso scaffold protein specifically binds zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso and members of the mixed lineage zzso zzso family, and regulates zzso zzso in zzso In this study we demonstrate that distinct regions within the N zzso of zzso and the zzso family member dual zzso zzso zzso zzso mediate their binding to zzso We have also identified zzso acids in zzso required for: zzso binding to zzso and for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso 4 zzso and efficient zzso by zzso and zzso zzso to its zzso zzso and efficient zzso zzso None of the zzso acids identified were essential for zzso zzso to zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso These findings uncover molecular zzso of zzso scaffold complex assembly and demonstrate that there are zzso but also zzso binding zzso within zzso that mediate interactions with scaffold zzso zzso zzso and zzso
