During zzso zzso a relatively limited number of zzso cells zzso a stereotypical set of cellular movements that leads to formation of the three germ zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso therefore, provides a unique zzso system in which to study cell movements in zzso in a fairly simple cellular zzso Recent advances have been made in zzso the cellular and molecular mechanisms that zzso cell movements during zzso zzso These findings can be compared with observations made in other model systems to identify potential general mechanisms of cell migration during zzso
