zzso zzso zzso play an important role in maintenance of the zzso zzso for zzso zzso This study was carried out to investigate the effect of zzso zzso on the cultured rat zzso zzso and the signal zzso mechanisms of this zzso In normal zzso solution, zzso added zzso zzso a zzso zzso response consisting of a transient spike followed by a second sustained zzso zzso activated zzso channel blocker zzso acid zzso zzso 300 zzso only inhibited part of the zzso zzso response, while zzso zzso channel blocker zzso acid zzso 1 zzso reduced all, indicating the involvement of different zzso zzso Both zzso of the zzso zzso response could be significantly inhibited by zzso with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An increase in zzso zzso content upon stimulation of zzso was zzso All of the initial peak and part of the second peak could be inhibited by zzso with zzso agent zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso pump zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso In a zzso patch clamp experiment, zzso induced an inward current in the single zzso Two different profiles of currents were zzso the first component current exhibited an outward zzso zzso relationship in a time and zzso manner, and the current followed showed a linear zzso zzso The zzso current was found to be partially zzso by zzso and could be completely blocked by zzso The above results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso could be zzso by zzso and zzso regulatory zzso
