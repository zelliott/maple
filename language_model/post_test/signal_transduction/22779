The zzso zzso gene encodes an zzso of zzso and zzso signaling whose expression is induced by the signaling pathways that it zzso Here we describe a family of zzso zzso zzso and demonstrate that the regulatory relationship with zzso pathways has been zzso In both mouse and chick zzso zzso genes are expressed in intimate association with zzso signaling zzso zzso and zzso experiments demonstrate that zzso signaling zzso zzso gene expression in various zzso zzso zzso obtained by infecting the prospective wing territory of the chick zzso with a zzso containing a mouse zzso gene causes a reduction in limb bud outgrowth and other effects consistent with reduced zzso signaling from the zzso zzso zzso At later stages of development in the infected limbs there was a dramatic reduction in skeletal element length due to an zzso of zzso zzso The results provide evidence that zzso zzso proteins function as zzso feedback zzso and suggest a possible role for zzso genes in the zzso of specific human zzso caused by zzso zzso in zzso
