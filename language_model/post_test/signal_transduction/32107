zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso of zzso interactions and regulates many cellular zzso including growth, zzso survival, zzso migration, invasion and zzso The present work analyzes the role of zzso in wound healing in adult animals using a conditional zzso of the zzso gene generated with the zzso zzso system zzso zzso zzso show that zzso zzso leads to retarded wound closure in zzso zzso mechanisms involved in this process were analyzed in cultured mouse embryonic zzso zzso isolated from zzso mice and revealed that wounding promotes rapid zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a retarded wound closure due to a decrease in cellular proliferation and loss of zzso protein expression during the healing process, in zzso and in zzso zzso in cell proliferation and wound closure in zzso zzso or mice could be rescued by zzso administration of human zzso These data zzso for the first time, that the zzso of zzso and zzso after skin wounding are critical for zzso tissue repair and wound zzso
