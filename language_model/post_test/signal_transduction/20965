The zzso signaling cascade is an important regulator of zzso zzso Numerous abnormalities occur in this zzso and are associated with impaired cardiac zzso in patients with zzso heart failure zzso These signaling defects include zzso of zzso receptors zzso zzso and increased levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso that zzso and zzso only zzso zzso Our laboratory has been testing the hypothesis that reversal of these zzso defects may be able to restore cardiac zzso to normal in patients with depressed zzso zzso zzso mice with cardiac zzso of beta zzso or an inhibitor of beta zzso have enhanced cardiac function as compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the beta zzso or beta zzso inhibitor zzso beta zzso signaling in cultured adult rabbit zzso zzso However, a controversy has developed in the literature regarding whether increasing zzso signaling would be beneficial or zzso for patients with zzso Those cautioning against this approach note that increased sympathetic activity is dangerous in zzso zzso zzso levels predict mortality and zzso are not beneficial for survival, while recent studies suggest that zzso do improve zzso Supporting these concerns is the demonstration that transgenic mice with cardiac zzso of zzso alpha and enhanced zzso responsiveness to zzso develop zzso zzso This article summarizes this zzso highlights important differences between zzso of beta zzso or a beta zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and administration of zzso and develops the hypothesis that these strategies may differ in their therapeutic efficacy in treating zzso
