zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso function in cell zzso and the zzso signaling zzso In colon and other zzso zzso in the zzso tumor zzso protein or zzso zzso zzso stabilize zzso enhancing its ability to activate zzso of zzso target zzso Though zzso and zzso have analogous structures and functions and like binding to zzso evidence that zzso has an important role in cancer has been zzso We report here that zzso regulates both zzso and zzso and zzso functions as an zzso In contrast to zzso for which only zzso zzso forms transform zzso zzso cells, zzso and several zzso zzso forms of zzso had similar transforming zzso zzso transforming activity, like zzso was dependent on zzso zzso However, in contrast to zzso zzso strongly activated zzso expression and zzso function was crucial for zzso zzso Our findings suggest zzso zzso alter regulation of both zzso and zzso perhaps explaining why the frequency of zzso zzso in colon cancer far exceeds that of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso with zzso defects may be due to altered regulation of both zzso and zzso Furthermore, the data imply zzso and zzso may have distinct roles in zzso signaling and cancer via differential effects on downstream target zzso
