Several members of the zzso signal zzso family have been implicated in the control of polar development in zzso zzso zzso and zzso two zzso localized zzso sensor zzso and the response regulators zzso and zzso The zzso protein was shown previously to be required during the zzso cell transition for zzso ejection and efficient stalk zzso Here, we present data indicating that zzso also controls the onset of zzso and a cell density switch immediately preceding cell zzso zzso active zzso of zzso or zzso an zzso from zzso zzso almost completely suppressed zzso zzso zzso and inhibited the increase in zzso cell density during cell zzso The observation that these zzso also had a zzso effect on zzso in a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso background indicated that zzso is located downstream of the other components in the signal zzso zzso which controls the activity of the zzso zzso In addition, the presence of a zzso zzso or zzso zzso resulted in a doubling of the average stalk zzso Together, this is consistent with a model in which the active form of zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso controls aspects of differentiation in the late zzso cell, whereas it acts positively on polar development during the zzso cell zzso In agreement with such a model, we found that zzso which zzso to the stalked pole during cell zzso positively controlled the in zzso zzso status of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso modulated this status in a negative zzso Furthermore, domain switch experiments demonstrated that the zzso zzso output domain from zzso zzso is active in zzso zzso zzso a more general function for this novel zzso domain over a specific role such as DNA or protein zzso zzso roles for zzso and its zzso output domain in modulating the polar cell surface of zzso zzso are zzso
