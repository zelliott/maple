This study is to investigate the effect of zzso on zzso activity, bone zzso as well as zzso in zzso and explore the mechanism of zzso in preventing zzso zzso were separated from zzso bones of new born zzso cultured in zzso plate with glass slices and bone zzso and treated by 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified by observing live cells with phase contrast zzso HE zzso zzso zzso and zzso blue zzso of bone zzso zzso The numbers of bone zzso pits were counted as well as the surface area of bone zzso on bone zzso zzso were stained with zzso orange to detect the cell zzso The ratio of zzso zzso was observed under zzso zzso The gene expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein expression were examined using real time zzso and Western zzso zzso Comparing with the control group without zzso the rates of zzso zzso increased obviously and the number and area of bone zzso pits decreased evidently with 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There is significant difference between control group and experiment group treated by 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso through zzso signal zzso zzso the zzso activity, enhances zzso zzso and zzso the bone zzso
