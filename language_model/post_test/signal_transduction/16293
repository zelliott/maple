zzso receptors and zzso zzso are zzso zzso communication molecules that regulate the spatial zzso of cells in various zzso by repulsive or adhesive signals arising from contact between zzso and zzso zzso However, the expression and functions of zzso receptors in the gastric zzso and zzso zzso are virtually zzso We detected several zzso receptors and zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso of the adult mouse by zzso zzso zzso showed complementary expression patterns, with zzso being zzso expressed in the superficial part and zzso receptors in the deeper part of both zzso In the gastric zzso zzso was expressed in pit cells and zzso cells of the zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso zzso cells and zzso cells of the zzso In the zzso zzso was expressed in cells lining the ducts of zzso zzso as well as those covering zzso and the upper portion of the zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso were expressed in the zzso segment of zzso zzso and the lower portion of the zzso and zzso in the zzso In both zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso might occur zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso transition of zzso zzso where the zzso and zzso expression zzso Based on these findings, we propose that zzso zzso may regulate cell positioning within the zzso and zzso zzso
