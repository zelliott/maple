In order to identify some of the molecular mechanisms that occur after a central nervous system zzso the immediate early gene zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso B were zzso by zzso following unilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso 2, 5, 12 and 24 zzso two, six, 10 and 14 days, four weeks and six months zzso In the zzso zzso zzso was induced in some zzso zzso (30 zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells zzso to the zzso (2 zzso expressed in zzso zzso (5 h and two zzso and was absent at all later zzso A zzso expression of zzso was found in zzso zzso cells of controls, which was strongly increased on the zzso side (2 zzso and on the side zzso to the zzso (12 zzso zzso expression returned to control levels by 24 zzso zzso B was induced in zzso cells zzso to the zzso within 2 h and was back to control levels by 5 zzso In the lateral zzso area, zzso and zzso were induced 30 zzso zzso and decreased rapidly zzso In the cerebral cortex, a widespread induction of zzso and zzso occurred within 30 zzso after zzso zzso zzso and this zzso lasted until two days zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso leads to a rapid and widespread induction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso zzso some of these changes may be linked to the reorganization processes following the zzso zzso the zzso in immediate early gene expression reported here may be due to changes in synaptic activity or zzso zzso which occur in this zzso zzso
