zzso zzso transport of cellular signals driven by zzso is vital for zzso zzso Mouse models with defects in the retrograde transport machinery, including the zzso mouse zzso zzso in zzso and the zzso mouse zzso of zzso exhibit mild neurodegenerative zzso Transport defects have also been observed in more rapidly progressive zzso such as that observed in the zzso transgenic mouse model for familial zzso lateral sclerosis zzso Here, we test the hypothesis that zzso in retrograde signaling lead to zzso In zzso in zzso and zzso imaging zzso zzso show zzso of transport and zzso of retrograde signaling in the zzso zzso However, similar zzso is also seen in the zzso and zzso mouse zzso Thus, slowing of retrograde signaling leads only to mild zzso and cannot explain ALS zzso To further pursue this question, we used a zzso approach to investigate zzso retrograde zzso These data indicate a significant decrease in retrograde survival factors, including zzso zzso and zzso and an increase in retrograde stress factor zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso similar changes are not seen in the zzso zzso zzso of motor zzso and zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso in zzso chambers indicate that zzso of retrograde stress signaling is sufficient to block zzso of cellular stress pathways and to rescue motor zzso from zzso zzso zzso a shift from zzso to zzso retrograde signaling may be key to the rapid onset of zzso seen in zzso
