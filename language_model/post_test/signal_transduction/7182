To determine the efficacy of zzso delivery of zzso 1 zzso in preventing zzso zzso zzso 

zzso artery zzso was performed to induce zzso zzso After 14 days, zzso analysis confirmed increased zzso growth and subsequent media zzso and zzso zzso zzso capture zzso quantitative zzso and zzso analysis of zzso tissue revealed a significant increase in zzso zzso and notch target zzso zzso 1 and 2 expression in the injured zzso zzso delivery of zzso 1 zzso by zzso gel inhibited the zzso increase in zzso 1 zzso and target gene expression when compared to scrambled zzso controls while zzso reducing media zzso and zzso formation to zzso zzso zzso Selective zzso 1 zzso also reversed the zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression while decreasing zzso zzso zzso expression to zzso control zzso In parallel experiments, zzso zzso levels, as measured by zzso zzso were reversed to zzso control levels following selective zzso 1 zzso 

These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso can be successfully inhibited by localized zzso delivery of zzso 1 zzso
