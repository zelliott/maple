zzso a member of the tumor necrosis factor zzso family, can induce zzso when activated by zzso zzso binding or zzso zzso zzso zzso studies have shown that a zzso in zzso zzso resulted in abnormal development and function of the immune system in zzso A point zzso in the zzso domain of zzso (a single base change from T to A at base zzso replacing zzso with zzso zzso the signal zzso property of zzso Mice zzso for this zzso zzso zzso zzso develop zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Little is known about the mechanism of signal zzso in zzso zzso In this study, we used the zzso screen in zzso to isolate a zzso protein factor, zzso which specifically interacts with the zzso domain of zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso This interaction occurs not only in zzso but also in zzso zzso When zzso expressed in L cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso A search of available DNA and protein sequence data banks did not reveal significant zzso between zzso and known zzso zzso zzso is an unusual protein that binds to the wild type but not the inactive point zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso cell killing and is a candidate signal zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso
