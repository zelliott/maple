In zzso zzso zzso the synthesis of zzso compounds is zzso activated by the zzso zzso The zzso system zzso promotes zzso of three small regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which remove the regulatory proteins zzso and zzso from the zzso sites of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and formation of zzso complexes relieve zzso zzso zzso Other bacteria as zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso similar zzso based systems to adjust zzso translation zzso the zzso coli zzso system for carbon storage, zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso are remarkably similar in that they contain several zzso with an zzso zzso zzso exposed in the hairpin loop that would be the characteristic zzso motifs relevant for zzso activity and zzso Here it is shown that the dysfunctional zzso cascade of zzso zzso zzso zzso could be restored by appropriate zzso levels of artificial genes zzso zzso with unrelated primary sequence but with two or more zzso displaying the zzso binding zzso The results support the hypothesis that the molecular mimicry of zzso zzso is based on proper secondary structures that expose critical binding motifs irrespective of their overall zzso
