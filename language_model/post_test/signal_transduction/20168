To explore the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso II in human zzso zzso cells zzso and determine the involvement of the zzso zzso zzso The human zzso line, zzso was used in all experiments, and divided into control zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso cells were further divided among several zzso zzso to zzso zzso groups: zzso zzso blocking agent, 10-6 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10-6 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10-6 zzso To explore the potential zzso effects of various zzso family members, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells were exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso for 24 zzso Western zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso zzso were used to assess changes in protein and zzso expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso tissue growth factor zzso Compared with the control group, zzso zzso cells showed significantly increased levels of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso zzso with zzso or zzso eliminated these zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso can inhibit the zzso zzso zzso of zzso ROCK and zzso in zzso zzso cells, indicating that the zzso zzso zzso an important branch of the zzso system is involved in the occurrence and development of liver zzso
