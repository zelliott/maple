This study examines the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso protein zzso as part of the signal zzso zzso used to activate zzso zzso zzso cells labeled with zzso were treated with zzso proteins were separated by two-dimensional zzso gel zzso and the pattern of protein zzso was determined by zzso and zzso two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of multiple proteins between 15 and 60 zzso and the proteins were all zzso by 120 zzso The pattern of proteins zzso in the presence of zzso or zzso differed from that of zzso zzso of protein zzso C activity by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso by zzso zzso and zzso of calcium zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso did not inhibit the majority of zzso protein zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso cells by zzso of a zzso different from, or in addition to, protein zzso C or zzso zzso
