A zzso diverse group of bacterial pathogens have evolved a variety of strategies to zzso zzso functions to their zzso This often involves zzso zzso interactions leading to responses in both the pathogen and host zzso Central to this interaction is the function of a specialized protein zzso system that directs the export and/or zzso into the host cells of a number of bacterial proteins that can induce or interfere with zzso signal zzso zzso The understanding of these zzso interactions will not only lead to novel therapeutic approaches but will also result in a better understanding of a variety of basic aspects of cell physiology and zzso
