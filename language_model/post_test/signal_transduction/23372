Two models are proposed to explain zzso function during helper T zzso cell zzso One argues that zzso instructs one zzso cell fate over the other, whereas the other zzso that zzso function is dictated by zzso Here we provide a detailed zzso study investigating the role of zzso in orchestrating zzso cell zzso zzso neither instructed zzso cell differentiation nor did zzso direct zzso activity, but instead, zzso simultaneously regulated the zzso zzso and zzso cell genetic programs independently of zzso zzso In addition to regulating these programs in both polarized and zzso zzso cells, we identified zzso as a direct zzso zzso zzso bound the zzso zzso zzso where it zzso with zzso at the zzso Thus, zzso acts as an unbiased amplifier of zzso cell zzso Our data provide a paradigm for zzso in zzso with zzso simultaneously orchestrating multiple lineage programs, rather than restricting alternate zzso
