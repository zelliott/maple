zzso a zzso of zzso is a member of the zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso protein zzso zzso It is expressed at high levels in zzso tissue and has recently emerged as a novel zzso In the present study, we provide the first evidence for a zzso role of the new zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso was specifically expressed in zzso zzso cells, where testosterone is produced, in the adult mouse zzso zzso increased testosterone production by zzso mouse zzso cells in a zzso zzso The increased testosterone production was linked to zzso of zzso proteins zzso such as zzso acute regulatory zzso protein and cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, increases in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso element binding protein zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso of this signaling zzso by a specific protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso blocked testosterone production in zzso zzso cells, suggesting that the zzso effect of zzso on testosterone production is associated with zzso of the zzso signaling zzso Thus, our results demonstrate a zzso role for zzso in zzso zzso and provide novel insights in the zzso mechanisms activated by this zzso
