Previous studies suggested that zzso L zzso the bacterial zzso zzso activates mast zzso zzso presumably performs the zzso by interacting with zzso zzso but the underlying mechanisms behind the process remain zzso In the current study, we found that zzso zzso expression is a critical factor participant in zzso full zzso of zzso mast cells, which includes zzso production, the zzso response, and zzso zzso zzso release, and that engagement of the zzso with zzso and zzso is enough to induce zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso Introduction of zzso in two zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso completely abolished the zzso mast cell functions, with the exception of zzso zzso zzso the zzso acts as a signal zzso that is responsible for zzso release independently of the zzso Taken together, our results suggest crucial and distinct functions for the zzso and zzso in the zzso full zzso of mast cells induced by zzso and zzso
