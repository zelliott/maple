zzso have distinct zzso functions within the zzso The biological action of zzso is primarily exerted through zzso regulation by the nuclear zzso zzso zzso but the molecular zzso governed by zzso remain largely zzso At present, there is imminent concern that environmental man-made chemicals with zzso properties, among others, are capable of modulating hormonal responses, thereby interfering with normal zzso processes that are critical to zzso In the present study, we aimed to further characterize a standardized and zzso zzso culture system in terms of zzso expression during in zzso zzso to be able to use it as a zzso to study effects of zzso on zzso and zzso growth, steroid zzso profile, and zzso zzso maturation zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso protein was zzso to the nucleus of zzso and zzso cells in response to zzso zzso production in zzso cells during zzso zzso zzso During the zzso phase in zzso zzso was zzso expressed in mural and zzso cells, zzso an zzso zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso or zzso two model zzso compounds, resulted in reduced zzso growth during the zzso phase, altered zzso environment, and arrest in zzso zzso maturation in response to human zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in the culture model corresponded well to what is described in zzso and this system revealed several zzso functions targeted by zzso zzso that can be further investigated using more in-depth molecular zzso
