zzso zzso valve disease zzso is a disorder related to progressive zzso of zzso tissue that is a leading cause of heart zzso Thus far, there is no medical treatment to prevent the zzso of zzso zzso It is generally thought that zzso zzso is linked to zzso of vascular zzso However, the role of zzso during zzso as well as the survival signals for zzso zzso cells zzso the main cellular component of zzso valves, remains to be zzso Here, through several lines of evidence, we show that zzso of zzso zzso is a signal which determines survival or zzso of zzso and, in doing so, plays a major role in the development of zzso Specifically, in zzso and in zzso cultures undergoing zzso we found a high level of the zzso zzso In addition, a genetic zzso in the zzso 9 of the zzso gene was associated with zzso in a zzso cohort as well as with zzso expression levels of zzso in zzso zzso A high level of zzso in zzso promoted zzso zzso of zzso by depleting the zzso pool of zzso We then documented that release of zzso by zzso promoted cell survival via the zzso zzso and the zzso signaling zzso zzso our results show that level of zzso zzso zzso concentration of zzso which is an important survival signal for zzso These findings may help to develop novel pharmacological treatment for zzso
