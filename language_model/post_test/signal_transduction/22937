Reports from the past year have demonstrated that neural basic zzso genes and zzso zzso genes contribute to zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso that zzso signaling specifies cell fates in the developing zzso inner ear, and that the organization of the central nervous system into three columns is shared by zzso and zzso These findings pave the way for future work that will help to establish the extent to which these similarities represent evolutionary zzso
