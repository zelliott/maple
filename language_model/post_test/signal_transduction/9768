zzso oxide zzso is zzso in plants in response to stress, and its role in signaling is zzso In contrast, very little is known about the zzso role of its zzso zzso zzso which forms when NO zzso with zzso and zzso protein modification by zzso zzso zzso with an zzso pathogen triggers the simultaneous production of NO and zzso oxygen species, as well as an increase in zzso zzso so zzso could be zzso relevant during this zzso To gain insight into the role of zzso in plants, we measured its zzso during the hypersensitive response in zzso zzso using the specific zzso fluorescent dye zzso in a leaf disc zzso The zzso pathogen zzso zzso zzso tomato, carrying the zzso gene zzso zzso induced a strong increase in zzso zzso h zzso zzso which peaked zzso zzso The increase in zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso the zzso zzso together with the zzso and was almost completely eliminated by zzso zzso with zzso confirming that zzso zzso in zzso is induced specifically by zzso This establishes a link between zzso synthesis and zzso zzso and we therefore propose that zzso zzso the NO signal by zzso protein zzso
