zzso are zzso cells which play an exclusive role in bone zzso but the molecular mechanisms of zzso how zzso are activated and how the zzso zzso are finally released towards the bone zzso are poorly zzso Here we show that an energy zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso and that zzso of zzso is essential for the whole process of zzso under the control of a zzso zzso zzso By developing a traceable and zzso in zzso analyzing system for zzso function, we found that zzso gives rise to two events simultaneously zzso zzso reorganization for the formation of zzso zones, zzso zzso structures which zzso the contact surface, and zzso the delivery and zzso of zzso zzso towards the zzso site on the zzso We further found that zzso of zzso is a critical reaction for zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso resulted in zzso failure of the zzso like structure formation and zzso ceased zzso of zzso zzso Additionally, zzso of zzso was found to be regulated by zzso These data suggest a novel zzso zzso regulation zzso related to zzso for a therapeutic target in zzso zzso
