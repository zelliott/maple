This review focuses on our current knowledge of the zzso changes regulating gene expression at the zzso and DNA level, independently on the primary DNA zzso to zzso the zzso of muscle precursors during zzso zzso and muscle zzso These zzso marks provide the blueprint by which the zzso cues are interpreted at the nuclear level by the zzso machinery to select the repertoire of zzso genes to be zzso The zzso of some of these changes necessarily reflects the dynamic nature of skeletal zzso which zzso the progression through two zzso zzso and zzso Other zzso modifications are instead associated to events conventionally considered as zzso maintenance of lineage commitment and terminal zzso However, recent results support the possibility that these events can be zzso at least upon certain experimental conditions, thereby revealing a dynamic nature of many of the zzso modifications underlying skeletal zzso The zzso of the zzso network that regulates zzso during zzso zzso and muscle zzso might provide the information instrumental to devise pharmacological interventions toward selective manipulation of gene expression to promote zzso of skeletal muscles and possibly other zzso
