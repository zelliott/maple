zzso of B7 on tumor cells can circumvent T cell tolerance and lead to the generation of tumor zzso T cell zzso The effect of B7 expression on the generation of protective zzso immunity has been attributed primarily to 1) more efficient T cell zzso and 2) better generation of zzso killer T zzso We have investigated the role of zzso through zzso and its zzso the zzso zzso in the generation of zzso human zzso against zzso breast cancer zzso In this setting, we describe how activated zzso undergo zzso cell death upon killing the target zzso Instead of proliferation and zzso expansion, the majority of the zzso underwent zzso cell zzso zzso zzso could be blocked by 50% when binding of the zzso zzso to its zzso the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso was detected in the activated T cells, but not in zzso or a panel of other breast cancer cell zzso This excludes an active role for zzso during zzso death and indicates that the zzso zzso is due to an zzso production of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso drastically reduced the sensitivity of the zzso to zzso during target zzso Thus, in tumor cell zzso zzso might play a major role in preventing T cell death by altering T cell zzso for zzso
