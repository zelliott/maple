In contrast to the zzso zzso zzso insulin stimulation caused a zzso zzso decrease in the zzso mobility of zzso zzso in both Chinese zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment and direct zzso acid analysis demonstrated that insulin zzso an increase in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso but not zzso zzso although the latter displayed a marked increase in zzso zzso To identify the responsible zzso pathway, we compared the effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso by insulin, zzso and zzso zzso agents that specifically activate the zzso zzso or both zzso zzso zzso and zzso shock both zzso a decrease in zzso zzso mobility, whereas zzso had no zzso Furthermore, expression of a zzso Ras zzso zzso prevented the zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the specific zzso inhibitor zzso and expression of a zzso zzso zzso partially inhibited both the insulin and zzso zzso reduction in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso completely prevented zzso zzso but did not inhibit the zzso zzso of zzso zzso These data demonstrate that insulin stimulates the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso through a zzso zzso
