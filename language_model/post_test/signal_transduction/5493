The nervous and immune systems consist of complex networks that have been known to be closely zzso However, given the complexity of the nervous and immune systems of zzso including humans, the precise mechanisms by which the two systems influence each other remain zzso To cut through this complexity, we used the zzso zzso zzso as a simple system to study the relationship between the immune and nervous systems using sophisticated genetic zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso in zzso coupled receptors zzso expressed in the nervous system exhibit zzso responses to pathogen zzso The use of different zzso different modes of infection and zzso zzso highlighted the importance of the zzso zzso in avoidance to certain pathogens and in the regulation of innate zzso The regulation of innate immunity was found to take place at least in part through a zzso protein zzso signaling zzso similar to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, the results that support the different roles of the zzso neural circuit in the regulation of zzso zzso responses to pathogen infection are zzso
