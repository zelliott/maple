Few zzso are available to predict prostate cancer zzso Single zzso zzso zzso tend to have weak individual effects but, in zzso they have stronger zzso zzso zzso pathways have been implicated in the zzso We used a candidate zzso approach to investigate 29 functional zzso in key genes from relevant zzso pathways in a sample of zzso men eligible for prostate zzso We used zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to develop a zzso genetic risk score by weighting each risk zzso zzso based on its association with zzso Seven common functional zzso were associated with overall and high-grade prostate cancer zzso whereas three zzso were associated with high zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso and/or zzso The addition of genetic zzso to age and zzso improved the zzso accuracy for overall and high-grade prostate cancer, using either the area under the zzso characteristics zzso zzso the net zzso improvement zzso and integrated discrimination improvement zzso zzso These results suggest that functional zzso in zzso pathways may act individually and zzso to affect risk and severity of prostate cancer, supporting the influence of zzso pathways in the zzso of prostate zzso Use of such zzso zzso genetic risk score can enhance the zzso value of zzso and age in zzso absolute risk, which supports further evaluation of its clinical zzso
