zzso zzso a member of the zzso cell zzso zzso factor family, and its implication in the zzso is not well understood but might be an interesting therapeutic target for degenerative zzso zzso zzso is lost in the chicken during evolution, its target, the zzso family zzso alpha 4 zzso is still expressed in a zzso and spatial pattern in the developing zzso We used this zzso to study the zzso and the effect of zzso zzso application and subsequent zzso zzso during retinal development in zzso without zzso of zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso chicken zzso of embryonic day 6, were treated with zzso and zzso zzso was zzso Additionally, zzso was added during zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso and Western zzso were performed to evaluate changes in zzso zzso and zzso zzso applied zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso and decreased zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso Most zzso early retinal proliferation was enhanced and zzso zzso expression was decreased whereas differentiation of major retinal cell types was not zzso In contrast to zzso zzso is exclusively influencing early zzso whereas differentiation is not zzso and seems to be regulated through zzso zzso Since the binding site of zzso and therefore the target of potential zzso is well zzso among species and is with high probability not able to bind other members of the zzso these results might be assigned to other species including zzso and zzso
