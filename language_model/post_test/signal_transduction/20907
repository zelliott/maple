The zzso family of cell surface zzso regulates cell zzso and growth factor signaling by binding components of the zzso zzso and growth zzso To date, all known zzso interactions are via the zzso attached zzso zzso To zzso for potential zzso interactions via the core proteins directly, the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso one of the four zzso family members, was tested as a zzso for the attachment of zzso zzso Human zzso zzso bind to mouse zzso and both mouse and chicken zzso can block this zzso with 50% zzso observed between zzso and 1 zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain of another zzso family member, zzso fails to compete for cell binding to mouse zzso zzso acids zzso of the zzso acid mouse zzso compete fully, suggesting that the cell binding domain is within this zzso The ability of zzso to interact with molecules at the cell surface via its core protein as well as its zzso chains may uniquely regulate the formation of cell surface signaling complexes following engagement of this zzso with its zzso zzso
