zzso 5 zzso a zzso produced by helper T cells, is involved in the regulation of growth and differentiation of B cells and other zzso zzso To zzso zzso zzso mechanisms, we have established zzso and zzso zzso early B cell lines, zzso and zzso respectively, and examined the effect of zzso on the expression of zzso during zzso zzso to zzso increases in the levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were observed in zzso cells, compared with those in zzso zzso Further, a role of zzso in the zzso expression during differentiation was examined by using zzso zzso zzso chronic leukemia zzso cells with growth zzso After zzso culture, the amount of zzso zzso from zzso cells was zzso 4-6 fold in the presence of zzso Although expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not change, only zzso zzso expression was elevated within 30 zzso of stimulation with zzso and reached a zzso level by 1 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso to the culture of zzso cells inhibited both the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the elevated expression of zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso signal may be associated with the zzso of zzso zzso
