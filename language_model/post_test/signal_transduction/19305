To observe the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso of stem and leaf on zzso metabolism and insulin signal zzso in the insulin resistant model of zzso 

The insulin resistant model of differentiated zzso zzso was established in zzso with free fatty zzso After induction of insulin resistance, cells were treated with zzso or zzso for 2 zzso The zzso consumption in culture fluid was detected by zzso zzso zzso the effects of zzso on the zzso induced by tumor necrosis factor zzso was observed using zzso and the zzso of signal proteins was detected by zzso 

The amount of zzso consumption zzso in the model group zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly lower than that in the normal control group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso it increased in the zzso treated group zzso zzso zzso and the groups treated with zzso middle- and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively), significantly higher than that in the model group zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso treatment, the concentration of free fatty acid zzso zzso zzso in culture medium was zzso zzso zzso predominantly higher than that in the control group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso while it was zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group, zzso zzso zzso in high-dose zzso group, zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso group, zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso group, all were lower than that in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso or P zzso zzso and a zzso tendency of zzso action was zzso The zzso zzso of insulin zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso of zzso were lower in the model group than in the control zzso they were zzso changed in the zzso zzso group, but did show significant difference in comparing with those in the zzso zzso zzso groups or zzso zzso 

zzso can accelerate the zzso zzso and zzso the zzso in zzso induced by zzso which may be correlated with its promoting insulin signal zzso and improving insulin resistance in zzso
