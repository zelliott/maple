Muscle cells were dispersed separately from circular and zzso muscle layers of guinea pig zzso and zzso zzso receptors were characterized in zzso cells and in cells in which one zzso type was preserved by selective zzso zzso In zzso cells from both regions, zzso caused contraction and zzso increases in zzso free calcium concentration zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso levels zzso p zzso zzso that were zzso respectively, by the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In circular muscle cells, where zzso increase in zzso is zzso by zzso release from zzso zzso stores, zzso caused an increase in zzso zzso levels that was inhibited by zzso In cells zzso contracted with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused relaxation when the zzso effect zzso by zzso receptors was blocked with zzso relaxation and the zzso increase in zzso were inhibited by zzso The singular contributions of the zzso and zzso signaling pathways were identified in cells where only one zzso type was zzso In cells with only zzso zzso zzso caused contraction and an increase in zzso but not in zzso zzso contraction and the increase in zzso were inhibited by zzso zzso in cells with only zzso zzso zzso caused relaxation and an increase in zzso levels but not in zzso relaxation and the increase in zzso levels were inhibited by zzso The two signaling pathways were functionally linked, zzso to regulate the level of zzso Thus, the increase in zzso was zzso 1) when zzso production was inhibited by zzso in zzso cells or 2) when zzso production was suppressed in cells where zzso receptors were zzso and only zzso receptors were zzso The results imply that the increase in zzso levels zzso by zzso receptors acted to zzso the increase in zzso zzso by zzso zzso We conclude that the response to zzso in muscle cells is a compound effect involving zzso of two zzso types coupled to distinct signaling pathways that zzso on zzso as the zzso of mechanical zzso
