zzso is an insulin zzso zzso used for the treatment of zzso in women with zzso zzso syndrome and insulin zzso It zzso the zzso zzso affecting the release of zzso hormone zzso and zzso hormone zzso However, zzso mechanism of action in zzso zzso cells remains zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is involved in zzso action in various cell zzso Here, we investigated the effects of zzso on zzso zzso in response to zzso and zzso in primary rat zzso cells zzso and studied zzso in rat zzso In zzso zzso (10 zzso reduced zzso and zzso hormone zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso M, 3 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression induced by zzso zzso M, 12 or 24 zzso The different zzso of zzso are expressed in zzso In particular, zzso is detected mainly in zzso and zzso is less abundant in zzso and zzso and is zzso in zzso In zzso zzso increased zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor compound C abolished the effects of zzso on zzso release induced by zzso and on zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced by zzso The zzso production of dominant negative zzso abolished the effects of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced by zzso and on the zzso zzso induced by zzso Thus, in rat zzso cells, zzso decreases zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced by zzso and zzso release, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced by zzso through zzso zzso
