zzso and zzso are closely zzso small zzso that are clearly involved in breast cancer zzso Nonetheless, their specific roles in the control of zzso zzso alpha zzso activities have not been zzso 

We used zzso sequences to specifically zzso zzso and zzso expression in zzso breast zzso zzso zzso We then analyzed the consequences of zzso on zzso zzso zzso recruitment to the promoters of four target zzso and the zzso levels of those zzso 

We demonstrated that zzso and zzso clearly and similarly modulated zzso recruitment to the zzso zzso responsive element zzso present in a zzso reporter gene and to the promoters of zzso zzso zzso zzso D, and zzso zzso Besides, zzso zzso the zzso reporter gene activity and zzso zzso expression and tended to zzso zzso D and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had no significant effect at the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and to a lesser extent zzso zzso increased zzso zzso No zzso in zzso zzso levels was observed, suggesting potential zzso zzso 

Taken together, our results strongly suggest that zzso and zzso play different, but clear, roles in zzso zzso These zzso are definitely involved, along with zzso in zzso recruitment and, to some extent, zzso zzso zzso We zzso a differential role of zzso in breast cancer tumors that depend on hormone zzso
