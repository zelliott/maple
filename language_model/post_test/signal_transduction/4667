Growth factors regulated by specific zzso have been shown to promote aging and accelerate mortality in the majority of the organisms zzso In particular, the zzso activated by growth hormone, insulin, and zzso growth zzso in zzso and their zzso in simple model organisms represent perhaps the zzso proteins involved in the aging zzso zzso zzso which reduces the level of zzso growth zzso and of other growth factors, has been associated with protection from diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases, and deficiencies in growth hormone signaling and zzso growth zzso are strongly associated with protection from cancer and diabetes in both mice and zzso however, their role in cardiac function and cardiovascular diseases is zzso Here, we review the link between growth factors, cardiac function, and heart disease with focus on the zzso and zzso effect of growth factors in both model organisms and zzso
