zzso zzso protein zzso a major zzso in type 1 diabetes, is a zzso zzso protein associated with the membrane of zzso zzso of neural and zzso zzso Loss of zzso activity in the mouse results in reduced insulin release and additional zzso consistent with a general effect on zzso and hormone zzso To gain further insight into the cellular mechanisms of zzso function, we have studied the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso Using two independent putative zzso zzso of zzso we demonstrate that animals lacking zzso activity are viable and exhibit subtle zzso zzso studies of zzso in zzso and several genes involved in zzso zzso cargo release and signaling highlight two roles for zzso First, zzso has a specific and novel genetic interaction with zzso a protein that has been shown in other systems to regulate zzso zzso cargo zzso Second, loss of zzso activity enhances weak zzso in the zzso signaling zzso These results suggest that zzso may be an important factor in zzso zzso cargo release with parallels to insulin signaling in zzso
