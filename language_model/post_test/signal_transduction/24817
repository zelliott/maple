In zzso zzso zzso growth factors zzso and zzso zzso of bone zzso protein zzso zzso have been implicated in neural zzso The precise roles, if any, that these factors play in neural induction in zzso remains to be zzso 

To monitor the initial steps of neural induction in the chick zzso we developed an in zzso zzso of neural differentiation in zzso zzso Using this zzso we found evidence that neural cell fate is specified in zzso before the generation of the primitive streak or zzso zzso Early zzso cells expressed both zzso and zzso but the expression of both genes was zzso as cells acquired neural zzso During zzso and zzso zzso exposure of zzso cells to zzso activity in zzso was sufficient to block the acquisition of neural fate and to promote the generation of zzso zzso zzso was also found to be expressed in the early zzso and ongoing zzso zzso in zzso cells was required for acquisition of neural fate and for the suppression of zzso and zzso zzso 

The onset of neural differentiation in the chick zzso occurs in zzso before the generation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are each expressed in prospective neural cells, and zzso zzso appears to be required for the repression of zzso expression and for the acquisition of neural zzso zzso exposure of zzso cells to zzso however, can prevent the generation of neural tissue and induce cells of zzso zzso
