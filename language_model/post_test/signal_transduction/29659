zzso zzso zzso zzso have been implicated in regulating the zzso activities of zzso zzso molecules including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso consists of a protein core to which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chains are zzso The formation of HS zzso chains is zzso by zzso zzso by members of the zzso family of putative tumor zzso linked to zzso multiple zzso Previous studies in zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso the zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso However, the functions of other zzso family members are zzso We have identified and isolated the other two members of the zzso zzso family zzso which are named sister of zzso zzso and brother of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso 3 zzso zzso We show that both zzso and zzso zzso activities, as well as their zzso zzso are defective in cells zzso for zzso zzso or zzso in the wing zzso Surprisingly, although zzso zzso distribution is abnormal in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is only defective in zzso zzso or zzso double zzso and not in zzso nor zzso alone, suggesting that zzso and zzso are redundant in zzso zzso We demonstrate further that zzso and zzso form a complex and are zzso in zzso Our results, along with previous studies on zzso provide evidence that all three zzso zzso proteins are required for the zzso of zzso and for the zzso formation of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results also suggest that zzso have two distinct roles in zzso zzso distribution and zzso
