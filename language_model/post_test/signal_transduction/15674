The zzso features of chronic zzso pulmonary disease in man include zzso and chronic zzso associated with zzso zzso These zzso can be induced in mice by a single zzso zzso of zzso zzso a zzso and zzso agent for zzso The mechanisms underlying excessive zzso production and, in particular, zzso cell zzso in chronic zzso pulmonary disease remain poorly zzso The zzso receptors zzso are widely recognized for their zzso properties during zzso In this study, we examined whether zzso contributes to inflammation and lung damage induced by zzso by comparing the response of zzso zzso mice with that of zzso zzso zzso Mice were killed at various time points after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice developed zzso and zzso cell zzso The onset of pulmonary zzso was preceded by an increase in zzso zzso in zzso airways and zzso zzso This was followed by a decrease in zzso zzso and by an increase in zzso zzso on the zzso surface of airway zzso zzso In zzso mice, zzso administration induced similar responses in terms of inflammation and zzso but these mice were protected from the development of zzso cell zzso The involvement of zzso in airway zzso cell zzso was confirmed by demonstrating that zzso zzso of the selective zzso zzso zzso induced zzso cell zzso in the airways of zzso mice zzso These data suggest that zzso and zzso cell zzso occur zzso and that zzso signaling through zzso stimulation may play an important role in inducing zzso cell zzso
