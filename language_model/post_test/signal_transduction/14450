A newly emerging family of zzso that are members of the zzso zzso zzso contains the zzso motif zzso A member of this zzso zzso family known as zzso was recently shown to be a potential regulator of neural tube development in zzso zzso zzso Chan zzso zzso M (2002) zzso zzso Res zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that human zzso and the zzso protein zzso perform similar functions in zzso cells and zzso cells, zzso In addition to similarity in primary zzso zzso and zzso possess similar zzso and show similar zzso preferences, and both zzso to the nuclear zzso Additionally, we show that human zzso can rescue the zzso nuclear envelope zzso of zzso zzso cells, functionally replacing zzso Finally, zzso has been shown to zzso the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso J, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso S (2005) zzso J zzso and we show that zzso zzso the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso we propose that zzso zzso in a unique zzso cascade regulating nuclear membrane zzso and that this cascade is zzso from zzso to zzso
