To examine whether zzso zzso lung inflammation and improves survival during zzso and to determine whether the beneficial effects of zzso are associated with zzso of the nuclear factor zzso zzso 

Prospective laboratory zzso 

University zzso 

Male zzso rats zzso zzso zzso 

To induce zzso in rats, zzso zzso coli, zzso at a dosage of 10 zzso was injected into a tail vein and 10 zzso later, vehicle, a low dose of zzso zzso zzso or a high dose of zzso zzso zzso was administered once through an zzso tube, zzso 

We observed the survival of the subjects for 72 zzso At 6 zzso zzso we zzso animals and measured zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and inhibitor zzso expressions, nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, tumor necrosis zzso and zzso gene expressions and zzso damages in lung zzso We also measured zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso and zzso levels in lung zzso High dose of zzso suppressed zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene expressions in lung zzso reduced zzso lung damages, and improved survival in zzso zzso Furthermore, it increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels and decreased zzso level in lung zzso 

High dose of zzso attenuated lung zzso reduced zzso lung damages, and improved survival during zzso in zzso These therapeutic benefits were associated with zzso of the zzso zzso
