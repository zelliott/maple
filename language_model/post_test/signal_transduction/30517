Although the zzso role of the zzso zzso is well zzso it remains unclear how this zzso is zzso activated in lung zzso We found that zzso zzso a member of zzso family of zzso antagonists, is frequently zzso in lung cancer and plays a role in suppressing lung cancer cell growth through zzso of zzso factor zzso zzso zzso is the only zzso family member abundantly expressed in normal zzso but silenced by promoter zzso in a large fraction of lung cancer cell lines and lung zzso zzso of zzso was correlated with tumor progression and expression of nuclear zzso in lung zzso zzso expression of zzso in lung cancer cells with zzso zzso induced zzso and inhibited zzso activity as well as nuclear zzso of zzso and expression of zzso targets zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, small interference zzso knock down of zzso in cells lacking zzso zzso was sufficient to promote cell zzso zzso nuclear zzso and expression of zzso These observations suggested that zzso zzso of zzso activates the zzso pathway, thereby promoting the growth of lung cancer zzso
