The zzso mechanism of zzso was studied by molecular dynamics zzso simulations of the zzso inactive structure in an explicit membrane zzso The simulations were employed to calculate zzso correlations of the fluctuating interaction energy of zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso was used to determine a network that couples retinal to the zzso zzso where zzso zzso Two highly zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to have strong interaction correlation with zzso MD simulations with restraints on each zzso zzso indicated that the major zzso zzso involves the zzso side chains of zzso VI and zzso The functional roles of specific zzso were zzso by the calculated effect of retinal zzso from zzso to zzso on the zzso interaction zzso It is suggested that zzso may act as a zzso zzso and that zzso may introduce a threshold to prevent background noise from zzso zzso
