zzso class I zzso have been implicated in the process of acute and chronic rejection because these zzso can bind to zzso cells and zzso signals leading to the zzso of cell survival and proliferation zzso To characterize the role of the zzso class zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso we developed a mouse zzso zzso cardiac zzso model in which zzso zzso hosts zzso received a fully zzso zzso zzso heart transplant and were passively zzso with zzso zzso class I zzso We demonstrate that cardiac zzso of mice treated with zzso class I zzso show characteristic features of zzso rejection including zzso changes accompanied by zzso zzso zzso analysis of signaling molecules involved in the zzso class I cell proliferation and survival pathways were elevated in zzso zzso mice compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were used to dissect the class zzso zzso in zzso Treatment with zzso zzso was highly correlated with the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso When measuring distance as a marker of zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a close association between members of the zzso target of zzso zzso including zzso target of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results provide the first analysis of the zzso between these signaling molecules in zzso that reflects our knowledge of the signaling zzso derived from in zzso zzso
