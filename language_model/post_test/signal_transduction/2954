zzso syndrome, which is characterized by defects in the central nervous system, eyes and zzso is caused by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The mechanisms by which loss of zzso leads to the zzso manifestations of zzso syndrome are currently zzso in part, zzso to the lack of an animal model that zzso the disease zzso Here, we describe a zzso model for zzso syndrome using stable and transient suppression of zzso zzso zzso of zzso which is enriched in the brain, leads to neurological defects similar to those reported in zzso syndrome patients, namely increased zzso to zzso zzso and zzso brain zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso is reduced and there is both increased zzso and reduced zzso most zzso in the neural zzso zzso experiments indicate that zzso activity and binding to the zzso coat protein zzso are essential for zzso function in these zzso Our results indicate a novel role for zzso in neural development, and support a model zzso zzso of zzso metabolism and zzso membrane traffic leads to the neurological symptoms of zzso zzso
