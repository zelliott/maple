zzso of zzso barrier function is implicated in many vascular and inflammatory zzso One prevalent mechanism of zzso dysfunction is an increase in zzso oxygen species under zzso zzso Previous reports have demonstrated that hydrogen zzso zzso a highly stable zzso oxygen species that zzso zzso signaling zzso also enhances zzso zzso but the mechanism of this effect is zzso Here, we identify the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a key zzso of the zzso zzso change in bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso treatment alter the architecture of the zzso zzso in zzso cells, and zzso zzso the zzso and zzso of zzso from the cell membrane to the zzso Using pharmacological zzso and small interference zzso zzso directed against specific zzso we uncover a signaling cascade from zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso that is triggered by zzso and leads to zzso zzso Our findings establish a distinct role for zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso change in zzso cells, and suggest potential new therapeutic targets for the treatment of disorders involving zzso stress and altered zzso zzso
