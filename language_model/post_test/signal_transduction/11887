Metals are a threat to human health by increasing disease zzso Experimental data have linked altered zzso expression with exposure to some zzso zzso comprise a large family of zzso zzso molecules that primarily function to zzso regulate gene expression zzso Although several human populations are exposed to low zzso of zzso zzso and zzso as a mixture, most zzso research focuses on the individual effects that these metals zzso Thus, this study aims to evaluate global zzso and zzso expression changes induced by a metal mixture containing zzso zzso zzso and to predict possible zzso disease development under these zzso Our results show that this metal mixture results in a zzso expression profile that may be responsible for the zzso expression changes observed under experimental conditions in which coding proteins are involved in cellular zzso including cell death, growth and proliferation related to the zzso inflammatory response and zzso
