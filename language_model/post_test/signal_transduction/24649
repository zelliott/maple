We describe the isolation of zzso clones zzso type 1 zzso protein zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso form a zzso family in zzso Within their most zzso domain, these zzso are zzso identical at the zzso acid zzso One zzso zzso was found to zzso a protein that shows zzso sequence identity to zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso transcripts were detected in leaves, zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, distinct species of zzso transcripts accumulated at different stages of zzso zzso development, and mature zzso zzso contained a unique zzso zzso species not found at other stages of the plant's life zzso Lastly, we show by zzso Southern blots that the zzso zzso might contain zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
