zzso is a cell zzso zzso that zzso zzso to the zzso walls of zzso during inflammation and enables them to roll under the force of blood zzso zzso of zzso during rolling is thought to promote zzso signals that lead to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso ultimately contributing to zzso zzso Several studies have underscored the importance of the zzso zzso tail in functionally regulating zzso and zzso Interestingly, the zzso tail comprises only 17 zzso zzso and yet it is thought to bind simultaneously to several zzso For example, zzso association of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso resistance to zzso and zzso zzso zzso In this report we found that zzso zzso zzso and zzso bound zzso to the same tail of zzso Furthermore, molecular modeling supported the possibility that zzso zzso and zzso could form a zzso zzso Finally, using zzso lifetime imaging zzso to measure zzso resonance energy transfer, it was shown that zzso zzso and zzso could interact simultaneously in zzso Moreover, zzso zzso promoted zzso interaction in zzso zzso derived from neighboring zzso zzso These results highlight a novel zzso event that occurs as a consequence of zzso zzso which could participate in zzso signals that promote the transition from rolling to zzso
