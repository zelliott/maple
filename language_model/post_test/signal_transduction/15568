The zzso trafficking of receptors provides a way to control the overall sensitivity of a cell to zzso zzso These sorting pathways are also used to shape the balance of signals that are generated in response to zzso zzso The major zzso growth factor zzso is zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso activates a very similar set of zzso pathways to other zzso zzso zzso zzso however, its zzso trafficking is very zzso Furthermore, zzso can form a complex with a range of different zzso regulators that in turn regulate the trafficking of zzso through the zzso zzso This regulated trafficking of zzso has important consequences for zzso zzso and is a clear demonstration of how the zzso zzso plays a critical role in connecting zzso zzso pathways to cellular zzso
