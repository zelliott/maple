In addition to zzso zzso and proliferation of zzso cells during zzso development are controlled by a number of zzso factors including growth differentiation zzso zzso bone zzso zzso zzso and zzso The objective of this study was to determine the effect of zzso and zzso and their interaction with zzso and zzso on zzso zzso cell function in zzso zzso cells from small zzso zzso and large zzso zzso zzso were collected from bovine zzso and cultured for 48 h in medium containing zzso fetal calf serum and then treated with various hormones in zzso medium for an additional 48 zzso We evaluated the effects of zzso zzso zzso and zzso (30 zzso during a zzso exposure on zzso zzso and cell zzso In zzso plus zzso zzso cells obtained from small zzso 300 zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso production by zzso and 600 zzso zzso completely blocked zzso zzso zzso the zzso increase in zzso zzso In comparison, 300 and 600 zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso production by zzso and zzso respectively, whereas 150 zzso zzso was without effect zzso zzso zzso Treatment with 600 zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso numbers (by zzso of zzso cells from small zzso In the same cells treated with zzso but not zzso zzso with 600 zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso production (by zzso increased zzso zzso zzso cell numbers (by zzso and had no effect zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso In zzso plus zzso zzso cells obtained from large zzso zzso caused a zzso decrease zzso in zzso zzso (by zzso and zzso (by zzso zzso In contrast, zzso increased zzso and zzso zzso cell numbers by over zzso Furthermore, treatment with zzso also inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso but had no effect on cell zzso To zzso downstream signaling zzso zzso cells from small zzso were zzso with similar to mothers against zzso zzso binding element zzso or zzso response element zzso reporter zzso Treatment with zzso (but not zzso activated the zzso zzso promoter activity, whereas zzso (but not zzso activated the zzso zzso promoter zzso We have concluded that bovine zzso cells are targets of both zzso and zzso and that zzso zzso may simultaneously promote zzso cell proliferation and prevent premature differentiation of the zzso cells during growth of zzso whereas zzso zzso may also prevent premature zzso zzso
