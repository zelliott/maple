zzso cell proliferation must be carefully balanced with the transition to zzso zzso stem zzso to control zzso Here, we show that loss of the zzso zzso zzso (the zzso of zzso zzso zzso results in both excess proliferation and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in a zzso of zzso zzso zzso that extend processes that zzso the zzso suggesting that zzso cells communicate with the zzso We provide evidence that zzso zzso express zzso a transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso that triggers zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso to promote zzso proliferation and zzso zzso Further, our experiments suggest that zzso ensures both a correct zzso architecture and the zzso control of zzso protein synthesis via direct binding to zzso 3' zzso Together, these results establish zzso cues as key regulatory elements in the control of zzso cell proliferation and the zzso zzso
