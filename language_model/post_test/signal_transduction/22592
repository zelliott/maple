The zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is zzso from the cell surface via zzso zzso However, the zzso domain of zzso zzso does not contain a previously characterized zzso zzso A zzso zzso protein zzso consisting of the zzso tail, zzso zzso domain, and 12 zzso of the zzso of zzso joined to the zzso protein zzso zzso is zzso indicating that the zzso region of zzso contains an zzso zzso Although zzso zzso is zzso at a rate similar to that of influenza virus zzso zzso zzso zzso which contains a zzso zzso signal in its zzso tail, the elimination of the majority of the zzso zzso tail, or substitution of the zzso TM domain with zzso zzso did not affect the rate of zzso zzso The zzso protein of the closely related virus, zzso disease virus zzso is not zzso from the cell zzso Working under the usual convention that the TM domain consists of the zzso zzso bounded by two charged zzso analysis of zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso molecules indicates that the first seven zzso zzso zzso zzso are critical for zzso of zzso A zzso acid zzso zzso that zzso this zzso zzso TM zzso boundary is important for zzso zzso zzso
