The zzso zzso domain of human zzso interacts with the human zzso protein zzso recognizing a zzso fragment, zzso zzso at zzso Here we show that zzso binding requires sequential zzso by two zzso zzso and zzso yielding zzso zzso and zzso We have determined the solution structure of zzso in complex with the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealing not only local recognition of zzso but also the extension of the zzso of the zzso domain by the addition of a zzso of zzso The structure of an zzso domain in complex with a biologically relevant binding partner provides insights into zzso specificity and potentially links the cancer marker protein zzso to a signaling zzso associated with cell fate zzso
