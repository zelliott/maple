The zzso protein plays an essential role in the transforming growth zzso zzso signaling zzso This zzso mediates growth zzso signals from the cell surface to the zzso Although zzso protein is significantly zzso in human zzso there is no definitive evidence implicating zzso as a zzso zzso Here we show that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso form of zzso found in zzso and lung zzso did not abolish the zzso growth arrest, suggesting that resistance to the zzso effects of zzso exhibited by human tumors cannot be linked to the zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso cellular invasion, and this effect was enhanced by zzso A similar invasive zzso was obtained in cells expressing another zzso zzso in zzso zzso found in zzso zzso These findings indicate that genetic defects in zzso are sufficient to zzso the zzso effect of zzso and reveal that zzso acts through zzso to induce cellular invasion by a novel mechanism that is independent of zzso zzso by the activated zzso type I zzso
