The signal zzso zzso or pathways linking zzso signals to zzso are poorly zzso Upon zzso withdrawal from zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso activity and was sufficient to relieve the zzso effects of zzso on zzso gene zzso Later during zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso during differentiation prevented zzso formation despite appropriate expression of zzso heavy zzso This indicates that zzso gene expression is necessary but not sufficient to commit differentiated zzso to zzso and suggests a function for the zzso during the early and late stages of skeletal muscle zzso
