Bone zzso proteins zzso regulate zzso zzso patterning across the animal zzso however, the zzso properties of certain zzso components can vary according to zzso zzso zzso For example, zzso zzso zzso cleave zzso zzso proteins called zzso zzso while the zzso zzso zzso Short zzso zzso is only zzso efficiently when bound to zzso We identified zzso characteristics responsible for making its zzso dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso that are processed independently of zzso changed the steep zzso zzso found in zzso zzso to a zzso profile, analogous to that observed in some zzso zzso This change ultimately affected cell fate allocation and tissue size and resulted in increased zzso of zzso Thus, the acquisition of zzso zzso processing during evolution appears to facilitate long-range zzso diffusion and formation of a robust zzso zzso enabling the zzso zzso signaling zzso required for early zzso zzso
