In zzso trunk visceral zzso a zzso of zzso zzso gives rise to circular visceral zzso It has been demonstrated that the trunk visceral zzso zzso is subdivided into at least two zzso by zzso zzso which is regulated by zzso and zzso emanating from the zzso We now extend these findings by examining a greater number of visceral zzso zzso including zzso and zzso Each visceral zzso zzso appears to be divided into five or six regions, based on differences in expression patterns of these zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso regulate the expression of these zzso targets in trunk visceral zzso zzso expression in trunk visceral zzso is responsible for maintaining its own expression and zzso zzso zzso expressed in visceral zzso zzso 3 may also be required for normal zzso expression in this region and normal gastric zzso zzso zzso expressed in each trunk visceral zzso zzso serves as a guide for the initial budding of zzso visceral zzso The zzso pattern of trunk visceral zzso organized in response to zzso zzso signals, is thus maintained at a later time via zzso is required for zzso zzso and exerts feedback effect on zzso zzso zzso
