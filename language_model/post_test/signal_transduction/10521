zzso zzso zzso zzso the reductive zzso of zzso to form zzso a reaction that is essential for maintenance of zzso pools during cell zzso Because the zzso is indispensable for DNA replication in actively dividing cells, it is an important target for zzso drugs used in cancer chemotherapy, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These drugs generate zzso that bind to the zzso active site and inhibit zzso activity, leading to zzso deprivation and cellular zzso zzso binding to zzso results in stabilization of the zzso and an increase in its zzso zzso Previously, we showed that degradation of the zzso zzso is carried out by the 26 S zzso in a zzso zzso Such degradation is directed by the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso and is zzso by zzso zzso In the present study, we have verified the zzso nature of zzso zzso by showing that a zzso zzso in which all zzso zzso were replaced by zzso is still subject to zzso zzso In addition, we have mapped the structural zzso of zzso zzso degradation in more detail and show that zzso at the zzso end of the zzso particularly the penultimate zzso acid zzso play an important role in governing the zzso of the zzso This region is capable on its own of zzso an zzso distinct zzso zzso that normally lacks this domain, indicating that it functions as a degradation zzso Interestingly, degradation of an zzso unstable zzso form of zzso containing a zzso substitution at zzso zzso is directed by zzso rather than zzso zzso The implications of these findings for the control of zzso zzso and for the regulation of protein degradation in general, are zzso
