zzso responsible for zzso effects on zzso axis activity are not fully zzso Previously we reported that zzso suppressed only zzso but not the zzso zzso release from rat anterior zzso (AP) cells in zzso Since the zzso effect of zzso was exerted only in zzso cells, potential zzso impact on zzso zzso signaling could not be zzso In this study the effect of zzso on zzso synthesis in zzso and zzso rat zzso cells was zzso 

In the first experiment 5 zzso 105 zzso were incubated for zzso with zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso (10 zzso zzso In the second experiment cells were zzso for zzso with zzso zzso zzso then for 30 zzso with 10 zzso zzso and finally for zzso with zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso (1 zzso 10 zzso zzso concentration was measured by zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso diminished zzso zzso release without affecting zzso zzso release at any dose zzso Moreover, zzso increase of zzso zzso occurred in both zzso and zzso cells and intensity of cellular response was similar in both zzso 

zzso affects zzso zzso activity through its zzso effect on zzso synthesis in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso release from zzso cells appears to be the result of still zzso cellular zzso
