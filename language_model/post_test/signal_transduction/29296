zzso zzso is maintained by stem cell capacity within zzso zzso zzso Here, using a combination of surface zzso we describe a zzso method for zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that this population is composed of zzso cells and exhibits zzso and the side population zzso fulfilling general stem cell zzso We then applied this method to analyze zzso zzso and stem cell activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso shows progressive depletion of zzso zzso accompanied by zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso was observed in zzso and in zzso zzso of DNA damage and zzso of the zzso zzso were observed in zzso zzso zzso Moreover, suppression of zzso in an zzso background restored transplantation ability of zzso zzso indicating that zzso plays an essential role in maintenance of zzso zzso and their stem cell capacity by suppressing DNA zzso zzso zzso
