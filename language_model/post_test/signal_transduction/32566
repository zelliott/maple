zzso zzso junctions zzso comprised of the zzso zzso system, contribute to cell shape changes and cell movements in zzso zzso However, little is known about the dynamic features of zzso in cells of the developing zzso In this study, we constructed zzso fused with a green fluorescent protein zzso and found that it targeted zzso located zzso contacts but not other lateral contacts in zzso cells of living zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we examined the dynamic performance of zzso containing zzso in zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso of stage 11 zzso concentration and zzso of zzso occurred zzso with changes in length of zzso zzso In the lateral zzso of zzso at the same stage, dynamic zzso of zzso was concerted with division and zzso of sensory organ precursor zzso zzso Moreover, changes in patterns of zzso networks during zzso extension could be zzso Finally, we zzso zzso to precisely observe the defects in zzso fusion in shotgun zzso Thus, the zzso fusion protein is a helpful tool to simultaneously observe zzso movements and zzso dynamics at high zzso zzso
