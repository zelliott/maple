A zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts in a zzso manner with the hinge domain of zzso and enhances its zzso zzso In this study we demonstrate that zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However the mechanism by which zzso interacts with zzso is different from that of zzso Specifically, it was determined that the zzso zzso of zzso interacts in a zzso manner with the zzso hinge zzso In addition, an zzso motif within the zzso zzso of zzso was shown to interact in an zzso manner with the zzso domain within the zzso zzso of zzso The ability of zzso to associate with and zzso the zzso activity of an zzso zzso that is unable to interact with the zzso class of zzso suggests that this zzso may have a unique role in zzso zzso It is concluded from these studies that zzso is a bona fide zzso zzso which may serve as a convergence point between zzso and zzso zzso
