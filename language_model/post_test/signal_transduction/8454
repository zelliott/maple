The ability of cells to migrate zzso in zzso of zzso is a fundamental biological response that is essential for the survival of the social zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso is the most potent zzso and the zzso zzso and degradation of zzso is exquisitely zzso Interestingly, as zzso cells migrate zzso they do so in a zzso fashion, forming characteristic zzso This group behavior is acquired through the relay of the zzso signals to neighboring zzso This chapter describes experimental procedures used to obtain synchronized populations of zzso competent cells and to assess their streaming zzso In addition, we provide a detailed account of the method used to measure the ability of zzso to directly stimulate zzso zzso zzso Together, these techniques provide a way to combine cell biological and zzso approaches to the study of signal zzso
