zzso disease zzso is an zzso dominant neurodegenerative disorder typically affecting individuals in zzso HD is characterized by the selective loss of zzso zzso zzso while large zzso zzso are zzso An impaired zzso complex II zzso zzso zzso activity is known as a prominent zzso zzso in zzso zzso chronic treatment with zzso acid zzso an irreversible zzso zzso mimics motor abnormalities and pathology of HD in several animal zzso We have previously shown that in zzso application of zzso zzso a long-term zzso zzso of zzso synaptic transmission through zzso zzso zzso Since this zzso zzso zzso is shown by zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso it might play a role in the regional and cell zzso zzso death observed in zzso Here we investigate the role of group I zzso zzso receptors zzso in the induction of zzso We report that selectively blocking zzso but not zzso suppresses zzso zzso Moreover, we show that a zzso mechanism is involved in the formation of zzso zzso the cellular mechanisms underlying zzso may provide new insights to better understand the processes leading to the selective zzso loss observed in zzso
