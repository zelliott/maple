zzso is a zzso zzso factor that plays a role in regulating zzso function in zzso lung zzso To further understand the role of zzso in the zzso divergence and function of human lung zzso zzso we investigated the effect of zzso and zzso zzso activity on zzso of zzso differentiation and zzso including expression of zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso and zzso molecules zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso We identified a population of zzso from usual zzso pneumonia zzso pulmonary zzso zzso lungs characterized by zzso zzso zzso lower proliferation rates, and diminished expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared with control zzso zzso of zzso lung biopsy specimens demonstrated that zzso zzso was not present in zzso zzso zzso but was observed in the zzso of cells located in the areas of dense zzso zzso zzso in zzso did not significantly influence zzso or transforming growth factor zzso collagen I expression but inhibited expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling diminished resistance of zzso zzso to zzso zzso and responsiveness to transforming growth factor zzso but increased zzso zzso and restored zzso zzso expression in zzso via an zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso regulates several pathways in human zzso associated with normal wound healing, whereas zzso zzso signaling plays a critical role in zzso zzso
