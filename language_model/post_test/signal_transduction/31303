The manipulation of organisms using combinations of gene zzso zzso and drug interaction experiments can be used to reveal regulatory interactions between zzso Several zzso have been proposed that try to reconstruct the underlying regulatory networks from gene expression data sets arising from such zzso Often these approaches assume that each gene has approximately the same number of interactions within the network, and the methods rely on prior knowledge, or the zzso best guess, of the average network zzso Recent evidence points to zzso properties in biological networks, however, where network connectivity follows a zzso zzso For zzso networks, the average number of regulatory interactions per gene does not zzso zzso the zzso With this in mind, a new reverse engineering approach is introduced that does not require prior knowledge of network connectivity and its performance is compared with other published zzso using simulated gene expression data with biologically relevant network zzso Because this new approach does not make any assumptions about the distribution of network connections, it is suitable for application to zzso zzso
