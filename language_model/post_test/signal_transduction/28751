Introduced more than 100 years ago, zzso therapy is still the most important systemic therapy for all stages of zzso zzso zzso -positive breast zzso A major clinical problem limiting the usefulness of this therapy is tumor resistance, either de zzso or acquired during the course of the zzso Relatively new discoveries emphasize the complexity of zzso signaling and its multiple regulatory interactions with growth factor and other zzso signaling zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities contribute to this intimate zzso which is probably a fundamental factor in zzso zzso New targeted therapies, especially against the zzso growth factor zzso pathway, should be carefully evaluated in more zzso strategies to enable them to be exploited zzso A strategy of combining zzso therapy zzso zzso with these zzso to circumvent de zzso and acquired resistance, will be zzso We will also emphasize open questions and future challenges in the dynamic research field of molecular zzso biology from the zzso therapy zzso
