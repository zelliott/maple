Under hypoxic conditions, zzso can represent a threat to the cell because of their capacity to generate toxic zzso oxygen species zzso However, zzso are equipped with an zzso zzso that involves zzso zzso oxygen sensors and zzso factors zzso which zzso a tightly regulated zzso to keep zzso zzso activity under zzso The aim of this review is to provide an update on the pathways leading to zzso zzso which occurs in the zzso during zzso with particular emphasis on those induced by zzso zzso We start by studying the mechanisms of zzso damage during zzso and upon zzso highlighting the importance of the formation of the zzso zzso transition pore during zzso and its consequences for zzso zzso Next, we zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso and its important consequences for zzso zzso as well as the phenomenon known as the zzso zzso zzso we examine the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso zzso in particular, on those that involve the zzso pathway, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso generation, and zzso oxide zzso Finally, the role of the zzso zzso proteins in zzso tolerance is zzso
