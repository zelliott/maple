The activity of zzso pathways is critical to the inflammatory and immune responses that are associated with the progression of zzso Yet, the signals that regulate these pathways are poorly zzso Here, we address whether the innate immune signals of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso 2 affect zzso metabolism in zzso 

Analysis of human carotid plaques revealed that zzso was abundantly expressed at both zzso and protein levels by zzso cells and zzso zzso of zzso in ex zzso carotid plaques by zzso zzso an zzso zzso of zzso led to release of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso E zzso and to zzso of zzso zzso was zzso with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso was dependent on zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and was zzso by zzso and tumor necrosis zzso Selective zzso analysis of the zzso released by the carotid plaques characterized the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso as the zzso zzso that were produced by the zzso zzso in the absence of additional zzso Unlike the zzso zzso pathway, zzso activity of the zzso pathways was not altered on the short-term zzso of zzso in carotid zzso 

These results suggest that zzso may involve enhanced zzso innate zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso zzso such as zzso predominate the zzso synthesis and metabolism of zzso in zzso zzso These findings provide new insights into the regulation of zzso in zzso
