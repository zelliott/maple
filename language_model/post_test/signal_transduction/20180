zzso is generally resistant to chemotherapy, which may be related to defects in death zzso signaling and to defects in induction of zzso zzso family zzso factors induce the expression of death zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso resulting in zzso We therefore investigated whether a triple zzso form of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso can enhance zzso zzso in melanoma zzso Two melanoma cells zzso or zzso were tested for their sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso was assessed for its capability to induce zzso of the zzso zzso the role of zzso in the zzso zzso death was also assessed in zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso was also evaluated in a mouse melanoma zzso zzso We found that zzso melanoma cells were more resistant to zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso than zzso melanoma zzso zzso expression of zzso in melanoma cells zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso levels, and significantly increased zzso cell death in both cells zzso this induced cell death was partially blocked by a zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of subcutaneous melanoma zzso in mice resulted in approximately zzso decrease in tumor size compared with zzso These data indicate that zzso of zzso can induce the zzso zzso in melanoma zzso zzso therefore might represent a promising zzso for melanoma zzso
