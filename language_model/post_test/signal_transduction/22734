The increasing knowledge of the zzso mechanisms involved in cancer cell growth has enabled the zzso of mechanism based drug design approaches rather than the more conventional zzso zzso Drugs that interfere with cellular signal zzso pathways are currently a major focus in development of newer therapeutic technologies in zzso The therapeutic utility of potent and selective zzso zzso zzso in zzso applications has become widely recognized for several years, however targeting zzso receptors as a molecular target driven approach has only recently been zzso This review presents the hypothesis of the zzso receptors as a viable molecular target for medicinal chemical intervention in tumor biology, followed by an overview of the zzso studies which culminated in the advancement of the first potent zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and the orally active zzso zzso zzso zzso into clinical zzso
