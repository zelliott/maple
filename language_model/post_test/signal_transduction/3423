The zzso inhibitor zzso had been shown to prevent zzso induction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso zzso degradation of zzso factors plays an important role in the regulation of gene zzso The deletion of the gene zzso the zzso protein zzso had been reported to stabilize the zzso zzso zzso under inducing conditions and to lead to defects in zzso zzso suggesting that recycling of zzso is required for its zzso zzso however, it was argued that zzso remains zzso bound to the zzso under inducing conditions, suggesting that zzso turnover of zzso might not be required for its zzso We have performed an zzso zzso of zzso and isolated a zzso zzso zzso zzso We have used it for an unbiased zzso screen and identified the inhibitor zzso as a zzso of the zzso defects of the zzso zzso indicating that the protein degradation of the inhibitor zzso and not of the zzso zzso is required for zzso induction of the zzso zzso We also show that in the absence of zzso zzso is not required for zzso function, strongly supporting this zzso Furthermore, we have found that zzso controls the zzso protein degradation of zzso which places zzso genetically upstream of the zzso zzso zzso had originally been isolated by its ability to respond to zzso zzso and here we have discovered a leading role for zzso in the process of zzso The protein zzso zzso senses the inducing conditions and zzso the signal to zzso which zzso the degradation of the inhibitor zzso with the help of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The ability of zzso to control the protein degradation of zzso zzso indicates that zzso is actually able to direct its own recruitment to gene zzso
