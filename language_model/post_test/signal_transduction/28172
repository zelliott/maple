zzso produced during viral infections by accessory zzso I zzso or zzso cells zzso II zzso play a primary role in the regulation of immune and zzso zzso cell zzso zzso Because zzso have zzso effects on several cell types, including zzso cells, we asked whether they zzso proliferation of human zzso cells, and whether zzso and zzso mediate distinct effects on zzso cells at different zzso zzso Analysis of proliferation at the zzso level in human zzso cells indicated that both zzso types inhibit zzso zzso of immature zzso zzso zzso cells in freshly separated peripheral blood zzso and in cells derived from them after short-term zzso However, zzso inhibited specifically the zzso proliferation of these cells without affecting the zzso one or that of the zzso cells, whereas zzso attenuated proliferation of zzso cells at any zzso stage (both immature zzso and mature zzso zzso zzso zzso and contributed to their zzso differentiation to zzso zzso Adding to our previous report that zzso zzso zzso of mature zzso zzso cells, the present data unravel a mechanism by which peripheral immature zzso and mature zzso zzso cells can zzso regulate each other's zzso
