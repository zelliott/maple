How zzso zzso achieve signaling specificity during development is only partially zzso Here, we show that zzso one of four zzso zzso in zzso zzso signals through zzso one of three zzso of the zzso zzso zzso that are expressed during zzso In cell culture, zzso signaling is active in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso but not zzso demonstrating that the zzso zzso also contributes to the specificity of the signaling zzso During development, different zzso zzso express unique combinations of these zzso and zzso expression of zzso in a tissue where it is not normally expressed at high levels can make that tissue sensitive to zzso zzso These results reveal a mechanism by which distinct cell types can discriminate between different zzso signals during development as a result of differential expression of zzso zzso zzso
