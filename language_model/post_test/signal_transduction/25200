We have recently found that values of the transforming growth factor zzso in human zzso zzso fluid obtained during zzso stimulation for zzso were higher in women who subsequently became pregnant following zzso zzso We therefore zzso that zzso may have a beneficial effect on the zzso zzso and improve the chances of a successful zzso We have used reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso to investigate the presence in human zzso and zzso zzso of the essential components of the zzso zzso pathway, zzso receptors type I and II and the zzso proteins zzso 2 and zzso We found that both zzso as well as zzso 2 and 3, were present in the zzso zzso whereas only the type I zzso and zzso 2 and 3 were present at the zzso zzso At the zzso and zzso stages neither of the receptors was present, but zzso 2 and 3 were present at both zzso These findings support our hypothesis that the zzso in zzso fluid may interact with the zzso and zzso zzso via zzso zzso and that zzso zzso may be important for the development of the zzso and the zzso zzso
