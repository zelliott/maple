The potential involvement of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso in zzso of zzso brain injury has been recently zzso zzso zzso in support of this thesis include increases of brain zzso concentration during zzso and the zzso effect exerted by zzso zzso In this article, we demonstrate that several zzso zzso responses in zzso in zzso resemble these observed previously in zzso brain and are widely acknowledged as the potentially zzso factors in this zzso In zzso prepared from rat zzso 10 zzso zzso caused an zzso zzso of zzso calcium as measured by zzso zzso zzso A similar zzso of zzso zzso was evoked by 1 zzso zzso zzso As an effect of calcium entry after zzso application, a zzso of protein zzso C zzso toward plasma zzso was demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso It was followed by an increase of 50 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso recognized on Western blots with zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the presence of calcium zzso abolished these effects of zzso and significantly decreased the content of zzso in the zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment markedly attenuated the zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso The decrease of zzso level seems to be secondary to the zzso calcium entry with subsequent zzso of zzso zzso since it was completely blocked by zzso a potent inhibitor of this zzso Our observations indicate that zzso in a concentration found in zzso brain can elevate zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso in zzso including zzso zzso and zzso followed by zzso zzso of zzso zzso The relative contribution of these events to zzso brain injury is currently under extensive zzso
