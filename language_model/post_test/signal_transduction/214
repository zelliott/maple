The zzso gene encodes the zzso zzso zzso zzso and is often zzso or amplified in breast zzso zzso of zzso contributes to tumor zzso Many aspects of tumor growth are favorably affected through zzso of zzso zzso Indeed, zzso plays a role in increasing proliferation and survival of the primary tumor and distant zzso which upon completion of full transformation cause zzso zzso receptors and signaling from them and associated molecules increase zzso of both zzso and zzso cells, decrease zzso enhance signaling interactions with the zzso regulate zzso as well as a multitude of other zzso Recent experimental and clinical evidence supports the view that the spread of incompletely transformed cells occurs at a very early stage in tumor zzso This review concerns the identification and characterization of zzso the evolution of the zzso model, and the more recent cancer stem cell zzso In particular, we review the evidence for an emerging mechanism of zzso breast cancer zzso zzso the zzso zzso cell shows characteristics of zzso cell, zzso and then completes its final transformation at the secondary zzso
