zzso zzso an unusual zzso zzso member of the zzso family of cell zzso zzso is widely expressed in the cardiovascular zzso The expression profile of zzso within diseased zzso and zzso vessels indicates some relationship between expression of zzso and the zzso status of resident zzso Using cultures of human zzso smooth muscle cells zzso and human zzso vein zzso cells zzso we investigate the hypothesis that zzso may function in modulating adhesive properties of vascular zzso zzso of culture plates with zzso zzso protein or with zzso against the first zzso domain of zzso zzso significantly decreased zzso and spreading of zzso and zzso zzso adherent on zzso or zzso zzso exhibited an zzso zzso and associated zzso of the zzso and focal zzso to a distinctly peripheral zzso These changes are characteristic of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso chamber migration zzso demonstrated that the zzso induced by zzso zzso cell migration towards a serum zzso zzso of zzso in vascular cells using zzso zzso does not influence cell zzso or zzso per se, but increases the detachment and migratory responses induced by zzso zzso The data suggest that zzso acts as an zzso signal for vascular cells, thus modulating vascular cell zzso and migration zzso
