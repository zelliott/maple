Signal zzso is the process by which the cell converts one kind of signal or stimulus into zzso This involves a sequence of zzso zzso carried out by zzso The dynamic response of complex cell zzso networks can be zzso and simulated in the framework of chemical zzso The mathematical zzso of chemical zzso results in a system of coupled differential zzso zzso can arise through assumptions and zzso The paper provides a critical discussion of frequently employed approximations in dynamic zzso of signal zzso zzso We discuss the requirements for conservation laws, steady state zzso and the neglect of zzso We show how these approximations simplify the mathematical treatment of zzso networks but we also demonstrate differences between the complete system and its approximations with respect to the transient and steady state zzso
