Human Natural zzso cells express a large array of surface receptors that are involved in the regulation of the different zzso cell zzso Some of these zzso by sensing the expression of zzso class I on potential target cells, deliver negative signals that inhibit the zzso zzso In the absence of such zzso zzso other receptors are allowed to zzso zzso signals that result in zzso attack of zzso or zzso zzso The function of these main zzso receptors is supported and enhanced by the simultaneous engagement of different zzso Finally, the ability of zzso cells to interact with normal, zzso other cells such as zzso cells zzso appears to zzso contribute to the regulation of both innate and zzso immune zzso
