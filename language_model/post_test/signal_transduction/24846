The zzso of the zzso zzso was proposed by zzso to be zzso into zzso zzso zzso and spinal zzso by a zzso zzso In the zzso step, the zzso zzso organizer zzso zzso with anterior character, followed by zzso by a transforming zzso Recently, simultaneous zzso of zzso and zzso signaling was shown to induce head formation in zzso zzso However, how the zzso of zzso and zzso signaling pathways specify a properly patterned head, and how they are regulated in zzso is not zzso Here we demonstrate that the loss of anterior neural fates observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs during zzso due to a reduction and subsequent zzso of zzso The neural induction zzso was correlated with decreased zzso expression and zzso increases in zzso zzso and was suppressed by zzso of zzso zzso Whereas expression of anterior neural markers was restored by zzso zzso zzso in early zzso zzso it was not maintained during later zzso The zzso of zzso in zzso was correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso rescued formation of the organizer and anterior neural fates in zzso zzso We propose that zzso specifies formation of anterior zzso by regulating zzso and zzso pathways in a fashion consistent with zzso zzso neural patterning zzso zzso promotes neural induction by positively regulating zzso zzso and limiting the zzso activity of zzso zzso In addition, by negative regulation of zzso zzso zzso promotes organizer formation and limits zzso of zzso in the late zzso
