Short motifs of many zzso elements zzso can be found in the promoters of most zzso zzso and this raises the question of how their presence can zzso specific zzso We developed a universal zzso to test the biological significance of zzso by first identifying every zzso gene with a zzso and then statistically zzso the presence or absence of the element with the gene expression profile on multiple DNA zzso This zzso was successfully verified for previously characterized zzso acid, zzso zzso and drought responsive zzso in zzso showing that the presence of these elements indeed zzso with zzso gene zzso Later, we used standard motif sampling methods to identify 128 putative motifs induced by excess light, zzso oxygen species and zzso Our zzso was able to filter 20 out of 128 novel zzso which significantly correlated with gene induction by either heat, zzso oxygen species and/or zzso The position, orientation and sequence specificity of zzso was tested in zzso by analyzing the expression of genes with naturally occurring sequence zzso In three novel zzso the forward orientation correlated with zzso induction and the reverse orientation with zzso zzso The functionality of the predicted novel zzso was zzso confirmed using zzso zzso cultures transformed with short promoter fragments or artificial promoters fused with the zzso reporter zzso Our zzso analysis opens up new possibilities for in zzso zzso of the biological significance of newly discovered zzso and allows for subsequent selection of such zzso for experimental zzso
