We examined the role of zzso calcium release in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso cell zzso We found that zzso red, an inhibitor of zzso zzso substantially diminished the zzso response, whereas zzso C, an zzso zzso zzso zzso had no zzso zzso of two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was confirmed by zzso We also found that caffeine, a zzso zzso zzso significantly zzso whereas zzso which causes depletion of zzso calcium store, markedly diminished, the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso calcium release is involved in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso
