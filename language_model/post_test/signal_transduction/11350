In human cancer, despite zzso activity, zzso promotes the cell cycle progression under certain zzso In this study, we demonstrated that zzso cell proliferation is achieved through the zzso In addition, alternative zzso zzso zzso and zzso contribute the zzso cell cycle promotion through distinct zzso The long form of zzso zzso activates the zzso which enhance the activity of zzso and zzso whereas short form zzso are activated by zzso zzso zzso through the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso however, recruitment of zzso into zzso is later than that of zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso show the late response to zzso of zzso We also show that each zzso zzso is regulated by a distinct molecular mechanism at the zzso zzso zzso is induced by zzso whereas zzso through the zzso zzso is like an zzso regulatory zzso zzso the induction of zzso in response to zzso is achieved in a more delayed manner than that of zzso Our present study also implies that other alternative zzso zzso perform differential roles in spite of the same zzso
