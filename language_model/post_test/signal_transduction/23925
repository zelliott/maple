We have recently demonstrated that multiple zzso pathways are involved in zzso proliferation in rat zzso zzso acts by zzso zzso zzso via zzso protein zzso zzso zzso includes both zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the possible protein zzso zzso which might be involved in zzso zzso zzso We found that, in zzso zzso can evoke zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso This process is dependent on the increase in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, in response to zzso stimulation zzso formed a complex with zzso zzso zzso and adapter protein growth factor zzso protein 2 zzso which could be zzso Furthermore, both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso can be attenuated by zzso zzso inhibitor zzso From these data we conclude that zzso uses zzso and zzso zzso to activate zzso thereby leading to zzso zzso which predominantly recruits zzso in rat zzso
