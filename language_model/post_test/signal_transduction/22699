This paper zzso five experiments that may be used to characterize the nature of the zzso step in which a magnetic or electric field is converted into a biological zzso Each of the five experiments is formulated as a zzso hypothesis in such a manner that rejection of the hypothesis will provide information about the zzso process and an associated confidence level for evaluating each zzso The proposed hypotheses are formulated to provide zzso about the mode of interaction zzso field or induced electric field zzso spatial distribution of the detector elements in the biological system, and the zzso of the zzso zzso
