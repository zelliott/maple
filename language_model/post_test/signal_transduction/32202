Many zzso zzso receptors mediate zzso signals by stimulating zzso zzso protein zzso zzso that are typically regulated by the small zzso zzso Recent studies have revealed that members of the zzso family may possess the ability to activate zzso by interacting with the zzso protein zzso repeat 1 zzso Within the zzso family, the highly zzso zzso can relay signals from numerous zzso Here, we examined if zzso interacts with zzso to stimulate Ras signaling zzso zzso of the zzso active zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells led to the formation of zzso Ras as well as increased zzso of downstream signaling molecules including zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso type 2 and zzso zzso receptors produced similar responses in human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso cells demonstrated a stronger association of zzso for zzso zzso than zzso , suggesting that zzso zzso binds to the zzso form of zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso with the Ras zzso zzso exchange factors zzso and zzso zzso of a dominant negative zzso of zzso or zzso zzso of zzso effectively abolished the ability of zzso to induce Ras signaling in native zzso or zzso zzso zzso Although expression of the dominant negative zzso of zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso it did not affect zzso zzso stimulation of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso is required for zzso to stimulate zzso signaling zzso but not for the propagation of signals along zzso zzso
