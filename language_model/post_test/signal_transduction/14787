To study the zzso of transforming growth factor zzso signal zzso in diabetic zzso zzso and effects of zzso zzso 

40 male zzso rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: zzso group zzso zzso 16, fed with zzso fat diet for 4 weeks, injected zzso with zzso so as to establish zzso model, and then zzso into the stomach with normal saline once daily since the injection of zzso for 16 weeks), zzso group zzso zzso 16, zzso into the stomach with zzso at the dose of 30 zzso once a day for 16 weeks after the establishment of zzso zzso and control group zzso zzso 8, fed with normal diet and zzso into the stomach with normal saline once daily for 16 zzso At the end of the experiment, the contents of fast zzso zzso fast insulin zzso serum cholesterol, and zzso were zzso and insulin sensitivity index zzso was zzso zzso zzso was performed to measure the zzso zzso left zzso zzso pressure zzso left zzso end zzso pressure zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso pressure zzso zzso and the left zzso zzso function zzso was zzso zzso of zzso tissue were taken out to undergo zzso zzso examination by transmission electron zzso The content of collagen was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used to detect the zzso expression and protein expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

By the end of experiment the levels of zzso zzso and cholesterol increased and the zzso decreased significantly in the zzso and zzso groups (all P zzso zzso Compared with the zzso and control groups the levels of zzso and T significantly increased, and the levels of zzso and zzso zzso significantly decreased (all P zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso group was significantly higher than that of the control group and the zzso zzso of the zzso group was significantly lower than that of the control group zzso zzso zzso The volume of collagen in the zzso tissue of the zzso group was zzso zzso zzso significantly higher than that of the control group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The content of collagen in the zzso tissue of the zzso group was lower significantly than that of the zzso zzso The levels of zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, all significantly higher than those of the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, all P zzso zzso - zzso The ratios zzso and zzso of the zzso group were significantly higher than those of the control group (both P zzso zzso The protein levels of zzso zzso and zzso were 143 zzso 17, 212 zzso 43, and 151 zzso 32 respectively, all significantly higher than those of the control group zzso zzso 18, 107 zzso 21, and 89 zzso 17 respectively, P zzso zzso The zzso and zzso of the zzso group were significantly higher than those of the control group (both P zzso zzso The zzso (or zzso and zzso (or zzso of the zzso group was significantly lower than those of the zzso group (both P zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso signal zzso and imbalance between zzso 3 and zzso may be one of the mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso can prevent zzso from damage by blocking the signal zzso
