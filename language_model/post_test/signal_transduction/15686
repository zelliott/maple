The zzso factor zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso of zzso However, the roles of zzso in anterior zzso zzso zzso during zzso are zzso We knocked down zzso in zzso which resulted in defects of the newly formed zzso including loss of the striped patterns of zzso polarity genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as the absence of zzso expression in zzso Also, the expression of zzso exhibited a zzso and zzso pattern, indicating that zzso is necessary for zzso patterning in anterior zzso zzso were treated with zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in reduction of zzso zzso This finding was consistent with results obtained from zzso zzso whose zzso form of zzso was produced by zzso Loss of zzso expression was observed in the zzso injected with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could rescue the defective expression levels of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso suggesting that zzso signaling acts as an upstream zzso of zzso during zzso We concluded that zzso is required for maintaining zzso polarity within a zzso and that the striped pattern of zzso in anterior zzso is mainly regulated by zzso An zzso signaling network is therefore zzso
