The zzso target of zzso complex 1 zzso is a master regulator of cell growth and zzso Recent studies have suggested that zzso zzso of zzso in normal cells could lead to zzso tumor development in several zzso However, the mechanisms of zzso zzso to promote the growth and zzso of breast or other zzso are still not well zzso Here, using a new zzso deletion system, we show that deletion of zzso in mouse primary zzso tumor cells, either before or after their zzso significantly increased their growth in zzso The increase in tumor growth was completely rescued by zzso treatment, suggesting a major contribution from zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso but not zzso acid zzso zzso was increased significantly in zzso tumor zzso Further analysis of these cells also showed an increased zzso zzso but no significant changes in zzso zzso Together, these results provide insights into the mechanism by which zzso of zzso promotes breast cancer progression through increasing zzso and zzso zzso in zzso
