zzso zzso pathways have been zzso as having zzso properties where there is a quantitative relationship between zzso zzso and response, or threshold characteristics in which there is a zzso switch in response at a fixed level of zzso zzso Here we report the use of a bacterial artificial zzso zzso transgenic system in which a zzso zzso has been introduced into the zzso zzso zzso These mice exhibit zzso zzso and zzso zzso that are exacerbated when the zzso copy number is zzso Surprisingly, increasing zzso zzso copy number also leads to the de zzso appearance of zzso I zzso in the hind limb and transformations of the zzso zzso is accompanied by a reduction of programmed cell death in the developing hind zzso zzso gene analysis reveals zzso of zzso in the zzso I field and zzso of zzso and zzso These findings show that zzso zzso pathways exhibit differing zzso zzso zzso development of the zzso zzso and zzso follows a zzso mode, whereas development of the zzso column and the hind limbs has threshold zzso zzso
