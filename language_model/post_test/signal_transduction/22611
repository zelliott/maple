zzso zzso play a crucial role in initiating the inflammatory response in allergic asthma through the zzso of the low affinity zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso or zzso by zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells targets I zzso B zzso leading to the zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso We demonstrate in this paper that zzso signaling in zzso cells leads to zzso of I zzso B alpha at zzso zzso zzso of a zzso I zzso B alpha zzso containing zzso at zzso completely zzso degradation of I zzso B zzso zzso B zzso and gene zzso that follows zzso zzso Investigation of the second zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso B demonstrates that I zzso B zzso zzso but not zzso are selectively activated following zzso zzso and mediates the zzso of I zzso B zzso zzso experiments with an zzso beta negative dominant completely inhibit zzso induced zzso zzso B zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso is required for the induction of zzso activity, I zzso B alpha degradation, and zzso B nuclear zzso Taken together, our results show that zzso zzso in the zzso lineage zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso of zzso which zzso I zzso B alpha at the zzso domain zzso inducing its degradation, zzso B zzso and gene zzso
