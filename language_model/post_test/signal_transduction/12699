The tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso has gained much attention as a possible therapeutic zzso for the treatment of tumors, as TRAIL was originally described to induce zzso specifically in cancer cells, but not in normal zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso arthritis zzso patients exhibit zzso features and we have described earlier that TRAIL zzso zzso only in a subset of zzso zzso but an induction of proliferation in the surviving zzso This observation zzso to the zzso effects of TRAIL observed on primary human tumor zzso Here, we describe that the zzso zzso pathway, but not that of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso protects zzso zzso from zzso zzso by modulating the expression of the cell survival regulators zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, we found that not only zzso zzso but also zzso proliferation in zzso zzso is zzso by zzso with a crucial role for zzso zzso TRAIL was found to induce degradation of zzso and zzso that was zzso but independent of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The finding that zzso proliferation and zzso share zzso routes has to be taken in consideration in defining therapeutic strategies on the basis of the administration of zzso
