Members of the zzso growth factor zzso family of zzso growth factors are widely expressed in the germ layer derivatives during zzso and early zzso of the zzso We have investigated the effect of administering zzso zzso in the zzso streak stage zzso to test if the patterning of the body plan may be influenced by this growth zzso Shortly after zzso treatment the embryonic zzso zzso the expression of zzso and the zzso signaling regulator zzso suggesting that zzso signaling was activated as an immediate response to zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was suppressed in the prospective anterior region of the zzso After 24 h of in zzso development, zzso displayed a zzso suppression of zzso zzso disruption of the zzso zzso and zzso of the differentiation of the embryonic zzso Overall, development of the zzso axis in the late zzso is sensitive to the delivery of zzso zzso The early response associated with the expression of zzso suggests that the later zzso observed could be primarily related to an zzso of the zzso signaling zzso
