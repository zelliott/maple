We investigated the role of surface zzso molecules in regulating vascular zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso rat zzso cells zzso express zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso across the zzso zzso increased through the interaction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but no increase was seen through zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso The potential of zzso zzso for zzso increase depended on zzso zzso it peaked at zzso and was neither zzso by injury nor by growth zzso to the zzso zzso Effect of zzso zzso was inhibited significantly by the zzso zzso zzso or the protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso and was completely blocked by the combined addition of zzso and zzso It seems likely that both zzso and protein zzso are involved in related zzso signal zzso zzso expression on zzso was zzso with zzso beta treatment and was zzso with mixed zzso reaction zzso zzso zzso Although zzso expression on rat vascular zzso in zzso was not zzso the expression of zzso was induced on zzso zzso cells at the site of inflammation induced by zzso complete zzso zzso zzso zzso in the inflamed zzso significantly increased when zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso zzso were given zzso The collective evidence suggests that zzso zzso on the zzso is one important regulatory event in vascular zzso at sites of zzso
