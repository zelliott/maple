The steroid hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso rapidly zzso zzso zzso in avian skeletal muscle cells by driving a complex signal zzso zzso which promotes zzso release from inner stores and zzso influx from the outside through both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present work, we evaluated the involvement of zzso zzso in zzso regulation of zzso influx in chick skeletal muscle zzso Treatment with zzso m zzso in zzso medium resulted in a rapid but transient zzso rise correlated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso influx zzso by the hormone was insensitive to both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compound zzso and the zzso protein zzso II zzso inhibitor zzso when added after the zzso zzso zzso but it was completely abolished when added prior to the zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso Moreover, in cells zzso with zzso zzso directed against the zzso zzso the zzso zzso influx was reduced up to zzso respect to zzso zzso The present results suggest that the 1, zzso zzso zzso zzso transient is required for zzso zzso which in turn activates zzso influx in a mechanism that seems to include zzso
