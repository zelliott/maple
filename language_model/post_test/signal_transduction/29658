zzso zzso is a pivotal signaling zzso that zzso behavioral and zzso responses to diverse chemical and physical zzso We report zzso regulation of zzso zzso by transient zzso potential V zzso zzso channels in zzso zzso zzso in the zzso genes zzso or zzso dramatically zzso the expression of the gene zzso the zzso synthesis zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso but neither the zzso nor the double zzso of both channel genes affects other types of zzso zzso The zzso genes are expressed in the zzso zzso but not in other zzso zzso and act zzso to regulate a zzso zzso zzso Whereas in zzso zzso zzso and zzso function is dependent on zzso zzso the activity of zzso or two other zzso proteins expressed in the zzso zzso is not required for zzso zzso zzso thus the zzso zzso channels in different zzso may be regulated by different zzso A zzso zzso in zzso zzso partially suppresses the zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso thus zzso may be an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso genes cause worms zzso arrest at the zzso zzso This zzso zzso is due in part to reduced zzso zzso into zzso neuroendocrine zzso
