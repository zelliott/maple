In previous in zzso studies, we have found that zzso saline zzso can augment zzso proliferation and restore the function of suppressed zzso Our animal models have shown that zzso resuscitation reverses zzso after zzso and reduces mortality from zzso In the present study, we investigated if and how zzso may influence zzso signaling and function on a zzso zzso 

Human peripheral blood zzso cells zzso were used to determine the effect of zzso on zzso zzso 2 zzso production and zzso Human zzso zzso were used to study the effects of zzso on zzso signal zzso zzso zzso transcription, and zzso zzso 

The effect of zzso on zzso proliferation and zzso production was measured with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells was measured by reverse zzso zzso chain zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso zzso was determined by zzso with zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso a signal zzso protein that is activated by zzso stress, was determined by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was measured with an zzso zzso zzso using zzso as a zzso 

zzso of activated human zzso increased significantly upon addition of zzso to the culture zzso This effect of zzso was paralleled by enhanced zzso production of activated zzso and zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso exposure of zzso cells caused zzso zzso of a number of cellular zzso We found that zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso and that it was activated in the presence of zzso All these effects of zzso on zzso signaling and function were observed at zzso zzso that were within zzso relevant levels zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso triggers a signaling zzso that includes increased zzso zzso of several cellular proteins and zzso of zzso zzso zzso alone does not result in zzso zzso transcription, zzso zzso or zzso zzso However, in combination with other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso We speculate that zzso could zzso suppressed zzso in trauma patients by zzso of, or substituting for, blocked signaling zzso
