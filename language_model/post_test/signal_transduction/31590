To determine the mechanisms of action of zzso zzso zzso in lens cell differentiation and zzso 

zzso quail lens cell cultures were treated at different stages of differentiation with the zzso inhibitor zzso and expression of survival proteins and differentiation markers were determined by zzso zzso The connection between zzso regulation of lens differentiation and zzso zzso reorganization was examined by zzso zzso and zzso activity zzso Survival in the absence of zzso signaling was examined by zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the absence of zzso signaling was induced with zzso zzso 

Exposure to zzso blocked lens zzso cell differentiation zzso This result was linked to zzso of zzso activity and zzso of zzso filament reorganization from stress fibers to cortical zzso which has been shown to signal lens differentiation zzso The survival of lens zzso cells in the absence of zzso signaling correlated with induction of numerous survival factors, including zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso signaling in zzso lens fiber cells induced zzso by blocking zzso of zzso showing that zzso signaling has a protective role in the late stages of differentiation as zzso and zzso are zzso 

zzso signaling regulates lens cell differentiation initiation through its ability to signal reorganization of the zzso zzso from stress fibers to cortical zzso In zzso lens fiber cells, zzso has a protective function, signaling survival through zzso of its downstream zzso zzso
