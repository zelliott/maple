The zzso zzso zzso zzso are genetic conditions characterized by zzso zzso of the longest zzso tract zzso and so their study provides an important opportunity to understand mechanisms involved in zzso maintenance and zzso A group of zzso genes zzso proteins that zzso to zzso One of these is zzso zzso in zzso syndrome 1) and we have shown recently that its zzso zzso zzso zzso bone zzso protein zzso zzso although the relevance of this finding to the zzso protein was not zzso We show here that zzso zzso is also an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso physically interacts with the type II zzso zzso zzso and we demonstrate that this interaction does not require the zzso tail of zzso We show that the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso zzso involves zzso of zzso receptors by promoting their zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso versions of zzso alter the trafficking of zzso and are less efficient at promoting zzso degradation than zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrate that two other members of the zzso group of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso of zzso zzso Since zzso zzso is important for zzso zzso function, we propose that zzso of zzso zzso could be a unifying pathological component in this zzso group of zzso and perhaps of importance in other conditions in which zzso zzso zzso is zzso
