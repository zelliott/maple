The purposes of this study are to characterize the binding of zzso acid zzso to mouse T zzso cells, to measure changes in zzso zzso after zzso zzso to zzso the interaction between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the membrane zzso and finally to correlate these events with zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso to zzso First, we established an in zzso zzso using zzso to measure the binding of zzso to mouse T zzso cells, and found that the binding of zzso to these cells is readily inhibited by the addition of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is the zzso zzso Next, we examined various signal zzso events that occur after zzso binds to its zzso on mouse T zzso zzso The results of these studies indicate that the concentration of zzso zzso (as measured by zzso zzso begins to increase within seconds, and reaches a zzso level 5 zzso after the addition of zzso to the zzso After this increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso both its zzso zzso to form zzso structures, and cell zzso to zzso zzso Furthermore, we have determined that zzso binds directly and specifically to zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso in a zzso manner; and that zzso is zzso accumulated underneath the zzso zzso capped zzso The zzso zzso zzso was found to stimulate zzso zzso capping and zzso while zzso (a zzso zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso (a zzso zzso and zzso D (a zzso zzso but not zzso (a zzso zzso zzso inhibit zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso These findings strongly suggest that zzso plays an important role in linking the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso system during zzso zzso zzso zzso
