Signaling pathways in response to DNA double strand breaks involve molecular zzso consisting of sensors, zzso and zzso proteins that activate cell cycle checkpoints and recruit repair machinery zzso zzso (a nuclear factor with zzso zzso protein 1) contains zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso gene 1 zzso zzso zzso and internal repeats and is an early participant in nuclear zzso in response to zzso To zzso its role in the response zzso small interfering zzso zzso directed against zzso in human cells demonstrated that its absence is associated with increased zzso and delayed zzso transition, but not zzso to zzso zzso associates with nuclear zzso within minutes following zzso a property similar to zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are all early participants in the DNA damage signaling zzso zzso studies show that zzso is required for the zzso positive for zzso but zzso is not needed for zzso and zzso zzso zzso together with zzso plays a partially redundant role in regulating zzso of the downstream zzso zzso zzso since zzso of both diminishes zzso zzso in zzso zzso These results place zzso parallel to zzso in regulating zzso and downstream of zzso in the recruitment of repair and signaling proteins to sites of DNA zzso
