The zzso of zzso zzso involves the zzso of a zzso signal zzso zzso that drives zzso zzso via mechanisms that are unique to this cell zzso zzso surrounds the impact of zzso calcium on this process, with positive and negative effects being recorded in independent zzso We clearly demonstrate that the presence of calcium in the external medium decreases zzso zzso in both human and mouse zzso Under these conditions, a rise in zzso pH was recorded, however, this event was not responsible for the observed changes in zzso zzso Rather, the impact of calcium on zzso zzso in these cells was associated with an unexpected change in the zzso availability of zzso Thus, the zzso content of both human and mouse zzso fell significantly when these cells were incubated in the presence of external zzso Furthermore, the removal of zzso or addition of zzso decreased zzso levels within human zzso populations and induced a corresponding decline in zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso inhibitor zzso had no effect on either zzso levels or zzso zzso zzso of the zzso probe zzso zzso confirmed our prediction that zzso have many zzso zzso Moreover, addition of the zzso inhibitor zzso increased zzso calcium levels, decreased zzso and suppressed zzso zzso Based on these findings, the present study indicates that zzso calcium suppresses zzso zzso by decreasing the availability of zzso zzso and not by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso as has been previously zzso
