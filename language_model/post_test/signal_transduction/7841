zzso is a zzso protein of unknown function since, unlike other zzso it does not form zzso complexes with zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso has widespread association with zzso zzso in developing zzso and other zzso We have now shown that full-length human zzso zzso specifically binds to the zzso region of zzso but not to zzso in solid phase zzso and overlay zzso The binding was enhanced by the inclusion of 2 zzso zzso zzso in the zzso buffer and abolished by 5 zzso zzso indicating that the interaction was directly or indirectly zzso zzso zzso The zzso for the interaction was calculated from the specific binding curve as zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso of zzso was shown to a) bind the zzso zzso of zzso and b) block completely the binding of full length zzso to zzso This result indicates that the major zzso binding site resides close to the zzso of zzso Further competitive binding studies showed that an analogous zzso terminal zzso of zzso was able to block the binding of zzso to zzso and that the zzso zzso of zzso could block the interaction of the zzso zzso with the zzso Thus the binding site for zzso on zzso appears to be the same or in close proximity to that for zzso zzso analysis of developing human zzso showed distinctive but extensively overlapping zzso for zzso and zzso Both zzso showed extensive zzso with zzso and elastic zzso but zzso had extensive signal throughout the zzso layer whereas zzso showed strong zzso only in the outer zzso zzso The finding indicates that there is a possibility for zzso to compete with zzso for binding to zzso zzso throughout the zzso wall but particularly in the outer zzso region where the zzso is predominantly zzso Overall, the results support the concept that that zzso may be an indirect negative zzso for storage of the large zzso zzso complex on zzso in zzso and other zzso zzso
