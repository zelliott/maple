Human zzso leukemia zzso cells readily undergo zzso when cells are treated with various stimuli including zzso agents, tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso zzso However, the signal zzso mechanism resulting in zzso is zzso To study the mechanism of zzso we isolated and characterized a zzso zzso from zzso cells, which was resistant to zzso and zzso zzso zzso but was less resistant to zzso zzso zzso induced signals are zzso by two types of zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso and zzso is zzso to the zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso cells showed resistance to zzso by zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso cells were resistant to zzso and zzso zzso Because expression of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso was similar between zzso and zzso cells an zzso zzso for zzso through zzso and zzso could be zzso in zzso zzso To clarify the genetic zzso of zzso cells, we performed zzso cell zzso with parental zzso and the zzso zzso All of the hybrid clones were as sensitive as the parental zzso cells to zzso by both zzso and zzso zzso indicating that the zzso resistance in zzso cells resulted from zzso zzso
