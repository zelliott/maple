zzso peptides are potent stimulants of zzso zzso zzso zzso migration from species such as humans and zzso Interestingly, zzso from dogs, zzso pigs and cows have been reported as zzso to zzso zzso and generally are believed not to express zzso zzso zzso are a major component of zzso media from zzso coli cultures and believed to be a significant element in inflammatory responses zzso by zzso zzso Our studies have found that zzso coli zzso was a potent stimulant of dog zzso zzso zzso of migration to zzso coli zzso by the zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the migration was zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to peptides with higher affinity for the zzso zzso than zzso was further evidence for these receptors on the dog zzso zzso from dogs migrated in response to zzso at high zzso zzso zzso however, zzso with zzso zzso zzso resulted in increased migration of dog zzso in response to zzso of zzso as low as 1 zzso These results demonstrate that dog zzso are responsive to zzso and that these responses can be zzso by zzso Thus zzso from a species previously thought incapable of responding to zzso can respond to zzso zzso with high affinity for the zzso as well as be primed for enhanced migration to zzso by zzso
