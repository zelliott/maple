The molecular effect of zzso zzso from zzso zzso as well as zzso coli on the zzso protein zzso in the zzso B zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice was zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso of selected membrane proteins that included the zzso with apparent molecular masses of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the B zzso from both strains of mice, while zzso coli zzso induced zzso and zzso in zzso B zzso zzso These findings suggest that through the same zzso zzso zzso as observed in zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso induced the zzso of zzso B zzso in which a trigger signal by zzso coli zzso could not be zzso to initiate zzso protein zzso
