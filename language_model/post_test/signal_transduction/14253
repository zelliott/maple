Previous mouse studies suggest that decreasing dietary fat content can slow prostate cancer zzso zzso To our knowledge, no study has yet compared the effect of multiple different fats on zzso zzso We sought to systematically compare the effect of fish oil, olive oil, corn oil and animal fat on zzso zzso 

A total of 96 male severe combined zzso mice were injected with zzso human zzso zzso Two weeks following injection, mice were zzso to a Western diet based on fish oil, olive oil, corn oil or animal fat zzso zzso from zzso Animals were zzso when tumor volumes reached zzso zzso was collected at death and zzso for zzso insulin, zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also zzso for zzso and zzso levels, and global gene expression was analyzed using zzso zzso 

Mice weights and tumor volumes were equivalent across groups at zzso Overall, fish oil consumption was associated with improved survival relative to other dietary groups zzso On gene expression zzso the fish oil group had decreased signal in pathways related to zzso physiology and insulin zzso 

In this zzso model, we found that consuming a diet in which fish oil was the only fat source slowed tumor growth and improved survival compared with that in mice consuming diets composed of olive oil, corn oil or animal zzso Although prior studies showed that the amount of fat is important for zzso growth, this study suggests that the type of dietary fat consumed may also be zzso
