It is becoming clear that Ras proteins mediate their diverse biological functions by binding to, and participating in, the zzso of multiple downstream zzso Recent work has identified zzso factors for zzso as the newest members of the set of putative Ras zzso zzso This new work has also detected two potential downstream targets of Ral zzso a novel zzso zzso protein and a zzso zzso
