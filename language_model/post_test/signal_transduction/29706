Acute inflammation is characterized by an zzso of zzso cells zzso generation of zzso oxygen species, subsequent zzso of zzso and finally zzso of zzso cells by zzso Recently, it has been demonstrated that during zzso zzso of membrane zzso especially zzso zzso Moreover, we have shown that membrane zzso released from zzso cells contain biologically active oxidized zzso The involvement of oxidized zzso in the development of zzso which is described as a chronic inflammatory disease, is increasingly zzso These oxidized zzso were shown to induce several zzso zzso such as zzso zzso protein 1 or zzso and it is hypothesized that zzso zzso products also play a role in other chronic inflammatory zzso On the other hand, oxidized zzso were shown to exert zzso effects by zzso zzso zzso representing a possible feedback loop during zzso zzso Additionally, it has been described that oxidized zzso are capable of inducing genes such as zzso zzso that are important for the resolution of acute zzso Moreover, oxidized zzso serve as recognition signals on zzso cells zzso zzso In this review, we discuss the hypothesis that oxidized zzso generated in zzso cells zzso zzso chronic inflammation and zzso contribute to the resolution of acute zzso
