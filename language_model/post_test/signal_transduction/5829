We have recently demonstrated that tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso decreases zzso zzso proliferation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso X, zzso zzso zzso K, zzso zzso zzso Res zzso zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to delineate a zzso through which zzso exerts its zzso zzso zzso were conducted on zzso zzso cultures and heart zzso isolated from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso decreased zzso expression and increased zzso proliferation in zzso and zzso zzso A zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein levels were increased in zzso zzso and heart zzso Treatment with zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity using zzso decreased zzso zzso increased zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso Furthermore, treatment with the zzso specific inhibitor zzso or the zzso zzso decreased zzso proliferation as well as zzso of zzso and zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso proliferation by zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso are zzso via zzso of zzso zzso and decreases in zzso and zzso zzso
