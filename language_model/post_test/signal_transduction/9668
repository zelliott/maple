zzso regulatory factor 4 zzso is a critical zzso regulator in B cell development and zzso We have previously shown that zzso together with zzso zzso zzso cell development by limiting zzso cell expansion and by promoting zzso cell zzso Here, we report that zzso suppresses zzso induced leukemia in zzso zzso Our results show that zzso induced leukemia was greatly accelerated in the zzso zzso mice zzso the average age of mortality in the zzso mice was only 7 to 8 weeks but was 20 weeks in the control zzso Our results show that zzso zzso cells were derived from large zzso cells and were zzso and resistant to zzso Further analysis revealed that the majority of zzso zzso cells zzso the zzso zzso zzso and contained defects in zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso is part of the molecular zzso that controls zzso cell zzso Our results show that expression of zzso was lost in the zzso zzso cells and zzso of zzso expression in those cells induced zzso and inhibited their zzso Thus, zzso functions as a classical tumor zzso to inhibit zzso induced B cell leukemia in zzso zzso
