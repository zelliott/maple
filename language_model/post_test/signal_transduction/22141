Studies in zzso model organisms have led to a wealth of knowledge concerning the zzso zzso But which of these discoveries will apply to zzso in zzso Recently, an assessment of the degree of conservation of zzso pathways between two of the leading zzso model organisms, zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso The results zzso zzso indicated that pathways were zzso between zzso disparate zzso species and zzso emphasized the importance of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso With recent findings that deletion of the zzso zzso zzso or exposure of mice to the zzso inhibitor zzso result in lifespan extension, zzso zzso has become a major focus of zzso zzso Here, we address downstream targets of zzso zzso and their possible links to zzso We also briefly cover other zzso genes identified by comparing worms and zzso addressing the likelihood that their zzso counterparts will affect zzso
