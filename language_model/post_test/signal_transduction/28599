The definitive retinal zzso of the eye field are specified by zzso factors that both promote a retinal fate and control cell movements that are critical for eye field zzso However, the molecular signaling pathways that regulate these movements are largely zzso We demonstrate that both the zzso and zzso pathways impact eye field zzso zzso the zzso zzso before zzso zzso cellular movements in the zzso anterior neural plate and prevents cells from expressing a retinal fate, independent of zzso induction or zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso promotes cell zzso and significantly increases eye field zzso zzso reverse signaling is required to promote cellular movements into the eye field, and can rescue the zzso zzso repression of retinal zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso of zzso signaling regulates the positioning of retinal zzso cells within the definitive eye zzso
