Stress is a zzso significant factor shown to influence zzso synaptic plasticity and cognitive zzso Although numerous studies have reported that stress produces a suppression in long-term zzso zzso a putative synaptic mechanism underlying learning and zzso little is known about the mechanism by which this zzso Because the effects of stress on zzso and its converse process, long-term depression zzso parallel the changes in synaptic plasticity that occur following the establishment of zzso with zzso stimulation zzso zzso zzso and enhancing zzso zzso it has been proposed that stress affects subsequent zzso plasticity by sharing the same molecular machinery required to support zzso This article summarizes recent findings from ours and other laboratories to assess this view and discusses relevant hypotheses in the study of stress-related modifications of synaptic zzso
