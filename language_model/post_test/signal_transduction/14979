Bone zzso proteins have been implicated in the development of zzso and zzso however, a role for zzso zzso signaling in zzso development has not been demonstrated in a genetic zzso Using mice in which signaling via type I zzso receptors zzso and zzso have been zzso in the neural tube, we demonstrate that zzso signaling contributes to the maturation of zzso cells in zzso At zzso zzso mice exhibited a zzso decrease in zzso or zzso zzso in the cervical spinal zzso The number of zzso precursors and the timing of their emergence was unchanged in the zzso mice compared to the zzso however zzso protein expression and mature zzso numbers were significantly zzso These data indicate that zzso signaling promotes the generation of zzso and mature, zzso zzso in zzso but does not affect zzso precursor development, thus suggesting tight regulation of zzso signaling to ensure proper zzso
