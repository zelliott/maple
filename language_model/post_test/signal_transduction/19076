zzso zzso A zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso in zzso in the absence of zzso by zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso signal zzso but loses activity if three specific zzso sites or adjacent zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso sites are replaced by zzso zzso zzso zzso becomes zzso active if zzso zzso replace those zzso zzso These observations suggest an essential positive role for zzso in responding to zzso However, direct manipulation of zzso activity has not provided strong evidence for positive effects of zzso with the notable exception of a robust induction of zzso target genes by zzso zzso in zzso Here we show that the latter response is zzso principally by regulatory elements other than zzso binding sites and not by altered zzso zzso Also, the failure of zzso zzso to induce zzso target genes strongly through zzso zzso cannot be attributed to the zzso zzso of zzso sites on zzso Finally, we show that zzso containing zzso zzso at zzso and zzso sites can be zzso further by zzso and acts through zzso pathways that both stabilize zzso and use zzso zzso activity to increase the specific activity of zzso
