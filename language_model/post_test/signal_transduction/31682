zzso zzso are a family of zzso proteins that bind to and stabilize zzso zzso zzso cells express multiple zzso of zzso including three high molecular weight zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso While reports have indicated zzso of zzso in transformed cells and several human zzso zzso little is known about the underlying mechanism of zzso zzso In present study the expression of zzso zzso was investigated in zzso cell zzso of esophagus zzso relative to primary cell cultures of normal esophagus by western zzso and real-time zzso Our results showed that zzso zzso and zzso were significantly zzso in cell line of zzso Moreover, zzso level of zzso and zzso were markedly decreased by zzso and zzso in tumor cell line relative to esophagus normal zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso could play an important role in zzso of zzso zzso To zzso the mechanism of TM zzso in zzso cancer, the role of Ras dependent signaling and promoter zzso were zzso We found that zzso of two Ras zzso downstream zzso zzso and zzso leads to significant increased expression of zzso protein and both zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso significantly zzso zzso suggesting the prominent contribution of promoter zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso of zzso zzso occurs basically in zzso and the zzso of zzso and zzso pathways as well as the zzso mechanism of promoter zzso play important role in zzso suppression in zzso
