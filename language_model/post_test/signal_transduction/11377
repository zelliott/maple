During septic zzso circulating levels of zzso zzso are increased relative to those of zzso The reduced capacity of septic shock blood zzso in expressing zzso genes in response to bacterial zzso zzso zzso may contribute to reductions in these zzso but the reasons for persistent increases in circulating zzso zzso are zzso We determined whether septic shock zzso that have adapted to zzso induction of the zzso gene could continue to express zzso in response to zzso zzso shock zzso zzso and zzso zzso selectively maintained production of zzso after treatment with zzso while limiting that of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and rapid zzso of zzso zzso in septic shock zzso correlated with reductions in levels of zzso after stimulation with zzso zzso of zzso zzso was also zzso but the ability of zzso to stimulate events that lead to efficient translation of a stable zzso zzso appeared responsible for maintaining zzso zzso We conclude that zzso adaptation of septic shock zzso selectively influences signaling pathways that regulate transcription, zzso processing, and translation, leading to changes in the balance of production of zzso and zzso zzso
