zzso cells produce zzso oxide zzso by zzso of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso of zzso NO zzso zzso We explored the effect of zzso zzso a compound derived from zzso on tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso in human zzso vein zzso cells zzso and explored the signal pathways involved by using zzso and Western zzso zzso suppressed zzso expression of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation and nuclear factor zzso zzso nuclear zzso which were required for NO gene zzso Exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting zzso of such a signal zzso might be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso significantly inhibited NO zzso Furthermore, zzso obviously suppressed zzso zzso zzso and the downstream zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is an upstream key regulator in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso of zzso and zzso Our data indicate that zzso might repress zzso zzso at least in part, through its zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
