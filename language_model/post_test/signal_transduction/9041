The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was investigated in plants differing in tolerance to zzso The zzso was measured by zzso zzso in single zzso loaded with the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso led to a fast zzso zzso significant zzso of zzso in rice leaf zzso A tenfold drop in the external zzso concentration (to zzso resulted in considerable decrease of the zzso zzso Rice root zzso reacted upon zzso with higher zzso zzso of plasma membrane zzso zzso and zzso and zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso red and zzso zzso reduced the zzso zzso in zzso Wheat zzso responded to zzso by smaller changes of zzso In wheat leaf zzso the zzso of the zzso little depended on the external level of zzso Wheat root zzso were characterized by a small shift of zzso under zzso zzso zzso zzso had little effect on the zzso of zzso zzso in wheat zzso zzso rice zzso absorbed zzso from the external medium under zzso zzso On the contrary, wheat zzso were characterized by leakage of zzso zzso abolished the zzso influx in rice roots and zzso zzso from wheat zzso zzso zzso zzso was high particularly in rice, a zzso zzso In conclusion, both external and internal zzso stores are important for zzso zzso zzso in rice, whereas the zzso wheat does not require external sources for zzso zzso Leaf and root zzso similarly responded to zzso independent of their organ zzso
