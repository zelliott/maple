We employed zzso zzso zzso to monitor zzso zzso zzso signals in zzso mouse pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso signals start at the zzso cell pole and subsequently spread toward the zzso zzso zzso waves zzso by stimulation of zzso zzso receptors zzso with 20 zzso zzso spread with a slower rate than those induced by zzso of zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso with 10 zzso zzso However, the magnitude of the initial zzso release was the same at both zzso zzso suggesting that the secondary zzso release from zzso stores is modulated by zzso of different zzso pathways in response to low and high zzso zzso Our experiments suggest that the propagation of zzso waves is modulated by protein zzso C zzso and zzso acid zzso The data indicate that zzso zzso are linked to zzso C zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso are coupled to zzso and zzso D zzso zzso The products of zzso and zzso zzso AA and zzso zzso cause zzso of zzso wave propagation by yet unknown zzso
