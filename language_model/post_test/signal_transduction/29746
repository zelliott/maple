zzso zzso regulate tissue repair and zzso in the zzso To zzso transcript levels in these cells we performed a comprehensive gene expression study using serial analysis of gene expression zzso Among zzso zzso tags we could identify zzso unique zzso A comparison of zzso data from cardiac zzso with data derived from total mouse heart revealed a number of zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed a specific collection of zzso zzso proteins and zzso growth factors, and components of signaling zzso The zzso signaling zzso was represented by the zzso for zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso type I zzso zzso and, interestingly, the zzso protein zzso The expression of zzso I was verified by zzso and Western zzso To establish a functional role for zzso I in cardiac zzso we studied its effect on cell zzso Selective zzso of zzso I with a zzso analog inhibited the proliferation of zzso cardiac zzso which express zzso I, but not higher passage zzso which contain no zzso zzso zzso Currently, our data suggest that zzso I mediates the zzso effects of the zzso zzso on cardiac zzso zzso zzso the zzso library of transcripts expressed in cardiac zzso provides a basis for future investigations into the pathological regulatory mechanisms underlying cardiac zzso
