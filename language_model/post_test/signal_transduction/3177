Little is known about the effect of zzso on zzso which are important zzso cells in immune and allergic zzso 

This study aimed at revealing the role of zzso hormone zzso on zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso receptors and zzso zzso was analyzed by means of zzso Western zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso Signal zzso studies included zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was assessed based on zzso surface expression and zzso zzso 

zzso expression was zzso in zzso isolated from human peripheral blood, as well as in zzso within zzso zzso In isolated zzso from human blood, truncated zzso transcripts were present, but there was no zzso zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso increased zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso doses zzso suppressed zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso or grass zzso zzso in whole blood of healthy or allergic subjects, zzso The effect of zzso on zzso zzso was zzso zzso (as shown by blockade with a zzso analogue of zzso zzso and imitated by zzso hormone but not zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso both of which lack the central zzso of zzso Moreover, zzso at zzso doses significantly suppressed zzso of 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings highlight a novel functional activity of zzso which acts as a natural zzso zzso zzso These findings might point to novel therapeutic strategies in treating allergic zzso
