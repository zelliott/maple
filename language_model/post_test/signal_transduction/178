Using the zzso we previously identified a central function for zzso during zzso blood vessel zzso Here, we explored the nature of zzso function during zzso zzso A close examination of individual zzso cell behavior revealed that zzso is required for proper zzso cell migration and zzso Because these events are largely zzso by zzso zzso we investigated the relationship between zzso and the zzso zzso We discovered that zzso zzso caused an abnormal increase and zzso of total zzso protein suggesting that zzso is required for the appropriate zzso of zzso zzso we linked zzso function to the zzso zzso by efficiently rescuing the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso protein or zzso Combining the strategic zzso of zzso throughout the vascular basement membrane along with its growth zzso ability, we hypothesized a major role for zzso during the establishment of the zzso zzso which provides the zzso cues to zzso cells during zzso In support of this hypothesis we demonstrated that human zzso bound in a zzso zzso fashion to zzso Moreover, zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso our results indicate that zzso coordinates zzso zzso through zzso of zzso signaling zzso The identification of zzso factors, such as zzso and their role in zzso development will not only enhance overall understanding of the molecular basis of zzso but may also provide new insight into zzso therapeutic zzso
