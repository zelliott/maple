zzso is a frequent side effect of zzso contrast media, partially due to a direct effect on vascular smooth zzso Our purpose was therefore to examine any possible implication of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways in contrast media induced zzso 

zzso segments of zzso zzso arteries were zzso with 10 zzso zzso and relaxed with zzso before and after blockade of the zzso and zzso zzso 

80 zzso and 160 zzso of zzso significantly relaxed about zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso rings, zzso 10 zzso of zzso a zzso zzso did not increase the zzso effect of 80 zzso zzso but increased the relaxations induced by 400 zzso zzso by about zzso times (which stimulates the production of zzso and by 1 zzso sodium zzso (which stimulates the production of zzso 1 zzso of zzso (an inhibitor of the zzso protein zzso was able to reduce the relaxation induced by 4 zzso zzso by about zzso times but had no significant effect on the relaxation induced by 160 zzso zzso 10 zzso of zzso (an inhibitor of the soluble zzso zzso could reduce the relaxation induced by 10 zzso of zzso but not the one induced by 160 zzso zzso Moreover, the absence of zzso cells did not alter the relaxation induced by zzso 

The zzso of the zzso and zzso pathways are not involved in the in zzso relaxation induced by zzso in zzso zzso zzso
