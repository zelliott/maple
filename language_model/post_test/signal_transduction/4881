There is an increasing appreciation of the zzso nature of many bacterial infections such as those associated with zzso zzso zzso and of the potentially important role for zzso interactions in influencing both bacterial zzso and response to zzso Patients with zzso are often zzso with zzso zzso and other pathogens including zzso zzso and zzso zzso These latter bacteria produce signal molecules of the zzso signal factor zzso family, which are zzso fatty zzso We have previously shown by in zzso studies that zzso from zzso zzso leads to altered zzso formation and increased resistance to antibiotics by zzso zzso these responses of zzso zzso require the sensor zzso zzso Here we show that zzso signals are present in zzso taken from patients with zzso zzso of these zzso signals was correlated with patient colonization by zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso Analysis of 50 clinical zzso of zzso zzso showed that each responded to the presence of synthetic zzso by increased zzso resistance and these strains demonstrated little sequence variation in the zzso zzso In animal experiments using zzso zzso zzso regulator knockout mice, the presence of zzso promoted zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso resistance of zzso zzso zzso grown on human airway zzso cells was enhanced in the presence of zzso Taken together, these data provide substantial evidence that zzso zzso bacterial interactions occur in the zzso lung and may influence the efficacy of zzso treatment, particularly for chronic infections involving persistence of zzso
