In spontaneously zzso zzso the zzso zzso surge is initiated on the day of zzso by a timed, zzso signal originating from the zzso clock in the zzso nucleus zzso The present studies explored whether zzso is part of the essential neural circuit linking the zzso to the zzso system to stimulate zzso in Syrian zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit an zzso daily pattern of cellular activity consistent with a role in the zzso control of the zzso zzso The zzso targets zzso zzso via zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso Because zzso administration can only stimulate the zzso surge during a restricted time of day, we examined the possibility that the response to zzso is gated at the level of zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were assessed after the administration of zzso during the morning (when zzso is incapable of initiating the zzso zzso and the afternoon (when zzso injections stimulate the zzso zzso zzso but not zzso cellular activity was zzso after morning injections of zzso suggesting that zzso sensitivity to zzso signaling is gated within zzso but not zzso zzso In support of this possibility, we found that the zzso system exhibits pronounced daily changes in sensitivity to zzso zzso with zzso sensitivity in the zzso Together these studies reveal a novel mechanism of zzso control with interactions among the zzso system, zzso zzso and a zzso gating mechanism of zzso
