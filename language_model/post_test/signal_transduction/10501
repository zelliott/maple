The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is crucial for some forms of synaptic zzso by inducing various cell responses via zzso to various types of G zzso Upon zzso zzso an active zzso zzso of the zzso domain is zzso which zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso resulting in the initiation of downstream zzso We have confirmed that zzso functionally interacts with both zzso and zzso zzso a combination of fluorescent indicators showed that zzso increased zzso zzso and zzso concentration zzso and zzso By contrast, zzso a different type of zzso whose recognition site on zzso is distinct from the zzso site, increased only zzso and the zzso curve was zzso zzso analysis revealed that a low concentration of zzso induced zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso as does zzso whereas a high concentration of zzso reversed the zzso efficiency, which was consistent with a zzso relationship between concentration and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso an active and a sort of zzso zzso in zzso The zzso active state is considered to zzso to the zzso zzso revealed by previous zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso state coupled both to zzso and zzso proteins whereas the zzso zzso zzso state preferred zzso to zzso suggesting that zzso serves not only as a simple zzso switch but also as a multiple signaling path zzso
