In order to sense and respond to the fluctuating light conditions, higher plants possess several families of zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are responsible for zzso and play a role in zzso zzso and zzso growth regulation of zzso In tomato zzso zzso controls zzso development, flowering time, fruit zzso content as well as the zzso zzso of several other zzso zzso We applied large-scale molecular approaches to identify altered transcripts and proteins in tomato zzso zzso versus a zzso zzso transgenic zzso under a zzso zzso Our results showed that tomato zzso profoundly affects both gene and protein expression in response to daily light zzso Particularly altered molecular pathways are related to zzso stress, photosynthesis, including components of the light and dark reactions and of starch and zzso zzso as well as to secondary zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso One of the most interesting results is the coordinated zzso in the transgenic zzso of a consistent number of transcripts and proteins involved in zzso and zzso It is conceivable that light zzso the energetic metabolism of tomato through a fine zzso zzso zzso
