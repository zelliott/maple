zzso syndrome zzso is an zzso disorder characterized by chronic inflammation and destruction of zzso and zzso zzso leading to dry mouth, dry eyes, and the presence of zzso zzso Despite modern advances, the current therapies for SS have no permanent zzso A potential treatment could involve the use of zzso which are highly potent zzso zzso zzso that are zzso during the resolution of inflammation to restore tissue zzso Our previous studies indicate that zzso the zzso for zzso is expressed and active in the rat zzso cell line zzso Specifically, zzso of zzso with zzso blocked inflammatory signals caused by zzso and enhanced zzso zzso zzso The goal of this study was to investigate zzso zzso expression and signaling pathways in primary zzso zzso Additionally, we determined the role of the zzso zzso analog zzso a more chemically stable zzso zzso zzso in prevention of zzso zzso inflammation in mouse zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso is expressed in zzso and is able to elicit zzso zzso responses and zzso of zzso as well as zzso Given that these signaling pathways are linked to cell survival, we investigated whether zzso was able to prevent programmed cell death in zzso Specifically, we determined that zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso is expressed in human minor zzso zzso with and without zzso indicating the potential therapeutic use of zzso for this zzso
