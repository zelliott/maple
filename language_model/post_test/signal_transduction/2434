This manuscript presents a brief overview of the physiology and cell biology of the zzso which is the basis for understanding the role of zzso cells in pathological processes as diverse as zzso zzso zzso and multiple organ zzso Following consideration of general aspects of zzso function in regulating zzso vascular tone and growth, special emphasis will be placed on zzso regulation of the inflammatory response, which zzso on the zzso A particular role in inflammation is played by cell zzso molecules zzso expressed both on zzso and blood zzso Cell and molecular biological methods to investigate the expression of zzso in zzso cells in zzso will be zzso as well as novel data, indicating that zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso may involve signal zzso pathways other than those culminating in the zzso of zzso zzso Finally, the phenomenon of zzso will be briefly reviewed as a characteristic of zzso cell activity of central importance to both physiology and pathology and new experimental data presented from an in zzso model to study the ability of individual zzso cells to form zzso zzso In comparative studies to investigate the roles of vascular zzso growth factor zzso and basic zzso growth factor, the dominant role of zzso in the formation of zzso networks could be unequivocally zzso
