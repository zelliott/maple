zzso zzso protein zzso is a zzso zzso with remote similarity to the family of zzso factors zzso In a zzso zzso screen designed to identify proteins interacting with zzso we isolated a partial zzso of the zzso zzso zzso exchange factor zzso zzso its N zzso and most of the zzso domain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibited a higher affinity to zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Similarly, full-length zzso was specifically zzso to zzso loaded with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso the latter exhibiting the lowest binding zzso zzso of zzso but not of zzso in zzso cells reduced the zzso from zzso green fluorescent protein fused with zzso or zzso in plasma zzso as detected by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso inhibited the zzso D zzso activity zzso by zzso and zzso in a system of isolated zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso cells with zzso or zzso but not zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso induced zzso stimulation and zzso of zzso from zzso to zzso These data suggest that the zzso form of zzso specifically binds zzso and that zzso may be involved in a zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso
