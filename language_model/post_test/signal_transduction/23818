Breast cancer is a large global health burden and the most frequently diagnosed zzso in women zzso Here, we zzso zzso mice to interrogate the role of regulator of G protein signaling 6 zzso localized to the zzso zzso in mouse and human breast, as a novel tumor zzso in zzso zzso mice exhibit accelerated zzso zzso tumor initiation and zzso as well as decreased overall zzso Analysis of zzso aberrations in the zzso zzso of zzso mice revealed a failure of the DNA damage response concurrent with zzso zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso suppressed cell growth induced by either human zzso growth factor zzso 2 or zzso zzso zzso in both zzso breast cancer cells and zzso zzso cells zzso zzso isolated from zzso mice also showed a deficit in zzso zzso zzso zzso oxygen species generation and zzso confirming that zzso is required for effective zzso of the DNA damage response in these cells, a critical zzso against zzso zzso zzso The ability of zzso to simultaneously enhance zzso zzso signaling and suppress zzso cell growth likely zzso the accelerated zzso and cellular transformation observed in zzso zzso mice and isolated zzso zzso Unsurprisingly, spontaneous tumor formation was also seen in old female zzso but not in zzso zzso Our finding that zzso is zzso in all human breast cancer zzso independent of their molecular zzso indicates that obtaining a means to restore the growth zzso and zzso actions of zzso in breast might be a viable means to treat a large spectrum of breast zzso
