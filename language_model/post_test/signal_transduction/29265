zzso zzso zzso has been shown to induce zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso characterizes airway inflammatory disease such as zzso allergic zzso However, little is known about the effect of zzso on zzso gene zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of zzso on zzso gene expression in cultured zzso cells zzso zzso 

zzso cells were treated with zzso for 2 or 6 zzso zzso gene zzso was mainly used for zzso protein levels were measured using an zzso zzso zzso 

zzso significantly increased zzso gene zzso activity in a zzso zzso zzso which is a selective zzso of zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso gene zzso activity in a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso activity was also suppressed by a zzso inhibitor zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso inhibitor zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso an zzso signal regulated zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and a nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso 

These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso gene zzso via a signaling zzso involving zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
