The zzso concept, now more than century old, remains the core concept in understanding the mechanisms of disease causality and drug zzso Originally formulated in the early 1900s, zzso theory has evolved in both detail and complexity as the tools of molecular biology and increasingly sophisticated research technologies have facilitated the study of zzso zzso interactions at the molecular zzso The result has been a more detailed and nuanced understanding of the parameters of drug action that together with knowledge of the zzso nature of cellular targets and associated signaling pathways has reshaped the zzso zzso zzso to the basic zzso view of zzso function, concepts like zzso inverse zzso biased signaling and compound residence time have provided a broader understanding of zzso interactions to better inform drug discovery zzso The iteration of descriptive data from pharmacological experiments to provide generic zzso of affinity and efficacy can now be used to predict expected zzso effects in other zzso systems where the sensitivity of the latter to drug effects zzso via expression levels of cell surface receptors or zzso in the efficiency with which those receptors are coupled to zzso zzso zzso can be zzso
