zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which signals through a specific cell surface zzso zzso Only one chain, that for zzso binding zzso or zzso was identified zzso We report here that, although human zzso binds to the human zzso chain expressed in zzso cells, it does not induce signal zzso However, the zzso of zzso a zzso protein of previously unknown function belonging to the class II zzso zzso family, together with the zzso chain renders zzso cells sensitive to zzso The zzso complex was detected by zzso to labeled zzso In addition, the zzso chain was able to be zzso with zzso zzso when peripheral blood zzso cells were treated with zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso chain is part of the zzso zzso signaling zzso Thus, the zzso chain, which we designate as the zzso or zzso chain, serves as an accessory chain essential for the active zzso zzso complex and to initiate zzso signal zzso zzso
