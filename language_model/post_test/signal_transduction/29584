A protocol is described for validation of implanted oxygen sensors, in which sensors are zzso in the gas phase where concentration boundary layers are zzso zzso prior to sensor zzso and confirmation after sensor zzso allows separation of tissue mass transfer effects from sensor zzso and zzso A model is given here that describes the zzso signal current in terms of oxygen mass transfer to the zzso zzso of the sensor zzso and zzso zzso The zzso used in the model to describe mass transfer to implanted sensors is consistent with experimental observations and allows comparisons with zzso zzso This method provides a bridge between the complementary approaches of empirical zzso and zzso calculation for determining oxygen concentration from the sensor zzso
