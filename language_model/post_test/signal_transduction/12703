zzso circuits may be triggered by molecules originating from the environment zzso nutrients and zzso zzso also actively probe the environment for information by releasing molecular zzso to measure conditions beyond the cell surface: a process known as zzso zzso the environment beyond is achieved by sensing environmentally induced changes in those zzso as occurs when a zzso zzso an iron atom or a zzso signal is zzso by a specific zzso or zzso This information, captured by chemical and physical changes induced in specifically produced molecules zzso through the environment, enables bacteria to mount a zzso appropriate zzso
