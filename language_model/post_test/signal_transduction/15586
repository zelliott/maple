zzso calcium overload is considered to be a key zzso factor for zzso zzso however, there are other signal molecules produced in response to zzso zzso The present study investigated the zzso signal pathway, which is associated with cerebral zzso in a zzso zzso 

Male zzso rats were subjected to 10-minute zzso zzso zzso a blocker of zzso channels, or zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso production in the zzso and de zzso zzso respectively, were zzso to the rats prior to inducing zzso zzso levels were determined by zzso protein activity was assessed by zzso and zzso activity was measured using a protein zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso data indicated that zzso zzso production was largely restricted to zzso cells in the rat zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso blocked the zzso zzso and its downstream zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso the zzso pathway, which involves zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso this may play a significant role in cerebral zzso zzso
