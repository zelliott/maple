While skeletal muscle protein zzso during resistance training zzso zzso zzso is thought to result from zzso translation initiation zzso this concept is based on responses to a single bout of unaccustomed resistance exercise zzso with no measure of zzso across zzso Further, aging appears to affect acute responses to zzso but whether age differences in responsiveness persist during zzso leading to impaired zzso adaptation is zzso We therefore tested whether muscle protein fractional synthesis rate zzso and zzso target of zzso zzso signaling in response to unaccustomed zzso differed in old zzso young adults, and whether age differences in acute responsiveness were associated with differences in muscle zzso after 16 zzso of zzso Fifteen old and 21 young adult subjects completed the zzso zzso The zzso states of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso initiation factor zzso zzso binding protein zzso zzso and zzso were all elevated zzso 24 h after a bout of unaccustomed zzso A zzso zzso increase in zzso was found in a subset (6 old, 8 zzso Age zzso time interaction was found only for zzso zzso zzso in old subjects zzso while there was an interaction trend zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso in young subjects zzso After 16 zzso of zzso gains in muscle mass, type II zzso size, and voluntary strength were similar in young and old zzso In conclusion, at the level of zzso zzso we found no evidence of impaired responsiveness among older adults, and for the first time, we show that changes in zzso signaling after unaccustomed zzso were associated with substantial muscle protein zzso zzso during continued zzso
