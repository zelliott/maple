zzso is a pivotal signaling zzso involved in the regulation of zzso In order to further zzso the role of zzso in blood vessel development, a zzso transgenic system was zzso to zzso activate zzso signaling in zzso cells to examine transcript expression changes associated with zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso over the course of 6 weeks led to a zzso increase in zzso density without affecting overall heart zzso zzso expression profiles in the hearts were analyzed with an zzso zzso Mouse zzso Set 430 zzso which represents approximately 45,000 zzso and zzso A total of 248 transcripts were zzso expressed between transgenic and control mice zzso change zzso false discovery rate zzso zzso P zzso zzso A subset of these zzso expressed transcripts included zzso growth factors, zzso and zzso zzso zzso More specifically, these transcripts included zzso zzso and zzso tissue growth factor, each of which is implicated in blood vessel growth and the maintenance of vessel wall zzso Furthermore, these factors may be involved in an zzso feedback system, one believed to promote vessel zzso zzso of these and other targets could be used to treat zzso heart disease, a disease whose broad spectrum of manifestations range from patients with only zzso angina without zzso damage, through stages of zzso zzso that are associated with zzso and irreversible impairment in left zzso function, to states of irreversible zzso injury and necrosis resulting in zzso heart failure zzso
