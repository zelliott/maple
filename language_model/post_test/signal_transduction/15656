In the human zzso pathogen zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is important for adaptation and growth in zzso host zzso In this study, we characterize the zzso zzso zzso A zzso and its zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso is a functionally zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and that zzso zzso zzso within its predicted first zzso zzso Gene expression analysis revealed that zzso is required for both zzso and zzso gene transcription, indicating that other zzso of zzso may zzso Using gas zzso we showed that zzso and zzso are required for both zzso and hypoxic zzso zzso and therefore cells lacking zzso or zzso are defective for growth in the presence of low levels of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso our studies demonstrated zzso effects of zzso and zzso towards zzso and zzso cells, demonstrating that the zzso zzso is required for both growth and survival in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso Given the need for zzso drugs, we propose that zzso of zzso zzso or other regulators of zzso function administered in combination with a zzso synthesis inhibitor could prove an effective zzso zzso
