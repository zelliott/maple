In zzso zzso the onset of zzso is zzso through the zzso initiation network zzso signaling zzso Similarly, in budding zzso the onset of budding is zzso through the zzso exit network zzso zzso We previously characterized in zzso signaling elements zzso zzso closely related to the core elements zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso Our first results suggested that a plant signaling zzso must be used to coordinate zzso exit with zzso This review questioned the value of such an hypothesis in a zzso zzso The core elements zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso pathways were only detected in zzso plants and zzso We also noticed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed two zzso in zzso Although zzso genes complement zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins interact with zzso zzso zzso plants do not use these core elements to coordinate the termination of cell division with zzso zzso regulation and expression data suggest a function for the plant zzso elements in the control of cell type zzso zzso the evolutionary conservation of an ancient signaling zzso provides evidence that evolution has recycled regulatory elements for zzso a new signaling zzso
