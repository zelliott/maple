zzso is a zzso and zzso zzso zzso that is required for zzso beta cell proliferation and zzso zzso and zzso hormones elicit beta cell insulin zzso and promote synergistic zzso activity by inducing the nuclear zzso of zzso (also known as zzso a zzso for zzso In zzso cells under zzso conditions when zzso activity is low, zzso is zzso and zzso in the zzso by zzso zzso In response to feeding zzso zzso is zzso enters the nucleus, and binds to zzso located at target gene zzso The zzso of zzso at zzso in response to zzso is insufficient to account for the dynamics of zzso zzso and zzso activity in zzso zzso Here, we identify zzso of zzso as a zzso binding site that is zzso under low zzso conditions and which becomes zzso by zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso of zzso is essential for both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in beta cells and zzso Using a zzso screen of 180 human protein zzso we identified zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso as a zzso zzso that blocks zzso zzso Taken together, these data provide the zzso underpinning for how zzso and zzso zzso promote a zzso program critical for zzso cell survival, and identifies zzso as a potential target for diabetes zzso
