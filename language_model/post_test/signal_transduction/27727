zzso zzso structures at the ends of zzso are essential for maintaining zzso zzso Most tumor cells contain zzso a zzso that zzso zzso repeats, and it plays an essential role in indefinite zzso To better understand regulatory mechanisms of zzso in relationship with zzso and the cell cycle, we examined zzso activity in zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso multiple myeloma cell line, using a zzso zzso When zzso cells were cultured in zzso media, the addition of zzso resulted in zzso of the cells, but with no influence on zzso zzso When zzso was added to the culture with serum plus zzso after serum zzso zzso transition was inhibited and zzso activity was lower compare to findings in culture with no zzso zzso response experiments of zzso and zzso and the measurement of zzso activity of sorted cells in zzso using zzso demonstrated a higher activity of zzso in the samples which contained a larger proportion of cells in zzso These data indicate that regulation of zzso activity is closely related to cell cycle status, in particular cells in zzso have an high zzso zzso While zzso play an important role in cellular zzso the regulation of zzso is independent from zzso signals induced by zzso in myeloma zzso
