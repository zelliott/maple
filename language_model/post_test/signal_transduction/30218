The authors review the clinical, zzso zzso zzso and molecular aspects of zzso disease zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso disease is a unique disease characterized by multiple bone zzso associated with a peculiar form of zzso that leads to zzso and precocious death usually during the fifth decade of zzso The diagnosis can be established on the basis of clinical and zzso zzso Recently, molecular analysis of affected families revealed zzso in the zzso zzso or zzso zzso providing an interesting example how zzso in two different zzso of a zzso zzso complex result in an identical human disease zzso The association of zzso with zzso in the zzso or zzso genes has led to improved diagnosis of affected zzso Also, the possible roles of the zzso signaling zzso in zzso and zzso in humans are just beginning to be zzso Some aspects of this peculiar signaling zzso are discussed zzso
