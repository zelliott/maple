Hu zzso R zzso is a central zzso protein regulating cell zzso zzso and survival, which are well-established hallmarks of zzso zzso is frequently zzso in tumors zzso with tumor zzso which is in line with a role for zzso in zzso However, the precise mechanism leading to changes in zzso expression remains zzso In the liver, zzso plays a crucial role in zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here, we unraveled a novel mean of regulation of zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso and colon zzso zzso levels correlate with the abundance of the zzso zzso double minute 2 zzso in human zzso and colon cancer zzso zzso is stabilized by zzso zzso in at least three zzso zzso ensuring its nuclear zzso and protection from zzso 

This novel zzso regulatory framework is essential for the zzso transformation of tumor cells, which, in turn, unveils a novel signaling paradigm that is zzso amenable for cancer zzso
