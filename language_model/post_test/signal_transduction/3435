While zzso zzso zzso is known to protect against a wide range of inflammatory zzso its zzso mechanisms are not well zzso Furthermore, zzso protective effects against saturated dietary fats have not been previously zzso In this study, we used zzso cells to demonstrate that while zzso acid activates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the major protein component of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Further, vascular zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso and zzso markers zzso zzso induced by 24 weeks of a zzso diet containing cholesterol zzso is reduced in human zzso zzso transgenic zzso mice compared to zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso mice on zzso compared to a zzso diet display increased gene expression of zzso raft markers such as zzso and zzso and inflammatory zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso in the zzso However zzso transgenic mice on zzso show markedly reduced expression of these zzso Finally, we show that in zzso cells zzso is recruited into zzso zzso in response to zzso and that zzso prevents zzso zzso trafficking into zzso zzso thereby blocking zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso might be a useful therapeutic tool against vascular zzso
