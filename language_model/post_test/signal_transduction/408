zzso 1 zzso is a key zzso zzso that is functionally zzso across a wide range of species, including plants, bacteria, and zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the reduction of zzso zzso and zzso In contrast to small molecular zzso such as zzso and zzso that can reduce a wide range of oxidized zzso zzso reduces only selected proteins via specific zzso zzso zzso has been shown to regulate numerous signal zzso zzso and its zzso have been implicated in several diseases, including cancer, zzso and neurodegenerative and cardiovascular zzso Identification of zzso target proteins may help to identify novel signaling mechanisms that are important for zzso zzso zzso In this study, we performed an zzso zzso study for the identification of zzso target proteins from the hearts of a cardiac specific zzso transgenic mouse model zzso zzso proteins were distinguished from zzso proteins by comparison of the zzso results with those obtained using a parallel zzso zzso tags for relative and absolute zzso protein expression zzso We were able to identify 78 putative zzso reductive sites in 55 zzso Interestingly we identified a few protein functional networks that had not been shown previously to be regulated by zzso including the zzso zzso the zzso zzso transition pore complex, and the cardiac zzso zzso The results presented here suggest that in addition to a general zzso function, zzso may be involved in the coordination of a wide array of cellular functions for maintaining proper cardiac energy dynamics and zzso muscle zzso
