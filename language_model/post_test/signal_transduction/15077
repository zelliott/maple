zzso of bone zzso zzso cells zzso improves animal neurological functional recovery after zzso But the mechanism remains zzso As cell cycle machinery plays an important role in stroke, we investigated the dynamic changes of cell cycle elements in a rat model of middle cerebral artery zzso We found the cell cycle zzso zzso along with its zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso increased after brain zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso on zzso the zzso zzso complex mutual target, was zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso facilitated zzso zzso zzso and zzso decrease in the zzso zzso Meanwhile, zzso zzso was completely zzso On the contrary, zzso zzso inhibitor zzso reduced before but enhanced after zzso zzso These findings suggested zzso might zzso cell cycle progression in injured brain via zzso of the zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso of zzso zzso These results provide another way by which zzso may contribute to the recovery from zzso
