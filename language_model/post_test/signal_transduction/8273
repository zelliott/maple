We study the influence of the structural diversity of cells on zzso zzso signals in coupled zzso zzso The zzso of the cellular structural zzso zzso is employed to characterize the structural zzso It is found that structural diversity enhances the cellular ability to detect zzso weak signals through zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso spikes zzso a maximum with a variation of zzso indicating the occurrence of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the effects of the level of zzso stimulus and zzso zzso strength on the behavior of zzso dynamics are also zzso Analysis indicates that these phenomena have inherent relevance to both the zzso feature of a single cell and zzso interaction through zzso zzso Our findings may exhibit that structural diversity plays a constructive role in biological zzso
