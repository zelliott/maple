zzso A clone of the rat zzso cell line zzso was treated with nerve growth factor zzso for 4-6 days and used to study zzso and zzso zzso release from zzso zzso zzso The zzso store can be depleted by zzso zzso release zzso while the zzso release is zzso by zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso release from these zzso stores on zzso free zzso zzso was measured by means of zzso single cell zzso zzso zzso application caused no or only a small zzso release in zzso cells in normal culture zzso The zzso pool could be filled by zzso entry into cells through either zzso zzso channels or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso application produced substantial zzso release in zzso cells in normal culture zzso The response was enhanced after zzso of the zzso The zzso release of zzso also caused depletion of the zzso pool by zzso However, zzso released from the zzso store was not zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso rise in zzso was blocked by zzso in a zzso zzso In addition, a substantial zzso zzso block resulted from the zzso rise of zzso and subsequent zzso By contrast, the zzso rise of zzso caused only a marginal zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest an enhancement of the zzso zzso rise in the zzso by zzso from the zzso zzso zzso A mathematical model adequately simulates our experimental zzso
