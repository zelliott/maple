zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso constitute an enigmatic zzso protein family that is united by a signature domain that binds zzso zzso and possibly other zzso zzso The human zzso contains 12 zzso family members zzso while that of the budding zzso zzso zzso encodes seven zzso zzso zzso Of these, zzso (also referred to as zzso has been the most widely studied to zzso Recently, three-dimensional crystal structures of zzso with and without zzso bound within the core of the protein were zzso The core consists of 19 zzso zzso that form a near-complete zzso Recent work has suggested that zzso proteins facilitate the zzso transport of zzso in zzso and in zzso while other evidence supports a role for zzso proteins in the regulation of zzso transport and zzso zzso This article will review recent advances in the study of zzso proteins and will discuss future research issues regarding the zzso zzso
