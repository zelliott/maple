The zzso effects of natural killer zzso cells and their ability to zzso zzso require synergistic signals from specific pairs of zzso zzso such as zzso (also known as zzso and zzso zzso which bind to distinct zzso present on target zzso These signals are required to overcome zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso exchange factor zzso which promotes zzso of zzso zzso Here, we showed that the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso of 76 zzso was required for this zzso and that distinct zzso zzso in zzso were zzso by each member of a pair of synergistic zzso Selective zzso of zzso 113 or zzso 128 in zzso enabled binding of zzso to zzso Selective zzso of zzso at these zzso was restricted to receptors that zzso zzso target cell zzso zzso stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso promoted zzso at both zzso zzso and zzso experiments with zzso zzso proteins showed the distinct role of each zzso in the synergistic zzso of zzso revealing an unexpected degree of selectivity in the zzso of zzso by zzso cell zzso zzso Together, these data suggest that combined zzso of separate zzso zzso in zzso forms the basis of synergistic zzso cell zzso
