In cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is induced with the rapid zzso of a primary response zzso Like many other primary response gene zzso the zzso zzso possesses zzso elements and is believed to be zzso The rapid induction of a short-lived transcript could be achieved zzso by zzso increases in zzso zzso zzso the present study was undertaken to evaluate whether the alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a known zzso of zzso zzso could stabilize the zzso zzso and, if so, what signaling pathways might be zzso In primary zzso cells treated with a zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso was found to be about 1 h in the absence of zzso however, in the presence of zzso the zzso increased to 5 zzso It was shown that neither the zzso zzso zzso zzso nor the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso stabilization of the zzso zzso However, either the protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso some blockade of the stabilizing effects of zzso While zzso doses of zzso zzso nearly completely blocked zzso zzso stabilization was only partially zzso Moreover, zzso doses of zzso zzso which only partially blocked zzso zzso nearly completely inhibited zzso Thus, while zzso appears to be required for zzso zzso stabilization, zzso seems to play a dominant role, participating through both zzso and zzso zzso These results establish roles for both the zzso and zzso families in alpha zzso zzso stabilization of the zzso zzso suggesting that the rapid induction of zzso expression might be due, in part, to this zzso increase in zzso zzso
