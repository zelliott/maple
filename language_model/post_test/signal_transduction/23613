zzso acid zzso is a zzso growth factor with multiple biological functions and has been shown to stimulate cancer cell zzso of vascular zzso growth zzso zzso and trigger zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso consisting of zzso and zzso (also known as aromatic hydrocarbon zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso is an important regulator of zzso in prostate cancer zzso through the enhancement of zzso zzso In this study, we first confirmed the ability of zzso to induce zzso expression in zzso cells and then validated that zzso zzso expression was regulated by zzso and zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso a zzso for zzso compounds, functions as a zzso factor through zzso with zzso and was found to inhibit prostate zzso and zzso zzso zzso Since zzso is a common zzso partner of zzso and zzso we hypothesized that zzso might suppress zzso zzso expression in zzso cells by competing with zzso for zzso Here we demonstrated that zzso and zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso induction by zzso treatment of zzso zzso In conclusion, our results suggested that zzso zzso may inhibit zzso zzso expression in zzso cells by attenuating zzso zzso and zzso suppressing zzso and zzso of zzso These results suggested that zzso presents a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of PC zzso
