zzso restriction zzso extends lifespan in a wide variety of species, yet the underlying mechanisms are not well zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso zzso nuclear hormone zzso zzso is required for zzso and zzso responses associated with zzso zzso zzso mediates the longevity of zzso zzso a genetic zzso of dietary zzso and zzso the longevity response of DR induced by bacterial food dilution at low zzso zzso zzso changes associated with zzso including decreased Oil Red O zzso decreased zzso levels, and increased zzso are partly reversed by zzso of zzso Additionally, the DR fatty acid profile is altered in zzso zzso zzso profiles reveal that several hundred genes induced by DR depend on the activity of zzso including a putative zzso required for the DR zzso This study provides critical evidence of nuclear hormone zzso regulation of the DR longevity response, suggesting hormonal and zzso control of life zzso
