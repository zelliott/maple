Rapid zzso effects of zzso hormones zzso and zzso on two plasma membrane transport systems were investigated in zzso and zzso chick zzso zzso The zzso zzso activity was measured using the zzso zzso fluorescent probe zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso acid transport was estimated by zzso acid zzso System A zzso acid transport zzso was linear to hormone zzso whereas the zzso zzso gave a zzso zzso curve, with a maximum at the zzso hormone concentration of 1 zzso The specificity of the effect was verified by the use of zzso and zzso The zzso hormone analog zzso was able to mimic some of the hormone effects, but with a lower zzso The effect on the zzso zzso was identified for zzso and zzso cells, whereas the zzso acid transport could only be activated at the late stage of zzso zzso Both transport systems were activated through a signal zzso zzso involving zzso zzso pathway, and zzso even though the differences in response behavior indicate a differential zzso of the two transport systems by zzso and zzso These results clearly demonstrate the existence of rapid zzso action of zzso hormones also in avian cells, and show that zzso of System A zzso acid transport is not directly correlated to changes in zzso zzso For the first time, evidence is presented which suggests that short-term effects of zzso hormones may play a role during fetal development and cell zzso
