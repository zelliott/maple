It has been recognized for a long time that engagement of B cell zzso receptors zzso on immature B cells or mature B cells leads to completely opposite cell fate zzso The underlying mechanism remains zzso Here, we show that zzso of zzso on human zzso zzso immature B cells resulted in complete zzso of cell surface zzso After loss of cell surface zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells showed impaired zzso zzso delayed zzso zzso and decreased zzso and zzso zzso which differ from those in mature zzso or Ramos B cells with partial zzso of zzso In contrast, sustained zzso and zzso of zzso upon zzso were observed in the zzso zzso cells after zzso zzso Taken together, these results show that complete zzso of cell surface zzso in zzso zzso cells specifically alters the downstream signaling events, which may favor zzso editing versus cell zzso
