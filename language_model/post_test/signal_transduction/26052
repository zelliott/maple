zzso zzso is promoted or restricted by different signaling zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity in the early embryonic zzso is a prerequisite for pancreatic zzso However, in zzso loss of zzso signaling leads to a severe reduction of zzso leading to some ambiguity as to the role of zzso during zzso development and whether its function has completely zzso between zzso Here, we have employed genetic and pharmacological zzso to temporally delineate the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso development and investigate its relationship with the zzso and zzso acid zzso signaling zzso We found that zzso is required at the start of zzso for the zzso migration and differentiation of zzso pancreatic zzso at later zzso This early positive role of zzso promotes zzso lineage differentiation by restricting the repressive effects of zzso zzso of zzso signaling in the early zzso leads to increased zzso numbers and partially rescued zzso formation in zzso zzso By the end of zzso zzso switches to a negative role by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso but continues to promote differentiation of zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso the zzso signaling components zzso and zzso in zzso zzso indicating a possible molecular mechanism for blocking zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso during the zzso zzso These results identify multiple sequential roles for zzso in zzso development and highlight an unexpected zzso relationship between zzso and other signaling pathways to control pancreatic zzso and zzso
