zzso zzso stimulates important signaling pathways in a wide range of zzso In the human zzso pathogen zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and the genes needed to zzso zzso Previous studies on the zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso has to be zzso to induce zzso zzso the role of zzso zzso was examined by deleting the genes required to zzso zzso and zzso zzso to convert it to zzso zzso zzso and zzso As expected, the zzso failed to zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso inhibited the growth of the zzso and zzso zzso in the presence of other zzso suggesting that excess zzso is zzso Interestingly, both zzso and an zzso zzso zzso triple zzso could be efficiently zzso by zzso to form zzso These zzso could also be zzso to express zzso zzso Because zzso must be zzso by zzso to be zzso and also for it to enter the anabolic pathways that form zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso indicate that zzso metabolism is not needed to induce signaling in zzso zzso Thus, these studies in zzso zzso reveal a novel role for zzso in cell signaling that may also regulate critical pathways in other zzso
