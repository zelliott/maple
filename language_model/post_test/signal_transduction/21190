The envelope protein zzso of the mouse zzso tumor virus zzso can stimulate zzso synthesis via binding to its cellular zzso on zzso zzso This effect was zzso by either zzso oxide zzso or zzso and was blocked by an NO zzso Furthermore, the effects of zzso and zzso were not additive at zzso zzso suggesting that they were using the same signaling zzso Finally, zzso elevated zzso levels in zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso activates the following zzso zzso in this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso synthesis in the zzso However, the effect was again zzso by zzso blocked by an NO zzso and the effects of zzso and NO were not zzso zzso it appears that zzso is using the zzso zzso in both zzso but that muscle tissue may be more susceptible to the toxic effects of zzso
