In the liver, genes are expressed along a zzso zzso Based on their zzso behavior, a zzso versus compartment type, and a dynamic versus stable type of zzso have been zzso To understand at least in principle the development and maintenance of these zzso in gene expression in relation to the limited number of signal zzso we propose a simple and testable zzso The model uses zzso zzso of signal molecules as zzso while the output depends on two zzso zzso zzso the affinity of the gene for its regulatory factors and the degree of zzso that determines the response in the zzso zzso As a preliminary zzso test for its performance, the model was tested on control and zzso induced expression patterns of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to determine the overall zzso of the zzso whereas zzso causes these zzso to zzso locally, as is necessary for a zzso expression zzso zzso between two or more different signal zzso is necessary to ensure a stable expression pattern under different zzso The diversity in sequence and arrangement of related zzso elements of genes appears to account for the zzso shape of the zzso zzso in zzso The feasibility of testing the function of zzso zzso units in zzso is demonstrated by zzso such units into a zzso active zzso and analyzing the pattern of expression of these zzso in transgenic zzso
