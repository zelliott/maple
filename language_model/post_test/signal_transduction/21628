zzso cells in the brain are capable of responding to hormonal zzso The zzso steroid hormone zzso in addition to its actions on zzso can directly affect zzso zzso zzso receptors have been described on both zzso and zzso suggesting a complex interplay between these two in zzso the effects of the zzso zzso sense and respond to zzso activity with a rise in zzso calcium concentration zzso Using simultaneous zzso and calcium imaging techniques, we monitored zzso activity evoked zzso zzso changes in mixed zzso cultures loaded with zzso zzso Action potential firing in zzso zzso by injecting zzso current zzso was associated with zzso zzso in zzso which could be blocked by 200 zzso zzso and also 1 zzso zzso We compared zzso zzso zzso in control and 24-hour zzso treated zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso the number of responsive zzso and the zzso wave zzso were all significantly reduced in zzso treated zzso zzso rise in zzso in response to local application of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was attenuated in zzso treated cultures, suggesting functional changes in the zzso zzso following zzso treatment with zzso Since zzso can zzso synaptic transmission by release of zzso the attenuated zzso response seen following zzso treatment could have functional consequences on zzso zzso
