The first event in the mode of action of the zzso zzso zzso is the binding to specific receptors located at the plasma zzso They are very likely related to the presence of zzso compounds able to compete with zzso for binding to its zzso Some zzso properties of these proteins conform to criteria commonly used for zzso A functional relationship between zzso receptors and the plasma membrane zzso which is assumed to be the final zzso target of zzso has been recently zzso New support in zzso of this relationship has been sought by studying a model system prepared by zzso into zzso of preparations from zzso zzso of the two zzso The model system is capable of zzso on zzso addition and the zzso is markedly zzso by zzso Thus, it represents a promising tool for the understanding of zzso signal zzso at the molecular level, since it can assist in the detection and zzso of the zzso chain components contained in the zzso protein zzso
