zzso factors are the common convergence points of signal zzso pathways to affect gene zzso Signal zzso activity results in zzso modification zzso of zzso factors and the sum of these modifications at any given time point will determine the action of the zzso zzso It has been suggested that these zzso provide a zzso factor code analogous to the zzso zzso However, the number and variety of these modifications and the lack of knowledge in general of their dynamics zzso at present a concise view of how combinations of zzso affect zzso factor zzso Also, a single type of zzso such as zzso can have opposing effects on zzso factor zzso zzso factors of the zzso box O zzso class are predominantly regulated through zzso by zzso zzso zzso B (also known as zzso zzso and a zzso oxygen zzso zzso zzso zzso Both pathways result in increased zzso zzso yet with opposing zzso Whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results in zzso of zzso Here we discuss regulation of zzso zzso factors by zzso as an example for understanding integration of signal zzso at the level of zzso zzso
