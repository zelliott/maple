In this study, we have characterized the negative regulation of the zzso zzso expression by zzso in zzso Although zzso zzso zzso promoter contains a putative zzso zzso element zzso neither zzso nor deletion of the zzso had any effect on the zzso activity of zzso The zzso zzso and zzso regulatory factor zzso induced promoter activity was suppressed by the expression of a zzso active zzso type I zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso which was zzso by expression of an zzso zzso zzso zzso of a reporter gene containing three copies of both zzso and zzso elements from the zzso zzso promoter was significantly zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, reporter containing three copies of either the zzso or zzso sites was not affected by zzso zzso These findings indicated that both the zzso and zzso sites are required for the repression of promoter activity of zzso zzso by zzso
