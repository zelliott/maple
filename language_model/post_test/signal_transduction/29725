zzso activates signaling pathways that increase the expression of zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso of skeletal zzso expression occurs during differentiation through unknown zzso The purpose of this investigation was to examine the mechanisms that zzso uses to induce skeletal zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso increased skeletal zzso promoter activity by zzso compared with the control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso of the skeletal zzso promoter by approximately zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso of the skeletal zzso promoter by zzso zzso failed to increase skeletal zzso promoter activity in zzso zzso zzso functional zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso and 30 zzso zzso increased skeletal zzso promoter activity by zzso and zzso compared with zzso or zzso conditions, zzso zzso increased zzso activity, which was inhibited by zzso zzso Further, zzso A inhibited zzso zzso of the skeletal zzso zzso zzso active zzso increased skeletal zzso promoter activity by zzso and rescued the zzso zzso of zzso zzso but failed to rescue the zzso of zzso zzso zzso nuclear factor of activated zzso zzso activity was not inhibited by zzso or zzso zzso failed to increase serum response factor zzso zzso however, serum response factor activity was reduced in the presence of zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso of the skeletal zzso promoter is regulated by the zzso zzso and zzso but independent of nuclear factor of activated zzso zzso activity as zzso zzso differentiate into zzso
