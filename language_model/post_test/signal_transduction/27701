Members of the bone zzso protein zzso family have been implicated in multiple aspects of neural development in both the zzso and peripheral nervous zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso are expressed in the developing cerebral cortex, making the zzso likely candidates for regulating cortical zzso To define the role of these factors in the developing cerebral cortex, we examined the effects of zzso and zzso on cortical cells in zzso zzso were cultured from embryonic day 13 zzso and zzso rat cerebral zzso in the absence or presence of different zzso of zzso growth factor 2, a known regulator of cortical cell proliferation and zzso At zzso the zzso promoted cell death and inhibited proliferation of cortical zzso zone cells, resulting in the generation of fewer zzso and no zzso At zzso the effects of the zzso were more zzso zzso of zzso in the range of zzso zzso promoted zzso and zzso differentiation and inhibited zzso zzso whereas 100 zzso zzso promoted cell death and inhibited zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso promoted zzso in zzso demonstrating that zzso zzso signaling influences the differentiation of cortical cells in zzso The distribution of zzso and zzso within the developing zzso suggests that local zzso of zzso and zzso define zzso of zzso signaling during zzso Together, these results support the hypothesis that the zzso and their zzso zzso zzso cortical cell fate and zzso
