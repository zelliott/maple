zzso zzso zzso is an important regulator of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso leaves in zzso zzso of zzso implicates the regulation of leaf zzso by zzso via zzso zzso Recent studies have identified zzso zzso and zzso the dominant zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, which display three types of leaf zzso However, it remains unclear whether or how zzso controls leaf zzso through the pathways zzso by these zzso To define which zzso and target genes are relevant to the zzso zzso in terms of leaf zzso the effects of three zzso zzso genes and their targets on the direction and extent of leaf zzso in zzso zzso were zzso The genetic analysis shows that the zzso zzso is strongly rescued by zzso but not by zzso or zzso whereas the zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso leaves are compromised by the zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that reduced zzso of zzso rather than of zzso or zzso causes zzso of zzso leaves, and that zzso zzso positively regulates the zzso identity gene zzso while zzso zzso zzso regulates the zzso identity gene zzso zzso In these cases, the direction and extent of leaf zzso are associated with the expression ratio of zzso to zzso genes zzso to zzso zzso zzso regulates the balance between zzso and zzso identity and zzso leaf zzso by preventing leaf zzso zzso margins, and downward zzso It is concluded that zzso monitors the roles of zzso zzso and zzso in leaf zzso through the relative activities of zzso and zzso identity zzso thus playing an essential role in leaf zzso
