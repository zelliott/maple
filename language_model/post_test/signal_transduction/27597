zzso growth factors I and II zzso and zzso are potent zzso involved in growth regulation of breast zzso cells and are implicated in the zzso of breast zzso Their zzso is enhanced or inhibited by specific zzso proteins zzso Vitamin zzso compounds zzso have been shown to inhibit proliferation and induce zzso of zzso breast zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso antagonize the zzso activity of zzso by stimulating zzso production of zzso in zzso cells, but the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling has not been zzso We report here that the vitamin D analogue zzso interferes with the zzso signaling zzso by attenuating zzso zzso zzso of zzso and to a lesser extent, zzso It does not affect protein levels of zzso zzso or zzso However, zzso does not inhibit zzso zzso of zzso induced by zzso zzso an zzso analogue with greatly reduced affinity for zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso These data strongly suggest that zzso plays a functional role in the interfering action of zzso with the zzso signal zzso zzso
