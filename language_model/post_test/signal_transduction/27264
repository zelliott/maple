zzso migration into the vessel wall is an early step in zzso Even though a number of zzso factors have been identified, the regulation of the zzso response is not clearly zzso As the release of zzso acid has been implicated in zzso zzso we studied the influence of LDL, which can supply this fatty acid to cells, on the zzso mobility of zzso zzso of human zzso zzso cells was abolished by a zzso incubation in medium containing zzso zzso fetal calf zzso zzso human zzso LDL, zzso LDL, zzso LDL, zzso free cholesterol, zzso acid, zzso acid, or zzso acid was zzso At the end of varying incubation periods zzso to 8 hours), zzso zzso and cellular cholesterol content were zzso In the same experimental setting we also studied the effects of the pharmacological agents zzso zzso and zzso acid on zzso zzso zzso was restored by LDL in a zzso and zzso manner starting at zzso as low as 5 zzso and at zzso as brief as 30 zzso The other zzso tested zzso zzso zzso LDL, and zzso zzso as well as free cholesterol had no comparable effect on zzso zzso and total cholesterol content did not differ among the zzso zzso incubation of cells with zzso zzso and zzso acid reduced zzso of zzso by LDL by zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, the agents had only slight zzso effects on the zzso mobility of zzso control zzso zzso with zzso acid showed a zzso restoration of zzso whereas zzso acid zzso zzso by zzso compared with the positive zzso zzso of LDL with the zzso zzso zzso directed against LDL resulted in a significantly reduced migratory zzso The data suggest a novel zzso regulatory mechanism of zzso by zzso
