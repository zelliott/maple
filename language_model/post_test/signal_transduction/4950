zzso contact lens zzso use and care often lead to zzso zzso zzso zzso We used mouse eyes which wore zzso as the animal model to assess the reason for zzso zzso with zzso zzso The similar and overlapping activity of vascular zzso growth factor zzso and the potent zzso zzso factor zzso zzso called for a study of the zzso relationship in the expression of these two zzso We determined the time dependent expression of zzso and correlated it to that of zzso expression in the mouse model of closed eye with zzso zzso 

Mouse eyes were fitted with zzso followed by a silk zzso zzso The anterior surface was analyzed at 4, 7, and 10 days after zzso by slit lamp and zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels were measured by reverse zzso zzso western zzso and zzso with specific zzso and zzso We used zzso targeting zzso to substantiate the link between zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso wear zzso 

zzso zzso scores increased in a time dependent manner in the model of closed eye zzso induced hypoxic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression increased in a time dependent zzso The prolonged hypoxic state brought by closed eye zzso wear induced a time dependent zzso response which was significantly attenuated by zzso specific zzso but not by zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso levels were reduced significantly in zzso zzso from eyes treated with the zzso specific zzso 

The present study documented the increased expression of zzso in the zzso zzso during zzso zzso It also demonstrated the presence of zzso in the zzso zzso and its increased expression in this zzso Altogether, the results of this study raised the possibility of interaction between zzso and zzso in zzso the zzso response induced by the prolonged hypoxic state brought about by closed eye zzso zzso The results strongly implicated zzso zzso as a component of the inflammatory and zzso cascade initiated by hypoxic and further suggested that zzso was a zzso regulator of zzso expression in this zzso
