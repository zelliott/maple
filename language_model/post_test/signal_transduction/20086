The ability of tumor cells to invade adjacent zzso is governed by a complicated network of molecular signals, most of which have not yet been zzso In a recent work, we reported that the zzso regulator zzso contributes to zzso cancer progression by powering the invasion capacity of tumor zzso 

The intent of this work was to further investigate the biology of invasive zzso tumors, through the analysis of the molecular interactions existing between zzso and some of its target genes and through the characterization of the function of these factors in the progression of zzso zzso 

We showed that zzso controls the expression of the zzso zzso I and that this zzso factor plays a central role in zzso the zzso zzso function in zzso tumor zzso We demonstrated that zzso regulates zzso migration, and zzso by zzso a panel of genes involved in zzso degradation and cellular invasion, which we previously identified as zzso target genes in zzso tumor zzso Finally, we show that zzso is strongly expressed in zzso human zzso tumors both at the primary site and in zzso 

Overall, our experiments demonstrate the existence of a previously unknown molecular axis that controls zzso tumor zzso by altering the ability of tumor cells to interact with the surrounding zzso These factors could prove to be valuable markers that permit early diagnosis of aggressive zzso zzso
