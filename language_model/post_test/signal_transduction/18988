To understand how a gene regulatory network functioning as an zzso is built, a precise mathematical description of the network and its zzso properties are developed in this zzso Our approach is based on analyzing the effect of interactions between smaller zzso with simple zzso We relate an zzso behavior of the network to the zzso phenomenon of a steady state caused by the interactions in a simple discrete zzso When source of the instability of the steady state rather than the zzso behavior itself is considered, linear stability analysis and feedback control theory can be zzso Moreover, the zzso robust against change in delay can also be obtained from the discrete zzso The main ideas are illustrated by constructing a genetic zzso termed a zzso and analyzing the occurrence of cellular zzso although the theoretical results hold for a general class of biological zzso The method can be directly applied to design, construct genetic zzso and further control their zzso even for large-scale zzso
