Today, we find ourselves in an urgent need for novel zzso drugs, as many important human pathogens have acquired multiple zzso resistance zzso Among those, zzso zzso and zzso zzso play a major role as the leading sources of zzso zzso Recently, it has been suggested to develop zzso that attack bacterial zzso rather than kill zzso Such drugs are called zzso and are believed to reduce the development of zzso zzso Specifically, zzso gene regulation zzso in bacteria has been proposed as a potential zzso While promising reports exist about zzso zzso in zzso bacteria, the use of the zzso zzso system as a drug target is now seen in an increasingly critical zzso zzso of zzso in zzso has been shown to enhance zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso system increases bacterial persistence in zzso infection, suggesting that interference with zzso would enhance rather than suppress this important type of zzso zzso The chemical nature and biological function of another proposed zzso zzso zzso named zzso are insufficiently zzso zzso zzso systems might in principle constitute a reasonable way to find novel zzso zzso However, as outlined here, this approach requires careful investigation in every specific pathogen and type of zzso
