Exposure to zzso zzso in zzso in zzso mice produces zzso zzso in male offspring when they reach zzso To help define the molecular events associated with the fetal onset of zzso zzso pregnant zzso mice were given drinking water containing 0 zzso or 85 zzso zzso from day 8 to 18 of zzso At the end of the zzso exposure period, male fetal zzso were removed and zzso isolated for zzso analysis using zzso zzso zzso zzso exposure in zzso produced significant zzso zzso in expression of zzso zzso with approximately zzso of zzso expressed genes related to either zzso signaling or steroid zzso zzso zzso on selected genes confirmed these zzso Various genes controlled by estrogen, including zzso transcript, anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and small zzso zzso were dramatically zzso zzso genes including zzso zzso and zzso were zzso although zzso was zzso Several genes involved with steroid metabolism also showed remarkable expression changes, including increased expression of zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso and decreased expression of zzso zzso in testosterone zzso The expression of key genes important in zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Thus, exposure of mouse fetus to zzso zzso during a critical period in development significantly alters the expression of various genes zzso zzso signaling and steroid or zzso zzso These zzso could disrupt genetic programming at the very early life stage, which could impact tumor formation much later in zzso
