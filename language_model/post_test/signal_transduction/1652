In zzso zzso brain patterning depends on signals from adjacent zzso For example, zzso the most common brain anomaly in humans, results from defects in signaling between the embryonic zzso plate zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso I have examined whether a similar mechanism of brain development occurs in the zzso zzso and find that the zzso and zzso act to pattern the fly embryonic zzso When the zzso and zzso of zzso are zzso brain patterning is zzso The loss of zzso expressed in the zzso appears to mediate this effect, as it does in zzso One mechanism zzso these defects occur is a disruption of normal zzso in the zzso These data argue that the last common zzso of zzso and zzso had a zzso of the brains present in modern animals, and also suggest that the zzso and zzso contributed to the patterning of this zzso They also argue that the zzso of zzso and zzso which have traditionally been assigned to different germ zzso are actually zzso
