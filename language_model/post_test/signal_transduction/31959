zzso zzso is expressed in the heart, where it zzso the zzso current that controls zzso zzso and in the pulmonary zzso where it regulates vessel zzso in response to changes in oxygen zzso zzso zzso and hypoxic pulmonary hypertension are characterized by zzso of zzso protein zzso as well as with zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid on zzso zzso of proteins is an important, dynamic mechanism for protein regulation under zzso zzso zzso is widely reported to be zzso and the channel possesses 6 potentially zzso zzso zzso We therefore hypothesized that zzso acid modification of the channel itself may regulate zzso in response to zzso zzso 

To investigate how zzso stress, via zzso modification of the channel with zzso acid, regulates trafficking and expression of zzso 

zzso studies with the zzso zzso probe zzso and zzso zzso Western zzso demonstrated a global increase in zzso zzso proteins in human patients with zzso zzso as well as zzso acid modification to zzso in the zzso Further studies showed that zzso is modified with zzso acid on a single zzso zzso zzso and the level of zzso acid increases in response to zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso zzso we found that modification of this zzso is necessary and sufficient to reduce channel surface zzso promote its zzso and block channel recycling back to the cell zzso Moreover, Western zzso demonstrated that zzso acid modification is a trigger for channel degradation under prolonged zzso zzso 

zzso acid modification to zzso which is elevated in diseased human heart, regulates zzso channel surface expression and stability under zzso stress and zzso channel from a recycling zzso to zzso This provides a molecular mechanism linking zzso stress and zzso of channel expression observed in cardiovascular zzso
