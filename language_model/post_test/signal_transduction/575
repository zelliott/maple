In this paper a hypothesis that some special signals zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides and zzso are not only involved in information handling by the zzso zzso but also trigger out substantial structural and/or functional changes in the Central zzso System zzso is zzso This forces the zzso circuits to move from one stable state towards a new state, but in doing so these signals became potentially zzso Several mechanisms are put in action to protect zzso and zzso cells from these potentially harmful zzso However, in agreement with the Red Queen zzso of zzso zzso et zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso it is proposed that during zzso these zzso processes become less effective while, in the meantime, a shortage of brain plasticity occurs together with an increased need of plasticity for repairing the wear and tear of the zzso The paper presents findings supporting the concept that such zzso in instances such as zzso may zzso neurodegenerative processes in an attempt of maximizing zzso zzso
