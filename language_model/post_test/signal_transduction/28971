zzso protein zzso zzso are activated through the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and activate their downstream zzso which in turn zzso and activate their downstream zzso zzso proteins relay upstream signals through the zzso zzso to induce cellular zzso However, the molecular mechanisms by which given zzso are regulated remain largely zzso Here, we found that zzso protein zzso 38, zzso physically interacts with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso including the zzso domain, but not the zzso zzso of zzso was necessary for the interaction with zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso without preventing zzso binding to its zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed the zzso of zzso without interfering with zzso zzso formation, and converted zzso from its zzso to its zzso zzso The negative regulation of zzso was not due to its zzso by zzso On the other hand, zzso short hairpin zzso enhanced zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of the downstream zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso zzso regulates the zzso of zzso by direct interaction with the zzso domain of zzso suggesting a novel mechanism of zzso zzso
