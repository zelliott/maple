zzso signaling zzso controls differentiation of various cells by regulating the expression of target zzso zzso plays a central role in zzso signaling zzso To investigate the molecular mechanisms of fate determination in zzso zzso stem cells zzso we investigated effects of zzso and zzso two key members of the zzso zzso in zzso differentiation of zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso protein can inhibit the zzso differentiation of zzso zzso in zzso zzso By stabilization of zzso zzso with continuous treatment by zzso the zzso differentiation of zzso was also suppressed and the osteogenesis was zzso In contrast, a loss of zzso in zzso enhanced the zzso differentiation and rescued zzso zzso In addition, the mutual zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso in the presence of zzso or zzso but increased in the gene zzso of zzso Taken together, our study indicated that zzso signaling zzso inhibited the zzso differentiation potential and alter the cell fate from zzso to zzso
