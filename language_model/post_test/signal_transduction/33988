In this study, we investigated zzso changes in cellular responses to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated that detachment of zzso cells increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signal regulated zzso zzso zzso responses without affecting the zzso zzso zzso Additionally, detachment enabled zzso zzso stimulation to inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso Such a cross talk between the two zzso systems was not observed in attached zzso zzso zzso zzso response was insensitive to zzso state of the cells, while zzso zzso response was enhanced upon zzso zzso of the zzso zzso did not appear to play a role in zzso sensitivity of zzso responses, as treatment of attached cells with zzso D did not mimic zzso zzso zzso of detachment were reversed immediately after zzso of the suspended cells on zzso coated cover zzso suggesting that the involvement of zzso or focal zzso complexes is zzso Taken zzso our results demonstrate that not only cellular responses induced by different G zzso zzso but also different responses induced by a particular G zzso zzso can be affected zzso by the zzso status of zzso This suggests an important role for cell zzso in controlling the zzso of a single G zzso zzso to different zzso zzso
