Cell zzso and zzso is of fundamental importance during development, normal physiology and zzso conditions such as tumor zzso zzso zzso proteins and their dynamic interactions play a critical role in the regulation of directed cell migration upon exposure to zzso guidance zzso Using a combination of pharmacological zzso knockout and zzso cells and zzso protein zzso we recently reported that following zzso and growth factor stimulation the dynamic interaction between zzso and zzso is regulated by zzso zzso of zzso and that this interaction is necessary for the coordination of zzso family zzso signaling controlling zzso cell polarity and thus directional zzso zzso we discuss the implications of these zzso
