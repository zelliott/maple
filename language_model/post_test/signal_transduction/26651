zzso zzso is a zzso response to low oxygen tension that increases blood supply to match zzso zzso Although this response has been characterized for zzso years, the underlying hypoxic sensing and zzso signaling mechanisms remain zzso We have shown that zzso zzso in the heart can reduce zzso to zzso oxide zzso and thereby contribute to zzso zzso signaling during zzso On the basis of recent observations that zzso is expressed in the zzso of zzso fish, we hypothesized that zzso zzso may contribute to zzso hypoxic zzso via reactions with vascular zzso to form zzso 

We show in the present study that zzso is expressed in vascular smooth muscle and contributes significantly to zzso hypoxic zzso in zzso and ex zzso The generation of zzso from zzso reduction by zzso zzso activates zzso soluble zzso zzso signaling zzso In zzso and ex zzso zzso responses, the reduction of zzso to zzso and the subsequent signal zzso mechanisms were all significantly impaired in mice without zzso zzso zzso studies in zzso and zzso and zzso NO zzso knockout models suggest that only zzso contributes to systemic hypoxic zzso responses in zzso 

zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of hypoxic zzso Its reduction to zzso via the zzso zzso zzso enhances blood flow and matches zzso supply to increased zzso demands under hypoxic zzso
