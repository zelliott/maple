Although several interventions slow the progression of diabetic zzso current therapies do not halt progression zzso Recent zzso studies suggested that zzso zzso prevents zzso in various diseases, but the mechanisms underlying its zzso action are incompletely zzso Here, we evaluated the role of zzso in regulation of the zzso zzso In mouse zzso cells, zzso decreased zzso promoter activity, reduced zzso protein zzso and inhibited zzso zzso zzso promoter activity, and generation of zzso oxygen zzso To explore the therapeutic potential of zzso we administered zzso to zzso zzso mice for 4 zzso zzso treatment significantly reduced zzso zzso expansion and expression of zzso zzso genes but did not affect zzso Using liquid zzso with subsequent zzso zzso tandem mass zzso we identified 21 proteins unique to zzso diabetic zzso Analysis of gene zzso and zzso interactions of these proteins suggested that zzso may regulate zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso promotes zzso zzso of zzso initiation factor, potentially zzso translation of zzso In conclusion, zzso is zzso in diabetic kidney disease and may exert its zzso effects, in part, via zzso zzso zzso
