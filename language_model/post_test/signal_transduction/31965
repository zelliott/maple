It has been demonstrated that zzso acids suppress growth, zzso and zzso of highly invasive and zzso breast cancer cells in zzso and zzso However, the mechanism of action of zzso acids in breast cancer remains zzso In the present study, we looked into the effect of zzso acid Me zzso on cellular zzso and tumor growth in the zzso breast cancer cell zzso The results indicated the zzso inhibited nuclear factor zzso zzso activity at 24 h in zzso zzso When zzso 231 cells were zzso with tumor necrosis zzso zzso the zzso effects of zzso were still zzso We demonstrated that zzso inhibited proliferation and invasion and induced zzso in zzso cells via suppressing the zzso zzso However, zzso did not inhibit the zzso and degradation of zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of various zzso genes including genes involved in cell proliferation zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso invasion zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso administration of zzso inhibited tumor growth of zzso cells in zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso inhibited zzso zzso invasion and induced zzso in zzso cells via suppressing zzso activity and the expression profile of its downstream zzso These findings provide evidence for a novel role of zzso in the prevention and treatment of breast cancer by its ability to zzso the zzso signaling zzso
