zzso cancer is the most lethal type of zzso cancer in the Western zzso The high case fatality rate is due in part because most zzso cancer patients present with advanced stage disease which is essentially zzso In order to obtain a whole zzso assessment of zzso gene expression in advanced zzso cancer, we used zzso zzso zzso over 40,000 features to profile 37 advanced stage zzso zzso primary zzso We identified zzso genes that were significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso regulated between the zzso cancer specimens and normal zzso surface zzso The zzso data were validated using real time zzso on 14 randomly selected zzso regulated zzso The list of zzso expressed genes includes ones that are involved in cell growth, zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, numerous genes whose function remains to be zzso were also zzso The zzso data were imported into zzso software to identify signaling pathways involved in zzso cancer zzso Based on our expression results, a signaling zzso associated with tumor cell migration, spread and invasion was identified as being activated in advanced zzso zzso The data generated in this study represent a comprehensive list of genes zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso and may be useful for the identification of potentially new and novel markers and therapeutic targets for zzso zzso
