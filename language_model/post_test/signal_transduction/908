zzso zzso cells zzso play a pivotal role in zzso tissue repair and zzso zzso has been considered a zzso signal for zzso and proliferation of zzso in zzso In the present study zzso and zzso protein zzso gene expression was studied in a model of acute liver injury induced by a single zzso dose of carbon zzso zzso in adult zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed a marked increase in zzso zzso levels, with a maximum between 3 and 9 h after zzso application, whereas steady state zzso levels of zzso were only moderately zzso In zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that this increase in zzso zzso was due to a strong expression of zzso in the zzso region zzso h after zzso application, extending to the zzso region of the zzso within zzso zzso zzso a prominent zzso for zzso was observed in zzso areas, with a maximum zzso h after zzso zzso of early cultured zzso with a zzso zzso from human zzso fluid resulted in a zzso increase in zzso DNA zzso The zzso effect of zzso was also zzso when zzso were zzso with zzso zzso cells compared with zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso released during the early steps of liver tissue damage and repair may interact with zzso and zzso the sensitivity of zzso to zzso zzso
