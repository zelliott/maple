zzso zzso domain zzso protein zzso is a zzso protein zzso that acts as a zzso zzso by zzso regulating zzso Here, we show that zzso is recruited to the cell membrane by binding to a scaffolding zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso results in zzso of zzso from the membrane to the zzso and an increase in zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso has the opposite zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of cell proliferation is facilitated by the formation of a zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, our findings identify a functional interaction between zzso and zzso in zzso regulating zzso zzso
