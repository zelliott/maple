In response to stress, plants accumulate zzso requiring degradation after release from adverse zzso zzso zzso zzso the second zzso for Pro degradation, is zzso by a single gene expressed zzso To study the zzso function of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso were isolated and zzso Although Pro degradation was zzso in zzso zzso neither increased Pro levels nor an altered growth zzso were observed under normal zzso Thus zzso is essential for Pro degradation but not required for zzso plant zzso External Pro application caused programmed cell death, with zzso deposition, zzso oxygen species production, and DNA zzso involving a salicylic acid signal zzso zzso zzso zzso were hypersensitive toward Pro and other molecules producing zzso such as zzso and zzso Pro levels were the same in the wild type and zzso but zzso was zzso only in zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso may be the cause for Pro zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in decreased sensitivity to zzso supplied zzso Thus, Pro and zzso zzso may serve as a link between stress responses and cell zzso
