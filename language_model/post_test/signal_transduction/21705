Despite nearly zzso years of research into the field of zzso zzso the actual mechanism of protection remains zzso However, much progress has been made in zzso the signal zzso pathways that convey the zzso signal initiated by the zzso stimulus to the zzso targets of zzso with many of these pathways involving the zzso of a diverse array of survival protein zzso zzso The powerful protective benefits of zzso zzso have not yet been zzso in the clinical arena, not least because of the prerequisite for any zzso intervention to be applied prior to the onset of index zzso which in the case of an acute zzso zzso is difficult to zzso In this regard, the newly described phenomenon of zzso zzso which comprises a zzso intervention that can be applied at the time of zzso zzso offers a far more attractive and amenable approach to zzso zzso Interestingly, certain survival protein zzso zzso recruited at the time of zzso zzso appear to be shared by both zzso zzso and zzso thereby offering a potentially common target of zzso The often disputed roles these different protein zzso play in zzso the zzso effects of zzso zzso and zzso are reviewed in this article, and include protein zzso C, G, and A, members of the zzso family zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso
