zzso is a neutral zzso that accumulates in zzso zzso membrane zzso called zzso zzso zzso zzso serve as membrane platforms for signal zzso mechanisms that mediate cell growth, survival, and a variety of other processes relevant to zzso A number of studies, going back many years, demonstrate that cholesterol accumulates in solid tumors and that cholesterol zzso breaks down in the prostate with aging and with the transition to the zzso zzso This review summarizes the established links between cholesterol and prostate cancer zzso with a focus on how zzso of cholesterol within the zzso raft component of the plasma membrane may stimulate signaling pathways that promote progression to hormone zzso zzso We propose that increases in cholesterol in prostate tumor cell zzso resulting from increases in circulating levels or from zzso of zzso zzso results in the zzso of raft zzso This would have the effect of zzso positive regulators of zzso signaling within zzso while maintaining negative regulators in the zzso membrane zzso This approach toward examining the function of zzso zzso in prostate cancer cells may provide insight into the role of circulating cholesterol in zzso growth and on the potential relationship between diet and aggressive zzso zzso characterization of proteins that zzso to zzso zzso may help unveil signaling networks and pathways that will lead to identification of new zzso for disease progression and potentially to novel targets for therapeutic zzso
