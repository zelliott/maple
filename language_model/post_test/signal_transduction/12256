Central zzso in the zzso and spinal zzso are essential for the maintenance of sympathetic tone, the integration of responses to the zzso of zzso and central commands, and the generation of an appropriate respiratory motor zzso Here, we will discuss work that aims to understand the role that zzso neurotransmitter systems play in central zzso zzso It is well known that blockade of zzso zzso zzso and zzso pathways causes major or even complete disruption of zzso systems, whereas antagonism of other neurotransmitter systems barely affects circulation or zzso Despite the lack of an zzso role for zzso zzso they are nevertheless significant in modulating the effects of central command and peripheral zzso zzso Finally, we propose that a likely explanation for the plethora of zzso and their receptors on zzso zzso is to enable differential regulation of zzso in response to zzso zzso while at the same time maintaining a zzso level of sympathetic activity that supports those zzso that significantly zzso their blood supply, such as the heart, brain, zzso and zzso Such an explanation of the data now available enables the generation of many new testable zzso
