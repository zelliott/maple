zzso growth factor zzso zzso gene knockout zzso cardiac and zzso development in zzso embryonic stem cells zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are responsible for its zzso zzso zzso activity whereas zzso zzso and zzso represent zzso sites for zzso zzso zzso of this study was the characterization of zzso zzso requirements necessary for zzso differentiation in zzso To this purpose, zzso zzso were infected with zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso or the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The resulting embryonic stem zzso cell lines were differentiated as zzso bodies zzso and beating zzso formation was zzso In order to appraise the presence of cells belonging to cardiovascular and zzso zzso specific markers were zzso by quantitative zzso whole mount in zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso rescued zzso beating zzso formation in zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were both zzso Analysis of the expression of early and late cardiac markers in zzso zzso confirmed these zzso At zzso with zzso zzso all the zzso zzso zzso forms were able to rescue zzso differentiation in zzso originated by infected zzso zzso only the zzso zzso zzso being zzso In keeping with these zzso treatment with different zzso zzso zzso indicates that protein zzso C and zzso zzso are essential for zzso but not for zzso differentiation in zzso generated by zzso approximately zzso In conclusion, our results suggest that, although zzso zzso activity is necessary for both cardiac and zzso lineage maturation in zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso domain of the zzso is a specific requirement for zzso zzso
