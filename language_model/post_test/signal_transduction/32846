zzso is a cellular zzso of the product of the viral zzso zzso of the zzso virus, and it functions as a zzso zzso zzso It plays an important role in cell zzso zzso zzso cell development, zzso zzso and zzso zzso controls the expression of critical genes involved in these processes by binding to zzso binding sites present in the zzso regulatory zzso The zzso gene generates two zzso zzso and a spliced zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso In this paper we show that zzso expression zzso the damaged zzso zzso zzso in zzso colon zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and causes these cancer cells to become susceptible to the effects of the normal zzso zzso zzso zzso is a redundant system in many cells and zzso and here we demonstrate that it is important in zzso zzso in cells where the normal zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso activity by using specific zzso of this zzso prevents the zzso zzso from zzso indicating that the induced zzso zzso is responsible for killing the cancer zzso zzso activates a critical alternative zzso zzso in cancer cells that are resistant to normal immune attack, and thus it may be useful as an zzso zzso
