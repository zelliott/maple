Many tumors, including Hodgkin's lymphoma, are associated with decreased cellular immunity and elevated levels of zzso zzso zzso a known inhibitor of zzso T cell zzso suggested to be involved in immune zzso in zzso To address the molecular mechanisms zzso zzso might have on primary human zzso T cells, we used a whole zzso zzso approach and show that zzso severely limited changes of gene expression induced by signaling through the T cell zzso and zzso This data suggests an interference of zzso at an early step of T cell zzso zzso indeed, zzso stimulation of T cells leads to zzso of zzso and reduced zzso of zzso zzso genes escaped zzso zzso resulting in partial protection from zzso in response to zzso or zzso zzso As a functional consequence, zzso zzso T cells are arrested in the cell cycle associated with zzso of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Most importantly, zzso T cells in Hodgkin's zzso show similar regulation of genes that were altered in zzso by zzso in T cells from healthy zzso These data strongly suggest that zzso is an important factor leading to zzso T cell impairment observed in Hodgkin's zzso
