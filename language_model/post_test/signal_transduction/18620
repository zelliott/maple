zzso in zzso growth factor receptors zzso 1-3 cause skeletal disease syndromes in zzso Although these zzso are expressed at various stages of zzso and zzso development, their function in specific skeletal cell types is poorly zzso Using conditional zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells and in differentiated zzso we provide evidence that zzso signaling is important for different stages of zzso zzso zzso of zzso markers showed that zzso of zzso in zzso cells delayed zzso zzso but that zzso of zzso in differentiated zzso accelerated zzso In zzso zzso cultures zzso the in zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso In immature zzso zzso zzso increased proliferation and delayed differentiation and zzso zzso whereas in differentiated zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso in differentiated zzso resulted in increased expression of zzso a zzso that regulates the activity of differentiated zzso Mice lacking zzso either in zzso cells or in differentiated zzso showed increased bone mass as zzso These data demonstrate that signaling through zzso in zzso is necessary to maintain the balance between bone formation and zzso through a direct effect on zzso zzso
