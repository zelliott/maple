Severe acute respiratory syndrome zzso is an acute infectious disease with significant zzso A typical clinical feature associated with SARS is pulmonary zzso and the associated lung zzso However, the underlying mechanism remains zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso coronavirus zzso zzso zzso protein zzso transforming growth zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso of human peripheral lung zzso zzso zzso The promoting effect of N protein on the zzso responses of zzso is zzso N protein associates with zzso and promotes zzso complex formation while it interferes with the complex formation between zzso and zzso These findings provide evidence of a novel mechanism zzso N protein zzso zzso signaling to block zzso of zzso host cells and meanwhile promote tissue zzso Our results reveal a novel mode of zzso action in a zzso manner and may lead to successful strategies for SARS treatment by targeting the zzso signaling zzso
