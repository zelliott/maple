zzso strategies are zzso mechanisms that enable organisms to recover some of the fitness lost to damage, but impose limited or no cost on zzso They are frequently invoked in studies of zzso and of zzso zzso but the possible roles of tolerance in zzso zzso zzso have yet to be thoroughly zzso This review identifies candidate roles for tolerance in the evolution, maintenance and breakdown of zzso zzso by reducing the cost of damage, tolerance provides a key zzso by which zzso hosts can reduce the cost of association with their zzso promoting zzso This holds for the evolution of zzso zzso type zzso where a host requires an zzso that does not direct any reward to their partner for some resource, and of zzso zzso where participants directly trade zzso zzso in outright zzso tolerance might maintain cooperation by reducing the cost of a zzso negative trait in a symbiotic zzso Finally, the evolution of tolerance might also provide a zzso out of zzso because the host could evolve a cheaper alternative to continued cooperation with its zzso partner, permitting zzso A key consequence of tolerance is that it contrasts with partner choice mechanisms that impose large costs on zzso and I highlight understanding any zzso between tolerance and partner choice as an important research topic in the evolution of zzso I conclude by identifying tolerance as part of a more general phenomenon of zzso in zzso and zzso that drives the evolution of the zzso ratio from the zzso
