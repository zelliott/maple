One of the most powerful tools used to gain insight into complex zzso processes is the analysis of mosaic zzso A mosaic is defined as an zzso that contains cells of more than one zzso usually zzso and zzso It is the interplay between zzso and zzso cells in the mosaic that reveals information about the normal function of the zzso zzso zzso analysis has been zzso extensively in zzso zzso zzso mice, and zzso to zzso when, where, and how a gene acts during zzso In the zzso mosaic analysis has been used to dissect a number of different zzso zzso including zzso movements, zzso and zzso zzso zzso patterning and migration, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and neural crest zzso zzso analysis is a particularly effective method for understanding gene function in the zzso a model zzso particularly suited to forward zzso zzso and classical zzso zzso These zzso when combined with the accessibility and optical clarity of the zzso zzso facilitate the real time observation of individual cell behaviors and interactions within mosaic zzso
