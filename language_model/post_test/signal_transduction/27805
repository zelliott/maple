zzso or zzso zzso receptors were introduced into zzso cells that lack zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso activity in a zzso and zzso manner in cells expressing the zzso zzso A zzso zzso lacking all the binding sites for zzso zzso zzso and zzso fails to activate zzso zzso zzso with no binding site for either zzso or GAP can fully activate zzso but those which do not bind either zzso or zzso are unable to induce zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was reduced upon cell zzso with zzso or zzso and is completely zzso by chronic zzso zzso Altogether, these results indicate that zzso activates zzso through a zzso that involves both zzso and zzso and subsequent zzso of protein zzso zzso
