The cellular identity of both zzso and differentiated cells is defined by the concerted interplay of zzso factors as well as other zzso such as zzso and signaling zzso zzso the manipulation of a cell's zzso network directly zzso zzso between cellular zzso zzso the molecular regulation of cell fate changes, including those involved in zzso is crucial in realizing the practical potential of zzso and induced cell zzso Here we review the zzso in the role of zzso factors in zzso as well as in the conversion between and within zzso and zzso cell zzso
