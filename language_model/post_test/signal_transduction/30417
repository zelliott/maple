zzso between genes and proteins are crucial for efficient processing of internal or external signals, but this connectivity also zzso zzso fluctuations by zzso noise between zzso Linear zzso zzso were shown to exhibit an interplay between the sensitivity to changes in input signals and the ability to buffer zzso We searched for biological circuits that can maintain signaling sensitivity while minimizing noise zzso focusing on cases where the noise is characterized by rapid zzso zzso feedback can buffer this type of noise, but this zzso comes at the expense of an even greater reduction in signaling zzso By systematically analyzing zzso zzso we identify positive feedback as a central motif allowing for the zzso of zzso noise while maintaining sensitivity to long-term changes in input zzso We show zzso that noise reduction in the presence of positive feedback results from improved averaging of rapid fluctuations over time, and discuss in detail a particular zzso in the control of zzso zzso in zzso As the design of biological networks zzso for multiple constraints, positive feedback can be used to improve sensitivity without a compromise in the ability to buffer zzso zzso
