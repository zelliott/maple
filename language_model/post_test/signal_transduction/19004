The plant hormone zzso acid zzso controls numerous zzso zzso dormancy and zzso of seeds, zzso and resistance to zzso zzso In order to get more insight into the role of protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso we obtained eight zzso zzso zzso lines in zzso zzso zzso zzso One zzso named zzso exhibited a strong zzso zzso of zzso as only zzso of its seeds zzso after 3 days instead of zzso for the Columbia zzso zzso zzso and molecular analyses of zzso showed that it bears a unique zzso zzso in the promoter of the gene and that the zzso is zzso zzso expression in the zzso is about half that of the zzso zzso The zzso of two zzso genes zzso zzso and the zzso of two zzso genes zzso zzso are enhanced in the zzso zzso compared with the zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is reduced and the zzso of the zzso opening of zzso by zzso is stronger in zzso leaves than in zzso zzso Finally, zzso expression is zzso in the presence of zzso in both zzso and zzso but more zzso in the zzso Thus, zzso is hypersensitive to zzso Taken together, these results show that zzso which encodes a zzso zzso is a negative regulator of zzso zzso
