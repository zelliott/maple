In humans and experimental models of zzso zzso zzso cells in various zzso segments undergo zzso and/or zzso cell zzso Various factors, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso oxygen species, zzso disruption of zzso integrity, and zzso of various components of the zzso machinery, have been implicated in zzso cell zzso Several approaches to limit the injury and augment the zzso process, including zzso zzso administration of growth factors, zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso of zzso and executioners of cell death, proved to be effective in animal zzso Nevertheless, an effective approach to limit or prevent zzso zzso injury in humans remains zzso primarily because of an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms of cellular zzso zzso of cell death pathways in animal models in the setting of zzso injury and zzso of the findings to humans will aid in the design of potential therapeutic zzso This review evaluates our understanding of the molecular signaling events in zzso and zzso cell death and the contribution of various molecular components of these pathways to zzso zzso
