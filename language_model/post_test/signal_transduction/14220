A remarkable feature of nervous system development is the ability of zzso emerging from newly formed zzso to zzso by cellular scale, colossal distances to appropriate zzso The earliest zzso achieve this in an essentially zzso environment, but the vast majority of zzso eventually grow along a scaffold of nerve tracts created by earlier extending zzso Signal exchange between zzso or simultaneously extending zzso may well represent the zzso mode of zzso zzso but zzso few efforts have so far been directed at deciphering the underlying zzso This review intends to provide a conceptual update on the cellular and molecular principles driving zzso zzso with emphasis on those contributing to the zzso of zzso zzso sorting and connectivity during nerve and circuit zzso
