zzso cells display increased demands for energy production and DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for both processes and is also continuously zzso by cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso is a crucial factor in the zzso of zzso and thus in cancer cell zzso Here, we establish the zzso mechanism of action of the small zzso inhibitor zzso to result from impaired synthesis of zzso Initially, we detected zzso in cells between zzso and a known inhibitor of zzso zzso a compound of a structurally different zzso We then showed that zzso protects against zzso zzso Finally, we observed that treatment with zzso zzso cellular zzso levels in sensitive cancer zzso In conclusion, these results strongly suggest that, like zzso zzso kills cancer cells by depleting zzso
