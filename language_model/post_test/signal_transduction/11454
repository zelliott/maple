The tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso family are zzso zzso proteins that mediate zzso as well as zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso expression of zzso a recently identified member of the zzso zzso family, induced zzso in zzso or zzso cells and the zzso function of zzso was inhibited by zzso of zzso zzso or the zzso zzso family member, zzso zzso of a dominant negative zzso of zzso failed to protect from zzso zzso indicating that unlike zzso and zzso zzso induced zzso via a zzso zzso Despite the ability of zzso zzso expression to induce zzso zzso zzso and protein were found to be elevated in prostate tumor cell lines and in advanced stages of prostate zzso Analysis of several zzso proteins revealed that zzso levels and zzso 32 zzso of zzso the natural inhibitor of zzso were similarly elevated in cells expressing high levels of zzso suggesting that zzso survival proteins may protect from zzso zzso and that zzso is a target of zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso resulted in increases in both zzso zzso and protein levels, and this induction was suppressed by zzso of zzso Similarly, treatment of cells expressing high levels of zzso with zzso and zzso compounds also known to zzso zzso function, resulted in a zzso decrease in zzso protein and zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso signaling zzso the expression of a member of its own zzso family through zzso of zzso
