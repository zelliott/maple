zzso is a potent T cell growth factor that for many years was assumed to amplify zzso responses in zzso zzso zzso has been used clinically to enhance T cell immunity in patients with AIDS or cancer, and blocking zzso to the zzso are used to inhibit T cell responses against transplanted zzso It was later shown in mice that, unexpectedly, disruption of the zzso zzso results in zzso zzso and zzso rather than immune zzso indicating that the major zzso function of zzso is to limit rather than enhance T cell zzso This apparent paradox has recently been resolved with the discovery that zzso is critical for the development and peripheral expansion of zzso regulatory T cells, which promote zzso by suppressing T cell responses in zzso Our new understanding of zzso biology zzso a zzso of how best to clinically manipulate this important zzso zzso
