zzso zzso has been implicated in the impairment of the zzso cycling zzso by deregulation of zzso and zzso zzso turnover in zzso Here, we have examined possible mechanisms involved in the zzso disruption of zzso zzso including those related to protein degradation, such as the zzso and zzso zzso Our study revealed that zzso but not zzso zzso is responsible for zzso of the zzso zzso after zzso zzso Because protein zzso C zzso zzso leads to the zzso of zzso carriers, and zzso increases zzso activity, we hypothesized that the zzso signaling contributes to the zzso disruption of zzso zzso Our results show that zzso zzso causes a decrease in zzso zzso and that zzso of zzso reverses zzso zzso of zzso influx as well as zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso studies show association of zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso specific increase in zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso with zzso against zzso show decreased sensitivity to zzso compared with those zzso with control zzso or zzso targeted against zzso Taken together, these findings demonstrate that zzso signaling is involved in the zzso deregulation of zzso turnover in zzso
