Several zzso zzso specific for each of the protein zzso C zzso zzso beta 1, beta 2 and gamma have been generated and used to monitor the zzso and subsequent separation of these zzso A simple protocol has been developed for the efficient zzso of these zzso from bovine zzso The separation of the zzso beta 1, beta 2 and gamma zzso has been monitored using the zzso and pools containing pure zzso beta 1, and gamma forms have been zzso These zzso have been zzso for zzso dependence and zzso zzso The results indicate that while the zzso have similar requirements for zzso zzso zzso and zzso they differ in their dependence on zzso zzso and zzso The zzso also differ in their range of zzso zzso The implications of these results are zzso
