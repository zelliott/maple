zzso cells control the levels of molecular zzso and folding zzso in the zzso zzso zzso by a zzso induction process termed the unfolded protein response zzso according to the needs within the zzso In zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso factor zzso is tightly regulated at the level of zzso zzso that depends on an unconventional zzso Thus, zzso precursor zzso is zzso expressed but not zzso A sensor zzso zzso signaling from the zzso specifically removes an zzso of 252 zzso from the precursor zzso and the resulting mature zzso is translated to produce zzso Because the zzso zzso site is located near the zzso end of the zzso region, this zzso replaces the last 10 zzso of the zzso with an zzso zzso 18 zzso without affecting the zzso zzso region which contains the zzso zzso Here, we found that this zzso zzso segment functions as a potent zzso zzso zzso the zzso event joins the zzso zzso domain to its zzso domain, allowing rapid zzso generation of a potent zzso zzso zzso zzso that activates the zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso is hardly activated by zzso produced without zzso zzso zzso which may occur in the absence of zzso signaling from the zzso Based on these and other results, we propose that the control of expression and activity of zzso meets the requirements of the zzso
