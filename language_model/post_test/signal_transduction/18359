We report on two patients affected with severe combined immune zzso zzso with an unusual zzso zzso and a substantial number of zzso poorly functioning T zzso zzso zzso identified at the zzso locus in the two patients impaired zzso signaling but affected zzso zzso differently, resulting in generation of a zzso or zzso zzso zzso These observations add to the growing complexity of the zzso spectrum of zzso in humans and indicate the need for detailed zzso and molecular investigations in zzso zzso
