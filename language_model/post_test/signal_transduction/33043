The zzso joint arises from an initial zzso of cells that subsequently develops into distinct skeletal structures, separated by the zzso Bone zzso proteins zzso and growth and differentiation factors zzso have a fundamental role during zzso including joint zzso Development of the joint appears to be dependent on the differential zzso of the related zzso and zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the developing zzso and is necessary for the formation of some zzso In contrast, recent data has shown that antagonism of the zzso family is crucial for joint zzso Here, we review mechanisms of how zzso zzso may be zzso We also describe the expression of zzso and zzso together with two zzso antagonists, zzso and zzso during chick joint zzso Finally, we discuss possible mechanisms of how a joint forms and the evidence that the joint is a zzso zzso that may coordinate the development of adjacent skeletal zzso
