zzso T zzso display weaker and slower responses than zzso cells for reasons that are not well zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso stimulation zzso distinct zzso and zzso zzso patterns in zzso and zzso human T cells, and that these contribute to the differential responses shown by these zzso Specifically, zzso zzso triggers the zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso This zzso of zzso zzso subsequent calcium influx and zzso the degradation of the zzso In contrast, zzso stimulation of experienced cells results in the zzso of zzso via an association with zzso large zzso Thus, there are distinct signaling pathways triggered by zzso zzso that impair signaling in zzso cells and facilitate it in zzso zzso
