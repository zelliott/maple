We investigated the mechanism of tissue induction and zzso using the zzso zzso as a model zzso This structure begins its zzso as a zzso outgrowth of the zzso zzso and ultimately forms a zzso structure with zzso zzso Using a reporter zzso as a specific marker for zzso zzso we show that the zzso factor zzso is required for normal development of the zzso and is probably an important competence zzso In investigating the zzso signaling required, we show that zzso growth factor zzso 10 is sufficient to stimulate zzso zzso bud formation in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso adjacent to the zzso zzso bud and absence of zzso zzso development in zzso mice strongly suggest that it is an zzso zzso This was supported by the observation that zzso of signaling by a zzso for zzso zzso 2 zzso suppressed development of the zzso zzso zzso In zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth but not branching zzso This suggested that its role in induction is to stimulate proliferation and, in turn, that zzso combines with other factors to provide the zzso signals required for zzso zzso zzso
