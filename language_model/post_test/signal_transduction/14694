Blood vessel growth is critical for embryonic development and contributes to zzso including cancer and diabetic zzso A growing body of evidence suggests that signaling via the zzso zzso contributes to zzso and that zzso zzso signaling might alter zzso cell zzso To test the hypothesis that zzso signaling promotes zzso cell proliferation and vessel growth, we treated bovine zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso and zzso derived from zzso with zzso zzso zzso cells cultured in the presence of zzso displayed increased zzso zzso proliferation and zzso stability in zzso zzso which primarily signals via an alternate zzso pathway, the zzso pathway, decreased both cell number and zzso zzso zzso which in other cell types activates the zzso pathway, did not activate zzso affect cell number or increase zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso signals might have opposing effects on zzso
