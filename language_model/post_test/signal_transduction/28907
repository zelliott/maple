Blood zzso recruited to zzso zzso zzso airways are believed to be rapidly killed by resident bacteria and to passively release zzso and other toxic zzso that promote disease zzso By zzso analysis, we demonstrate that profound functional and signaling changes readily occur within viable zzso recruited to zzso zzso compared with their blood zzso zzso zzso have undergone conventional zzso as shown by decreased zzso zzso increased zzso raft zzso surface zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and increased levels of the zzso zzso zzso zzso they also mobilize to the surface zzso zzso zzso usually confined zzso and lose surface expression of zzso and zzso both key receptors in zzso Furthermore, they express zzso major zzso complex type II, and the zzso zzso zzso zzso all normally associated with other zzso which reflects functional zzso This notion is reinforced by their decreased total zzso levels, mirroring a zzso stage, and increased levels of the zzso zzso zzso a key anabolic zzso Thus, we identified a subset of zzso within zzso airways with a viable but dysfunctional zzso This subset provides a possible therapeutic target and indicates a need to revisit current zzso of zzso airway zzso
