The T cell zzso zzso zzso is the most complex zzso known to date, consisting of eight zzso zzso Its zzso by an zzso is the initial step in an immune zzso Here, we present the zzso geometry model explaining how zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose that a zzso zzso zzso its geometry on two zzso receptors by simultaneously binding to zzso This causes the zzso zzso to rotate with respect to each other leading to displacement of the zzso of the associated zzso zzso This results in a zzso movement of the zzso zzso that opens the zzso tails for interaction with zzso zzso thus initiating zzso zzso
