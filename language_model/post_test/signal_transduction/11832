zzso zzso zzso is a potent zzso responsible for cardiac zzso in which zzso zzso growth zzso serves as a principal downstream zzso We recently found that zzso of zzso in mice attenuated zzso zzso protected mice against progressive zzso dysfunction, and significantly reduced the mortality after experimental zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and subsequent cardiac zzso We performed chronic subcutaneous infusion of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice by a zzso zzso After 4 weeks of zzso dosage of zzso infusion zzso zzso of body weight per zzso zzso mice developed significant zzso whereas the zzso showed no zzso In zzso zzso treatment significantly zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Col I zzso type zzso Col III zzso type zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and increased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso which were all unchanged in zzso zzso zzso The zzso mice consistently displayed zzso effects intermediate between zzso and zzso zzso dosage of zzso (2 zzso of body weight per zzso induced significant zzso in zzso but not in zzso mice with comparable hypertension and zzso in both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were treated with zzso in which direct zzso effects and zzso zzso effects was observed in zzso The latter effects were totally abolished in zzso cells, suggesting that zzso is essential for zzso zzso zzso In conclusion our data indicate that zzso is essential for zzso zzso cardiac zzso via enhanced zzso zzso and suggest that zzso is a potential therapeutic target to inhibit zzso cardiac zzso
