zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso signaling zzso plays a crucial role in the formation and progression of many zzso and has been shown to be an important therapeutic target for zzso In the present study, human gastric zzso zzso of different grades zzso were zzso The protein expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was evaluated zzso in the biopsy zzso zzso zzso was blocked by constructed zzso small hairpin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso used to zzso into human gastric cancer zzso zzso The zzso efficiency of zzso in zzso cells was observed under fluorescent zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was detected by real-time zzso and Western zzso zzso Cell zzso activities and zzso capabilities were determined by zzso and zzso zzso As a consequence, the protein expression of zzso and zzso was respectively observed in zzso and zzso gastric zzso zzso zzso with the ascending order of tumor zzso zzso blockade of zzso zzso decreased the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and inhibited the zzso activities and zzso capabilities of gastric cancer zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso were strongly expressed in gastric zzso zzso and targeted blockade of zzso zzso may inhibit gastric cancer growth and zzso through zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso may represent an important therapeutic target for gastric zzso
