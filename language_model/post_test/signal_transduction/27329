To zzso the signal zzso mechanisms in the turtle zzso zzso zzso the effects of zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso and zzso red on the responses of the accessory zzso bulb to general zzso were zzso zzso zzso a large response, suggesting that there are zzso channels in the zzso zzso On the other hand, the dependence of the responses to general zzso on zzso zzso was different from that of the response to zzso A large response to an zzso zzso zzso appeared after the zzso zzso was fully zzso by application of 50 zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso does not contribute significantly to generation of the response to general zzso A concentration of 50 zzso zzso red significantly reduced the responses to zzso zzso alone and after 50 zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso contributes partly to generation of the responses to general zzso in the zzso zzso
