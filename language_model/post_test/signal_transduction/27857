The development of the feather buds during avian zzso is a classic example of a spacing zzso The regular arrangement of feather buds is achieved by a process of lateral zzso zzso one developing feather bud prevents the formation of similar buds in the immediate zzso zzso zzso during feather formation implicates a role of long range zzso during this zzso Recent work has shown that zzso are able to enforce lateral zzso during feather bud zzso However these results do not explain how the feather bud escapes the zzso zzso We show that this could be achieved by the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we show that local application of zzso leads to the development of zzso feather zzso We suggest that zzso locally zzso the action of the zzso and so permits the cellular changes associated with feather zzso zzso We also provide evidence for the role of short range zzso during feather zzso We have correlated changes in cellular zzso in feather zzso with the expression of the gene zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso that requires direct zzso contact for zzso We show that the expression of this gene precedes cellular zzso required for feather bud zzso
