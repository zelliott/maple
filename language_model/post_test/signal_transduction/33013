The avian zzso cell system represents a novel method to generate loss of function zzso in zzso zzso These chicken B zzso cells undergo zzso zzso at very high zzso and can thus be used to zzso zzso genes believed to function in zzso zzso The knockout cells can then be used to determine how the cell death process is modulated after induction of zzso and to order components in cell death zzso The system can be further zzso using zzso zzso to allow expression of zzso zzso to rescue zzso zzso if the gene of interest is zzso zzso zzso expression zzso containing zzso or deletions in the zzso zzso the absent protein can be used to delineate functional zzso zzso expression libraries or known proteins believed to function downstream of the target in a signal zzso zzso could also be zzso into the knockout cell line, and the zzso cells could be zzso for zzso and/or rescue of the zzso zzso Finally, the system has recently been adapted to allow disruption of human genes in zzso hybrid cell lines thereby potentially extending this system for use in studying human zzso
