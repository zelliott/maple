zzso administered as a subcutaneous implant was previously reported to inhibit the zzso initial increases in zzso free calcium zzso zzso in mouse zzso The present studies were initiated to determine whether zzso affects signal zzso subsequent to zzso of protein zzso C zzso in immune zzso Administration of zzso significantly inhibited the zzso zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso expression in both zzso and zzso mouse T zzso In contrast, zzso treatment had no effect on zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso zzso suggesting a selective zzso of zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso blocked the effect of zzso on zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso expression was not reproduced by zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that this effect of zzso was zzso through zzso but not directly via zzso receptors located on T zzso Moreover, zzso abolished this effect of zzso in zzso but not zzso T cells, suggesting that the zzso effect of zzso on zzso expression in zzso T cells may be zzso through a zzso increase in zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso may involve an zzso of zzso events, especially zzso zzso as well as impairment of earlier events in the zzso of immune cells such as the increase in zzso
