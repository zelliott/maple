Evidence is growing that zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in zzso zzso We hypothesized here that zzso plays a central role in zzso zzso barrier zzso by zzso signaling from zzso zzso zzso in the stratum zzso zzso Since the SC contains zzso and zzso activity, we assessed the influence of SP zzso on barrier zzso Acute barrier disruption increases SP activity and blockade by topical SP zzso zzso zzso barrier recovery after acute zzso This improvement in barrier function is due to accelerated zzso body zzso zzso Since zzso SP signal certain downstream responses through zzso we assessed its potential role in zzso the negative effects of SP on zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the outer zzso layers of the zzso and most specifically under zzso condition to the zzso raft zzso zzso zzso tape zzso barrier zzso provokes zzso zzso as shown by zzso zzso zzso zzso movement from zzso to zzso zzso zzso topical applications of zzso zzso zzso zzso delay zzso barrier recovery and inhibit LB zzso while, conversely, zzso knockout mice display accelerated barrier recovery zzso and enhanced LB zzso paralleled by increased zzso formation and zzso zzso These results demonstrate first, the importance of zzso balance for normal zzso barrier zzso and second, they identify zzso as a novel signaling mechanism of zzso barrier, that is, of response linked to LB zzso
