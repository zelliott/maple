A zzso and zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso shedding of several zzso growth factors and zzso The expression and activity of zzso increase under some pathological conditions such as stroke and zzso zzso promotes neural zzso cell migration and contributes to zzso zzso after stroke and brain tumor growth and zzso In the present study, we sought to zzso whether zzso contributes to breast cancer progression and its zzso To this end, we examined the role of zzso in the zzso invasion and tube formation of zzso breast cancer cells in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso cell line with either a zzso for zzso of human zzso or a zzso to zzso was employed in this study to establish high or low zzso expression in breast cancer cells, zzso For study of zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso were used to counteract high zzso expression or the activated zzso zzso zzso of zzso breast cancer cells were tested by zzso zzso incorporation zzso growth curve and zzso B zzso zzso invasion zzso were used to assess the ability of zzso cells to penetrate the Extra Cellular zzso A zzso tube formation zzso was performed to test zzso tube formation zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells under different zzso expression levels were tested by western zzso and zzso Our data show that zzso promotes the zzso zzso zzso by increased zzso invasion and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression was increasing by zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso signal pathway, which correlated with zzso cell zzso zzso zzso This study suggests zzso contributes to breast cancer progression through zzso of the zzso signal zzso
