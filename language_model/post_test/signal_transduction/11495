The proteins that compose the Ras family of small zzso zzso share a remarkably high degree of sequence zzso yet recent evidence indicates that they may have unique biological zzso How is it that similar proteins carry out different jobs in the zzso zzso addresses this question by surveying recent reports that indicate that different biological roles may be born out of distinct zzso zzso of the Ras zzso It appears that the small differences in their zzso acid sequences and their different zzso modifications may be all that is necessary to direct various Ras proteins to different zzso
