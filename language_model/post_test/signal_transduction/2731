In many tumor cell lines, tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso causes profound zzso in nucleus including zzso zzso and DNA zzso However the mechanism is largely zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso alpha treatment of zzso cells increased zzso zzso of a zzso nuclear protein zzso zzso by zzso which occurred after zzso h treatment zzso with occurrence of DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A, inhibited either zzso zzso of zzso or DNA zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso may be involved in the zzso zzso changes in zzso zzso of zzso zzso level by zzso of cell surface zzso with bacterial zzso or addition of either zzso or natural zzso also resulted in increase of zzso zzso zzso which was zzso at zzso h treatment and reached maximum after 2 h treatment, indicating that zzso zzso may be a downstream zzso of zzso signaling zzso Our data provide further evidence that zzso signaling zzso may mediate signal zzso of zzso zzso
