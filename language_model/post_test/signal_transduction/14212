zzso of zzso and vascular zzso in the zzso ligament zzso around the tooth root was observed during tooth movement by zzso force zzso We previously demonstrated that a single zzso culture zzso of primarily cultured zzso zzso called zzso has an zzso zzso cell zzso character and can form zzso cell zzso zzso blood zzso zzso However, the types of molecular mechanisms that control the in zzso kinetic properties and the differentiation of the zzso zzso cells into zzso zzso which are known to expand zzso zzso require zzso 

Using specific zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso we examined how zzso growth factor zzso zzso signals affected the zzso migration, and zzso differentiation of these zzso 

zzso induced zzso cell proliferation in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso suppressed the expression of zzso differentiation markers in these cells in a zzso manner, and, moreover, zzso the cell migration in a zzso zzso 

zzso regulates zzso tissue zzso in zzso through zzso and zzso signals by affecting the zzso migration, and zzso differentiation of the zzso zzso zzso
