The zzso system in rats is part of the zzso region with extensive zzso connections with brain areas involved in the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso The existence of the zzso system and zzso zzso in the zzso bulb suggests that zzso may zzso zzso transmission and diverse zzso zzso zzso In the present work we studied the effect of zzso and zzso on zzso zzso release and the short-term regulation of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso showed that both zzso increased zzso zzso activity through the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso coupled zzso coupled to the stimulation of protein zzso A and C, as well as zzso protein zzso zzso On the other hand, neither zzso nor zzso modified zzso zzso total protein levels, but both peptides increased the zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso at sites 19 and zzso Furthermore, zzso enhanced zzso release in zzso zzso suggesting that this event may contribute to increased zzso zzso activity by reducing the feedback zzso Taken together present findings show a clear interaction between the zzso system, and the zzso transmission in the zzso zzso Additional studies are required to evaluate the zzso functions regulated by zzso at this brain zzso
