Gap junctions formed by two zzso from two neighboring cells are zzso communication zzso zzso are communication channels between zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso proteins formed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso exist in the zzso cell surface, but their component zzso and functions have not been zzso Recent studies by others have demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso from zzso serve as regulators of zzso via zzso the zzso signaling zzso Here, the zzso properties of zzso are demonstrated using two zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were isolated from zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that these two genes belong to a zzso zzso family, as they contain the insect signature zzso motif at the beginning of the second zzso zzso zzso showed that two fusion zzso zzso and zzso were localized predominantly in the cell zzso zzso and also zzso zzso expression in zzso cells and zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso cells promoted zzso In the zzso cells, zzso cells presented remarkable membrane zzso This study also showed that zzso and zzso cells undergo low level zzso under normal culture conditions, but not zzso zzso In zzso stable cell lines, zzso was used to isolate surface proteins and confirm zzso and zzso zzso in the cell membrane and also further data showed that zzso cells may activate the zzso signaling zzso via zzso molecular zzso zzso This result suggests that zzso zzso may be involving the zzso signaling zzso These findings will facilitate further examinations of the zzso regulation by the zzso signaling zzso and comparative studies of zzso zzso zzso and zzso
