zzso receptors are important in the regulation of zzso zzso therefore, this study sought to determine if such receptors influence zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso cells, with and without the cortical thick ascending zzso were loaded with the zzso sensitive zzso zzso Red zzso zzso or zzso 2 zzso video image zzso Studies were performed on an zzso microscope in a chamber with a zzso zzso zzso Changes in zzso calcium concentration zzso from exposed zzso zzso plaques were assessed upon addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso for 2 zzso added to the bathing zzso There was no change in zzso with addition of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso caused zzso to increase by 268 zzso 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 295 zzso 53 zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, whereas in response to zzso and zzso zzso increased by only 67 zzso 13 zzso zzso zzso 8) and 93 zzso 36 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso response curve for zzso zzso to zzso zzso added in bath showed an zzso of 15 zzso No effect on zzso zzso zzso was seen when zzso was added from the zzso zzso caused similar increases in zzso zzso zzso in the presence or absence of bath zzso and addition of 5 zzso zzso acid zzso zzso (an zzso of zzso and zzso zzso completely inhibited zzso zzso zzso Also, zzso responsiveness was prevented by the zzso C zzso zzso but not by its inactive zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso cells possess zzso zzso receptors on zzso but not zzso zzso and that zzso of these receptors results in the zzso of zzso
