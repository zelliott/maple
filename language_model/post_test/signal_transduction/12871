White zzso tissue from rats was examined for zzso responsive vascular zzso growth factor 165 zzso zzso and zzso zzso When separated into it constituent fat zzso zzso cells using zzso zzso methods, only the zzso (or whole fat zzso responded to zzso insulin zzso by doubling zzso release over 4 and 24 h in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression increased zzso Several zzso zzso were zzso Although zzso fat cells had the highest rates of zzso release, the differences were not zzso zzso zzso release was zzso in part via zzso but not zzso Additional zzso were tested, including steroids, zzso an zzso zzso and zzso Only the latter compound increased zzso production, and this effect was zzso by zzso zzso zzso the incubation zzso concentration between zzso zzso did not alter zzso zzso zzso An experimental mimic of zzso zzso also increased zzso zzso and this effect was additive with 100 zzso zzso These studies demonstrate that zzso insulin zzso stimulate zzso formation and expression in cultured zzso white zzso Although the biological significance of this observation remains to be determined, if white zzso zzso has zzso or systemic zzso actions, these might hypothetically impact on zzso expansion or the vascular zzso of zzso
