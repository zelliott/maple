Human zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso expressed protein that plays an important role in the zzso and zzso zzso It has been shown that zzso interacts with zzso zzso zzso zzso and suppresses its zzso Here, we report a novel function of zzso in regulating tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso The present experiments showed that zzso physically associated with tumor necrosis factor zzso factor 2 zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso but not of nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso and inhibited zzso cell zzso by suppressing the interaction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression through zzso interference zzso resulted in increase of zzso zzso association followed by zzso of zzso and zzso A zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso motif exhibited a significant decline of capacity to bind zzso and block zzso signaling compared with the wild type of zzso Moreover, the zzso activity of zzso was not involved in the regulation of zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso plays an important regulatory role in zzso signaling by forming zzso interactions with zzso which provides a new insight for zzso the protective effects of zzso in tumor zzso
