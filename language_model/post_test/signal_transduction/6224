A relatively recent zzso into molecular zzso zzso zzso a class exhibits a unique set of zzso relative stability, affinity for specific proteins and zzso ability to activate the zzso zzso and finally, zzso interference zzso In zzso unique zzso short interfering zzso molecules zzso destroy the corresponding target zzso with exquisite potency and zzso thus causing zzso gene zzso zzso An understanding of the design of zzso zzso and development of techniques to deliver zzso in the cell and in live animals has heralded a new age of gene therapy without gene zzso This review first summarizes the biological zzso metabolism and effect of the zzso with special emphasis on zzso and zzso This is followed by the clinical, pharmacological and pharmaceutical prospects of the development of the zzso as a zzso It is clear that the zzso holds an enormous promise in the treatment of a large number of zzso and infectious diseases including but not limited to cancer, zzso zzso diabetic zzso Alzheimer's and other neural disorders, zzso diseases, and all viral infections including AIDS zzso immune zzso zzso zzso and respiratory zzso virus zzso
