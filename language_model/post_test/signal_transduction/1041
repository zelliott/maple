Exposure of zzso B cells to the zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso leads to a state of zzso in which subsequent zzso of major zzso complex class II molecules zzso the zzso of calcium zzso and cell zzso However, it is not clear how critical this zzso is for immune responses or how it is normally induced in zzso zzso of mice with the commonly used zzso zzso led to zzso of zzso B cells and to the zzso in the zzso of a previously unknown population of zzso zzso zzso These cells and zzso were both required for in zzso zzso and expansion of zzso B cells, as well as for optimal production of zzso These studies reveal a key role for a previously unknown accessory zzso cell population in the generation of zzso immune zzso
