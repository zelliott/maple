Animals use acoustic signals to communicate and to obtain information about their zzso The processing of acoustic signals is initiated at auditory sense zzso where zzso hair cells convert zzso zzso into electrical zzso Although the zzso principles underlying the zzso process in hair cells have been characterized in much detail over the past 30 years, the molecular zzso of the zzso machinery have proved to be difficult to zzso We review here recent studies that have both identified some of these molecules and established the mechanisms by which they regulate the activity of the zzso zzso zzso
