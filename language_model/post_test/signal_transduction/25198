Using the zzso model of zzso zzso death in the zzso zzso region, it was recently shown that there is a strong zzso of zzso zzso influx in zzso examined at 2 days after the zzso insult zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Lin, zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso after brief zzso in zzso zzso zzso 81 (1999) zzso The aim of the present study was to determine whether a similar change occurs in zzso zzso of the zzso region that are relatively resistant to transient zzso In zzso zzso recordings and zzso zzso zzso were made from zzso zzso in zzso slices prepared from controls and 1 or 2 days following in zzso zzso In slices from control and zzso animals, the zzso properties of zzso zzso were consistent with significant zzso zzso influx, leading to spike frequency zzso zzso results indicated no significant difference in zzso zzso evoked by action potential zzso This zzso signaling was compared with responses in zzso zzso from the same zzso which showed substantially diminished zzso influx at 2 days zzso These findings suggest that diminished zzso is not a general feature of zzso zzso following zzso but is characteristic of zzso destined to zzso
