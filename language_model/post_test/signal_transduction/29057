To determine the role of zzso in zzso zzso we used zzso DNA zzso to create mice with an zzso disruption of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso disappearance of zzso expression occurred on d 6 of zzso a time point when zzso have already undergone conversion to zzso Thus, this knockout model examined the role of zzso in mature but not zzso zzso Beginning at 9 zzso of age, zzso mice weighed more than their zzso controls and had increased zzso tissue mass, associated with zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso or reduced energy zzso zzso but not zzso zzso was impaired in zzso zzso which may partially explain the increased cell zzso Despite reduced zzso and increased liver zzso zzso mice displayed normal zzso zzso Overall, these findings demonstrate that zzso zzso regulates body weight zzso in part through direct effects of zzso on zzso
