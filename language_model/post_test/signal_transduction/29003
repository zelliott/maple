Heat shock zzso response is a universal mechanism of protection against adverse environmental zzso It is zzso mainly by rapid and robust induction of molecular zzso and other zzso zzso In higher zzso the zzso of the HS response is zzso by a master regulator, heat shock zzso factor 1 zzso Here we outline recent progress in understanding the early steps in zzso zzso by heat in the context of existing models of zzso zzso
