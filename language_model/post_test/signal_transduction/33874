An estimated 300,000 new cases of zzso cancer worldwide are diagnosed zzso Although new zzso zzso agents for either advanced or zzso zzso cancer or both are used, no improvement in survival has been zzso Indeed, the zzso survival rate of zzso zzso cancer is very low zzso The zzso approach is an attractive challenge for treating specific genetic zzso involved in progression and zzso zzso This article aims to describe the new targeted therapies available to cure advanced cancer or zzso zzso cancer or both according to the zzso pathways potentially zzso 

The rapidly expanding understanding of the zzso of zzso cancer at the molecular level has led to the identification of zzso pathways involved in this disease and provided molecular targets for new biological agents directed against zzso and zzso The recent results of clinical trials have not only highlighted the need to select patients who could benefit from such a therapy but also the fact that zzso has completely entered into a new zzso 

zzso zzso agents are slowly being supplemented by a new generation of drugs that recognize specific targets in or on cancer zzso Recent technological advances in zzso and zzso have led to an improvement in identifying zzso zzso of response and thereby to identify patients who would be more likely to respond to such a zzso There is a real hope to improve both the efficiency and the zzso of zzso cancer zzso
