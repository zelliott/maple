In addition to their major function in zzso presentation and natural killer cell activity regulation, zzso class I molecules may zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso that recognize distinct zzso of zzso class I molecules were reported to interfere with zzso zzso We show here that two zzso zzso zzso and rat zzso that bind to an zzso of the zzso domain of zzso class I heavy chain induce zzso cell death of zzso but not resting, peripheral T zzso Other reference zzso class I zzso specific for distinct zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of the heavy chain decreased zzso proliferation but had little or no zzso zzso zzso shown by DNA zzso zzso zzso and decrease of zzso zzso potential was observed whatever the type of zzso zzso zzso did not result from zzso interaction and distinct though partly overlapping populations of activated T cells were susceptible to zzso and zzso class zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not require zzso class I zzso zzso as it could be observed with zzso zzso zzso The data indicate that zzso and zzso directed against the zzso domain of zzso class I trigger zzso of activated T zzso by a zzso which does not involve zzso
