Life on earth has evolved in a sea of natural electromagnetic zzso zzso Over the past century, this natural environment has sharply changed with introduction of a vast and growing spectrum of man-made zzso zzso From models based on equilibrium thermodynamics and zzso effects, these fields were initially considered too weak to interact with zzso systems, and thus incapable of influencing zzso zzso Laboratory studies have tested a spectrum of zzso fields for zzso at cell and molecular levels, focusing on zzso at zzso zzso A clear emergent conclusion is that many observed interactions are not based on tissue zzso zzso of cell surface chemical events by weak zzso fields indicates a major amplification of initial weak triggers associated with binding of hormones, zzso and zzso to their specific binding zzso zzso zzso play a key role in this zzso These studies support new concepts of communication between cells across the barriers of cell zzso and point with increasing certainty to an essential physical organization in living matter, at a far finer level than the structural and functional image defined in the chemistry of zzso New zzso between physical and biological scientists define common goals, seeking solutions to the physical nature of matter through a strong focus on biological zzso The evidence indicates mediation by highly zzso zzso processes at critical steps in signal zzso across cell zzso There is increasing evidence that these events relate to quantum states and resonant responses in zzso systems, and not to equilibrium thermodynamics associated with zzso energy exchanges and tissue zzso
