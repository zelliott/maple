zzso zzso is common, but the mechanisms remain zzso This study was undertaken to investigate the zzso zzso in zzso mice in zzso and the effects of zzso on cultured vascular smooth muscle cells in zzso zzso red S zzso was used to detect zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso and zzso protein expression were examined in cultured zzso vascular smooth muscle cells zzso The involved signal zzso was studied using a zzso protein zzso zzso inhibitor and zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso mice developed slight zzso zzso after being fed with normal zzso diet for 30 zzso zzso supplement of zzso attenuated zzso zzso in these zzso On cultured zzso zzso inhibited zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso protein was detected in zzso and zzso activated zzso zzso protein zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso expression or zzso zzso reversed the effects of zzso on zzso zzso These results showed that zzso inhibited zzso differentiation of zzso through the zzso signaling zzso Our findings showed that zzso mice developed zzso zzso and this could be attributed to the loss of zzso action of zzso on zzso differentiation of zzso It suggested that zzso plays a protective role against zzso zzso
