zzso Na delivery to the connecting zzso zzso causes zzso zzso zzso zzso a process we call zzso zzso feedback zzso zzso II zzso zzso in the zzso zzso enhances zzso via zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso II stimulates zzso via zzso of protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and enhanced production of zzso zzso zzso zzso and adherent zzso were zzso and zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso was induced by increasing zzso zzso zzso from 0 to 5, 10, 30, 45, and 80 zzso and the concentration of zzso that zzso a zzso response zzso was zzso Compared with vehicle, adding zzso II zzso zzso to the zzso zzso reduced zzso from 37 zzso 3 to 14 zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating zzso II zzso zzso In the presence of zzso II, the zzso scavenger zzso zzso zzso increased zzso from 20 zzso 4 to 41 zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso increased zzso from 17 zzso 2 to 39 zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso and the specific zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso increased zzso from 19 zzso 2 to 34 zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso and zzso had no effect on zzso in the absence of zzso zzso Compared with vehicle, the zzso zzso zzso (2 zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso from 35 zzso 2 to 14 zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso increased zzso from 14 zzso 2 to 35 zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude the zzso zzso mediates the enhancement of zzso by zzso zzso II but it does not participate in zzso in the absence of zzso zzso
