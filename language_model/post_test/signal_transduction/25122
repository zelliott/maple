The activity of zzso factors is often modulated by signal responsive protein zzso zzso zzso factors are regulated by zzso zzso the zzso of which causes zzso and degradation, resulting in nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso of target zzso Here we report zzso and zzso experiments showing that a zzso 66 zzso protein zzso binds zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso This zzso appears to have at least two binding sites on zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity similar to zzso zzso and to specifically zzso the zzso domain of zzso zzso at an zzso consensus zzso
