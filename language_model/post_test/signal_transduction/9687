Plants interact with zzso and zzso zzso the combined effects of these interactions determine plant fitness and trait zzso To better understand the ecological and evolutionary implications of zzso zzso we explored linkages between soil zzso zzso and floral zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

Using a zzso we zzso reduced zzso colonization of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso We monitored floral signals and zzso interactions with zzso and zzso and seed set for zzso and control zzso 

zzso effects varied among traits, between zzso and with environmental zzso Treatment effects were negligible in 2008, but stronger in 2009, especially in the zzso zzso zzso There, zzso increased zzso sugar content and damage by zzso ants, but did not affect zzso Surprisingly, zzso also enhanced seed set, suggesting that direct resource costs of soil zzso exceed indirect benefits from reduced zzso In the zzso zzso effects were negligible in both zzso However, pooled across treatments, colonization by zzso zzso in 2009 correlated zzso with the intensity and diversity of floral volatile organic compounds, suggesting integrated zzso and zzso signaling zzso 

zzso effects on floral rewards in zzso zzso link soil zzso to ecological costs of zzso zzso zzso linkages to soil zzso should zzso expression of sensitive and zzso floral zzso in zzso zzso Overall, this study demonstrates how zzso linkages may lead to shifting selection pressures on interaction traits, restricting the evolution of zzso
