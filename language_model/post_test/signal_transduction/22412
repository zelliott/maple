zzso an active component from zzso zzso a traditional Tibetan medicinal plant, has been shown to possess zzso and zzso zzso However, the functional role of zzso on tumor growth and zzso has not been zzso We found that zzso significantly inhibited human pancreatic tumor growth in zzso mice when zzso treated at a dosage of 20 zzso daily, and this effect was accompanied with a potent zzso on zzso When examining the zzso of zzso on zzso and pancreatic cancer cells in zzso we found that zzso were more susceptible to the treatment, suggesting zzso might be the primary target of zzso Our results further showed that zzso inhibited vascular zzso growth factor zzso cell migration, invasion, and zzso structure formation of zzso in a zzso zzso In ex zzso and in zzso zzso zzso we showed that zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso of rat zzso rings and zzso zzso in zzso zzso To understand the underlying molecular basis, we next examined the effects of zzso on different molecular components in treated zzso and found that zzso suppressed the zzso zzso of zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso but had little effect on focal zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso at an effective zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso targets the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso in zzso cells, leading to the suppression of pancreatic tumor growth and zzso
