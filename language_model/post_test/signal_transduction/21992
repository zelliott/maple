zzso zzso changes in blood zzso level dependent zzso zzso levels from functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data has applications for learned regulation of regional zzso brain state monitoring, and zzso zzso In each of these zzso accurate zzso of the zzso signal in as little time as possible is zzso This is a challenging problem due to the low zzso ratio of zzso zzso Previous methods for real-time zzso analysis have either sacrificed the ability to zzso zzso zzso changes by averaging several acquisitions into a single zzso estimate or have sacrificed accuracy by failing to account for prominent sources of noise in the zzso zzso Here we present a new method for computing the amount of zzso present in a single zzso acquisition that separates zzso changes in the zzso signal intensity attributable to neural sources from those due to noise, resulting in a feedback signal more reflective of neural zzso This method zzso an incremental general linear model fit to the zzso time series, which is used to calculate the expected signal intensity at each new zzso The difference between the measured intensity and the expected intensity is scaled by the zzso of the zzso in order to transform this residual difference into a zzso Both synthetic and real data were used to validate this method and compare it to the only other published real-time zzso zzso
