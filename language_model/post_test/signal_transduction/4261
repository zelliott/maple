zzso mice produce little or no zzso in response to zzso stimulation with zzso zzso and fail to express zzso 4 zzso zzso in the zzso 5 days after injection of zzso in contrast to other mouse strains that produce substantial amounts of zzso and zzso Because zzso is critical in zzso production, the possibility that zzso mice are poor zzso producers because their zzso T cells fail to differentiate into zzso producers must be seriously zzso zzso itself is the principal factor determining that zzso T cells develop into zzso zzso A major source of zzso for such differentiation is a population of zzso zzso T cells that express zzso These cells produce zzso within 90 zzso of zzso zzso T cells from zzso mice fail to produce zzso in response to injection of zzso Similarly, zzso T cells and zzso zzso do not produce zzso in response to acute in zzso zzso zzso T cells show a marked zzso in zzso cells that express the surface receptors associated with the zzso zzso zzso This result indicates that the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso production is associated with, and may be due to, the absence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
