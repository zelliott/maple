zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in many transformed cells but not in normal cells and, zzso has emerged as a novel zzso zzso Previously, we showed that although most adult zzso zzso zzso cells express the TRAIL death zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso they are resistant to zzso Thus, in this study, we tried to find natural products that can overcome TRAIL zzso Among more than 150 materials screened, a zzso that was extracted from zzso zzso zzso exhibited the most striking zzso with zzso Treatment of the zzso zzso cell line zzso with a combination of zzso and zzso resulted in apparent zzso that was not observed on treatment with either agent zzso Furthermore, zzso with zzso followed by TRAIL further zzso the zzso zzso increased the level of zzso promoter activity and surface protein expression in a zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso indicating that zzso was caused by the increase of zzso zzso More interestingly, similar effects were observed in other leukemia cell lines by exactly the same zzso These results suggest that combined treatment with zzso and TRAIL may be a new strategy for cancer zzso
