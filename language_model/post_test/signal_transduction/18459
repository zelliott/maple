zzso tissue is a major zzso organ that exerts a profound influence on zzso zzso Two types of zzso tissue exist in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and BAT zzso zzso zzso zzso stores energy and is the largest energy reserve in zzso whereas zzso expressing zzso zzso protein 1), can zzso energy through zzso zzso In zzso ample evidence supports BAT as an organ zzso zzso whereas less is known about the presence and significance of BAT in zzso Despite the different functions of white and brown zzso knowledge of factors zzso influencing the formation of white and brown fat cells is zzso Here we zzso recent progress in the molecular understanding of white versus brown zzso zzso including novel insights into zzso and signal zzso zzso Since expression of zzso is the hallmark of BAT and a key factor determining energy zzso we also review conditions associated with enhanced energy expenditure and zzso expression in zzso that may provide information on processes involved in brown zzso zzso
