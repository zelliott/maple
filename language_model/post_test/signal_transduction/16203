The zzso zzso zzso and zzso factor zzso are considered crucial components required for normal zzso zzso zzso of either zzso leads to zzso zzso zzso in zzso Similarly, obstruction of either zzso zzso zzso and zzso various forms of bone zzso It has been shown previously that mice expressing a zzso zzso zzso termed zzso develop severe zzso zzso to increased zzso zzso It was further suggested that this phenomenon is associated with reduced zzso zzso zzso However, the precise mechanism underlying the zzso zzso effect of zzso remains zzso zzso associates with zzso interacting with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso region and the complex facilitate zzso of zzso down stream signal zzso zzso including zzso Given this proximity between zzso and zzso signaling in zzso we zzso that zzso of zzso by zzso may be achieved through zzso of zzso zzso We have demonstrated recently that zzso the regulatory zzso of the zzso complex, is crucial for zzso and interacts with zzso in zzso zzso zzso studies, in which we employed various forms of zzso and zzso revealed that the dominant negative form of zzso namely zzso mediates degradation of zzso thus halting zzso zzso Furthermore, degradation of zzso requires its intact zinc finger domain which is located at the zzso zzso This process also requires appropriate cellular zzso of zzso since deletion of its zzso domain zzso its degradation zzso zzso these findings, the expression of zzso and zzso signaling were significantly reduced in zzso collected from zzso transgenic zzso
