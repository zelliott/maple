zzso zzso requires key factors such as vascular zzso growth factor zzso and the zzso zzso factor zzso to induce the formation of primitive zzso zzso from veins during zzso zzso However, pathological zzso defined as new zzso vessel growth resulting from zzso zzso may zzso additional signaling pathways and/or cell types in conditions such as tumor progression or inflammatory zzso In fact, although both zzso and pathological zzso vascular development share fundamental mechanisms, zzso growth factors and/or zzso zzso mediate zzso in experimental models of zzso zzso This review summarizes molecular mechanisms underlying zzso in pathological conditions and focuses in particular on current findings relevant to zzso zzso
