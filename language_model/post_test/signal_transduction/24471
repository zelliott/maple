zzso zzso growth factor zzso is a zzso factor implicated in zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the role of the type I zzso growth factor zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso We used Lewis lung zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with human zzso zzso These cells, but not the zzso cells, expressed zzso zzso produced a zzso zzso zzso precursor zzso and zzso a zzso zzso processed form in response to zzso In zzso they acquired a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induction was abolished in cells expressing an zzso with zzso zzso in the zzso domain, but not in the zzso zzso The induction was zzso zzso dependent and, to a lesser extent, zzso protein zzso signaling dependent, as determined by the use of the respective zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results identify the zzso as a positive regulator of zzso expression and zzso it in the control of zzso zzso
