To evaluate the mechanisms by which zzso growth factor zzso regulates zzso cellular processes such as cell migration, we first examined the effects of zzso on cell zzso which is essential for cell zzso In mouse zzso zzso zzso with the full-length zzso zzso zzso promotes cell zzso and zzso cell spreading on zzso zzso and zzso and thus appears to reduce the strength of cell zzso Moreover, zzso zzso with multiple zzso zzso zzso components in the promotion of zzso cell migration of several different cell types, including zzso and various zzso and zzso cell zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso of zzso with zzso or zzso is essential for zzso zzso When zzso is mixed with the cells instead of the zzso zzso it has little effect on cell zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso with zzso components can enhance the polarization events required for directional cell zzso To identify the zzso zzso elements critical for the zzso stimulation of cell migration, zzso zzso were zzso with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, we found that zzso cells that lack the zzso zzso are not able to migrate to zzso even though they can adhere to zzso However, the introduction of zzso zzso receptors into these zzso enables them to migrate toward zzso even in the absence of zzso The requirement of the zzso zzso for cell migration does not appear to result from the zzso of zzso or zzso by the cells zzso with the zzso zzso Furthermore, cells expressing zzso receptors that are zzso or zzso zzso exhibit little migration toward zzso indicating that an intact zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso cell zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell migration in the presence of zzso and inhibit migration to zzso or zzso zzso These results further suggest that the zzso zzso is downstream of zzso zzso in the signal zzso pathways leading to zzso zzso
