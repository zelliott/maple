The zzso structure of the G protein zzso zzso alpha zzso 1 gamma 2 (at zzso zzso reveals two zzso regions of contact between alpha and zzso an extended interface between beta and nearly all of zzso and limited interaction of alpha with zzso The major zzso interface covers switch II of zzso and zzso zzso of switch II causes zzso zzso during zzso zzso in zzso binding in the zzso zzso with zzso explain stabilization of the inactive zzso of alpha by beta zzso zzso zzso motifs in beta form a zzso zzso beta zzso The zzso zzso of these motifs are a scaffold for display of their more variable zzso on the exterior face of each zzso zzso
