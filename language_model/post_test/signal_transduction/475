zzso regulation of zzso signaling is important in many zzso as in development of the zzso zzso where excessive or zzso zzso signaling leads to severe brain zzso zzso of the widely expressed zzso gene causes loss of the anterior zzso during mouse zzso Here we report that zzso is the mouse zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso and that the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein has a novel and zzso function during zzso zzso zzso increases the zzso of zzso and zzso by promoting the addition of zzso zzso anchors to these zzso which results in their retention in the zzso We also report that zzso zzso exhibit prematurely robust zzso activity in the zzso domain of the early neural zzso We examine the effect of low zzso expression on zzso in zzso by knocking down zzso zzso expression in zzso and zzso melanoma cells using zzso zzso of zzso results in increased zzso zzso which is correlated with greatly enhanced zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso increases zzso signaling in zzso and in zzso Finally, we address the mechanism of zzso zzso retention under zzso conditions, by zzso zzso with zzso zzso D zzso The presence of zzso in the zzso zzso results in increased zzso of soluble zzso suggesting that the zzso anchor lipids on zzso mediate its retention in the zzso These data now provide a zzso framework for understanding the zzso defects in zzso mice, and support a role for zzso zzso regulation during early brain zzso Our work highlights a critical role for zzso retention in regulating zzso signaling in the mouse zzso and gives insight into the notoriously inefficient zzso of zzso
