zzso cells express zzso zzso receptors of zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Recently, we reported that zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso and zzso C zzso zzso To further zzso the zzso signaling mechanisms, we examined the effects of zzso and zzso on zzso protein zzso zzso zzso caused a zzso and zzso increase in zzso activity zzso the zzso or zzso and the effect was blocked by zzso zzso a competitive zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso prevented the actions of the zzso indicating that the effect of zzso on zzso zzso is zzso through zzso receptors in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso or zzso of zzso with zzso abolished zzso zzso by zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso was reduced by the protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso of zzso by prolonged exposure to zzso zzso The involvement of zzso in the signal zzso pathways was further supported by the ability of zzso to induce zzso of zzso measured by zzso zzso Interestingly, a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso toxin zzso G protein form part of the molecular pathways zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso A specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso gene zzso All together, these results indicate that zzso is implicated in the transmission of zzso signaling to the nucleus and requires zzso zzso and zzso zzso
