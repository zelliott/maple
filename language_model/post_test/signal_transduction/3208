Despite accumulating evidence on a role of immune cells and their associated chemicals in mechanisms of pain, few studies have addressed the potential role of zzso in the descending zzso of persistent zzso The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that the zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso known as zzso zzso zzso signaling in the zzso zzso zzso zzso a pivotal structure in zzso pain zzso circuitry, is involved in descending pain zzso in zzso 

An zzso spinal nerve zzso zzso was produced in rats under zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso were used to detect the expression levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and examine their zzso compared with the zzso marker zzso as well as zzso markers zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

SNL induced an increase in zzso expression in the zzso and this returned to the control level at 4 weeks after zzso The induced zzso zzso with zzso but not with zzso and zzso zzso was also zzso by SNL in the zzso and this increase lasted for at least 4 zzso zzso was zzso with zzso but not zzso Few zzso zzso also exhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso with an zzso zzso zzso zzso or injecting zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso into the zzso on day 1 after zzso significantly attenuated the established zzso and mechanical zzso In addition, injection of zzso rat zzso zzso zzso into the zzso induced zzso zzso which was prevented by zzso with zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso a potent zzso of zzso zzso was also selectively zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso into the zzso induced behavioral zzso which was blocked by zzso (10 zzso However, an zzso zzso zzso (3 zzso did not prevent zzso (3 zzso zzso These results suggest that the effect of zzso is downstream to zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso signaling zzso play a role in zzso interactions and the descending zzso of zzso zzso
