zzso in body temperature may influence immune system function and consequently affect the risk of infection and inflammatory zzso zzso zzso from zzso bacteria zzso production of inflammatory zzso after zzso binding to zzso zzso 4 zzso on immune cells (especially zzso zzso Our aim was to explore how clinically relevant zzso and zzso affect this zzso in an ex zzso whole blood model, and investigate if the zzso response was correlated with zzso zzso expression zzso 

Blood from 11 healthy volunteers was incubated with zzso 10 zzso for 6 h at 33, 37 or zzso The zzso of selected zzso zzso necrosis zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were measured in zzso and the surface expression of zzso was zzso on zzso + zzso 

zzso zzso expression and plasma zzso were zzso related to zzso The zzso production was unaffected by zzso but increased significantly during zzso whereas plasma zzso was significantly reduced during both zzso and zzso zzso No correlation was found between zzso expression and zzso zzso During hypothermia, the zzso and zzso ratios increased seven and nine times, zzso zzso increased the zzso ratio, but to a lesser extent zzso whereas the zzso ratio remained zzso 

zzso significantly changed the zzso ratios in the zzso zzso In comparison, the effect of zzso was zzso with a modest increase in the zzso ratio zzso No association was found between zzso zzso production and zzso expression on zzso + zzso
