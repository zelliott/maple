Plants are able to adapt to the environment zzso through regulation of their growth and zzso Excess copper zzso a toxic heavy metal, zzso zzso zzso in plant zzso however, the underlying mechanisms are still zzso With this in mind, the multiple zzso functions of zzso oxide zzso in plant cells and its possible regulatory role and relationship with zzso were examined during zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso distribution was determined by microscopic observation of zzso zzso zzso and the levels of zzso zzso and zzso were detected by zzso zzso As well as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso plants were zzso 

zzso at a concentration of 50 zzso resulted in a large reduction in zzso area and zzso and primary root zzso accompanied by an increase in zzso zzso In zzso a low zzso concentration promoted NO zzso which was arrested by zzso oxide zzso or nitrate zzso zzso The zzso zzso NO synthesis was not zzso in zzso or zzso zzso In roots, zzso caused a decrease of the NO level which was not associated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso transport resulted in an increase in NO levels, while zzso application of an NO donor reduced zzso zzso The zzso processes of zzso were not sensitive to zzso but zzso plants showed diverse growth zzso 

In plant zzso zzso excess results in severe zzso responses during which the zzso hormonal balance and signal zzso are zzso zzso and NO zzso regulate each other's level and NO zzso the zzso zzso expansion, but zzso zzso processes under zzso zzso
