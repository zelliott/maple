Human zzso growth factor zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso directly linked to the growth of zzso from various origins and a validated target for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a new approach with designed zzso repeat proteins zzso as alternative zzso we show that binding of two zzso connected by a short zzso one targeting zzso zzso I and the other zzso IV, causes much stronger zzso effects on the zzso breast cancer cell line zzso zzso the therapeutic zzso zzso We determined crystal structures of these zzso in complex with the respective zzso zzso models of the full-length zzso constrained by its rigid domain structures and its membrane zzso explain how the zzso zzso connect two zzso zzso zzso zzso them such that they cannot form zzso zzso with any zzso family member, preventing any zzso zzso and thus leading to a complete loss of zzso
