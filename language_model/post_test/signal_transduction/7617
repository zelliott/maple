The zzso repeat zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso is a common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease zzso Although patients with sporadic zzso and individuals with zzso zzso display the classical zzso zzso it is not known whether or not the same biological pathways are zzso in each zzso By using zzso zzso we investigated the deregulation of various biological pathways in a total of 47 peripheral blood zzso cell zzso samples from patients with sporadic zzso patients zzso for the zzso zzso zzso compared to healthy zzso We found that the deregulation patterns were indeed similar in zzso obtained from patients with sporadic zzso and from zzso zzso carriers, with zzso in zzso zzso cell survival zzso zzso zzso signaling and iron zzso Analysis of our zzso data and other publicly available zzso zzso (for whole blood zzso showed that deregulation of the immune system, zzso and zzso initiation factor 2 zzso signaling are the main features of zzso profiles in zzso (since they are also present in the zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso analysis of zzso is thus valuable for zzso characterizing the zzso pathways shared by genetic and sporadic forms of zzso and zzso identifying potential zzso and therapeutic zzso This minimally invasive approach opens up tremendous perspectives for better diagnosis and therapy of neurodegenerative diseases because it can be applied from the earliest stages of the disease zzso
