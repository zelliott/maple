The zzso zzso zzso is one of two areas in the mature brain where stem cells reside to continuously produce new zzso throughout zzso While much research has focused on the zzso for its roles in adult zzso little is known regarding how this key region of the brain initially develops to form its distinct zzso We show here that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is critical for zzso development of a specific region of the zzso known as the lateral zzso blade zzso zzso zzso and point zzso demonstrate that zzso zzso activity is essential for zzso zzso This is consistent with expression of zzso in zzso neural zzso cells that migrate zzso from the lateral zzso zzso notch zzso to populate the zzso zzso and form the zzso near the zzso of the zzso Animals lacking zzso zzso loss of the zzso and show that this zzso acts as the zzso to stimulate zzso forward signaling and direct migration of the neural zzso into the zzso compartment of the zzso zzso and form the zzso zzso against the zzso zzso protein zzso in a region directly above the developing zzso is dramatically reduced when zzso forward signaling is zzso Together, these results indicate zzso interacting with zzso controls the migration of zzso zzso cells into the zzso half of the developing zzso perhaps in part by affecting zzso expression in a key compartment directly above the zzso
