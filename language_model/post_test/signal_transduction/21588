The zzso signaling zzso is important for survival and growth of cancer zzso In the present paper we show that the zzso signaling zzso is zzso activated in human zzso leukemia virus type I zzso zzso lines and in primary adult zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso a natural compound present in zzso has been studied vigorously as a potent zzso agent for cancer therapy because of its zzso effect on proliferation and induction of zzso in several tumor cell zzso We investigated the effect of zzso on zzso activity in zzso zzso lines and primary ATL zzso zzso zzso is an zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso of zzso and inhibited zzso zzso of zzso zzso activated zzso zzso zzso zzso a downstream target of zzso zzso by zzso zzso of this zzso zzso reduced the expression of cell cycle regulators, zzso D1 and zzso zzso which are both zzso by activated zzso Our results suggest that zzso of the zzso signaling zzso plays an important role in ATL cell survival, and that zzso may have zzso properties zzso at least in part, by zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso agents could be useful for the treatment of zzso In this regard, zzso is a potentially promising compound for the treatment of zzso
