We have developed an alternative method to study the zzso in zzso human zzso by measuring the zzso of the specific membrane markers zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of resting zzso and zzso zzso in specific zzso The expression of these marker proteins was measured by the binding of specific zzso to zzso cells and subsequent flow zzso We first investigated whether the changes in zzso and zzso expression after stimulation of intact cells were comparable with earlier zzso of zzso zzso in which the release of soluble marker proteins was zzso These experiments indicated that this new method compares zzso with earlier studies, both with respect to zzso and stimulus zzso zzso we applied this method (which does not include zzso of the zzso to study zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso a clear zzso of the specific zzso marker zzso was observed upon incubation with a free zzso concentration of 1 zzso a value of the zzso free zzso concentration occurring in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso marker zzso required zzso besides 1 zzso zzso for a significant zzso zzso our study indicates a different requirement for zzso signals of the two main types of zzso in human zzso
