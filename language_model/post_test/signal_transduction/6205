zzso expressing the human zzso virus zzso envelope zzso complex zzso can fuse with zzso zzso When the zzso zzso is initiated in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso with a healthy zzso fusion partner zzso zzso results in zzso of the zzso and thus is zzso The zzso transmission of the lethal signal was only observed when the zzso from donor cells exhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with comet zzso DNA strand breaks, which zzso zzso zzso as well as the loss of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the lethal signal resulted into zzso zzso and zzso nuclear zzso with zzso affecting both the donor and the zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso all zzso of the zzso formed by fusion of the zzso and the healthy cell zzso zzso exhibited DNA zzso and lost zzso zzso zzso of the lethal signal did not require donor cells to contain a nucleus or zzso DNA, yet was inhibited when two zzso zzso zzso or zzso were zzso zzso zzso could be induced in primary human T cells, as well as in zzso in T cells exposed to dying zzso zzso Altogether, these data point to a novel mechanism through which zzso can induce bystander zzso
