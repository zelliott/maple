zzso zzso tolerance is common in zzso although this character has been lost in most vascular zzso The moss zzso zzso survives complete zzso if treated with zzso acid zzso Group A protein zzso type zzso zzso are negative regulators of zzso acid zzso Here we show that the elimination of Group A zzso is sufficient to ensure zzso zzso survival to full zzso without zzso treatment, although its growth is severely zzso zzso analysis shows that the Group A zzso genes exclusively overlap with genes exhibiting a high level of zzso zzso Group A zzso disruption zzso affects zzso zzso activity, indicating Group A zzso action downstream of these zzso in the zzso We propose that Group A zzso emerged in land plants to repress zzso tolerance mechanisms, possibly zzso plants propagation on land, whereas zzso releases the intrinsic zzso tolerance from Group A zzso zzso
