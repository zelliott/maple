zzso cancer shows high expression of type I zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and prostate zzso cells zzso produce zzso Although high plasma level of zzso is a risk factor of prostate cancer, the significance of the prostate zzso zzso in the regulation of prostate cancer remains zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso certainly regulates the development of prostate zzso zzso of zzso increased the growth of human prostate cancer zzso and zzso tumors in severe combined zzso zzso The zzso medium of zzso as well as zzso induced zzso of zzso and increased the growth of zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso and zzso cells, zzso significant amounts of zzso zzso with zzso increased the growth of zzso cells in zzso but the zzso of zzso with small interfering zzso of zzso did not enhance zzso Furthermore, various chemical zzso consisting of 79 compounds with approximately 60 different targets led to the finding that only zzso inhibitor suppressed the zzso growth enhancement of zzso zzso Thus, these results show that the prostate zzso zzso mediates zzso cell interactions of prostate cancer to accelerate tumor growth, supporting the idea that the zzso signaling is a valuable target for the treatment of prostate zzso
