This paper addresses the hypothesis that land plants have a zzso origin as the product of an zzso zzso between a green zzso and a zzso zzso zzso culminating in the acquisition of part of the latter's zzso by the host zzso zzso zzso 1988, Are vascular plants zzso zzso zzso 69, zzso According to this hypothesis, the zzso zzso capacity for invasive growth was exploited during the further evolution of the zzso for the development of various specialized plant cell types, but especially those displaying tip zzso Here, noting the recent discovery of the dependence of zzso tube tip growth on zzso this hypothesis is refined and extended by suggesting that a symbiotic relationship was advanced by the evolution of zzso zzso in the zzso followed by the evolution of a growth response by the zzso zzso to the presence of those zzso allowing the zzso to continue to live with the zzso in its new, zzso zzso This growth response then evolved into a dependence on zzso in the context of an zzso zzso relationship progressing toward zzso and incorporation of the zzso genetic capacity for cell zzso tip growth and their control into the host zzso zzso Land plants and advanced zzso algae (which are the closest zzso relatives of land zzso are likely products of this process, while a primitive zzso zzso zzso both tip growth and cell zzso is proposed to have been the likely host for the zzso A series of tests of this hypothesis, based mainly on the identification and molecular zzso analysis of appropriate zzso are zzso Whether the zzso could have been a relative of the earliest zzso zzso is zzso
