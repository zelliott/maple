zzso melanoma is the most common primary zzso zzso in adult zzso Unlike zzso melanoma, zzso melanoma disseminates zzso to the liver through the zzso zzso To date, the mechanism underlying this zzso zzso is largely zzso This study investigated the effect of zzso growth factor zzso signaling pathways to identify the role of zzso and its downstream zzso in inducing the migration of zzso melanoma zzso 

zzso of zzso melanoma cells was measured by in zzso wound healing and zzso migration zzso The expression and zzso of zzso were detected using indirect zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso pathways was analyzed using specific zzso against zzso and zzso The impact of zzso treatment on the expression of cell zzso molecules was measured using Western zzso 

zzso was found to enhance cell migration, and that zzso migration depends on zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso induced by the zzso axis is involved in the zzso of cell zzso molecules zzso and zzso contributing to the zzso of zzso zzso and promoting the enhanced zzso and migration of zzso melanoma zzso On zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso to the nucleus in a zzso manner, suggesting that zzso may zzso the expression of genes involved in melanoma cell zzso 

Data from this study directly linked the central zzso zzso to zzso melanoma migration and pointed to new avenues for therapeutic intervention in zzso zzso
