The recently cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso into zzso and Chinese zzso zzso cells to compare the binding and signal zzso properties of this zzso with those of the zzso zzso zzso The binding of zzso zzso to both zzso and zzso was of similar high affinity zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso In competitive binding experiments, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso at the zzso and zzso zzso but zzso zzso and zzso bound with higher affinity to the zzso than the zzso zzso zzso 210 had a higher affinity for the zzso zzso zzso a recently identified zzso zzso zzso was essentially zzso at both zzso zzso The structurally related fatty acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso also bound with relatively equal affinity to both zzso but zzso had a higher affinity for the zzso zzso The rank order of potency and efficacy for binding of the selected zzso to the zzso and zzso receptors was zzso in functional zzso of zzso zzso experiments for all compounds zzso Both zzso and zzso receptors couple to the zzso of zzso zzso that was zzso toxin zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was a poor zzso at the zzso zzso in both binding and functional zzso of zzso zzso zzso When expressed in zzso cells, the zzso zzso zzso an zzso of zzso calcium channels and an zzso of inward zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso did not zzso the activity of either channel under identical zzso zzso Similar to results obtained for zzso zzso the zzso zzso did not couple to the zzso of zzso zzso C, or D or to the zzso of zzso zzso Except for its inability to couple to the zzso of zzso calcium channels or inwardly zzso zzso channels, the zzso and zzso receptors display similar pharmacological and zzso zzso
