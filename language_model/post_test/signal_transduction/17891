These studies investigate the role of zzso channels, protein zzso C zzso and zzso activated protein zzso zzso on the zzso of zzso zzso and pharmacological zzso zzso of the human zzso and their sequence of zzso 

Right zzso zzso from patients undergoing zzso cardiac surgery were zzso for 30 zzso and then subjected to 90 zzso of simulated zzso followed by 120 zzso zzso At the end of each protocol zzso zzso leakage zzso zzso wet zzso and the reduction of zzso to zzso dye zzso wet zzso were zzso Similar protection was obtained with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and their combination did not afford additional zzso zzso of zzso channels with zzso zzso with zzso or zzso with zzso abolished the protection of zzso and of zzso In additional studies, the stimulation of zzso channels with zzso or zzso of zzso with zzso or zzso with zzso induced identical protection to that of zzso and zzso The protection induced by zzso was abolished by blockade of zzso and by blockade of zzso Furthermore, the protection induced by zzso was abolished by zzso but not by zzso whereas the protection induced by zzso was unaffected by either zzso or zzso 

Opening of zzso channels and zzso of zzso and zzso are obligatory steps in the signal zzso cascade of zzso and zzso of the human zzso with zzso zzso being downstream of the opening of zzso channels and upstream of zzso zzso
