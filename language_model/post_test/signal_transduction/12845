The zzso zzso drug zzso exerts a significant zzso effect on several types of human zzso including oral zzso cell zzso zzso Because zzso zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso has been linked to zzso of various tumors including head and neck zzso we studied whether zzso treatment affects the zzso signaling zzso in oral zzso zzso Western zzso experiments showed that short-term treatment of cells with zzso resulted in a large reduction of zzso zzso without significantly affecting zzso protein zzso In contrast, 3 days of zzso treatment eliminated both zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso Also, zzso treatment exerted a significant zzso cell zzso effect on oral zzso cells under the same conditions shown to induce zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso which lacks zzso activity, did not affect either zzso expression or zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment against zzso zzso zzso gamma did not zzso the ability of zzso to zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso of zzso can be induced by zzso treatment, thus possibly contributing to the zzso effect of this zzso
