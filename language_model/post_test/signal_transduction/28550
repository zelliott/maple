zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with diverse functions including cancer development, progression and zzso It is unclear how zzso is regulated in zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of zzso growth factor on the expression of zzso in zzso cells, and to explore the signal zzso zzso zzso this zzso 

zzso expression was detected by zzso protection zzso and Western zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso was used to see if zzso signal zzso was involved in the induction of zzso gene zzso 

zzso cells zzso expressed low levels of zzso Treatment with zzso growth factor increased zzso zzso and protein level in a zzso and zzso zzso Application of zzso caused a dramatic reduction of zzso growth zzso zzso zzso 

zzso gene expression can be induced by treatment of zzso cells with zzso growth zzso zzso growth factor may regulate zzso gene expression through zzso signaling zzso Several potential targets in the zzso can be manipulated to block the synthesis of zzso and inhibit liver cancer zzso
