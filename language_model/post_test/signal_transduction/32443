The zzso zzso is expressed at very high levels in nearly zzso of human breast cancer patients and plays an important role in the transformation and the prognosis of breast zzso While evidence accumulates to support the relationship between zzso zzso and poor overall survival in human breast cancer, understanding of the biological zzso of zzso zzso remains zzso Our recent discovery, zzso sequencing, and expression of the zzso zzso zzso has allowed us to identify a number of related but distinct biological zzso which appear responsive to signal zzso through the zzso zzso These zzso of growth, zzso and differentiation have clear implications for the zzso zzso and/or control of zzso and represent established zzso in the assessment of zzso progression in breast zzso Studies in zzso have shown that zzso zzso a zzso growth effect zzso of growth at low zzso and zzso of growth at high zzso on cells with zzso zzso zzso we have recently observed that the zzso zzso zzso can be modulated by zzso acting through the zzso zzso zzso zzso we observed that down regulation of zzso by zzso can be blocked by zzso acting through the zzso zzso Clearly, zzso aspects of the zzso interaction need to be understood from a therapeutic standpoint, and may zzso provide additional insights into treatment zzso for particular zzso We think that these studies will facilitate the emergence of zzso zzso
