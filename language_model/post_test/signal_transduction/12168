zzso zzso occurs in response to a variety of zzso and pathological zzso While pathological zzso in heart failure is usually coupled with depressed zzso function, zzso zzso associates with increased zzso In the present study, we explored whether 8 weeks of moderate intensity exercise training would lead to a cardiac zzso effect in an experimental model of heart failure associated with a zzso of a pathological zzso zzso or zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The cardiac dysfunction, exercise zzso left zzso zzso increased heart weight and zzso zzso from mice lacking zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were associated with sympathetic zzso induced heart zzso The relative contribution of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso targets to pathological zzso of zzso mice was zzso While nuclear zzso B, zzso and zzso zzso were significantly increased in zzso mice, no changes were observed in zzso zzso As expected, zzso treatment decreased nuclear zzso of zzso in zzso mice, which was associated with improved zzso function and a pronounced zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was not activated in zzso zzso Exercise training improved cardiac function and exercise capacity in zzso mice and decreased heart weight and zzso zzso paralleled by diminished nuclear zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso expression zzso When combined, these findings support the notion that zzso of zzso zzso pathological zzso is a preferential mechanism by which exercise training leads to the cardiac zzso effect in heart zzso
