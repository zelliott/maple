The zzso of zzso zzso C is rapidly and zzso induced in the central nervous system by a variety of zzso zzso brain injury is one of the situations that leads to a dramatic increase in zzso zzso zzso In this study, stimulation of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso was measured in zzso slices from rats up to 21 days after an zzso insult of 30 zzso zzso was induced using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso was significantly increased in the slices prepared from zzso rats 24 h after zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8) and 182 zzso zzso zzso zzso 9) of the zzso level zzso This zzso was also observed 21 days after zzso zzso to zzso was also accompanied by an increase in zzso formation of zzso zzso In addition, global zzso did not change either zzso zzso binding in zzso zzso or the stimulation of zzso zzso by zzso or zzso in zzso zzso The present results suggest that the increased responsiveness to zzso is the result, at least in part, of functional changes at the zzso level, and may contribute to the zzso of zzso brain injury or to the zzso phenomena that accompany zzso zzso
