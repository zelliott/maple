The zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important zzso role in zzso but little is known on the zzso mechanisms coupled to this effect of zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso zzso reduction of zzso bursting in a model of zzso activity in mouse zzso zzso In this same model, we investigated whether the zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso is part of those zzso mechanisms zzso zzso zzso zzso Both the expression of zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso release of zzso increased in zzso with zzso zzso In particular, zzso protein increased in zzso zzso layer and in the zzso layer of the zzso zzso In addition, the selective zzso of zzso by zzso markedly decreased zzso zzso release induced by zzso bursting and the zzso bursting zzso Similar effects on zzso bursting were obtained with another zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso application zzso the increase of both zzso expression and zzso release which occurred in zzso with zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso and zzso comparably reduced zzso bursting in a zzso manner and zzso abolished the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso These results demonstrate that: zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso exerts an zzso role by zzso to the zzso zzso In conclusion, we have identified a key set of zzso events that zzso zzso effects of zzso in a mouse model of zzso zzso thus providing useful data not only to identify alternative intervention points for the zzso of zzso function, but also to exploit new chemical space for zzso zzso
