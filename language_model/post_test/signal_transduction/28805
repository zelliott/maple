We analyzed the global zzso response of zzso zzso cells exposed to different zzso of zzso in the growth medium and at different times after zzso Early responsive genes were mainly involved in cell wall structure and zzso About half of the induced genes were previously shown to respond to other zzso metal zzso in a zzso zzso Western zzso analysis confirmed that cesium zzso as low as 100 zzso activate zzso zzso Another important fraction of the zzso genes requires zzso for full responsiveness as shown by the zzso of a zzso strain in the presence of zzso We showed that a cell zzso process promptly occurs in response to cesium addition, which is dependent on the presence of both zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, the sensitivity to low concentration of cesium of the zzso strain is not observed in a strain carrying the zzso double zzso We conclude that the observed early zzso zzso of cell wall genes has a crucial role in zzso zzso adaptation to zzso
