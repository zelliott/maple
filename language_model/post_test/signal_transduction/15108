zzso zzso is the most important zzso zzso zzso causing severe infections in zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso signaling pathways are involved in the regulation of various cellular responses to environmental changes in zzso Genome zzso analysis revealed that the central core of the cell wall integrity signaling zzso in zzso zzso is composed of three protein zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso This zzso is of particular interest because it represents a possible target for new zzso zzso zzso of these genes resulted in severe sensitivity of the zzso against cell zzso compounds and drastic zzso of the zzso zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso and zzso directly activate zzso during zzso growth and under cell wall stress conditions further confirming that zzso zzso and zzso form a zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, this zzso zzso module affects the formation of zzso derived from zzso zzso
