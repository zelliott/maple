In addition to well established zzso functions, zzso acutely affect neurotransmitter zzso from the zzso nerve zzso influence synaptic development, and may serve as selective retrograde zzso that regulate synaptic zzso The crucial question related to the mechanisms of zzso signaling is whether acute effects of zzso are zzso restricted to the activated zzso Here we have used a local zzso technique for local delivery of zzso zzso to various regions of developing zzso zzso zzso in zzso Within minutes after a focal exposure of a zzso or a small ( approximately 30 zzso in zzso zzso segment to zzso we observed an increase in the spontaneous neurotransmitter zzso from the zzso nerve terminals located approximately zzso zzso away from the site of zzso zzso zzso activity along the zzso zzso was not zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso signal may rapidly travel through zzso zzso over unexpectedly long distances and zzso neurotransmitter release specifically at the zzso nerve zzso
