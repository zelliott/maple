zzso T cell development represents one of the best studied zzso of zzso zzso zzso committed precursors enter the zzso and the zzso zzso plays an essential role in committing them to the T cell zzso The zzso cell zzso zzso as an autonomous cell signaling zzso commits cells to the zzso lineage while its rival, the zzso is involved in generating the zzso lineage of T zzso Positive and negative selection of immature zzso cells are essential mechanisms for generating mature T cells, committing them to the zzso and zzso lineages and avoiding zzso Additional lineages of zzso cells, such as the natural killer T cell lineage and the zzso regulatory T cell zzso are formed when the zzso encounters specific zzso in suitable zzso Thus, positive selection and zzso lineage commitment represent a hallmark of the zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso contribute to zzso zzso discrimination, which represents an essential feature for the evolutionary fitness of zzso zzso
