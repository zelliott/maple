Are there zzso computing agents' capable to zzso Turing zzso zzso It is perhaps tempting to dismiss this question with a negative zzso Quite the opposite, for the first time in the literature on molecular computing we contend that the answer is not theoretically zzso Our results will be formulated in the language of membrane computing zzso zzso Some mathematical results presented here are interesting in zzso In contrast with most zzso methods which are based on zzso our results rest upon some zzso results proved for deterministic P zzso These results will be used for building zzso P zzso In contrast with the case of Turing machines, acceleration is a part of the hardware (not a quality of the zzso and it is zzso either by decreasing the size of zzso or by zzso the communication zzso zzso two acceleration zzso of biological inspiration are zzso each of them poses specific questions to zzso Finally, in a more speculative part of the paper, we will deal with Turing zzso activity of the brain and possible forms of zzso zzso
