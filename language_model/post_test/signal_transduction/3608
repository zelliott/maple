The zzso zzso repeat protein zzso is a component of a negative feedback system that zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso the timing and spacing of formation of the zzso zzso are controlled by a molecular zzso termed the zzso zzso zzso are also patterned along the zzso axis of the zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso and mice exhibit genetic zzso defects of the zzso zzso While progression of the zzso clock occurred in zzso zzso they exhibited altered zzso patterning of the zzso In zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso compartment was zzso These studies confirm an anticipated, but previously zzso role for the zzso gene in zzso zzso patterning and provide an example of the strong influence that genetic background plays on the zzso exhibited by zzso zzso
