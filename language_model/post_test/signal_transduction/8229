zzso coli zzso zzso is an zzso zzso characterized by two kinds of zzso a zzso zzso critical for zzso activity, and a zzso interface formed upon zzso due to zzso binding of zzso In this work, zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso and the impact of zzso binding on the unfolding zzso of the zzso and the zzso forms of the zzso was zzso The zzso zzso form unfolds and zzso from zzso to zzso M zzso without the zzso of native zzso as indicated by circular zzso and size exclusion zzso zzso However, a zzso intermediate with an expanded volume and residual secondary structure accumulates above zzso M zzso The zzso zzso complex shows a shift in the simultaneous zzso and unfolding process to elevated zzso zzso (from zzso to zzso zzso together with the expulsion of the zzso detected by intrinsic zzso zzso The unfolding zzso of the zzso zzso complex shows the zzso of a zzso intermediate with altered zzso properties at about zzso M zzso Above this concentration a sharp transition from zzso to zzso without the zzso of either compact zzso or zzso was detected by light scattering zzso Indeed, the most populated species was a partially unfolded zzso about zzso M zzso On the basis of these results, we suggest that the zzso contacts are critical for the maintenance of the overall structure of zzso and for the binding of zzso explaining the reported importance of the zzso state for zzso zzso
