The zzso of zzso bacteria to zzso zzso zzso proteins is regarded as an important zzso of zzso A comparison of the zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso to different zzso proteins showed that the most pronounced binding could be observed for immobilized zzso To investigate the genetic zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso library was screened for zzso displaying reduced zzso of zzso latex zzso A putative zzso signal zzso system was identified and designated zzso It comprises genes zzso a putative response regulator of 218 zzso acids and a putative zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the deduced proteins with the zzso database revealed a significant similarity to zzso systems of zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso locus showed that the zzso genes are located on one zzso To further characterize the influence of the putative zzso zzso zzso in the zzso locus on the zzso of zzso zzso to immobilized zzso a targeted zzso of zzso was zzso In comparison to the zzso strain this zzso demonstrated altered zzso binding capacities depending on bacterial cell zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins in the wild type and the zzso zzso strain revealed that zzso levels of the zzso zzso gene zzso were increased in the zzso strain while the zzso of the zzso zzso factor gene zzso was unaffected by this zzso Based on these results, we zzso that zzso regulates the expression of bacterial cell surface zzso
