zzso sense the rigidity of their environment and respond to zzso Most studies have been focused on the role of zzso complexes in rigidity zzso In particular, it has been clearly shown that proteins of the zzso complexes were zzso and could thus trigger zzso signaling in response to applied zzso In order to understand how this local zzso could be coordinated at the cell scale, we have recently carried out single cell traction force zzso on springs of varying zzso We found that zzso at the cell scale zzso speed of contraction, mechanical power) was indeed adapted to external zzso and reflected zzso activity of zzso zzso II and zzso response to zzso Here we suggest a scenario of rigidity sensing where local zzso sensitivity to force could be coordinated by adaptation of the zzso dependent cortical tension at the global cell zzso Such a scenario could explain how spreading and migration are oriented by the rigidity of the cell zzso
