The zzso of cortical circuits is modulated by zzso that release the zzso neurotransmitter zzso In zzso and zzso visual cortex, activity deprivation leads to a decrease in the expression of zzso This suggests that activity is able to adjust the strength of cortical zzso but this has not been demonstrated zzso In addition, the nature of the signal linking activity to zzso expression has not been zzso zzso is known to regulate the expression of the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso has been shown to influence the zzso of zzso zzso We use a culture system from zzso rat visual zzso to test the hypothesis that activity is regulating the strength of cortical zzso through the regulation of zzso zzso were zzso against zzso and the zzso marker zzso and the percentage of zzso that were zzso was zzso zzso spontaneous activity in these cultures zzso decreased the number of zzso zzso without affecting zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso currents demonstrated that activity blockade also decreased zzso zzso onto zzso zzso and raised zzso zzso firing zzso All of these effects were prevented by incubation with zzso during activity zzso but not by zzso 3 or nerve growth zzso Additionally, blockade of zzso signaling zzso the effects of activity blockade on zzso zzso These data suggest that activity regulates cortical zzso through a zzso mechanism and that this zzso plays an important role in the control of cortical zzso
