The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is of great practical and research interest because of its zzso widespread zzso effects, primarily zzso and zzso arising from its ability to interact with proteins and zzso Although zzso was originally shown to possess zzso properties, its effects on acute gastric zzso have not been previously zzso The aim of the present study is to evaluate the protective effect of zzso on ethanol induced gastric zzso in zzso Administration of zzso at doses of 1, 5 and zzso zzso prior to ethanol zzso zzso inhibited gastric zzso The gastric zzso zzso was assessed by zzso area, gastric juice zzso zzso zzso activities, zzso and zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced the gastric zzso index, zzso activities, zzso and zzso score in a zzso zzso In addition, zzso also significantly inhibited zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso level in serum and gastric zzso in the mice exposed to ethanol induced zzso in a zzso zzso In addition, zzso analysis revealed that zzso markedly attenuated the zzso of nuclear zzso in gastric zzso of zzso It was concluded that zzso represents a potential therapeutic option to reduce the risk of gastric zzso In addition, acute toxicity study revealed no abnormal sign to the mice treated with zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso activity of zzso might contribute in adjusting the inflammatory zzso by regulating the zzso zzso zzso
