zzso the gene zzso in human zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso nuclear regulator of zzso proliferation and zzso Here, we have identified a new function of zzso in controlling zzso progression in zzso Loss of zzso in mice leads to an increased proportion of cells arrested in zzso and, zzso to zzso segregation zzso zzso for the molecular basis of the zzso we found that zzso acts as regulator of zzso zzso zzso interacts with two zzso zzso zzso and zzso thereby increasing their zzso Loss of zzso results in zzso zzso zzso which is maintained during zzso zzso zzso zzso and binding of zzso is impaired, and zzso zzso accumulate in zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso identifying zzso as an important regulator of zzso zzso during zzso in zzso Our data provide the first evidence that the control of zzso can be linked to the regulation of zzso differentiation by zzso consequences of altered zzso zzso
