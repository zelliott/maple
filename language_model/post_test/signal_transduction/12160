zzso has been used as general zzso for thousands of years in Asia and becomes a popular herbal medicine all over the zzso However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying its benefit effects are less zzso Thus, we investigated the effect of a crude extract from zzso zzso (American zzso on suppression of zzso responses in zzso with a focus on signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

The crude extract of American zzso that was supplied by the National Research Council of Canada, Institute for National zzso zzso zzso was freshly zzso in zzso zzso Eagle zzso zzso prior to each zzso zzso cells, a zzso zzso cell line, were exposed to zzso zzso to induce inflammatory responses such as expression of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso 2 zzso zzso were measured by Western zzso and zzso expression was determined by quantitative real-time zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso nuclear zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities were investigated using zzso reporter zzso 

American zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso however, it did not affect zzso zzso zzso While American zzso had no impact on zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso it dramatically inhibited zzso zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, American zzso and zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso suppressed the zzso zzso zzso 

American zzso selectively zzso the expression of zzso via suppression of zzso cascade but not zzso and zzso pathways in inflamed zzso Such a preferential suppression of zzso cascade by American zzso might have therapeutic potential for inflammatory diseases with zzso of zzso
