zzso is an zzso immune zzso zzso broadly zzso on the majority of human and zzso zzso and its functions have been attributed to delivering an zzso signal to its zzso programmed zzso zzso on T zzso Here we report that zzso on cancer cells receives a signal from zzso to rapidly induce resistance against T zzso killing because crippling signaling capacity of zzso but not zzso zzso this zzso zzso loss of zzso signaling is accompanied by increased zzso to zzso zzso zzso In addition to resistance against zzso destruction, zzso cancer cells also become zzso to zzso induced by zzso zzso or the protein zzso inhibitor zzso Our study reveals a new mechanism by which cancer cells use a zzso on immune cells as a zzso to induce resistance to zzso
