We have investigated the effect of zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso on zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso mediates dramatic shape changes that include zzso of the membrane zzso resulting in membrane zzso zzso We have found that the cell shape changes correlate with changes in electrical zzso measured in cellular zzso The shape and zzso changes were prevented after zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso Although zzso formation usually zzso zzso cell death, we have found that zzso cellular zzso does not associate with zzso zzso with a zzso zzso of zzso zzso that blocks zzso or with the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso completely prevented zzso shape and zzso zzso zzso was also completely inhibited by zzso a zzso light chain zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso C inhibitor zzso did not interfere with the effect of zzso P zzso on cellular zzso and cellular zzso but completely blocked zzso zzso calcium increase, indicating that the zzso is a process independent of zzso calcium zzso zzso is a protein zzso zzso process, since the zzso protein zzso C inhibitor zzso did not interfere with zzso zzso Based on these results, we provide the first evidence that zzso zzso interaction can cause zzso cellular zzso and that this process is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso
