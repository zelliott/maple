For studying the effect of zzso on the zzso of mouse eggs and its zzso signaling zzso zzso mouse eggs were loaded with calcium probe zzso and the intensity of zzso of the eggs treated with different factors was measured through laser zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso of zzso mouse eggs was increased when the eggs were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the mouse eggs was also increased when the eggs were placed in zzso medium and treated with zzso zzso or zzso The changes in the mouse egg zzso caused by zzso and zzso were similar to those caused by zzso However, the concentration of zzso of the zzso mouse eggs zzso with zzso zzso inhibitor was not increased when the eggs were treated in the same way, and, neither was the zzso calcium increased in those eggs zzso with zzso inhibitor when the eggs were treated with zzso zzso It is therefore suggested that the occupancy of zzso on the membrane of mouse eggs by their zzso mediates the release of zzso and then the increase in the zzso of eggs, which is one of the early events of egg zzso The zzso zzso signaling zzso and zzso are involved in this process as zzso
