zzso therapy achieves its therapeutic effects by inducing zzso and zzso cell zzso The aim of this focused review is to highlight the aspects of the cell death pathways most relevant to conventional zzso radiation zzso I review reports on how our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cell death may enable us to revise the four zzso principles zzso repair of zzso damage, zzso of cells in the cell cycle, and zzso of surviving zzso for radiation treatment with zzso dose zzso zzso and zzso forms of cell death are not represented in the linear zzso model, which is clinically used to calculate the effects of different total doses, dose per fraction and fraction number on zzso cell death, a mode of cell death associated with lethal zzso zzso Examples are provided to justify or not a reassessment of the role of zzso and zzso cell death in zzso tumor cell proliferation and tumor zzso As our understanding of zzso developed at the molecular level, so did our understanding of other forms of cell death, particularly zzso and to a lesser extent, zzso The linear zzso model remains a guide for the treatment zzso The therapeutic clinical roles of zzso and zzso forms of cell death remain to be zzso Their relative importance will probably lie in tumor zzso history related to its type, size and zzso zzso research should focus on the quantitative effects of dose and zzso on the radiation induction of zzso and zzso types of cell death and the interplay among cell death zzso This article is part of a Special zzso entitled zzso Four Decades zzso
