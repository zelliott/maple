zzso zzso has long been used as a traditional Chinese medicine to treat zzso zzso abdominal pain and other zzso 

The goal of this work was to study the zzso effect of zzso A, a constituent isolated from the stems of zzso zzso zzso and to extend its traditional use for clinical applications in treating human zzso zzso 

zzso effect of zzso A was determined by the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells treated with various zzso of zzso A for three zzso zzso was detected by the change of cell zzso and flow zzso zzso The zzso oxygen species zzso level and zzso membrane potential zzso were determined by flow zzso Western zzso analysis was used to zzso the expression of zzso and zzso signaling zzso 

zzso A selectively induced zzso in two zzso human zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso in comparison with normal immortalized zzso cells zzso zzso A reduced zzso membrane potential zzso and caused zzso of zzso zzso zzso A increased zzso ratios, the amount of zzso c released from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso activated zzso and zzso and ultimately led to zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, a higher dose zzso of zzso A zzso enhanced the zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso 

The current study demonstrated that zzso A triggered the zzso zzso pathways and zzso and zzso zzso in the human zzso zzso cell line zzso In addition, zzso A zzso enhanced zzso effect of zzso and zzso in zzso These data suggested that zzso A exhibited a potent zzso zzso This study supports the traditional use of zzso zzso stems with a therapeutic potential for the treatment of human zzso zzso
