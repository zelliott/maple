zzso known primarily for its zzso zzso function, is a zzso structural and signaling scaffold that binds zzso receptors and a wide variety of zzso signaling zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has a well zzso overall structure, including an zzso zzso domain, and a series of 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso partially zzso with zzso filaments in zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of zzso resulting from a deletion zzso and zzso depletion indicates zzso is required to maintain the zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso and to allow the exit of zzso from the zzso zzso deficient animals accumulate zzso in the zzso lay damaged and zzso eggs, and consequently exhibit dramatically reduced zzso zzso The zzso zzso is also required for the exit of zzso from the zzso and analysis of doubly zzso animals suggests that zzso and zzso act in the same zzso to promote proper transit of zzso from the zzso to the zzso Given the modular protein structure, zzso zzso genetic interaction with zzso and known zzso functions of zzso we zzso that zzso may be required to convert mechanical information about the presence of the zzso into a zzso zzso thereby allowing timely exit of the zzso from the zzso
