One of the most abundant zzso zzso formed under pathological conditions is zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso a potent zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the signal zzso events initiated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rings from male zzso rats were suspended in tissue baths containing zzso salt solution, stretched to optimal resting tension and zzso zzso alpha induced zzso zzso in pulmonary arteries zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) which were blocked by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso response to zzso alpha was significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) diminished zzso 1) zzso and zzso 2) zzso free zzso 3) zzso a zzso gated zzso channel zzso 4) zzso a zzso zzso channel zzso and 5) zzso C, a protein zzso C zzso These data suggest that the zzso response to zzso alpha is: 1) zzso via zzso of zzso zzso 2) partially dependent on the synthesis and release of other zzso derived zzso 3) dependent on an influx of zzso zzso possibly via zzso zzso and 4) may be zzso zzso
