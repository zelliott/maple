The zzso heat shock protein zzso is the most abundant molecular zzso in zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in regulating signal zzso pathways that control cell proliferation since its zzso function is restricted to a subset of proteins including some signal zzso zzso function of these proteins can be induced by an zzso agent zzso zzso which is the specific inhibitor of zzso In this study, it was demonstrated that zzso interferes with zzso proliferation of zzso zzso zzso As to the signaling mechanisms underlying this zzso effect, we discovered zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso factor zzso indicating the proper function of zzso is indispensable for zzso zzso This conclusion is validated by the observation that zzso interacts with zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso interrupts their zzso Furthermore, by constructing deletion zzso we identified the zzso half of zzso zzso region is responsible for binding with zzso
