The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is an important participant in the zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso and, unlike the expanded zzso zzso gene family, is zzso by a single gene in nearly all model and zzso zzso zzso is essential for viability in both zzso zzso and in zzso zzso These and other aspects of zzso biology, combined with the availability of structural and zzso data in zzso zzso suggest that the essential interactions between zzso and response regulator zzso would be a good target for zzso drug zzso The goal of this zzso is to zzso the wealth of data on zzso zzso zzso and to consider the potential benefits of conducting related studies in zzso zzso
