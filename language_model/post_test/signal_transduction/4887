In this study, the underlying mechanisms of the potential zzso properties of zzso zzso were zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso were supplemented with increasing zzso of zzso In addition, zzso mice zzso 10 per zzso were fed a zzso high-fat diet and zzso was administered orally via zzso for 7 zzso zzso of inflammation were determined both in cultured cells and in zzso zzso significantly decreased zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso levels and its zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, gene expression of other zzso markers including zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso were zzso following zzso zzso zzso decreased nuclear zzso protein levels, a zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso our data indicate that zzso significantly attenuated zzso levels in zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso effects of zzso were accompanied by an increase in zzso nuclear zzso and consequently by an increase of zzso and protein levels of the zzso target gene zzso zzso zzso was slightly less potent than zzso zzso as a positive zzso in zzso inflammation in zzso zzso A significant increase in nuclear zzso and zzso 1 gene expression and only a moderate zzso of zzso and zzso levels due to zzso was found in mouse zzso Present data suggest that zzso exhibits potent zzso activity in cultured zzso in zzso but has only little zzso activity in mice in zzso
