zzso is a G zzso zzso of considerable biological significance, and among its numerous functions, it is suggested to play a critical role in cancer zzso We have investigated the expression and function of zzso in a range of breast cancer cell lines covering a spectrum of invasive zzso and found that, while surface levels of zzso were uniform across the entire panel, only highly invasive cells that are zzso in zzso mice expressed functional zzso zzso induced cellular responses such as calcium zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells, whereas zzso cells were zzso Moreover, zzso activated multiple signaling pathways downstream of G proteins in highly invasive cells but failed to activate any of the examined zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso This blockade in zzso cell lines seems to be due to the inability of G protein alpha and beta zzso to form a zzso complex with zzso zzso and zzso were able to bind to zzso independently in all cell lines, but the association of G protein zzso zzso with the zzso a prerequisite for signal zzso downstream from G zzso zzso was only observed in the highly invasive cell zzso Our findings show, for the first time, that zzso function is subject to complex and potentially tightly controlled regulation in breast cancer cells via differential G zzso complex formation, and this regulation may play a role in the transition from zzso to zzso zzso
