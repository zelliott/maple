Bone zzso proteins zzso have been shown to play crucial roles in not only lung and heart development, but also in the zzso of pulmonary vascular zzso in pulmonary hypertension zzso We therefore hypothesized that zzso signaling could be altered in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and associated zzso 

zzso rats were exposed to either zzso zzso or vehicle on embryonic day zzso zzso On zzso and zzso fetuses were delivered by zzso section, killed and checked for zzso zzso The tissue was then harvested for zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso pulmonary expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso type 2 and zzso decreased on zzso and zzso On zzso pulmonary zzso expression increased, while zzso zzso In the zzso zzso expression was correlated to zzso and zzso and zzso correlated to zzso zzso zzso expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso while zzso and zzso expressions increased on zzso On zzso zzso expressions of zzso and zzso zzso while zzso expression zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso expressions were correlated to zzso expression and zzso correlated to zzso zzso ratio within the zzso 

zzso of zzso signaling seems to contribute to pulmonary and zzso anomalies observed in zzso zzso
