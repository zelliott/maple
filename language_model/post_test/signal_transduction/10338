zzso mediate multiple zzso guidance decisions, but the mechanisms underlying the responses of growth cones to these cues remain poorly zzso We show here that collapse induced by zzso medium zzso in zzso retinal growth cones requires local protein synthesis zzso and zzso zzso elicits rapid zzso of translation regulators and zzso zzso in growth cones, and zzso of zzso or disruption of zzso zzso blocks zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso causes a fast zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso with a zzso increase in the zzso protein zzso Our findings reveal an unexpected link between zzso and zzso in growth cones and suggest that local translation of zzso regulatory proteins contributes to zzso
