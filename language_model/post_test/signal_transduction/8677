zzso 2 zzso is a protein zzso zzso with many additional biological zzso We have previously shown that in zzso mice the in zzso clearance of zzso cells is defective leading to zzso zzso contributes to the formation of zzso portals by binding to both zzso zzso a known zzso zzso and its bridging zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cannot accumulate around the zzso cells and its signaling is zzso In the present study we describe a zzso of zzso zzso mice, in which a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso which resulted alone in a high zzso concentration around the zzso cells without the requirement for zzso partially corrected the zzso in zzso zzso zzso Our data provide a proof for the concept that the function of zzso is to stabilize accumulated zzso zzso concentration in the zzso zzso
