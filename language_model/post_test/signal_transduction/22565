zzso zzso mice with cardiac zzso zzso exhibit enhanced zzso and zzso responses to sympathetic zzso but develop zzso with zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso in zzso mice with zzso zzso could be averted with chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice and zzso zzso zzso were treated with the zzso blocker zzso for zzso months, starting at a time when the zzso was developing but was not yet severe enough to induce significant cardiac depression zzso months of age), and ending at a time when cardiac depression and zzso would have been clearly manifest (16 months of zzso zzso treatment, which can induce cardiac depression in the normal heart, actually prevented cardiac zzso and the depressed left zzso function characteristic of older zzso mice, and abolished premature zzso zzso also prevented the increase in zzso zzso area and zzso zzso zzso zzso already apparent in 9-month-old zzso mice, was actually eliminated by chronic zzso This study indicates that chronic sympathetic stimulation over an extended period is deleterious and results in zzso zzso zzso blockade is zzso in this situation and can prevent the development of zzso
