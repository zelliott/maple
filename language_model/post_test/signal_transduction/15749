zzso bacterial pathogens must adapt to multiple stimuli to persist in the environment or establish infection within a zzso zzso is often zzso as a signal to control expression of zzso genes necessary for infection or genes required for persistence in the zzso However, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms that allow bacteria to adapt and respond to temperature zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso pathogen that uses zzso zzso to survive in the zzso environment and to enhance initial invasion of host cells during zzso Upon entering the host, zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso genes in response to zzso zzso temperature zzso with a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso We previously determined that zzso of zzso zzso is required for zzso and is governed by the zzso activities of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we determined that zzso is also a protein thermometer that controls zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and gel mobility shift analyses indicated that the interaction between zzso and zzso is temperature zzso Using circular zzso and limited zzso we determined that zzso zzso a zzso zzso change as temperature is zzso zzso analysis of zzso in zzso revealed that zzso is zzso in the absence of zzso and at zzso (when the zzso complex is less zzso Since zzso zzso zzso of all zzso zzso zzso including zzso of zzso changes in the stability of the zzso zzso complex, due to zzso changes in zzso mediates repression or zzso of zzso zzso genes in zzso Thus, zzso functions as a zzso zzso that incorporates temperature signals into zzso control of zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first example of a protein thermometer that functions as an zzso to control a zzso process in zzso
