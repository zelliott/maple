zzso an zzso protein composed of one zzso and three zzso zzso is a common target for various cell surface zzso zzso is thought to function as an zzso protein to couple cell surface receptors to downstream zzso molecules that regulate cellular responses induced by zzso zzso In this report, we show that zzso forms a stable complex in zzso with zzso in zzso zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso is zzso by the binding of the zzso domain of zzso to zzso zzso Although zzso associates with zzso zzso zzso is not affected by insulin zzso Furthermore, in zzso and in zzso studies show that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso bind distinct zzso zzso in zzso After insulin stimulation all three signaling molecules can be found zzso to a single zzso zzso These findings provide further evidence that, in response to insulin zzso zzso acts as an zzso zzso protein that coordinates the regulation of various different signaling pathways activated by the insulin zzso
