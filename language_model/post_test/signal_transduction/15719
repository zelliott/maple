zzso bacteria are a frequent cause of zzso zzso The zzso defenses against infection are not completely zzso We have used the zzso mouse model for zzso zzso zzso to analyze the role of zzso gamma zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is known to contribute to acute zzso zzso zzso We have compared the acute zzso inflammation in zzso mice and wild type zzso zzso mice zzso increased pathogen loads in the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso of the zzso mice did not show the dramatic zzso of zzso zzso cell zzso a hallmark of the wild type zzso zzso Using bone zzso zzso mice we established that zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso cells, zzso controlled zzso zzso loss by zzso zzso In contrast, zzso in bone zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso was required for restricting pathogen growth in the gut zzso Thus zzso influences different zzso responses to infection, including not only pathogen restriction in the zzso zzso but, as shown here, also zzso cell zzso
