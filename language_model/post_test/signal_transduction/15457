zzso zzso zzso T cells with specific zzso and zzso signals is insufficient to induce optimal zzso expansion and zzso zzso In this study, we show that the zzso and differentiation of zzso T cells require zzso provided by activated zzso T cells at the initial zzso stage within zzso hours after zzso This critical zzso signal from zzso cells is zzso through the zzso of zzso cells, which is independent of zzso The zzso of zzso signaling advances the restriction point of the cell cycle, and thereby zzso the entry of zzso zzso zzso into the S zzso Besides promoting cell zzso zzso stimulation increases the amount of zzso and zzso B produced by zzso T zzso Furthermore, zzso at zzso enhances the ability of zzso zzso cells generated by zzso zzso to eradicate zzso tumors in zzso zzso our studies demonstrate that a full zzso zzso response is zzso by a critical zzso function of zzso released from zzso T cells, providing zzso insights into the regulation of zzso T cell zzso and zzso
