The failure of zzso to zzso after spinal zzso injury remains one of the greatest challenges facing both medicine and zzso but in the last 20 years there have been tremendous advances in the field of spinal zzso injury zzso One of the most important of these has been the identification of zzso proteins in zzso zzso and this has led to the development of strategies that will enable zzso to overcome zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been one of the most successful of these strategies, and in this review we examine how zzso signaling promotes zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso levels can be increased through a peripheral conditioning zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso with zzso or treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso and each of these methods has been shown to overcome zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso It is now known that the effects of zzso are zzso dependent, and that zzso zzso of zzso leads to zzso expression of genes such as zzso I and zzso The products of these genes have been shown to directly promote zzso zzso which raises the possibility that other zzso genes could yield additional agents that would be beneficial in the treatment of spinal zzso zzso Further study of these zzso in combination with human clinical trials of existing agents such as zzso would allow the therapeutic potential of zzso to be fully zzso
