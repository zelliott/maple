In zzso zzso production by zzso conversion from zzso plays an important role in breast tumor zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso can rapidly enhance zzso zzso activity through an increase of zzso protein zzso in breast cancer cell zzso In zzso labeling experiments and zzso zzso studies demonstrated that zzso of the zzso zzso is crucial in the zzso of zzso activity under zzso zzso Our results demonstrated a direct involvement of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso activity because zzso of its signaling zzso the zzso effects induced by zzso on zzso activity as well as zzso of zzso zzso In addition, from our data it emerges that zzso is a target of cross talk between growth factor receptors and zzso zzso alpha zzso These findings show, for the first time, that zzso zzso processes play a key role in the rapid changes induced by zzso in zzso zzso activity, revealing the existence of a short zzso zzso loop between zzso and zzso in breast cancer zzso
