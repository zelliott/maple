To gain insight into systemic molecular events associated with an age-related neurodegenerative disorder, we compared gene expression patterns in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso sampled from elderly, healthy controls and from Parkinson's disease zzso patients carrying the most frequently found zzso of the zzso gene zzso A zzso approach enabled us to detect zzso expressed genes and revealed zzso of pathways known to be involved in zzso zzso the zzso system, the zzso zzso system, zzso zzso guidance, calcium zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso of the zzso zzso pathway, the zzso zzso the zzso zzso system and zzso transport - all recently associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso - were zzso Furthermore, we acquired new zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and immune system pathways in zzso These data show that the zzso zzso affects the entire body and highlight some of the molecular events observed in the zzso This zzso zzso approach could be used to better understand zzso in zzso and decipher new zzso mechanisms, even at early stages of the zzso
