The synaptic zzso of zzso channel receptors is essential for efficient synaptic zzso and the precise regulation of diverse zzso functions, such as signal integration and synaptic zzso Emerging evidence points to an important role of zzso proteins that assemble receptors and components of the zzso machinery at zzso membrane zzso This article reviews interactions of zzso zzso neurotransmitter receptors with the zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso components involved in downstream zzso and/or control of signal zzso zzso The presently available data suggest a central synaptic organizer function for zzso in zzso zzso membrane assembly and zzso
