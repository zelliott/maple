Despite the fact that classical zzso zzso zzso has been described more than 170 years ago, only over the last 15 years significant advances regarding its molecular zzso have been zzso The lack of a specific lineage profile in combination with the low number of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells in the affected zzso zzso prevented for a long time both the identification of its cell of origin and of zzso and molecular zzso The development of methods for the analysis of zzso single cells made it possible to demonstrate a B cell origin of zzso zzso However, it has become clear that the normal B zzso gene expression program in zzso cells is disrupted by various molecular zzso Furthermore, molecular and zzso defects of various signaling pathways could be identified in zzso cells, including the zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso which protect zzso cells from zzso cell zzso Despite significant advances in the treatment of zzso the considerable long term toxicity of conventional therapies requires the development of new zzso therapeutic zzso zzso it will be a central aim to develop new treatment strategies based on these insights into zzso zzso
