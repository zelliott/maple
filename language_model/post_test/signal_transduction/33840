zzso sensing is a term used to describe zzso communication that allows zzso gene zzso Many bacteria use zzso zzso zzso zzso to generate fatty zzso zzso signals, which function with signal receptors to control expression of specific zzso The fatty zzso group is derived from fatty acid zzso and provides signal zzso but the variety of signals is zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso uses an zzso zzso to produce zzso by using environmental zzso acid rather than fatty acids from cellular zzso The zzso has a signal zzso with zzso to fatty zzso receptors that responds to zzso to regulate global gene zzso We also found that zzso is made by other bacteria including zzso zzso and zzso zzso This discovery extends the range of possibilities for zzso zzso sensing and raises fundamental questions about zzso sensing within the context of environmental zzso
