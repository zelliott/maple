The zzso kidney plays a crucial role in the zzso zzso of the zzso To maintain a net zzso balance, more than zzso of the filtered load of zzso must be zzso along the zzso There are two potential pathways through which net zzso zzso can zzso First, a zzso and passive route that zzso in the zzso zzso and thick ascending limb of zzso zzso Second, a zzso active transport that zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso transport involves passive influx across the zzso zzso diffusion through the zzso and active zzso across the zzso zzso The rate of active zzso zzso is controlled by the zzso hormones, zzso zzso hormone, zzso and zzso zzso The application of new techniques in zzso physiology has greatly increased our knowledge of the zzso handling of zzso and allowed the examination of zzso transport processes at the cellular and zzso zzso This review focuses primarily on the mechanisms and regulation of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso consists of at least four discrete segments and the contribution of each segment to active zzso zzso is discussed in zzso
