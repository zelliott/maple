We have examined protein zzso A zzso zzso expression in adult rat skeletal zzso Northern blots identified zzso zzso alpha and regulatory zzso I alpha and zzso alpha zzso as the major zzso expressed in slowly contracting zzso zzso and rapidly contracting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and activities of zzso alpha and zzso alpha promoters are similar in zzso and zzso These data indicate that zzso mechanisms account for the twofold differences in zzso zzso protein levels reported zzso zzso stimulation of zzso zzso with an zzso activity pattern zzso zzso transformed zzso into an zzso muscle with regard to zzso protein zzso These experiments suggest that the zzso regulation is activity zzso zzso specifically increased zzso alpha promoter activity and zzso alpha zzso levels in zzso and zzso Further experiments indicated that the zzso alpha zzso upstream sequences were activated following zzso zzso electrical stimulation prevented the rise in zzso alpha zzso levels following zzso demonstrating that electrical muscle activity regulates zzso
