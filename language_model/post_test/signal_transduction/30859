An inverse correlation between the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso has been reported in the chronic pathological conditions zzso insulin resistance, coronary artery disease, and zzso zzso We investigated whether this relationship is coincidental or has a zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso suppresses zzso transcription, zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso suppresses zzso zzso activity, an effect reversed by deletion or zzso of the zzso core zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso and in zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity, and zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso inhibitor zzso or small interference zzso targeted to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso or zzso zzso reverses zzso zzso zzso In contrast to its zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso zzso These data demonstrate for the first time that zzso selectively suppresses zzso expression via zzso zzso zzso and suggest that the inverse relationship observed between zzso and zzso in various chronic pathological conditions is zzso zzso Thus, targeting zzso expression may enhance zzso expression and mitigate disease zzso
