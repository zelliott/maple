zzso of variations in blood zzso zzso by pancreatic zzso and a subsequent appropriate zzso of insulin are key events in the control of zzso zzso Because a decreased capability to sense zzso changes is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes, the zzso zzso zzso leading to insulin zzso in pancreatic zzso has been extensively zzso This zzso mechanism depends on zzso metabolism and requires the presence of specific molecules such as zzso zzso and the zzso channel zzso zzso and zzso Other cells are also able to sense variations in zzso or in local zzso zzso and to zzso different zzso functions participating in the general control of zzso and energy zzso These include cells forming the zzso vein zzso zzso which controls zzso storage in the liver, zzso food intake and zzso zzso by peripheral zzso and zzso in the zzso and zzso whose firing rates are modulated by local variations in zzso zzso or, when not protected by a zzso barrier, directly by changes in blood zzso zzso These zzso zzso are involved in the control of insulin and zzso zzso food intake and energy zzso Here, recent zzso studies performed with zzso mice will be zzso which indicate that this zzso is essential for zzso sensing by pancreatic zzso by the zzso sensor and by sensors, probably located zzso which control activity of the zzso nervous system and stimulate zzso zzso These studies may pave the way to a fine dissection of the molecular and cellular components of zzso zzso sensors involved in the control of zzso and energy zzso
