zzso zzso cells, the zzso source of zzso in developing zzso are thought to be essential for the inside out formation of zzso zzso Fate mapping revealed that a large population of zzso zzso cells arises from the cortical zzso To investigate the function of zzso cells, we therefore genetically zzso the zzso zzso zzso cells were distributed beneath the zzso surface in control mice, but were virtually absent in zzso mice from embryonic day zzso zzso until zzso zzso cells derived from other sources did not invade the zzso zzso to compensate for hem zzso We predicted that zzso layers would be zzso in zzso animals, as in zzso mice, deficient in zzso zzso Against zzso layers showed the standard zzso Low levels of zzso in the cortical zzso or diffusion of zzso from other sites, may have allowed zzso to zzso Our findings zzso however, that the sheet of zzso zzso cells that covers the zzso zzso is not required to direct layer zzso
