zzso zzso receptors are one of the most abundant zzso of zzso receptors in the brain and have been shown to be involved in the zzso effect of zzso Recently, we showed that in primary culture of rat cortical zzso chronic zzso treatment (10 zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso enhances the zzso increase in zzso and zzso enhances the sensitivity to the zzso effect of zzso Here we demonstrate the involvement of zzso receptors in these three zzso zzso treatment with zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso zzso enhancement of the increase in zzso induced by zzso and enhancement of sensitivity to the zzso effect of zzso Next, using zzso of zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso signaling zzso we demonstrate the involvement of these pathways in the zzso of zzso receptors and in making the zzso more sensitive to the zzso effects of zzso zzso chronic zzso treatment with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso pathways inhibited zzso zzso zzso and enhancement of the response to zzso and enhanced the sensitivity to zzso This study increases understanding of the zzso mechanism of chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased sensitivity to zzso
