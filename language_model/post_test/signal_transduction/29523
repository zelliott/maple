Id proteins are general zzso of differentiation and positive regulators of proliferation in the nervous zzso The role of Id is especially evident in neural development, a period during which Id proteins prevent premature differentiation and terminal cell cycle zzso These activities have been related to the recognized ability of Id proteins to antagonize basic zzso loop zzso zzso factors and proteins of the zzso tumor zzso zzso In recent experiments, it was shown that Id zzso low or absent in zzso zzso zzso expressed by tumor and zzso cells of zzso derived from the central nervous system and peripheral nervous zzso In these tumors, zzso Id activity has been associated with relentless zzso loss of differentiation and zzso all key features of neural tumor zzso Future work will be required to fully zzso the molecular networks engaged by Id proteins to contribute to the essential hallmarks of neural zzso
