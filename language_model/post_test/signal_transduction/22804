zzso zzso are zzso powerful biological tactics for zzso signal zzso Such a zzso is generally made up of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the higher plant, zzso zzso results from recent intensive studies suggested that zzso zzso may be widely used for zzso environmental zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso In this study, we first inspected extensively the occurrence of zzso response regulators in order to compile and characterize zzso The results showed that this higher plant has, at least, 14 members of the family of response regulators that can be classified into two distinct zzso zzso and zzso as judged from their structural designs, zzso properties, and expression zzso Comparative studies were conducted for each representative zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso It was suggested that expression of the zzso response regulator is zzso while that of the zzso response regulator appears to be zzso zzso from zzso zzso analyses suggested that the zzso response regulator may have an ability to zzso interact with a set of zzso zzso zzso These and other results will be discussed with special reference to the zzso zzso signaling network in zzso zzso
