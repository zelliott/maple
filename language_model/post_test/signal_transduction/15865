We report the identification and characterization of a previously unidentified protein domain found in bacterial zzso and other bacterial signal zzso zzso This domain contains a motif of three zzso zzso and one zzso arranged as zzso type indicates zzso that are nearly zzso zzso This domain was first identified in the soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso coupled plasma mass zzso on zzso and zzso expressed zzso we determined that this domain binds zinc with a zzso zzso zzso We thus named the domain zzso for zzso zinc zzso Further analysis showed that many bacterial signaling proteins contain the zzso domain, most commonly proteins that participate in zzso but also those that participate in zzso signaling and zzso zzso among zzso zzso bearing the zzso domain are found in several bacterial zzso The variety of signaling proteins using the zzso domain suggests that it plays a critical role in several signal zzso zzso
