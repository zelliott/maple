The methanol extract of zzso zzso has been traditionally used in various disorders including zzso 

The aim of the study is to explore whether zzso action of 3 active compounds, two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso is related with zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in human zzso zzso cell line, zzso zzso 

Cell viability and production of zzso oxygen species were zzso In addition, zzso of zzso into zzso cells and western zzso for expression of zzso molecules and signal proteins were investigated in tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of test compounds significantly reduced zzso oxygen species zzso production and expression of vascular cell zzso zzso zzso but not zzso cell zzso zzso zzso Three compounds all zzso increased not only zzso expression in zzso cells but inhibited zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso with different zzso Finally, they prevented zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso 

The present results show that zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso selectively zzso zzso expression of zzso at least by zzso of zzso and signals for zzso zzso and zzso are involved in this zzso
