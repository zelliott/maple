zzso are the most rapidly growing members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso share similarity in their zzso organizations and in early and late zzso genes that are required for viral zzso A distinct characteristic of gamma zzso is their ability to establish zzso infection in zzso cells, and some of these viruses are closely associated with abnormal proliferation and cancer in zzso The first open reading frame of the zzso gamma zzso has been shown to directly contribute to zzso zzso This open reading frame encodes zzso membrane zzso zzso in zzso virus, zzso transformation protein zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso monkey zzso All of these gene products are capable of zzso cellular signal zzso events, resulting in cell growth zzso This review briefly summarizes the current view on the transforming mechanisms zzso by zzso zzso zzso
