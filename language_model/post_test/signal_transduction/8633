The regulation of protein expression on the cell surface membrane is an important component of the cellular response to zzso zzso The translation of zzso zzso into specific protein zzso often involves the zzso modification of cargo zzso Using a genetic screen of random zzso we have previously identified a group of zzso zzso represented by zzso zzso which are capable of overriding an zzso zzso zzso signal and directing membrane proteins to the cell surface via specific binding to zzso zzso The identity of the zzso zzso pathways that drive zzso and zzso binding of the zzso sequence is not zzso In this study, we report that the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso by the zzso of active zzso stimulation with fetal bovine serum or growth factors zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso recruit zzso proteins to zzso and zzso promote surface expression of the zzso zzso channel fused with the zzso zzso The expression of the dominant negative zzso inhibited the enhancement of surface expression by fetal bovine zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso significantly enhanced the zzso association and cell surface expression of zzso a G zzso zzso which carries an zzso zzso zzso zzso binding sequence and is known to serve as a zzso zzso Given the wealth and specificity of both zzso activity and zzso binding zzso our results suggest that the zzso zzso motif may serve as a sensor that can selectively induce the cell surface expression of membrane proteins in response to different zzso zzso
