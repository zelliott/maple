We investigated changes in signal zzso via zzso zzso in the zzso of rats zzso zzso to methamphetamine zzso The rats were injected with zzso (4 zzso zzso five times a week for 3 weeks and then were given a challenge dose of zzso (2 zzso zzso Seven days after the challenge test, we determined the levels of zzso zzso and zzso by Western zzso We further zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which can be zzso at zzso sites by zzso We found that both zzso zzso and zzso were significantly decreased in the particulate zzso but were not changed in the soluble zzso from the zzso of zzso rats as compared with control zzso The same findings were observed in the zzso of rats 6 h after the injection of zzso (10 zzso zzso In the zzso of zzso rats, zzso zzso significantly increased, but zzso zzso were not significantly different from those of the control zzso These results indicate that the activity of signal zzso via zzso is functionally decreased in the zzso of zzso zzso
