Over the past decade, zzso zzso has emerged as a natural mechanism of zzso of gene zzso This ancient cellular zzso response can be manipulated to provide an effective research tool to knock down the level of expression of selected target zzso providing a very powerful new method for the analysis of cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of genes on a zzso scale using large rationally designed libraries targeting many thousands of genes provides a novel functional zzso approach to the investigation of many aspects of zzso cell zzso including zzso zzso Here, the different approaches taken to use zzso interference libraries to study the cancer zzso will be considered, including both selective and high zzso screens and the use of both zzso and synthetic zzso methods for inducing zzso zzso The advantages and drawbacks of the competing zzso will be zzso zzso interference library technology holds great promise for enabling zzso cell zzso in tissue culture zzso Whether it can provide significant new insights into cancer will be its greatest zzso
