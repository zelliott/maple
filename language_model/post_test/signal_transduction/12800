Recently, we isolated a series of zzso cell zzso that are unable to respond to zzso stimulation by the tumor promoter, zzso zzso zzso Since protein zzso C zzso is the major zzso for zzso and appears to play a key role in cellular zzso we have examined the distribution of zzso in the parental zzso cells and the zzso zzso zzso zzso was located predominantly in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells, and upon zzso treatment it was rapidly zzso into the plasma zzso In contrast, zzso was located predominantly in the plasma membrane of zzso zzso zzso cells and was no longer activated by zzso zzso gel analysis showed that a Mr zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was rapidly zzso in zzso cells upon zzso treatment, whereas zzso of this protein was barely detected in zzso zzso In growing cultures, the majority of zzso was found in the plasma membrane of both cell lines, and no change occurred upon zzso zzso zzso column zzso revealed the presence of zzso zzso as the major component in both cell zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso protein may be involved in the mechanism of zzso signal zzso
