zzso zzso processes zzso in a late zzso compartment in zzso zzso The first approximately 30 zzso of the 115 zzso acid zzso zzso tail zzso of the zzso protein zzso contain a zzso retention signal that resembles zzso zzso signals in zzso cell surface zzso zzso of one zzso of two zzso zzso in the zzso or deletion of sequences adjacent to zzso results in loss of normal zzso zzso Surprisingly, loss of the zzso retention signal resulted in transport of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso as judged by zzso of degradation and by indirect zzso Analysis of the loss of zzso function in zzso after shutting off expression of zzso or zzso forms proved that zzso that cause rapid zzso turnover do so by increasing the rate of exit of the zzso from the zzso processing zzso The most likely explanation for these results is that zzso of the zzso retention signal in the zzso results in transport of zzso to the zzso by zzso zzso zzso also was transported to the zzso at an increased rate when zzso although apparently not due to zzso of a zzso zzso Instead, the zzso and zzso zzso forms of zzso may follow distinct paths to the zzso
