The functional role of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has never been fully explained so far, due to the difficulties in understanding the presence of an zzso specifically zzso zzso with no obvious advantage, and the apparent disadvantage of lowering plant stress resistance as a consequence of zzso zzso Here we suggest a complete change of perspective, by proposing an essential role of zzso as a zzso of both zzso and oxygen content, with relevant implications related to zzso By affecting the overall zzso state, zzso is actually involved in zzso regulation in the zzso zzso In addition, zzso can contribute to creating a hypoxic zzso especially relevant in the maintenance of zzso identity and the establishment of zzso zzso zzso We also zzso the possible involvement of zzso in the zzso of a signaling cascade analogous to the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso
