Cold exposure is associated with zzso stress and cardiac zzso The zzso zzso system, which plays a key role in zzso zzso may participate in cold zzso cardiovascular zzso This study was designed to examine the role of zzso in cold zzso cardiac geometric and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso knockout zzso mice were assigned to normal or cold exposure zzso environment for 2 and 5 weeks prior to evaluation of cardiac zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the temperature sensor transient zzso potential zzso zzso zzso proteins for zzso and zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Cold stress triggered cardiac zzso depressed zzso zzso capacity, including fractional zzso peak zzso and zzso zzso of zzso reduced zzso zzso release, prolonged zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso generation of zzso and zzso as well as zzso the effects of which were blunted by zzso Western zzso revealed zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso mouse hearts, which were obliterated by zzso zzso of zzso an essential regulator for zzso were zzso The zzso zzso zzso attenuated whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso cold zzso or zzso cardiac zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso zzso cold zzso cardiac zzso (but not zzso changes and zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso protects against cold zzso cardiac zzso and dysfunction zzso through zzso and zzso zzso
