zzso B zzso can adjust zzso and zzso responses according to changes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of plants to open environments zzso zzso zzso increases carbon gain at the expense of increased water zzso This zzso zzso stressful conditions generated by an excess of light, but increases the chances of zzso Here we evaluated how zzso zzso this zzso response by comparing zzso zzso zzso adult plants to the zzso zzso in response to water zzso zzso wilted before the wild type, and this was due to zzso maintaining open zzso under a reduction in soil water zzso Although zzso presented enhanced zzso levels under zzso conditions, this zzso was less sensitive than the wild type in diminishing zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity to zzso in zzso correlated with a lower expression of zzso which encodes a putative zzso influx zzso and zzso which encodes a soluble zzso zzso Furthermore, the expression of zzso and zzso both typical zzso zzso was lower in zzso than the wild type after zzso zzso We propose that zzso contributes to the zzso of plants to open environments by enhancing zzso sensitivity when soil water becomes zzso
