zzso zzso and zzso zzso are two zzso zzso isolated from Chinese herb named zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso and zzso possess zzso vascular regulation, zzso zzso and zzso zzso The mechanisms of zzso and zzso effect on zzso are not zzso The goal of this study was to characterize the mechanism by which zzso and zzso affect zzso production in rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were isolated from adrenal zzso of male rats and incubated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a permeable zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso precursors including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso M each, in the presence or absence of zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso at 37 degrees C for 1 zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in the media were measured by zzso After administration of zzso cells with zzso or zzso zzso zzso for 60 and 120 zzso Western zzso analysis was employed to explore the influence of zzso and zzso on the expression of zzso zzso side chain zzso zzso zzso and zzso acute regulatory protein zzso zzso and zzso reduced both zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso production in rat zzso zzso The enhanced zzso production caused by the administration of four zzso precursors was decreased following zzso or zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso inhibit zzso production in rat zzso cells via a mechanism zzso zzso a decreased activity of zzso zzso zzso a decreased activity of the zzso zzso that is, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso during zzso and zzso an zzso of zzso protein zzso
