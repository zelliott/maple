zzso zzso zzso exposure zzso steroid production in zzso zzso While this suppression of plasma steroid levels is thought to involve zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso the target zzso impacted and the molecular mechanisms involved have rarely been zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso genes involved in neuroendocrine function, including the control of zzso zzso and zzso zzso axes in rainbow zzso To zzso zzso zzso we zzso a pharmacological approach using zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso zzso and zzso zzso The gene expression pattern in the brain was zzso using a zzso targeted trout zzso array enriched with genes zzso proteins involved in zzso zzso stress response and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso gene expression with zzso and the zzso of this response by zzso confirmed zzso zzso zzso by itself impacted only a few zzso while zzso treatment significantly modulated the transcript level of 49 zzso many of which are involved in the neuroendocrine control of stress and zzso Of these, only zzso of the zzso zzso response was blocked by zzso suggesting molecular regulation of neuroendocrine pathways that are also zzso Gene expression pattern for select genes seen with the zzso analysis was also confirmed using quantitative real-time zzso Overall, our results reveal for the first time that zzso zzso several key genes involved in the neuroendocrine control of stress and sex steroid zzso while the mode of action involves both zzso and zzso pathways in zzso
