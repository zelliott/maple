The class B zzso box zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso together control the zzso of petals and zzso Toward an understanding of how the downstream molecular mechanisms controlled by zzso contribute to zzso zzso we conducted expression profiling experiments using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso First, four late zzso zzso stages were compared with zzso More than 500 zzso were identified that comprise a large number of zzso regulated genes and reveal a highly dynamic zzso zzso For identification of zzso target genes that might be directly controlled by zzso we took advantage of the zzso zzso zzso To enhance the sensitivity of the profiling experiments, one zzso zzso stage was selected, characterized by increased zzso changes that reflect the onset of cell zzso processes replacing cell division zzso Upon reduction of the zzso function, 49 zzso and 52 zzso zzso target genes were zzso Eight target genes were further characterized in detail by zzso and in zzso zzso zzso of genes responding rapidly toward an altered zzso activity is confined to different zzso zzso demonstrating the complexity of the zzso function regulating diverse basic processes throughout zzso zzso
