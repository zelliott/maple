The zzso response of innate immune cells such as zzso is defined by the zzso of complex signaling networks that are zzso by microbial zzso Many individual proteins have been demonstrated to participate in zzso and the application of zzso tools has indicated that many more remain to be zzso In this review, we examine this complexity and describe how during recognition, multiple receptors are simultaneously engaged to mediate zzso activate microbial killing, and induce the production of inflammatory zzso and zzso Many signaling molecules perform multiple functions during zzso and these molecules are likely to be key regulators of the zzso Indeed, zzso zzso target many of these molecules in their attempts to evade zzso
