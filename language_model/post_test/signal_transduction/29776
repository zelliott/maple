zzso or pathological stresses and strains produce longer or wider muscle cells, but resting zzso length remains zzso Our goal was to investigate the cellular mechanisms for controlling this zzso resting zzso zzso To do so, we cultured zzso rat zzso on zzso zzso zzso silicone surfaces and applied a zzso zzso strain of zzso zzso length was accurately measured by fast zzso transform analysis of images before, within 5 minutes of, and 4 to 6 hours after imposition of the zzso zzso length of aligned zzso zzso zzso was zzso acutely zzso zzso and recovered zzso zzso by 4 zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso prevented recovery of resting zzso length by 4 hours, thus indicating a requirement for new protein synthesis in the recovery zzso Furthermore, zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso was necessary for length recovery, as zzso zzso zzso zzso (5 zzso and zzso zzso (10 zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso prevented the restoration of zzso zzso To assess the importance of focal zzso complexes, zzso were infected with an zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor of focal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also prevented resting zzso length recovery, whereas a control zzso zzso only zzso did zzso In conclusion, using our novel culture system, we provide evidence indicating that the length zzso process requires new protein zzso zzso and zzso
