zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso controls the expression of many critical zzso zzso and the zzso complex occupies a central role in recruiting zzso zzso II zzso zzso to these gene zzso An impaired zzso zzso network in human liver is responsible for many pathological conditions, such as altered drug zzso fatty liver, and zzso Here, we report that zzso an associated member of the zzso complex, is required for the association of zzso with zzso its several zzso and zzso Pol zzso Further, increases and decreases in zzso zzso levels are reflected in the composition of the zzso complex, Pol II zzso and the expression of zzso target zzso A novel feature of zzso is that it zzso zzso zzso affects only a significant subset of zzso target genes that selectively regulate drug and zzso zzso These results define a role for zzso and the zzso complex in the regulation of zzso metabolism and zzso zzso
