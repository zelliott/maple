Studies using zzso transformed tobacco plants containing very low levels of zzso in their guard cells show that this zzso plays a role in the events associated with the zzso of zzso opening by zzso but not in the cellular reactions that are responsible for zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso guard cells zzso with the zzso zzso zzso fail to close on addition of zzso There are three possible explanations for this apparent data zzso The differences may be indicative of zzso zzso zzso the presence of a zzso zzso that is not zzso in these transgenic lines and/or they may reflect differences between short-term zzso administration of an inhibitor and long-term zzso effects of gene zzso It is possible that the guard cell is a robust zzso system that is able to adapt or compensate for the chronic loss of zzso but which is unable to adjust quickly to acute loss of this zzso It would be interesting to investigate this possibility further using either transient manipulation of gene expression or through the use of an zzso zzso
