Mechanical stimuli play a major role in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass, and the maintenance of muscle mass contributes significantly to disease prevention and issues associated with the quality of zzso Although the link between mechanical signals and the regulation of muscle mass has been recognized for decades, the mechanisms involved in converting mechanical information into the molecular events that control this process remain poorly zzso Nevertheless, our knowledge of these mechanisms is advancing and recent studies have revealed that signaling through a protein zzso called the zzso target of zzso zzso plays a central role in this zzso In this review we will, zzso discuss the evidence which implicates zzso in the mechanical regulation of skeletal muscle mass, zzso provide an overview of the mechanisms through which signaling by zzso can be zzso and zzso zzso our current knowledge of the potential mechanisms involved in the mechanical zzso of zzso zzso
