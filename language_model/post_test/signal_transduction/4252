zzso responses in zzso coli are typically zzso by zzso receptors that monitor zzso levels with zzso binding zzso and communicate with the zzso zzso through two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and then donates its zzso to zzso which in turn controls zzso zzso zzso coli also exhibits zzso responses to zzso that are transported by the zzso zzso zzso zzso system zzso Unlike conventional zzso zzso zzso are sensed during their zzso and zzso zzso by the zzso The zzso groups are transferred from zzso to the carbohydrates through two common zzso zzso I zzso and zzso carrier protein zzso and then to zzso zzso zzso We found that in zzso strains zzso proteins could substitute for zzso in transport but did not mediate zzso zzso In in zzso zzso these proteins exhibited reduced zzso rates from zzso indicating that the zzso state of zzso might link the zzso zzso to the zzso signaling zzso Tests with zzso proteins revealed that zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso did zzso These findings suggest the following model for signal zzso in zzso zzso During zzso of a zzso zzso zzso is zzso more rapidly by zzso than it is zzso at the expense of zzso zzso zzso zzso builds up and zzso zzso zzso This slows the flow of zzso to zzso zzso an zzso swimming response by the zzso
