zzso zzso signals through various adapter proteins and zzso that lead to zzso of numerous downstream targets, including the zzso factors including zzso In this study, we analyzed and characterized the effect of the differentiation of zzso zzso cells on zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso We report that zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso were zzso in zzso and zzso differentiated zzso cells zzso where zzso is zzso compared with zzso cells zzso whereas no differential effects were found following tumor necrosis factor zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and affinity binding studies reveal that zzso exclusively binds the type I zzso zzso and not zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso activity were both diminished in differentiated zzso zzso DNA binding activity in differentiated zzso cells relative to zzso cells was strongly reduced following zzso exposure but not after zzso zzso The zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso was not zzso in zzso zzso cells, in contrast to zzso zzso zzso reporter gene activity was zzso higher following zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso stimulation in zzso zzso We conclude that cellular differentiation of zzso cells selectively zzso the zzso signaling zzso zzso both zzso and zzso activity in response to zzso This relative zzso to zzso may represent an important regulatory mechanism of differentiated zzso zzso zzso
