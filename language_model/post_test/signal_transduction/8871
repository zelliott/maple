zzso zzso zzso zzso have been demonstrated to be zzso involved in zzso signaling in a variety of zzso zzso Many receptors can be zzso within the zzso clusters to form signaling zzso Currently, zzso were reported to be clustered to aggregate, zzso and assemble zzso zzso zzso and related proteins in various cells in response to various zzso forming zzso signaling zzso These zzso signaling platforms may play important roles in the regulation of cellular activity and cell function, and also in the development of cell dysfunction or injury associated with various pathological zzso This zzso zzso mechanism is considered to take a center stage in zzso signaling associated with death zzso In this chapter, some basic methods and procedures for characterization of zzso signaling platforms formation and for determination of the function of these signaling platforms are described in detail, which include identification of zzso signaling platforms in cell membrane by using fluorescent or zzso zzso of zzso signaling platforms and fluorescent resonance energy transfer analysis, isolation of zzso signaling platforms by zzso of zzso zzso and function measurement of zzso signaling platforms by electron spin resonance zzso It is expected that information provided here will help readers to design necessary experiments in their studies on zzso signaling platforms and zzso regulation of cell zzso
