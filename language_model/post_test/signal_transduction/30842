We identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which shares zzso conservation with both human and mouse zzso zzso zzso transcripts are zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in both zzso and zzso cells from late zzso to the zzso stages and can be identified in the zzso brain and zzso during zzso zzso zzso After 28 hours of development, zzso is exclusively expressed in the developing zzso Both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments were conducted to analyze zzso zzso zzso development of the liver and zzso and zzso abnormalities were observed in 96 zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso twofold decreases in the respective numbers of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso precursors were zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso expression caused substantial increases in the respective numbers of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso precursors and altered their distribution patterns in zzso zzso injected zzso zzso zzso motifs were identified in both zzso and zzso genes by zzso sequence zzso zzso can bind to the zzso motif located in zzso 1 of the zzso gene based on an zzso mobility shift zzso zzso of either zzso or mouse zzso zzso with the zzso zzso rescued the expression zzso of zzso in the liver of 53 zzso injected zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso regulates zzso expression and may also zzso zzso zzso thus affecting early zzso zzso This study underscores a novel role of zzso zzso in the development of different zzso zzso compared with its zzso zzso
