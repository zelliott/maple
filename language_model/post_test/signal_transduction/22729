We studied the effects of zzso converting zzso zzso zzso on zzso II zzso zzso induced growth related zzso pathways in zzso rat cardiac zzso In zzso proliferation zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso cardiac zzso growth in a zzso fashion zzso at zzso M, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso led to a zzso zzso of the zzso II induced cardiac zzso zzso A less pronounced effect on cellular proliferation was seen with the zzso inhibitor zzso To zzso the mechanisms involved in this direct zzso effect of zzso zzso in cardiac zzso we studied the zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso signal zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso caused an increase in zzso activity with an increased zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso This effect was completely inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso II zzso zzso also led to an increased zzso of zzso which is one of the key zzso proteins in the zzso zzso zzso This effect was also completely inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These data show that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibit zzso II induced proliferation of cardiac zzso according to their relative potency of zzso zzso in zzso This novel effect of zzso zzso is accompanied by blocking the zzso II induced zzso of several zzso signal zzso pathways zzso zzso and zzso
