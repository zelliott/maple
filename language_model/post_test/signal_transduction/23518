zzso T cells promote zzso T cell zzso by licensing zzso cells zzso via zzso zzso However, the initial requirement for zzso signaling may be replaced by the direct zzso of zzso by zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso interactions are often required for optimal zzso T cell responses to pathogens for unknown zzso Here we show that zzso signaling is required to prevent the premature contraction of the zzso zzso T cell zzso zzso is required on zzso but not on B cells or T cells, whereas zzso is required on zzso T cells but not zzso T cells, zzso cells, or zzso Paradoxically, even though zzso zzso T cells are required for robust zzso T cell responses, primary zzso T cell responses are apparently normal in the absence of zzso T zzso We resolved this paradox by showing that the interaction of zzso zzso with zzso zzso T cells zzso regulatory T cell zzso zzso zzso suppression and prevents premature contraction of the zzso zzso T cell zzso Thus, zzso T helper cells are not required for robust zzso T cell responses to influenza when T zzso cells are zzso
