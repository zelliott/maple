When the heart fails, there is often a constellation of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso signaling system, leading to the loss of cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso and functional zzso are zzso through enhanced activity of the zzso zzso zzso the expression of which is increased in zzso and failing zzso These changes are widely viewed as representing an zzso zzso which protects the heart against chronic zzso In this study, we zzso using in zzso zzso zzso gene delivery of a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso that the zzso and zzso of zzso seen in the failing heart may actually be zzso In a rabbit model of heart failure induced by zzso zzso which zzso the zzso zzso abnormalities seen in human heart failure, delivery of the zzso zzso at the time of zzso zzso prevents the rise in zzso activity and expression and thereby maintains zzso density and signaling at normal zzso Rather than leading to deleterious effects, cardiac function is improved, and the development of heart failure is zzso These results appear to challenge the notion that zzso of zzso signaling in the failing heart is zzso and they may lead to novel therapeutic strategies to treat heart disease via zzso of zzso and preservation of zzso zzso zzso
