zzso colonization of the host by bacterial pathogens relies on their capacity to evade the complex and powerful defenses opposed by the host immune system, at least in the initial zzso of zzso The two toxins of zzso zzso lethal toxin and zzso zzso appear to have been shaped by evolution to assist the zzso in this crucial function, in addition to act as general toxins acting on almost all cell zzso zzso toxin causes a consistent zzso of zzso an important second zzso the production of which is normally strictly controlled in zzso cells, whereas lethal toxin zzso most zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso By zzso or zzso central zzso common to all the principal signaling networks which control immune cell zzso zzso function and migration, the anthrax toxins effectively and systematically dismantle both the innate and the zzso immune defenses of the zzso Here, we review the specific effects of the lethal and zzso toxins of zzso zzso on the zzso and function of zzso zzso cells and zzso We also discuss some open issues which should be addressed to gain a comprehensive insight into the complex relationship that zzso zzso establishes with the zzso
