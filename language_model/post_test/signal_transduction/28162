The zzso zzso zzso zzso lacks inherent zzso zzso zzso zzso II binding to zzso nevertheless activates several zzso zzso and stimulates both zzso zzso and zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso in vascular smooth muscle zzso Since a balance between zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities is essential in zzso II zzso we investigated the role of zzso in modulating zzso zzso signaling pathways by zzso zzso vascular smooth muscle cells with expression zzso zzso zzso zzso protein or a zzso inactive zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso is an efficient negative regulator of zzso II zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso activity by zzso a positive regulatory zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression also zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso whereas expression of zzso inactive zzso caused sustained zzso zzso Thus, zzso likely regulates zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling by zzso zzso These zzso effects were specific for a subset of zzso II signaling zzso since zzso zzso failed to influence zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso These data show zzso represents a critical negative regulator of zzso II zzso and further demonstrate a new function for this zzso in vascular smooth muscle zzso
