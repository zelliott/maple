We previously showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso including decreased irrigation and zzso zzso independently of zzso Here, we developed a model of partially decreased zzso tissue irrigation, a common condition in obese zzso We aimed to study the role of zzso in the zzso adaptations to such conditions 1 and 48 hours after decreased blood supply, avoiding other zzso zzso zzso decrease during 1 hour zzso to increased zzso of zzso and degradation of zzso and zzso A in zzso normal zzso zzso After 48 hours, all rats showed increased zzso zzso and zzso However, zzso rats had higher free fatty acids and zzso levels and decreased zzso zzso to decreased zzso levels in partially zzso zzso zzso Our data show that besides causing vascular dysfunction, zzso further contributes to impaired zzso metabolism after a decrease of tissue irrigation, what may hamper zzso adaptation during tissue zzso
