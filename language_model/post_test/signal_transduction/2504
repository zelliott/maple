zzso zzso of proteins is critical for the zzso zzso zzso signal zzso that leads to the release of inflammatory zzso from mast zzso Here we report the isolation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso to a 72 zzso protein that becomes rapidly zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso By zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso this 72 zzso protein was different from the previously identified zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso or zzso The zzso of this 72 zzso protein was zzso within 15 zzso after zzso zzso and was independent of zzso influx or the zzso of protein zzso zzso By in zzso zzso reaction, the 72 zzso protein did not zzso which suggests that it is not a zzso but is associated with a 140 zzso protein that was strongly zzso Studies in zzso deficient and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso cells demonstrated that the zzso zzso of this 72 zzso protein was downstream of zzso These data indicate that the 72 zzso protein zzso by zzso zzso is a novel zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso
