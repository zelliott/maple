zzso acid zzso is considered to control zzso however, its precise mechanism remains unclear because of a zzso effect, which promotes or zzso zzso synthesis depending on the cell type, culture condition of zzso and skin zzso In this study, we examined the effects of zzso throughout each stage of differentiation of zzso using a mouse embryonic stem cell culture system to induce zzso The results showed that zzso has significantly different effects depending on the stage of differentiation of zzso More specifically, zzso promoted differentiation in earlier zzso wherein embryonic stem cells became zzso via neural crest cells, and inhibited differentiation in later zzso wherein zzso became zzso It was revealed for the first time that zzso show markedly different reactions to zzso depending on the stage of zzso
