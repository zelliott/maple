Drug addiction is a serious worldwide problem with strong genetic and environmental zzso Different technologies have revealed a variety of genes and pathways underlying zzso however, each individual technology can be biased and zzso We integrated zzso items of evidence from zzso publications between 1976 and 2006 linking genes and zzso regions to addiction by zzso strategies, zzso zzso or genetic zzso We identified 1,500 human zzso genes and developed zzso zzso the first molecular database for zzso genes with extensive zzso and a friendly Web zzso We then performed a zzso of zzso genes that were supported by two or more independent items of evidence to identify 18 molecular pathways that were statistically significantly zzso covering both upstream signaling events and downstream zzso Five molecular pathways significantly enriched for all four different types of addictive drugs were identified as common pathways which may zzso shared rewarding and addictive actions, including two new ones, zzso signaling zzso and gap zzso We connected the common pathways into a hypothetical common molecular network for zzso We observed that fast and slow positive feedback zzso were zzso through zzso which may provide clues to explain some of the irreversible features of zzso
