The cell cycle events accompanying zzso growth arrest of normal mouse resting B zzso zzso by zzso were zzso We showed that zzso prevents the zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso growth arrest in zzso to late zzso To explore the molecular basis of the effect of zzso we analyzed the in zzso zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso complexes involved in the progression through zzso phase and in the zzso transition, by using the zzso zzso fusion protein as a zzso zzso zzso activity was strongly induced in zzso B zzso It was dramatically inhibited by zzso as were the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment had no significant effect on the expression of two zzso phase zzso zzso E and zzso In contrast, the appearance of zzso A, zzso in late zzso phase, was almost totally inhibited by zzso We also showed that expression of the zzso inhibitor protein zzso decreased as cells progressed through the zzso zzso An zzso of zzso was found in zzso cells, showing that zzso prevented zzso decline of zzso Finally we found that the lack of zzso activity associated with zzso zzso complexes was correlated with increased amounts of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Overall, these results suggest that both zzso A and zzso may be active participants in the zzso cell cycle arrest in normal mouse B cells and indicate the involvement of zzso in this zzso
