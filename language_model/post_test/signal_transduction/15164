It has long been known that the brain is an zzso privileged site in normal zzso Although the cascade of immune responses can occur as long as there is a zzso injury or a potent immune zzso how the brain keeps zzso cells in a zzso state is still zzso zzso efforts have been made by several laboratories to zzso how repression of immune responses is achieved in the zzso zzso The suppression factors include zzso zzso zzso factors, zzso factors, and zzso contact via zzso molecules or zzso zzso This review discusses how these factors affect the cascade of cerebral immune responses because no single factor listed above can fully account for the immune zzso While several factors contribute to the suppression of immune responses, zzso of zzso cells and their production of zzso factors do occur as long as there is a zzso injury, suggesting that some zzso components facilitate immune zzso This review also discusses which signals initiate or augment cerebral immune responses so that zzso signals override the zzso zzso zzso lines of evidence have demonstrated that immune responses in the brain are not always zzso to zzso zzso to simply clear off inflammatory factors in the zzso may not be appropriate for zzso in neurological zzso zzso control of immune cells in the zzso may be beneficial to zzso or even zzso zzso understanding the mechanisms underlying immune suppression may help us to reshape pharmacological interventions against inflammation in many neurological zzso
