The aims of this study were to identify candidate single zzso zzso zzso and mechanisms of multiple sclerosis zzso and to generate zzso to gene to zzso zzso A zzso zzso association study zzso zzso that included zzso zzso in 500 cases and 500 controls of European descent was used in this zzso zzso candidate zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis was applied to the zzso zzso zzso analysis identified 9 candidate zzso and 5 zzso which provided 5 hypothetical biological zzso The candidate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were all at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The most strongly associated zzso was zzso to zzso to zzso zzso and zzso cell cycle zzso P zzso zzso false discovery rate zzso zzso zzso When zzso zzso were zzso zzso analysis identified seven candidate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and ten candidate zzso zzso which provided seven hypothetical biological mechanisms zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The most strongly associated zzso was zzso zzso to zzso to the zzso zzso zzso protein B from zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The application of zzso analysis to the zzso zzso zzso resulted in the identification of candidate zzso zzso and biological mechanisms that might contribute to zzso zzso
