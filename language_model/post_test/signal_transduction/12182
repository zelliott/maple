Cellular zzso suppresses cancer by zzso arresting the proliferation of damaged zzso Paradoxically, zzso cells also zzso factors that alter tissue zzso The pathways regulating this zzso are zzso We show that damaged human cells develop persistent zzso zzso bearing hallmarks of DNA zzso breaks zzso which initiate increased zzso of inflammatory zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred only after establishment of persistent DNA damage zzso usually associated with zzso not after transient DNA damage responses zzso zzso and maintenance of this zzso response required the zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso but not the zzso arrest enforcers zzso and zzso zzso was also essential for zzso zzso during zzso zzso and by damaged cells that bypass zzso Furthermore, zzso activity and zzso were elevated in human zzso and zzso suppressed the ability of zzso cells to stimulate zzso cancer cell zzso Thus, in addition to orchestrating zzso checkpoints and DNA repair, a new and important role of the zzso is to allow damaged cells to communicate their compromised state to the surrounding zzso
