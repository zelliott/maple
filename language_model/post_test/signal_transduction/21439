The zzso zzso factor functions as a downstream zzso of most zzso zzso zzso is zzso rapidly in response to zzso zzso signals, and blocking zzso induction zzso or at least severely zzso any zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso expression can often bypass the requirement for zzso signals for entry into S zzso Thus, the zzso zzso factor is both necessary and in many ways sufficient to promote the growth of diverse cell zzso Given this potent biological activity, it is not surprising that zzso in the zzso gene are among the most frequent in human and animal zzso zzso the molecular basis of zzso function has been a central issue in the fields of cancer biology and signal zzso for 20 zzso
