zzso zzso zzso is a regulatory zzso modification of zzso proteins that has a complex interplay with zzso zzso has been described as a nutritional zzso the level of zzso that serves as a donor for the zzso zzso zzso being regulated by the cellular fate of zzso Because muscular contraction is both dependent on zzso metabolism and is highly regulated by zzso zzso we decided to investigate the identification of zzso proteins in skeletal muscle using a zzso zzso Fourteen proteins were identified as being zzso zzso These proteins can be classified in three main zzso zzso proteins implicated in the signal zzso and in the zzso between the zzso and the nucleus or structural zzso zzso proteins of the zzso zzso and energetic zzso and zzso zzso proteins zzso heavy zzso A decrease in the zzso level was measured in the slow zzso zzso muscle after zzso zzso zzso a model of functional zzso characterized by a decrease in the force of zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso modification may serve as an important regulation system in skeletal muscle zzso
