The zzso protein zzso zzso pathways transmit signals from the cell membrane to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso may play a role in zzso zzso We hypothesized that enhanced expression of one or more of these pathways would occur in human lung zzso Using Western zzso analysis of tissue zzso from zzso zzso small cell lung zzso and matched zzso lung zzso we determined that only activated zzso was consistently increased in tumor compared with normal zzso In zzso zzso zzso confirmed that the levels of activated zzso correlated with the activity of the zzso and zzso analysis confirmed the cellular zzso of the activated zzso We incubated a lung cancer cell line in a hypoxic chamber to simulate the hypoxic environment in solid lung tumors, but found no increase in zzso zzso zzso to our expectations, zzso and zzso the zzso pathways traditionally associated with cell growth and perhaps zzso zzso were not consistently activated in the human lung tumor zzso However, zzso a zzso usually associated with stress responses, growth arrest, and zzso was activated in all of the human lung cancer samples, suggesting an additional role for this zzso in zzso cell growth or zzso
