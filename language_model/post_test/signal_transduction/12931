zzso of cell and tissue polarity commonly involves directional zzso In the zzso root zzso cell polarity is revealed by zzso root zzso hair outgrowth from zzso cells zzso The plant hormone zzso displays polar movements and accumulates at maximum concentration in the root zzso The application of polar zzso transport zzso evokes changes in zzso polarity only at high zzso and after long-term zzso Thus, it remains open whether components of the zzso transport machinery mediate establishment of zzso zzso Here we report that the zzso zzso influx carrier zzso contributes to zzso hair cell zzso zzso function is required for polarity changes induced by zzso application of the zzso zzso a preferential influx carrier zzso Similar to zzso zzso the zzso trafficking inhibitor zzso A zzso interferes with polar hair zzso and zzso function is required for zzso polarity zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane trafficking of zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso and alters the zzso zzso zzso Our results identify zzso as one component of a novel zzso zzso transport zzso polarizing cells toward a hormone zzso
