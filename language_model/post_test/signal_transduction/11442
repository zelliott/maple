The neural cell zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso outgrowth by zzso of the zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso and by generation of zzso zzso We investigated whether the zzso factors, zzso zzso binding protein zzso and zzso play roles in this process by zzso zzso zzso outgrowth from zzso cells grown in zzso with zzso or zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso with expression plasmids zzso zzso or dominant negative forms of zzso and zzso or an activated form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso acid, the zzso analogue zzso or protein zzso A zzso zzso The negative forms of zzso and zzso inhibited zzso outgrowth zzso by zzso zzso acid, zzso or zzso Neither zzso nor zzso could compensate for the zzso of the other, indicating that both factors are important in zzso zzso Treatment of primary zzso zzso with a synthetic zzso zzso zzso known to stimulate zzso outgrowth induced zzso of zzso and expression of zzso We thus present evidence that zzso zzso outgrowth involves a series of signal zzso zzso including the zzso pathway, targeting zzso and zzso
