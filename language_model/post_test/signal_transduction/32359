The interaction of blood zzso with the zzso of zzso zzso and other vessels involves regulated expression of molecules on both the zzso cell zzso and the zzso This is true for each of the major classes of zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso a particular subset of zzso with cultured human zzso illustrates this concept and also illustrates the diversity of structure, mechanisms of zzso and mechanisms of action of the molecules zzso One group of molecules zzso or zzso the zzso to the zzso without requiring zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are zzso that are expressed by zzso from zzso zzso or synthesis under zzso regulation, respectively, are zzso A second group of molecules activates the zzso by binding to zzso zzso zzso Factor zzso a zzso zzso is an example of this zzso Its production is controlled by regulation of synthetic zzso and is induced rapidly zzso when zzso are appropriately zzso zzso is zzso to the zzso surface, where it mediates zzso zzso of zzso by binding to a zzso zzso zzso One consequence of zzso zzso of zzso by zzso is functional zzso of zzso zzso on the zzso These zzso bind to zzso on the zzso enhancing the zzso of zzso over that provided by zzso zzso Thus, combinations of zzso and signaling molecules regulate zzso adhesive interactions with zzso zzso of such molecules also regulate other functional responses of the zzso that are important in zzso The zzso expression of different patterns of zzso and signaling molecules by zzso provides a general mechanism for differential zzso and zzso of different classes zzso in acute and zzso zzso
