We report the isolation of two novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of both zzso and zzso exhibited a 50% zzso acid identity to other zzso protein zzso zzso was expressed throughout the zzso zzso layer zzso an zzso structure in zzso from the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso was first expressed in the zzso zzso soon after the zzso transition, and slightly later in the entire zzso zzso After the late zzso period, zzso transcripts were detected in the zzso and they were restricted to the zzso zzso by the early zzso zzso The expression of zzso was dependent on zzso signals but not on zzso zzso zzso expression was not regulated by either zzso or zzso zzso This is in complete contrast to the zzso zzso expression of zzso These results indicate the complexity of the regulation of zzso zzso zzso
