Little is known about the regulation of the innate host defense zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso is believed to be zzso zzso and several zzso elements have been identified in the zzso putative zzso However, the zzso factors have not been clearly zzso We have recently reported that bacterial zzso suppress zzso expression in sodium zzso zzso zzso cells zzso and this may be zzso through zzso zzso early zzso Here we have shown that zzso pathways zzso regulate zzso expression in various zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso bind to the zzso putative promoter in zzso Additionally, zzso complexes containing zzso zzso and zzso upstream regulatory sequences are formed within zzso We have also shown that these complexes may activate zzso promoter and are required for its zzso expression in zzso This is underscored by the fact that zzso of zzso and zzso results in failure of zzso to zzso zzso and zzso B virus X protein may use zzso to induce zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso early zzso competes with zzso and zzso for binding to the zzso promoter and zzso transcription, thus functioning as a zzso zzso Finally, both zzso and zzso were shown to play major roles in the regulation of zzso in sodium zzso zzso zzso This is the first report of a detailed zzso study of zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso At the same time, it describes a novel zzso function of zzso
