zzso repellent and zzso responses, characteristic of behavioral adaptation, were observed in zzso zzso They were analyzed by zzso motion analysis and through the release of volatile zzso compounds from zzso cells, zzso zzso in the stop frequency and the rate of methanol release were induced by exposure of cells to repellent light signals, such as an increase in blue- and a decrease in zzso zzso At a zzso of zzso zzso the zzso of the methanol release response followed the zzso spectrum of the zzso zzso suggesting that they function as zzso for this zzso In contrast to the previously reported zzso response to a decrease in infrared light, the zzso response reported here does not depend on the number of zzso zzso per cell, suggesting that it is zzso by a separate zzso zzso color discrimination in taxis responses in zzso zzso involves two zzso zzso the zzso zzso and an additional zzso responding to blue zzso The signal generated by the former system could result in the migration of cells to a light climate beneficial for photosynthesis, while the zzso system could allow cells to avoid zzso zzso of zzso blue zzso
