zzso have a lower zzso of heart failure and improved survival after zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso Although zzso zzso zzso may be zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso pathway, it is unclear whether this action is zzso via zzso zzso beta zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso mediates zzso zzso through zzso and zzso signaling in females but not in zzso zzso male and female hearts from zzso knockout zzso and zzso zzso mice zzso zzso 5 zzso were subjected to zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso significantly decreased zzso recovery of left zzso developed pressure in female, but not male, zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was noted in female zzso hearts, which was associated with increased expression of zzso and zzso as well as decreased zzso levels compared with zzso However, zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling zzso zzso and zzso receptors 1 and 2 levels did not change in zzso of either sex following zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso increased zzso zzso zzso in females but increased zzso activity in males during acute zzso We conclude that zzso mediates zzso protection via zzso of zzso zzso decreased zzso and zzso and increased zzso in female hearts following zzso These findings provide evidence of zzso zzso and zzso signaling in the zzso and may lend insight into the zzso pathways behind the observed variation in clinical outcomes between males and females after zzso zzso
