Signaling by the zzso zzso of T zzso zzso different zzso zzso each of which require the zzso zzso zzso Previous studies with zzso and zzso peptides have indicated that zzso might respond differently to different structures of the zzso complex induced by bound zzso The roles of membrane proximity and orientation in zzso of zzso signaling were explored using synthetic zzso and their binding proteins designed to produce different zzso of zzso complexes composed of zzso fusion zzso zzso membrane recruitment of zzso levels of zzso with the zzso synthetic zzso zzso leads to rapid zzso of zzso and zzso of the zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso are not required for signaling when the zzso is zzso recruited to the zzso indicating that the zzso zzso function solely in recruitment and not in zzso zzso Using additional synthetic zzso and their binding proteins that recruit zzso equally well but orient it at the cell membrane in different ways, we define a requirement for a specific presentation of zzso to its downstream zzso These results provide a mechanism by which zzso bound to the zzso zzso could discriminate between zzso changes induced by the binding of different zzso complexes to the zzso zzso and introduce an approach to exploring the role of spatial orientation of signaling complexes in living zzso
