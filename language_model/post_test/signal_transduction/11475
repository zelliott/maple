To dissect the web of signals that control plant growth, it is important to understand how the individual components of the zzso are zzso zzso is a plant hormone involved in a large number of zzso zzso zzso and genetic approaches have provided a detailed view of the zzso and signal zzso pathways of this hormone in the reference plant zzso zzso The effects of several hormones and of zzso changes on the regulation of the key zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso serve as a clear example of interaction between signals in the generation of complex zzso We now have a picture of how zzso is sensed by the zzso receptors and how the signal is further zzso to the zzso Although some of the zzso receptors show a zzso pattern of zzso little is known about the regulation of the components of the zzso zzso cascade by other hormones or zzso zzso Once the zzso signal reaches the nucleus, it activates a zzso cascade that results in changes in the expression of a number of zzso We describe some of the results that suggest an interaction at the zzso level between zzso other hormones, and stress zzso
