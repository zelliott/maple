zzso zzso is a compound isolated from zzso zzso The zzso of zzso were evaluated in isolated rat zzso zzso The results showed that zzso can zzso induce contraction of rat zzso zzso in the resting and zzso zzso zzso The average response to 100 zzso of zzso was zzso of the 50 zzso zzso contraction, zzso of the 10 zzso zzso and zzso of the 20 zzso caffeine contraction in zzso The effects of zzso were proved not to be zzso dependent and could not be inhibited by zzso zzso blocker zzso zzso zzso blocker zzso zzso zzso blocker zzso zzso II zzso blocker zzso or the zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso However the influx of zzso calcium seemed to be required for this action, because depletion of zzso calcium and the addition of zzso calcium zzso channel zzso zzso and zzso calcium zzso channel zzso zzso and zzso zzso channel opener zzso could significantly affect the contraction induced by zzso We also investigated the possible signal mechanisms underlying zzso contraction using selective zzso The zzso of zzso light chain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signal regulated zzso zzso can suppress the effect of zzso respectively, whereas zzso of other signaling or zzso molecules such as protein zzso C zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso had no zzso All these results demonstrated that zzso can induce contraction of rat zzso that the zzso influx, zzso and zzso signal pathways and zzso zzso must be involved in the zzso zzso
