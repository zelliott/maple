It is well-established that the binding of zzso peptides to the zzso zzso zzso on zzso can be described by a kinetic scheme that involves two zzso zzso states, both a low affinity zzso complex and a high affinity zzso complex, and that the rate zzso describing zzso binding and zzso affinity state zzso are zzso Here we examine whether differences due to these rate constants, zzso differences in the numbers and lifetimes of particular zzso states, are correlated with zzso responses, namely zzso zzso and zzso zzso We find that an additional zzso state, one not discerned from kinetic binding zzso is required to account for these zzso This zzso state is interpreted as the number of low affinity bound receptors that are capable of zzso G zzso in other words, the zzso of these active receptors zzso with the extent of both zzso Furthermore, this analysis allows for the zzso of a zzso that measures the relative strength of a zzso to bias the zzso into the active zzso A model with this additional zzso state is sufficient to describe response data when two zzso zzso or zzso zzso are added zzso suggesting that cells respond to the zzso of active receptors regardless of the identity of the zzso
