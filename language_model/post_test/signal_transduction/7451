zzso zzso zzso zzso infection plays an important role in the development of gastric zzso zzso inhibitor of protein zzso 2A zzso is a novel human zzso that functions as an important regulator of cell growth and zzso zzso In the present study, we aimed to investigate the potential mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso and the functional impact of zzso zzso zzso in gastric cancer zzso We demonstrated that infection of zzso cells with zzso zzso led to a marked increase in the expression of zzso at the zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with increased cell zzso In addition, zzso zzso was found to activate the zzso zzso zzso both zzso zzso zzso production and cell proliferation were partially reversed by zzso of zzso zzso Similarly, the blockade of zzso zzso zzso expression by zzso against zzso also inhibited cell zzso Thus, zzso zzso appears to stimulate the expression of zzso and proliferation of gastric cancer cells via zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso of zzso contributes to the development and progression of gastric zzso Further in zzso studies are warranted to explore the biological role of zzso and its interaction with zzso signaling in gastric zzso
