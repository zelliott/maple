zzso zzso of zzso a basic zzso zzso factor, induce premature fusion of zzso zzso in zzso syndrome zzso We report here a previously zzso mechanism involved in the altered zzso in zzso zzso zzso from an zzso patient with a Twist zzso causing basic zzso deletion exhibited decreased expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso This was associated with decreased zzso degradation of zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso and increased zzso expression and zzso zzso Increased zzso zzso was also found in zzso in zzso sections of affected zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso with Twist or zzso abolished the increased zzso signaling in Twist zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not correct the altered expression of zzso differentiation markers in Twist zzso zzso In contrast, pharmacological zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso corrected the increased cell growth in Twist zzso zzso The results show that Twist zzso results in decreased zzso zzso degradation in zzso causing zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso This provides genetic and zzso evidence for a role for zzso zzso signaling in the altered zzso zzso induced by Twist zzso in zzso
