zzso of zzso cells is a critical process for the proper establishment of the zzso and is, therefore, necessary to maintain embryonic zzso zzso stem zzso cells grown in culture can differentiate into different zzso zzso in zzso mimicking normal zzso cell zzso zzso zzso cells are a valuable model system that can be used to zzso genetic factors that regulate zzso cell zzso Several zzso factors, when analyzed by targeted gene zzso in mice, have resulted in embryonic zzso due to zzso defects and, more specifically, defects of the zzso zzso These studies have helped improve our knowledge about zzso cell zzso but much is still unknown about the specific mechanisms zzso This study uses zzso cell culture to detect proteins with differential expression in zzso and zzso zzso cells in order to identify proteins with potential roles in the differentiation zzso We identified four proteins with differential expression: zzso zzso zzso zzso 8, zzso 18, and zzso (also known as heat shock protein 25, zzso Further investigation confirmed the presence of zzso protein during in zzso zzso cell zzso In addition, we confirmed that zzso of zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso 2 zzso increased in zzso cells during zzso zzso of zzso (also known as zzso zzso resulted in a reduction of zzso zzso and an increase in cell death during zzso cell zzso These results suggest that zzso and the zzso zzso are important during zzso cell zzso
