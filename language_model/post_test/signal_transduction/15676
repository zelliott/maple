The Down syndrome candidate zzso gene zzso also known as zzso is situated close to the Down zzso Critical Region zzso which contains genes responsible for many features of Down zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, though its functional role is incompletely zzso 

Here we investigated the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso signaling by analyzing interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso components zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso analyses of zzso cells revealed that zzso zzso with zzso an zzso zzso leading to the zzso of zzso from zzso Similarly, both zzso and zzso zzso with zzso with zzso reducing interaction between zzso and zzso zzso also zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso production, all downstream consequences of zzso zzso 

Together, these results suggest that zzso zzso positively zzso zzso signaling pathways by regulating zzso complex zzso
