zzso compounds are a newly recognized class of zzso zzso compounds with electron zzso zzso carbon centers that react with specific zzso zzso on targeted proteins via zzso zzso Although plants produce a variety of zzso active zzso compounds, the detailed mechanism of action of these compounds remains zzso zzso zzso compounds have attracted attention because they become zzso zzso upon zzso although they are not themselves zzso In this study, we focused on the zzso effects of one such compound, zzso acid zzso found in the herb rosemary obtained from zzso zzso We found that CA activates the zzso zzso zzso by binding to specific zzso zzso zzso thus protecting zzso from zzso stress and zzso In zzso cultures, zzso accumulates in zzso cells at low zzso and in zzso at higher zzso We present evidence that both the zzso and zzso distribution of CA may contribute to its zzso zzso Furthermore, CA zzso into the brain, increases the level of reduced zzso in zzso and protects the brain against middle cerebral artery zzso suggesting that CA may represent a new type of zzso zzso zzso
