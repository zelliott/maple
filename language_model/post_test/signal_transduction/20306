The zzso transformation of zzso zzso from an zzso form in batch culture to an adherent zzso form results from the contact of zzso with zzso zzso cells and with immobilized zzso zzso a basement membrane zzso This suggests host signaling of the zzso We applied integrated zzso and zzso approaches to investigate the molecular responses of zzso zzso upon binding to zzso A zzso analysis was performed by using large-scale zzso zzso zzso A total of zzso zzso generated from batch culture zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso libraries were zzso The zzso library revealed decreased amounts of transcripts that were of lower abundance in the zzso zzso There was a shift by zzso organisms to the expression of transcripts zzso essential zzso possibly indicating the expression of genes for adaptation to the zzso changes needed for the zzso zzso In addition, we identified 43 zzso expressed proteins in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Among these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (an zzso zzso and stress-related proteins were zzso in the zzso zzso zzso genes and proteins were highly expressed in both the zzso and zzso of zzso organisms, zzso that these genes and proteins may play critical roles in the response to zzso This is the first report of a comparative zzso and zzso analysis after the binding of zzso zzso to zzso This approach may lead to the discovery of novel zzso genes and affirm the role of genes involved in disease zzso This knowledge will permit a greater understanding of the complex zzso zzso
