A selective zzso D zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso generation and cell migration but not zzso in zzso zzso rat zzso A novel zzso zzso compound zzso zzso which inhibited zzso generation and cell migration, also reduced the zzso but not zzso zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso inhibited the interaction of zzso with zzso factor zzso 6 and Ras zzso zzso A, and reduced the membrane recruitment of zzso in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced the cellular levels of zzso zzso membrane recruitment of zzso protein zzso 1 and the downstream zzso light chain 2 zzso and attenuated the interaction between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas it only slightly inhibited the zzso zzso exchange activity of human zzso zzso protein and did not affect the zzso binding to zzso zzso inhibited the interaction of zzso with zzso the membrane association and the zzso of zzso zzso had no effect on the zzso of zzso family zzso zzso but attenuated the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also inhibited the interaction of zzso with protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso These results indicate that zzso of zzso zzso activity by zzso is attributable to the blockade of zzso zzso via the interference with zzso zzso zzso zzso of the interaction of zzso with zzso and zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso in rat zzso
