We recently found that zzso a zzso natural compound, is a novel zzso signaling zzso in pancreatic zzso In the present study, we further show that exposure of zzso insulin zzso zzso cells to zzso for 48 h enhanced zzso insulin zzso zzso whereas insulin content was not altered, suggesting that zzso zzso is not due to a zzso of insulin zzso This zzso effect is protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso had no effect on zzso zzso expression or cellular zzso production, but similarly zzso zzso insulin zzso in zzso cells, indicating that the improvement of insulin zzso function by long-term zzso exposure is not related to an zzso in zzso zzso or the zzso zzso The enhanced insulin zzso by zzso was associated with elevated zzso zzso concentration and dependent on protein zzso A and new protein synthesis as this effect was completely blocked by zzso or zzso Similarly, 48 h of zzso exposure also enhanced zzso in freshly isolated mouse and human pancreatic zzso suggesting a zzso and biologically relevant zzso These findings provide evidence that zzso may be a novel zzso compound that has an zzso effect by improving insulin zzso from pancreatic zzso
