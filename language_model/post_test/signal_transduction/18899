zzso is a well known zzso human zzso and zzso evidence has demonstrated its association with the increased zzso of lung zzso However, the mechanism involved in its lung zzso effect remains zzso The current study demonstrated that exposure of human zzso zzso cells zzso to zzso resulted in a marked induction of zzso zzso an important zzso for inflammation and tumor zzso Exposure of the zzso cells to zzso also led to significant zzso of nuclear factor of activated zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso rather than zzso or zzso is implicated in the responses of zzso cells to zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso of the zzso zzso by either chemical zzso dominant negative zzso of zzso or zzso small interference zzso resulted in the impairment of zzso induction and caused cell zzso in zzso cells exposed to zzso zzso zzso of two putative zzso binding sites zzso to zzso in the zzso promoter region eliminated the zzso zzso activity induced by zzso confirming that those two zzso binding sites in the zzso promoter region are critical for zzso induction by zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso expression by zzso small interference zzso also led to an increased cell zzso in zzso cells upon zzso zzso Together, our results demonstrate that zzso induction by zzso is through zzso and zzso or zzso pathways and plays a crucial role in zzso zzso cell zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso
