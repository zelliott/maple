zzso also known as high temperature requirement factor zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that was originally identified as a zzso zzso Like zzso it zzso inhibitor of zzso proteins when released into the zzso on zzso zzso Loss of its zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) mice is associated with zzso However, the detailed mechanisms by which zzso regulates the zzso of neurodegenerative disease remain largely zzso We report here that zzso zzso in the pivotal cellular degradation process known as zzso It activates zzso through zzso of zzso a zzso zzso protein that zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso the degradation of neurodegenerative proteins such as zzso zzso zzso and truncated zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso decreases the zzso level of zzso and increases the level of the above target zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso the zzso zzso found in zzso mice, fails to regulate zzso Increased zzso zzso and the formation of zzso structures are observed in the brains of zzso zzso These results identify zzso as a novel regulator of zzso and suggest that zzso might be important in the cellular quality control of proteins involved in neurodegenerative zzso
