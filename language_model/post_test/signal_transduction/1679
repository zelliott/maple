zzso is a zzso zzso factor resulting from fusion of the zzso domain of the Ewing zzso gene zzso to the three zzso zinc fingers of the zzso tumor zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso small round cell tumor zzso which is noted for the abundance of zzso zzso surrounding zzso of tumor cells, suggestive of zzso signals contributing to tumor cell zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso can be used to identify targets of zzso zzso of zzso from a zzso promoter leads to the induction of zzso zzso of which the most remarkable is the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso protein maps to two zzso sites within the zzso zzso Analysis of primary zzso tumor specimens demonstrates high levels of zzso within the tumor cells, along with expression of zzso and zzso by the abundant zzso zzso cells within the zzso zzso zzso of this zzso signaling zzso is consistent with the nuclear zzso of its downstream zzso zzso zzso and zzso These observations suggest that the zzso induction of a zzso zzso by a zzso zzso product enables a zzso response of zzso cancer cells to zzso zzso by the surrounding zzso
