Members of the zzso zzso family zzso and zzso have recently been shown to be involved in the entry of human zzso virus zzso into target zzso Here, we investigated the regulation of zzso in rat zzso leukemia cells zzso zzso zzso with wild type zzso zzso or a zzso tail deletion zzso zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso cell derived zzso zzso zzso higher zzso zzso zzso zzso generation, and a more sustained calcium zzso in cells expressing zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but not a membrane permeable zzso analog induced rapid zzso as well as zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was not detected under any of these zzso Despite lack of zzso zzso calcium zzso by zzso in zzso zzso cells was partially zzso by prior treatment with zzso Of interest, the rapid release of calcium was inhibited without affecting the sustained calcium zzso indicating independent regulatory pathways for these zzso zzso completely inhibited zzso zzso and calcium zzso in zzso zzso but only partially inhibited these responses in zzso zzso zzso also partially inhibited these responses in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso caused zzso of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso as well as zzso induced rapid zzso of zzso zzso zzso but not zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso albeit at reduced levels relative to zzso zzso These results indicate that signaling and zzso of zzso are regulated by zzso zzso dependent and independent zzso zzso of zzso zzso independent of zzso zzso appears to be a consequence of the zzso of zzso zzso
