zzso immunity is highly zzso and relies on pattern recognition receptors zzso such as zzso receptors zzso through their zzso to zzso zzso for pathogen zzso Although zzso Toll is vital for immune recognition and defense, roles for the other eight zzso zzso in immunity have remained zzso Here we have shown that zzso is a zzso both in zzso and in adult zzso loss of zzso led to increased zzso zzso virus zzso replication and zzso zzso along with additional zzso zzso zzso was zzso induced by zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso with zzso at the plasma membrane and induced zzso zzso independently of the zzso Toll signaling zzso These data uncover an zzso zzso role for a second zzso Toll zzso that links viral recognition to zzso and defense and suggest that other zzso zzso may restrict specific as yet untested zzso perhaps via zzso signaling zzso
