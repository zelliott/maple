Acute zzso leukemia is a form of acute zzso zzso characterized by the zzso zzso zzso and the presence of the abnormal zzso fusion zzso zzso acid is a potent agent for the treatment of this fatal zzso of zzso and is particularly effective when combined with zzso zzso The important biological activities of zzso acid in zzso and in zzso have provoked extensive studies over the years, aimed to define the mechanisms by which it zzso its zzso zzso It is now well established that zzso acid when administered at pharmacological doses can reverse the zzso effects that the zzso zzso exhibits on the functions of the wild type zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso gene zzso via zzso acid responsive elements zzso that are present in the promoters of zzso genes that ultimately result in the production of protein products that regulate zzso cell differentiation and induce zzso zzso There is now accumulating evidence that additional zzso pathways are activated during zzso zzso of cells, involving zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso This review summarizes the current knowledge on the zzso zzso activated by zzso acid in zzso zzso The clinical implications and potential zzso applications from the accumulating knowledge in the field are also zzso
