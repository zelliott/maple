The zzso gene zzso is associated with the zzso zzso which is caused by an zzso deletion of the long arm of human zzso zzso Previously, we found that zzso protein zzso zzso binds to and zzso zzso consequently leading to zzso zzso arrest and growth zzso However, it remains elusive whether zzso regulates cell proliferation in a zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso interacts with the zzso zzso box II zzso and the zzso basic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Further, zzso inhibited zzso zzso activity by preventing the recruitment of zzso and its zzso zzso to the target gene zzso as thus suppressing zzso cell zzso Also, zzso zzso depletion elevated zzso zzso activity determined by its target zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso depletion also resulted in the induction of zzso zzso and subsequent protein zzso zzso with this, zzso promoted zzso zzso turnover through an zzso 2 zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, our study demonstrates that zzso zzso zzso functions by directly zzso its zzso activity and zzso its zzso degradation via zzso
