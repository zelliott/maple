A previous controlled intervention trial showed that zzso supplementation was effective in reducing the zzso of prostate zzso zzso zzso of zzso have also been reported to inhibit the growth of human prostate cancer cells in zzso The present study describes the observation that zzso was able to significantly zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso transcript and protein within hours in the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso transcript and protein followed a similar dose and time response pattern upon exposure to zzso The reduction of zzso and zzso expression by zzso occurred well before any significant change in cell zzso With the use of a zzso reporter construct linked to either the zzso promoter or the zzso responsive element, it was found that zzso inhibited the zzso activity of zzso in cells zzso with the zzso zzso expression zzso zzso also suppressed the binding of zzso to the zzso responsive element site, as evidenced by zzso mobility shift zzso of the zzso responsive element zzso In view of the fact that zzso is a zzso zzso indicator of prostate cancer, an important implication of this study is that a zzso intervention strategy aimed at zzso down the zzso of zzso signaling could be helpful in controlling morbidity of this zzso
