The zzso to zzso transition zzso is considered to be an important event during zzso tumor progression and zzso Although zzso signaling causes zzso the mechanisms, including the signaling zzso are as yet zzso In the present study we have examined the effects of signal zzso pathways on zzso zzso zzso using an immortalized mouse zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso is characterized by zzso of zzso and tight junctions and the reorganization of zzso An active zzso gene was introduced into a mouse zzso cell line which was then treated with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso or the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso The expression and zzso of the zzso and tight junction proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined by western zzso zzso and zzso The barrier function of tight junctions was assessed by zzso of zzso electric resistance zzso and zzso in terms of zzso of zzso and zzso In zzso cells expression of zzso and zzso was markedly zzso at the protein and zzso levels and the zzso value was zzso while the zzso was zzso The distribution of zzso zzso and zzso was changed from linear to zzso structures at cell zzso In zzso cells treated with zzso and zzso but not zzso expression and zzso of zzso but not zzso recovered, together with barrier function, measured as the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso also recovered on treatment with zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso and zzso of zzso recovered slightly on treatment with zzso Thus, zzso zzso regulates zzso via distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso signal pathways in the mouse zzso cell zzso
