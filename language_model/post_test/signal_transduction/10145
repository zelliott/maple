zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso pathogen and the zzso agent of significant zzso and zzso tract zzso zzso primarily zzso zzso cells, and the inflammatory response of these cells to the infection directs both the innate and zzso immune zzso This study focused on determining the cellular immune receptors involved in the early events following infection with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso We found that dominant negative zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso during a productive infection with zzso Furthermore, expression of zzso zzso zzso was required for zzso zzso from infected cells, whereas the effect of zzso expression was zzso Cell zzso was dependent on infection with live, replicating bacteria, because infection with zzso bacteria and treatment of infected cells with zzso but not zzso zzso the induction of zzso zzso Finally, we show that both zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is actively engaged in signaling from this zzso zzso These data support the role of zzso in the host response to infection with zzso zzso Our data further demonstrate that zzso and the zzso zzso are specifically recruited to the bacterial or inclusion membrane during a productive infection with zzso and provide the first evidence that zzso zzso is responsible for signal zzso during infection with an zzso zzso
