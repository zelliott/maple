zzso zzso a natural zzso has shown zzso effects on the growth and migration of a variety of cancer zzso however, whether zzso has similar effects on vascular smooth muscle cells zzso remains zzso The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of zzso on the proliferation and migration of cultured zzso and zzso formation in a carotid injury model, as well as the related cell signaling zzso 

zzso zzso inhibited the zzso growth factor zzso proliferation of zzso without cell zzso This zzso was caused by a zzso phase cell cycle arrest demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso We also showed that zzso growth zzso was associated with the zzso of the expression of zzso D1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as an increase in zzso levels in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso was also found to zzso migration of zzso and smooth zzso zzso marker zzso zzso zzso zzso modulated zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the activities of downstream signaling molecules including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso Our in zzso studies using a mouse carotid zzso injury model revealed that treatment with 150 zzso zzso resulted in significant reduction of the zzso ratio and zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso cells, without affecting zzso of vascular cells and zzso zzso of inflammatory cells was also inhibited by zzso zzso 

These results demonstrate that zzso can suppress the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso after vascular zzso These beneficial effects on zzso were at least partly zzso by the zzso of zzso and the activities of downstream signaling zzso The results suggest that zzso has the potential to be a candidate for the prevention of zzso
