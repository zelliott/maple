The zzso zzso zzso plays dual roles in proliferation and patterning during embryonic development, but the zzso that distinguish the zzso and patterning activities of zzso zzso are not fully zzso An additional level of complexity is provided by the observation that zzso zzso can both promote and inhibit cell zzso One model to account for this apparent paradox is that zzso zzso primarily regulates cell cycle zzso such that zzso of zzso zzso promotes fast cycling and an earlier cell cycle zzso Here we report that zzso of zzso zzso promotes zzso cell proliferation but zzso proliferation in zzso zzso cells, suggesting that the cell cycle zzso model is insufficient to account for the opposing zzso responses to zzso zzso We show that expression of the zzso zzso zzso is a critical zzso that determines the zzso response to zzso zzso and that loss of zzso function zzso the zzso of cell cycle regulator targets of zzso zzso without affecting general zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso activity independently of zzso zzso and propose that zzso enhances zzso proliferation by promoting the activity of zzso Our results indicate that zzso is required for zzso cell proliferation but not for zzso zzso and suggest that the parallel zzso of zzso is required to zzso the zzso zzso to distinguish between patterning and zzso
