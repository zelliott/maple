zzso are activated by zzso zzso on zzso zzso A zzso zzso forms a functional zzso through zzso zzso zzso 2 domain zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment zzso the association of zzso and zzso which results in the zzso of zzso gene zzso The molecular basis of the zzso zzso interaction has not been zzso We report here that a region near the zzso zzso of zzso zzso acids zzso directly interacts with the zzso domain of zzso zzso acids zzso A zzso zzso lacking the zzso domain failed to inhibit zzso gene zzso By using a modified zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso specifically interacts with the zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso zzso In addition, whereas the zzso region of zzso does not interact with zzso it serves as a zzso domain by preventing the interaction of the zzso domain of zzso with the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso interaction is zzso through the specific recognition of the zzso form of zzso by zzso
