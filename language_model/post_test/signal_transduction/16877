Daily zzso of zzso outer segment fragments zzso by the retinal zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso zzso cells use an zzso machinery that is highly similar to the one zzso use to zzso zzso zzso In both forms of zzso particle binding zzso zzso signaling that is required for zzso assembly and zzso beneath bound zzso zzso binding of zzso cells stimulates zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which may be downstream of zzso and zzso zzso decreases zzso Here, we used specific zzso agents to investigate whether and how zzso and zzso contribute to zzso zzso Either zzso or zzso zzso eliminated zzso zzso by zzso cells in response to zzso and increased the numbers of zzso bound by zzso zzso zzso the quality of bound zzso we found a higher fraction of zzso associated with zzso zzso cups and zzso II in zzso receiving zzso zzso In these cells, individual zzso also recruited more zzso and zzso II than zzso in control zzso In contrast, zzso zzso did not alter frequency of zzso cups but individual cups contained less zzso (but similar levels of zzso zzso compared to control zzso zzso zzso another zzso cup protein of zzso cells, associated with bound zzso regardless of inhibitor zzso zzso zzso proceeded normally if cells already carried zzso zzso when receiving zzso However, zzso zzso during zzso binding blocked subsequent zzso zzso In striking contrast, zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest distinct regulatory roles of zzso and zzso during zzso zzso by zzso zzso
