zzso factors are small peptides found in several zzso zzso including gut, respiratory tract and zzso Their zzso function is not well zzso Among them, zzso factor 3 zzso zzso zzso is known to be zzso in the zzso However, the molecular mechanism and secondary zzso of zzso factor 3 action are not zzso In the present study, we examined whether the zzso zzso is involved in zzso factor 3 zzso We showed that zzso factor 3 significantly zzso the production of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells (an zzso zzso cell line) in a dose dependent zzso Western zzso and zzso revealed that zzso factor 3 zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso but not zzso in zzso zzso Treating cells with zzso factor 3 (10 zzso significantly attenuated zzso oxygen zzso zzso cell zzso This effect is blocked by zzso (10 zzso a selective zzso zzso Moreover, we demonstrated that zzso administered zzso (1 zzso a stable analogue of zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso (1 zzso caused a significant reduction of zzso oxygen zzso cell injury, mimicking the effect of zzso factor zzso In zzso our results indicate that zzso factor 3 activates zzso in zzso zzso to produce zzso zzso and zzso zzso which function as survival factors and mediate the zzso action of zzso factor 3 against zzso zzso
