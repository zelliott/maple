zzso growth zzso zzso zzso signal zzso is involved in zzso zzso cell zzso however, the role played by the zzso zzso signaling remains largely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso with enhanced zzso of zzso zzso signal regulated zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso inhibitor or by expression of dominant negative zzso blocked zzso zzso resulting in zzso of zzso protein synthesis and zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso active zzso zzso was sufficient to induce protein synthesis and zzso similar to those induced by zzso zzso or dominant negative zzso of zzso zzso 3 zzso decreased zzso zzso leading to suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso at zzso is zzso by zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Both zzso 3 zzso and zzso promoted zzso of zzso in response to zzso zzso negative zzso significantly inhibited zzso protein synthesis and zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso activity, which blocks zzso of zzso complex, decreased zzso zzso of zzso without any effect on zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso which mimics zzso zzso promoted protein synthesis and zzso similar to zzso These results were confirmed using zzso deficient zzso of zzso Together our results highlight a significant role of zzso of zzso complex for zzso zzso of zzso Moreover, we conclude that zzso zzso signaling circuit involving zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso of zzso at zzso is required to facilitate zzso cell zzso
