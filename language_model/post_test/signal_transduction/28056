zzso use sophisticated mechanisms to allow the specific packaging of their zzso over that of host zzso zzso We examined the in zzso assembly of the zzso zzso zzso virus zzso and observed that assembly with viral zzso follows two different zzso Initially, zzso zzso protein zzso zzso bind zzso with low zzso and form zzso particles of 90 zzso zzso and one copy of zzso zzso incubation reveals a different assembly zzso At a zzso of about ten zzso zzso per zzso the zzso slowly folds the zzso into a compact structure that can be bound with high zzso by additional zzso zzso This folding process is exclusively a function of zzso zzso structure and is independent of zzso zzso zzso folding is distinct from zzso folding that depends on zzso to stabilize zzso zzso We zzso that specific zzso of viral zzso is a three-step process: specific binding by a few copies of zzso zzso zzso and then cooperative binding of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso This zzso observed in a plant virus, may be zzso to other viruses that do not halt synthesis of host zzso acid, including zzso
