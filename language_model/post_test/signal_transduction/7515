zzso Is essential for normal patterning during zzso embryonic development, and either gain or zzso gene zzso results in severe axis zzso The zzso zzso locus is structured such that transcripts may possess two regulatory 3' untranslated regions zzso raising the possibility of zzso regulation as an important mode of zzso signaling zzso To determine whether both zzso contribute to zzso zzso gene regulation, each zzso zzso and zzso was tested in transient and transgenic reporter zzso Both zzso suppress zzso reporter expression in zzso with zzso exhibiting a more pronounced zzso zzso contains a 6 base sequence necessary for zzso regulatory function that is complementary to the seed of the zzso zzso A target protector zzso that zzso the seed complement zzso both reporter zzso and zzso zzso and produces zzso abnormalities consistent with zzso zzso In rescue zzso specific functions can be attributed to each of the two zzso proteins zzso by the zzso An interplay of zzso and zzso regulates neural and zzso patterning and zzso as well as patterning between brain zzso Thus, zzso control of zzso is essential to fine tune the balance of the signaling zzso of the complex zzso zzso
