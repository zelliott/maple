zzso zzso zzso is the leading cause of zzso mortality in premature zzso and it develops under conditions of exaggerated zzso signaling in the newborn zzso zzso Because NEC does not develop spontaneously, despite the presence of seemingly zzso stimulation of zzso zzso we hypothesized that mechanisms must exist to zzso zzso signaling that become diminished during NEC zzso and focused on the zzso stress response protein and zzso heat shock zzso zzso We demonstrate that the induction of zzso zzso in zzso dramatically reduced zzso zzso as assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These findings were confirmed in zzso using mice that either globally lacked zzso or zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso itself significantly increased zzso expression in zzso which provided a mechanism of zzso of zzso signaling in zzso In seeking to define the mechanisms involved, zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling required both its zzso zzso domain and association with the zzso zzso resulting in zzso and zzso degradation of zzso The expression of zzso in the zzso zzso was significantly decreased in zzso and human NEC compared with healthy controls, suggesting that loss of zzso protection from zzso could lead to zzso In support of this, zzso zzso zzso in mice and zzso zzso of zzso reversed zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as prevented and treated experimental zzso Thus, a novel zzso regulatory zzso exists within the newborn gut involving zzso that may be zzso activated to limit NEC zzso
