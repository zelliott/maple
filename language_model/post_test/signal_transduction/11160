zzso zzso zzso is associated with significant zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso mediates the inflammatory response to S zzso and may trigger an innate immune response in the zzso We hypothesized that a zzso zzso would zzso S zzso cardiac zzso zzso production and the development of cardiac zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso mice were zzso S zzso challenge significantly increased tumor necrosis factor, zzso and zzso oxide expression in hearts of zzso zzso This response was significantly blunted in zzso zzso Hearts from zzso mice had impaired S zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso terminal zzso nuclear zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, hearts from zzso mice were protected against S zzso zzso zzso 

These results show for the first time that zzso signaling contributes to the loss of zzso zzso and zzso production in the heart during S zzso zzso
