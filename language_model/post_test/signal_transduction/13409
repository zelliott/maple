Large arteries from zzso subjects are zzso to zzso zzso We tested the hypothesis that small arteries zzso zzso zzso have a profile similar to zzso zzso including signal zzso mechanisms and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contraction in normal and high blood zzso zzso and zzso arteries from zzso zzso zzso zzso sham zzso zzso zzso zzso blood pressure, zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso rats zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were mounted in a zzso zzso In resistance arteries from zzso rats, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso (5 zzso zzso rightward zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso zzso C inhibitor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso reduced maximum zzso contraction in small arteries zzso and zzso control, zzso As in zzso zzso had a decrease in threshold zzso zzso increase in potency zzso zzso zzso and increase in efficacy zzso sham zzso in small arteries from zzso rats compared with zzso Unlike in zzso zzso contraction in zzso small arteries was shifted competitively by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for both sham and zzso zzso and contraction to the zzso zzso zzso was not zzso Thus, the zzso zzso remains the zzso zzso in hypertension in small zzso Although similarities were observed for large and small zzso differences under the condition of zzso hypertension exist that may determine zzso compounds effective in lowering blood zzso
