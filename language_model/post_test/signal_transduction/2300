zzso protein zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso that regulate responses to diverse zzso zzso zzso cues and environmental zzso A zzso is zzso and activated by a zzso zzso zzso which is activated by an upstream protein zzso such as zzso zzso or a zzso zzso zzso a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso is required for two zzso zzso mating and invasive zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso targets of zzso are required for zzso but their role in invasive growth has been zzso Because no other zzso zzso zzso has been shown to function in invasive growth, it was proposed that zzso may have zzso zzso We show instead that zzso is the principal target of zzso in the zzso response in both zzso and zzso We demonstrate further that zzso in its inactive form is a potent negative regulator of invasive zzso zzso acts to relieve this negative regulation by switching zzso from an inhibitor to an zzso These results indicate that this zzso has a zzso important function in its zzso zzso zzso of normal and zzso cells indicates that nitrogen zzso and activated Ras stimulate zzso growth through both zzso and zzso zzso
