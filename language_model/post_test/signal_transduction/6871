Cooperative gene regulation by different zzso likely zzso the long-term forms of zzso learning and memory, but this mechanism largely remains to be zzso Following zzso zzso analysis for genes regulated by zzso or zzso we found that the zzso II gene zzso was zzso activated by zzso and zzso in primary cultured mouse zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso prevented zzso zzso by zzso or zzso thus, the zzso zzso zzso is predicted to include a convergence zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the protein zzso A inhibitor zzso enhanced zzso zzso by zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso also enhanced zzso zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso diminished the zzso zzso of zzso zzso These results are zzso with the notion that zzso input leads to zzso of a zzso zzso zzso which is short-lived because of rapid degradation by zzso This repression zzso may effectively limit the time window zzso to zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso via the zzso zzso zzso We propose that the regulatory system of zzso expression is equipped with machinery that is refined for the signal integration of zzso synaptic zzso We proposed hypothetical mechanism for the regulation of the zzso II gene as a signal zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso activates the zzso zzso pathway, which thus contributes to the signal zzso zzso zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso by zzso leads to zzso of the zzso protein X that is otherwise susceptible to zzso zzso This repression system may determine the time window zzso to the cooperative zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso
