zzso zzso cell growth factor zzso is zzso in the zzso but its role and regulation in this organ have not been zzso zzso and its receptors zzso were zzso using reverse zzso chain reaction and Western zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso protein were increased after treatment with 50 zzso zzso zzso of 100 zzso human zzso zzso 165 into the zzso caused an increase in zzso cell zzso but only a moderate increase in zzso zzso fluid zzso In contrast with systemic zzso treatment, local zzso injection did not increase the zzso to zzso injected zzso carbon zzso However, if zzso was given locally in the zzso of animals zzso with zzso 4 or 8 h earlier, zzso acted in zzso with zzso to increase vascular carbon leakage by forming zzso cell zzso zzso blood flow was unaffected by local zzso 165 zzso Treatment with a specific zzso zzso zzso inhibitor blocked the zzso increase in zzso cell proliferation but did not affect the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso blood vessels or the increase in the zzso zzso zzso The present study demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso is increased by hormonal stimulation of zzso cells and that zzso through effects zzso via zzso regulates zzso cell proliferation in the rat zzso zzso does not appear to regulate zzso blood flow and it is not involved in inducing the zzso zzso response in the zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso is low in the zzso under zzso conditions but is apparently zzso by zzso zzso
