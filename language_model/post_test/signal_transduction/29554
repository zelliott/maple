zzso zzso zzso acting through their zzso zzso promote the zzso survival and/or proliferation of many cell types in the developing nervous system, including neural crest cells and neural zzso zzso zzso We have recently found that the proliferation of a zzso zzso cell line is dependent on zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso and that zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso the formation of zzso peripheral nerve sheath zzso These observations suggested that zzso might similarly promote zzso in a variety of neural zzso including peripheral zzso aggressive neural zzso zzso that arise in nerves and soft zzso To test this hypothesis, we examined the expression of zzso and its zzso receptors in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells expressed multiple zzso proteins and zzso zzso several alpha and beta zzso from the sensory and motor zzso factor zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso receptors expressed by zzso cells were zzso zzso zzso and zzso these zzso with the zzso specific inhibitor zzso reduced zzso DNA synthesis in a zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso promotes the proliferation of zzso zzso cells in zzso and zzso that zzso zzso zzso or zzso signaling may contribute to the development and/or progression of zzso in zzso
