Only few zzso factors for the clinical activity of zzso growth factor zzso zzso therapy are zzso zzso growth inhibitor zzso is a small zzso protein suggested to play a role in the differentiation of zzso zzso Here, we have investigated the effect of zzso expression on the zzso signaling and zzso responsiveness of cancer zzso 

zzso zzso expression was investigated in clinical breast and lung cancer samples and in zzso and zzso cell zzso The effect of zzso expression of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso function and traffic was investigated in breast and lung cancer cell lines using multiple zzso The effect of zzso agents on these cells were tested by cell proliferation zzso and by assessing tumor growth of breast cancer cells in zzso treated and control zzso nude zzso 

Here, we show that although zzso is absent in cultured cell lines because of zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso of clinical breast zzso and zzso of lung zzso zzso expression of zzso rendered breast and lung cancer cells resistant to the zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in an zzso breast cancer zzso model in zzso When expressed in cancer cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso and the zzso zzso is zzso and not zzso 

zzso inherent zzso of cancer cells is a novel molecular mechanism for resistance to the zzso zzso therapy, and zzso may be a zzso for responsiveness to zzso zzso zzso
