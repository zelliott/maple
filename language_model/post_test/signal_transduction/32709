We previously demonstrated contrasting roles for zzso alpha zzso and their zzso zzso in controlling cell cycle withdrawal and the onset of terminal differentiation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thomas, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso in primary quail zzso either decreases or enhances the probability of cell cycle withdrawal, zzso In this study, we addressed the mechanisms by which changes in zzso alpha zzso ratios regulate this zzso zzso expression of truncated zzso or zzso indicate that the zzso zzso domain is zzso for the zzso zzso whereas the zzso 11 zzso acids of zzso zzso domain inhibit proliferation and promote zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso do not appear to initiate these signals directly, but instead regulate zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso or zzso have no zzso effect on the zzso zzso However, zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso autonomously zzso differentiation and maintains a zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso ratios also significantly affects zzso of zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso expression enhances expression and zzso of zzso as well as zzso protein zzso zzso with little effect on focal zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso expression suppresses zzso and zzso zzso zzso with a lesser effect on zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso forms of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso confirm these zzso These data demonstrate that zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso of cell cycle withdrawal and the onset of terminal zzso occurs through the zzso zzso and is modulated by the alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso ratios alters zzso expression and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso quantitative changes in the level of adhesive signaling through zzso and focal zzso components regulate the decision of zzso to withdraw from the cell cycle, in part via zzso zzso
