The capacity of muscle to grow or to zzso after damage is provided by adult stem cells, so called satellite cells, which are located under the basement zzso of each zzso Upon zzso satellite cells enter the cell cycle, zzso and differentiate into zzso which fuse to injured zzso or form new zzso These processes are tightly controlled by many growth zzso 

Here we investigate the role of bone zzso proteins zzso during satellite cell zzso Unlike the zzso zzso cell line, primary satellite cells do not differentiate into zzso upon zzso zzso Instead zzso signaling zzso zzso differentiation of primary satellite cells ex zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso signaling results in cell cycle exit, followed by enhanced zzso differentiation and zzso zzso Using an in zzso trauma model we demonstrate that satellite cells respond to zzso signals during the zzso zzso Interestingly, we found the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso in primary satellite cell cultures and in zzso zzso In both systems zzso expression follows that of zzso a marker for cells committed to zzso 

Our data indicate that zzso signaling plays a critical role in balancing proliferation and differentiation of activated satellite cells and their zzso Initially, zzso signals maintain satellite cells descendants in a zzso state thereby expanding cell zzso After cells are committed to differentiate they zzso the expression of the zzso inhibitor zzso thereby supporting terminal differentiation and zzso formation in a negative feedback zzso
