Slow and zzso wave zzso through zzso junctions in cardiac zzso is generally considered unsafe and zzso However, the relationships between tissue structure, wave zzso zzso and safety at such junctions are zzso We have developed a structurally and zzso detailed model of the canine zzso junction zzso and varied its zzso parameters to determine such zzso We show that neither very fast nor very slow zzso is safe, and there exists an optimal zzso that provides the maximum safety factor for zzso through the zzso The zzso zzso time delay across the zzso is a natural consequence of the zzso and zzso differences between the zzso fiber and zzso zzso The delay allows the zzso to accumulate and pass sufficient charge to zzso the adjacent zzso zzso but is not long enough for the zzso mismatch at the junction to be enhanced over zzso The observed relationships between the zzso zzso and safety factor can provide new insights into optimal conditions for wave propagation through zzso junctions between various cardiac zzso
