zzso zzso consists of multiple layers of signaling zzso zzso production is of interest for many, since its expression determines a critical difference between partial and full zzso zzso To achieve full zzso of T cells, it is necessary for the zzso zzso zzso zzso to be engaged for an extended period of zzso However, why extended stimulation is required for full zzso zzso is not understood at the molecular zzso In this review, orchestrated events of zzso signal zzso will be analyzed in a kinetic manner and connected toward the understanding of the mechanism of zzso zzso Based on recent results, a model of the mechanism that dictates the threshold between partial and full zzso zzso is zzso
