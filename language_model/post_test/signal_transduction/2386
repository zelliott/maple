The zzso zzso of the zzso embryonic nerve zzso undergo a reduction in cell number after zzso zzso tract zzso The numbers of zzso zzso entering zzso at this stage can be increased by a loss or reduction of function in genes of the zzso group or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso with an zzso zzso zzso is zzso to function as a zzso zzso In this work, we assess the role of zzso in the determination of zzso zzso cell zzso Although all zzso zzso express zzso zzso expression is restricted to the zzso zzso which do not enter zzso Fewer zzso zzso enter zzso in zzso lacking zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso is sufficient to remove all zzso zzso zzso from the nerve cord, even those that already express zzso zzso expression is not terminated in the zzso zzso after zzso group signaling triggers changes in gene zzso It is therefore likely that an zzso of zzso signaling by zzso is integrated with the zzso of zzso signaling by zzso throughout the period of reduction of zzso zzso zzso We suggest that signaling by zzso but not zzso is restricted to adhesive zzso In this manner, zzso zzso not forming signaling junctions remain sensitive to zzso zzso zzso while an zzso zzso signal is excluded by the adhesive zzso
