zzso zzso patients is important for decisions on the intensity of zzso therapy and mode of zzso The most recent zzso of Crohn's disease zzso and zzso colitis zzso the Montreal zzso is based on clinical zzso for CD, the age at diagnosis and disease location and behavior and for zzso the age at diagnosis and the extent of zzso During the Working Party in 2005 in Montreal, it was judged by the panel of experts that a molecular zzso using zzso and/or genetic markers was too premature and not yet zzso In the meanwhile, the number of genes associated with zzso has increased to zzso and more zzso peptides have also been zzso We recently showed that genetic zzso enable the zzso of CD patients in distinct zzso which is different from clusters seen in healthy zzso Furthermore, there was a poor relationship between the zzso zzso and the clinical zzso being zzso The promising role for molecular markers lies most likely in disease stratification, the prediction of prognosis at the time of diagnosis and the prediction of therapy zzso The behavior of CD and UC varies between patients, and the characteristic zzso inflammation in zzso zzso often progress and lead to zzso or zzso formation over zzso zzso which patients are at risk for progression to complications and how fast this occurs could have therapeutic zzso as more aggressive treatment strategies could become zzso in the appropriate zzso zzso factors are definitively more appealing for risk zzso on more solid zzso zzso markers may also better explain changes in disease behavior from a zzso standpoint, and by combining several markers this strategy can approach clinical zzso Before starting to apply molecular markers to predict disease behaviors, tools should be made available to score disease zzso Only then could the value of molecular markers to predict the speed of progression be fully explored in prospective zzso
