The zzso zzso for zzso zzso gamma zzso is expressed widely in the immune system and functions to zzso zzso immune zzso In mast cells, zzso of zzso gamma zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso activity requires a zzso motif within the zzso gamma zzso zzso domain termed the zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B cell zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso is rapidly zzso on zzso and recruits the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the mechanisms by which zzso mediates zzso gamma zzso zzso function in mast cells remain poorly zzso In this report we demonstrate that zzso gamma zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso stimulates enhanced zzso zzso zzso and association with zzso and zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso and association with zzso are observed, suggesting that zzso may mediate zzso gamma zzso zzso function in mast cells via recruitment of zzso and zzso Supporting this hypothesis, recruitment of zzso to zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to inhibit zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso Interestingly, both the zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso and the zzso zzso region of zzso can mediate zzso suggesting zzso of parallel downstream signaling pathways that zzso at zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso Finally, studies using zzso mice indicate that zzso is zzso for zzso gamma zzso zzso signaling in mast zzso Taken together, these data suggest a role for zzso as a zzso of zzso gamma zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso signal zzso in mast zzso
