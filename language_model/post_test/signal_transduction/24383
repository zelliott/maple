The zzso membrane zzso forms the structural and functional interface between the zzso plant and the zzso The model zzso zzso zzso was chosen to study the proteins present at the zzso by zzso zzso zzso was zzso from root zzso by an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins were subjected to a global zzso zzso The peptides were separated by zzso liquid zzso and analyzed by tandem mass zzso zzso the zzso protein database and the green plant expressed sequence tag database using the tandem mass zzso data identified approximately 94 zzso a number far exceeding the number of proteins reported for the zzso zzso In particular, a number of membrane proteins like zzso for zzso and zzso zzso proteins such as zzso proteins and zzso zzso and proteins involved in zzso for example, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and pathogen zzso zzso including a so-called zzso zzso were zzso Several zzso and zzso were present, indicating a more complex situation than previously zzso In addition, the unexpected presence of a number of proteins known to be located in other compartments was zzso Two characteristic protein complexes obtained from native gel zzso of total zzso proteins were also zzso Together, the results identified specific proteins at the zzso involved in important zzso processes and localized proteins known from zzso expressed sequence tag databases to the zzso
