zzso beta cells respond to changes in blood zzso by zzso insulin and increasing insulin zzso To identify genes used in these responses, we have carried out expression profiling of beta cells exposed to high zzso zzso or low zzso zzso zzso by using zzso zzso zzso zzso of genes that averaged a zzso or greater change revealed large groups of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Many zzso zzso genes were zzso in high zzso including seven members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In agreement with array analysis, protein levels of zzso components were increased by high zzso Most dramatically, the alpha zzso of the signal recognition particle zzso was increased over zzso These data indicate that the zzso and zzso zzso are major regulatory targets of zzso in the beta zzso Analysis of genes zzso zzso of zzso metabolism indicated that low zzso brought about greater zzso of zzso acids as an energy zzso This conclusion was supported by observations of increased zzso production under zzso zzso The above results demonstrate zzso integration of zzso functions at the level of transcript abundance and validate the efficacy of expression profiling in identifying genes involved in the zzso zzso zzso
