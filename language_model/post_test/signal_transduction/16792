The zzso zzso is one of only two zzso capable of transforming mouse zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso gene zzso zzso cells grow robustly in the absence of serum, suggesting the hypothesis that they may produce one or more growth factors that would sustain their ability to zzso in zzso zzso Using zzso approaches on zzso zzso media derived from zzso cells, we have identified two growth promoting factors: zzso and zzso zzso experiments have indicated that zzso plays a prevalent role in promoting growth of zzso cells in zzso zzso
