The zzso protein zzso zzso signaling network is integrated into most, if not all, defined zzso and regulatory responses of zzso zzso A systematic experimental and zzso approach has been used to identify more than 2,000 protein interactions related to functions and regulation of the zzso signaling zzso This discovery process provides a rich data and zzso resource for defining complexities of protein networks involving zzso and control of cellular zzso
