zzso zzso zzso have been traditionally defined as small zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso and their zzso receptors are zzso expressed in the central nervous system zzso where immune activities are under stringent zzso Why and how the zzso uses the zzso system to carry out its complex zzso functions has intrigued zzso Here, we focus on zzso zzso and its zzso zzso that have been widely characterized in peripheral zzso and delineate their main functions in the zzso zzso evidence supports zzso as a key regulator for early development of the zzso zzso signaling is required for the migration of zzso zzso zzso zzso and maintenance of neural zzso cells zzso In the mature zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso represent an inherent system that helps establish and maintain zzso zzso In addition, growing evidence implicates altered expression of zzso and zzso in the zzso of zzso disorders such as zzso zzso brain zzso stroke and multiple sclerosis zzso making them the plausible targets for future pharmacological zzso
