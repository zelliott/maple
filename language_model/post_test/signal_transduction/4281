The zzso and intrinsic activities on zzso zzso zzso and zzso of various selective beta zzso zzso were studied in brown zzso and compared to those of the zzso zzso and conventional beta zzso zzso and beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were more potent stimulants of zzso than of zzso zzso zzso while the selective beta zzso zzso had similar zzso for these two zzso zzso zzso values of the selective beta zzso and beta zzso zzso zzso for zzso of zzso zzso stimulation by zzso and the beta zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicated that zzso can stimulate the zzso through a relevant beta zzso zzso while the other drugs activate the zzso mainly by acting on the beta zzso On the contrary, antagonism of the zzso yielded apparent zzso values for zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso like all the beta zzso zzso zzso the brown zzso tissue zzso metabolism mainly through an action on beta zzso
