We have previously reported that zzso an zzso drug, prevented the experimental zzso zzso in the rat and mouse zzso arteries and its effect may be exerted through the zzso of vascular smooth muscle cell zzso However, its zzso mechanism has yet to be zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso effect of zzso on zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso signal zzso pathways in cultured human coronary artery smooth muscle cells zzso Growth responses to zzso were measured by zzso incorporation or cell zzso zzso of DNA synthesis and zzso of cell proliferation zzso by zzso in zzso cultures of zzso were inhibited by zzso in a zzso zzso Western zzso analysis of zzso from zzso with an zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso (10 - 300 zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso by zzso in a zzso zzso zzso also reduced zzso zzso zzso of a 180 zzso band, corresponding in mass to the zzso zzso as shown by zzso using an zzso zzso zzso study with zzso on zzso showed that zzso (10 - 1000 zzso inhibited the specific binding of zzso to cell surface receptors in a zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso with 300 zzso zzso decreased the maximum binding capacity zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso without affecting binding affinity zzso approximately zzso zzso indicating a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso These results suggest that the suppression of human zzso growth by zzso might be at least partly due to blockade of zzso zzso
