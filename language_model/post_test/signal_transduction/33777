Regulators of zzso activated protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso include zzso small zzso proteins and their zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso proteins identified through their interaction with zzso zzso and zzso scaffold zzso We examined zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in control and zzso zzso in zzso model of transient zzso zzso In normal brain higher amount of zzso but a lower amount of zzso was found in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than in zzso zzso After 5 zzso zzso and 1 h zzso a decrease of zzso and increase of zzso were zzso observed in the zzso zzso By contrast, the amount of zzso in zzso zzso reached zzso zzso zzso zzso of control while was doubled in zzso zzso the zzso of zzso was increased in zzso zzso and reduced in zzso Our data indicate that zzso and zzso take part in the regulation of zzso signal zzso but the mechanism does not seem directly connected with the zzso of zzso and zzso
