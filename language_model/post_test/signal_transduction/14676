To investigate the importance of zzso of the zzso factor, nuclear zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso necrosis zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso and assess its suitability as a target for therapy by determining its role in the induction of the zzso zzso and the degenerative zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso 

Three distinct cellular models, derived from primary zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso and primary zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso These were treated with specific zzso of zzso zzso and zzso to assess their differential role in the production of zzso relevant zzso specifically zzso zzso zzso and the tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso which were zzso by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso by a novel agent, zzso at a dose of zzso zzso exerted significant zzso zzso zzso repression of zzso zzso and zzso production in zzso zzso neither zzso production nor cell viability was significantly affected at the dose zzso These data were reproduced in zzso which might be considered as having greater zzso zzso Interestingly, comparable efficacy was noted using zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

We have demonstrated that a novel pharmacological inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso pathological zzso of zzso progression with equivalent efficacy as established zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our findings highlight a potential for developing zzso targeted zzso for positively regulating disease activity and improving clinical outcome in zzso
