zzso zzso and zzso factor 1 zzso plays important roles in zzso metabolism and zzso gene zzso Because insulin stimulates zzso and zzso zzso it would be important to decipher how the zzso activity of zzso is regulated in the insulin signaling zzso In this study, we demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso enhanced a zzso activity of zzso and expression of zzso target genes including fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso in zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso target gene zzso did not require de zzso protein zzso zzso that zzso might affect zzso activity of zzso at the level of zzso zzso Additionally, we demonstrated that zzso efficiently zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso these data suggest that zzso zzso is crucial to zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso for zzso gene zzso which would coordinate zzso and zzso zzso
