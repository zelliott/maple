zzso of zzso molecules and abundance of zzso molecules in the injured spinal zzso of adult zzso prevent zzso from successful zzso and, thus, contribute to the failure of functional zzso Using an zzso viral zzso zzso we expressed the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso in the zzso spinal zzso of adult zzso zzso zzso zzso already 1 week after zzso spinal zzso zzso and immediate zzso injection, was expressed at high levels up to 5 weeks, the longest zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells throughout the spinal zzso was zzso spanning over more than 10 zzso zzso and 10 zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso was not zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso led to improved stepping abilities and muscle coordination during ground locomotion over a zzso observation zzso Superior functional improvement was associated with enhanced zzso of the zzso spinal zzso by zzso zzso zzso tract zzso did not zzso beyond the zzso zzso but extended zzso into closer proximity to the injury site in zzso compared with control zzso The expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was decreased in zzso spinal zzso along with reduction of the zzso zzso marker zzso In zzso experiments confirmed that zzso zzso zzso zzso migration, process extension and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso activates diverse zzso in zzso and zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso appears to be a potent means to zzso modify the local environment in the injured spinal zzso and promote zzso Our study demonstrates a clinically feasible approach of promising zzso
