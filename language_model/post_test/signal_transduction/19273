Human zzso promoting zzso zzso target zzso zzso and function in animal models of multiple sclerosis zzso However, their mechanism of action is zzso This study seeks to identify the cellular mechanism of action of a zzso human zzso on OL zzso 

zzso of zzso to the surface of rat zzso was studied by zzso with various zzso zzso effects on zzso signaling in zzso differentiation zzso and signaling molecules were detected by Western zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso with zzso zzso but not other zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso we identified zzso family zzso zzso Lyn as a key player of zzso actions in zzso Lyn zzso in a complex together with zzso zzso and zzso Lyn expression was zzso zzso and Lyn zzso was zzso higher zzso OL cultures compared with zzso zzso inhibited zzso signaling by greater than zzso reduction of zzso and zzso zzso and reduced by zzso expression of differentiation markers zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited Lyn activity and restored zzso in zzso A human zzso that did not promote zzso and medium zzso as zzso 

zzso prevented zzso signaling zzso OL differentiation by Lyn zzso zzso zzso is due zzso of zzso and zzso rather than promotion of zzso zzso
