The underlying mechanism of zzso insulin resistance in skeletal muscle cells is zzso In this study, we showed that zzso inhibited the insulin signaling in zzso zzso accompanied with the enhanced zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso The zzso effects of zzso on the insulin signaling were diminished in zzso and zzso zzso target of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced by zzso was attenuated in zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggested that zzso insulin resistance in zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso
