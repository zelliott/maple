zzso zzso zzso responses following infection or zzso may stem in part from intrinsic characteristics of zzso B zzso In this study, we used zzso subset sorting combined with gene expression zzso to investigate major differences in the expression of host genes in zzso and adult zzso B zzso We discovered significantly reduced expression of the zzso zzso zzso alpha chain and reduced zzso zzso in zzso B zzso Neonatal zzso B cells were susceptible to more rapid and more profound levels of zzso when cultured in zzso They also exhibited a limited response to zzso treatment compared with adult zzso The expression level of the zzso zzso alpha 1 chain, a key component of the zzso zzso type II zzso and the response to zzso treatment for protection against zzso in zzso B cells were similar to those of the adult B zzso These studies suggest a possible mechanism underlying the limited magnitude and durability of zzso zzso zzso
