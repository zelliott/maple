Out of zzso zzso zzso screened with zzso of zzso zzso one zzso showed clear disease zzso In order to identify additional components involved in zzso of zzso zzso in zzso a screen for zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Eleven zzso zzso were isolated, which displayed differential zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso was crossed with Columbia zzso and zzso and mapping data for both populations showed the highest linkage to a region on zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso expression were found in zzso compared to zzso plants 48 h after pathogen zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso displayed zzso of either marker gene upon chemical treatment, possibly as an effect of an altered zzso zzso zzso To assess the contribution of different zzso zzso zzso implicated in salicylic acid zzso zzso plants expressing the bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso insensitive zzso enhanced disease zzso zzso and zzso acid resistant zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso insensitive zzso zzso and zzso resistant zzso were zzso All the zzso screened were as resistant as zzso plants, demonstrating the zzso of the pathways in zzso zzso zzso When zzso implicated in cell death responses were zzso responsive to zzso 1 zzso exhibited a weak susceptible zzso whereas accelerated cell death zzso showed a rapid zzso zzso zzso is only partially responsible for zzso zzso zzso in zzso as zzso and enhanced zzso to zzso zzso clearly showed a susceptible response while zzso levels of zzso were present in zzso and zzso The data presented point to the existence of multiple zzso mechanisms controlling the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso
