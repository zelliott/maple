Growing evidence supports the idea that zzso via zzso zzso not only allows cellular zzso but also zzso zzso zzso which in turn activates functional responses of adherent zzso This study investigates whether zzso zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso has a functional impact on zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso was found to induce substantial de zzso synthesis of zzso zzso as measured by zzso zzso and Northern zzso technique, zzso zzso of zzso zzso was also observed upon zzso of zzso to immobilized zzso a functional equivalent of its zzso product zzso that serves as a native zzso of zzso zzso were confirmed using zzso derived from zzso mice, which were unable to produce zzso zzso a zzso of human zzso in the presence of immobilized zzso In contrast, a substantial increase of zzso zzso was observed when zzso zzso were incubated on immobilized zzso In human zzso zzso technique showed that the gene zzso that required zzso zzso activity resulted in a substantial production and zzso of biologically active zzso and zzso In contrast, no zzso or zzso production was found, revealing that zzso zzso mediate differential expression of zzso zzso The biological relevance of the present findings was confirmed in an in zzso model of acute zzso Altogether, the present findings provide evidence for a functional link between zzso and inflammatory responses that may contribute to the recruitment and/or zzso of zzso and other cells at sites of zzso
