The major heat shock zzso zzso can protect against cell death by directly interfering with zzso zzso zzso However, zzso also zzso cells to certain zzso stimuli like zzso Little is known about how zzso enhances zzso We demonstrate here that zzso promotes zzso killing by specifically binding the zzso domain of I zzso B zzso gamma zzso zzso to inhibit zzso activity and consequently inhibit zzso zzso zzso gene zzso An zzso gamma zzso which interacts with zzso competitively zzso the zzso gamma interaction and zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso of zzso expression with zzso interference zzso zzso cell zzso Although zzso may or may not be sufficient to trigger zzso on its own, zzso zzso was initiated or made worse when zzso expression increased to high levels to disrupt zzso B zzso These results provide significant novel insights into the molecular mechanism for the zzso behavior of zzso in zzso cell zzso
