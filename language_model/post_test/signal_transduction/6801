zzso iron zzso involves a negative feedback circuit in which the expression level of the zzso hormone zzso depends on and controls the iron blood zzso zzso expression is regulated by the zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso of either zzso causes zzso diseases such as zzso or anemia of zzso We zzso analyzed how zzso and zzso control zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso and reporter gene expression were measured under zzso conditions, and the promoter was zzso by zzso Using mathematical zzso we systematically analyzed potential mechanisms of cooperative and competitive promoter regulation by the zzso factors, and zzso validated the model zzso Our results reveal that zzso zzso primarily occurs by zzso zzso factor binding to the promoter, whereas signaling zzso is zzso We find that the presence of two zzso elements enhances the zzso of the promoter response towards the zzso zzso signaling zzso which promotes iron zzso in zzso zzso zzso reduces the promoter sensitivity towards the zzso zzso because the zzso and zzso zzso factors compete for recruiting zzso zzso to the zzso start zzso This may explain why inflammatory signals disturb iron zzso in anemia of zzso Taken together, our results reveal why the iron zzso circuit is sensitive to zzso implicated in zzso
