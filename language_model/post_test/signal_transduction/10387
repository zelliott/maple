Most type I zzso zzso are expressed by the majority of cell types in response to viral zzso In contrast, zzso has been reported to have a cellular distribution limited to zzso and certain zzso cell zzso zzso expressed zzso has been shown previously to possess weak zzso activity when directly compared with zzso In order to expand on the zzso potential of zzso we zzso zzso human cell lines to circumvent the need to purify zzso proteins and to avoid the possible loss of zzso activity by the zzso zzso We evaluated the zzso signaling and zzso activity of zzso in parallel with zzso with zzso expression zzso to express each protein zzso Both zzso and zzso exhibited comparable zzso and zzso zzso However, in contrast to zzso zzso signaling and zzso activity, zzso activity was not zzso in zzso cell culture zzso zzso experiments revealed there was a direct relationship between zzso cells and zzso zzso These results were confirmed in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso exhibited zzso zzso activity against a zzso C virus zzso zzso cell zzso This novel zzso signaling strategy may represent an important distinct and divergent mechanism for limiting viral zzso
