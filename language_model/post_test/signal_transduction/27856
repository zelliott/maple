zzso zzso zzso by zzso proteins is crucial to many cell fate decisions in zzso Its profound effects on cell fate and proliferation require that a complex set of responses involving positive and negative signal zzso be orchestrated around each instance of zzso In zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso genes of the zzso locus are induced by zzso zzso and mediate some of its effects, such as suppression of neural zzso Here we report on a novel family of zzso responsive zzso whose products appear to act as zzso of the zzso signal in the process of adult sensory organ precursor zzso They, too, reside in the zzso locus and comprise zzso units zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of these genes causes zzso of zzso zzso expression accompanied by cell autonomous zzso of sensory organ precursors and zzso of zzso Interestingly, negative regulation of the zzso zzso by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso is specific to the process of sensory organ precursor zzso and does not impinge on other instances of zzso zzso
