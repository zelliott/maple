zzso of resting B cells requires an initial triggering of the B cell zzso zzso zzso and secondary stimuli through various zzso receptors and B cell zzso molecules including zzso We found that zzso of B cells through zzso is selectively inhibited by an zzso drug, zzso This effect of zzso on zzso zzso of B cells was observed using three different in zzso zzso zzso suppressed the zzso proliferation of zzso B cells, suppressed differentiation to surface zzso B cells, and inhibited an zzso prevention of zzso induced by zzso zzso of zzso zzso We next examined several known zzso signal zzso pathways to identify the target of zzso in zzso B zzso zzso did not inhibit the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso stimulation nor the zzso of immediate nuclear zzso factors of zzso zzso zzso affects a novel element of the zzso signal zzso zzso which influences the zzso zzso and prevention of zzso of B zzso
