The zzso gene has been implicated in the control of cell proliferation and zzso We show here that zzso has multiple zzso zzso that arise by zzso initiation from alternative tandem zzso These transcripts are not only zzso expressed between cell lines, but they can also differ within an individual cell line, in response to particular zzso Whereas zzso zzso zzso express low levels of zzso zzso stimulation by serum results in a dramatic zzso with the characteristics of a zzso response zzso zzso of involved signal zzso pathways showed that both zzso and zzso are strong zzso of zzso expression zzso via both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In order to characterize the regulatory zzso sequences upstream of the translation initiation site of zzso were zzso for promoter zzso The zzso zzso zzso sequences had zzso promoter activity in all cell lines tested, suggesting that zzso is regulated by negative regulatory elements that were not present in the zzso regions zzso zzso
