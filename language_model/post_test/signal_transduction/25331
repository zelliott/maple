Plants are attacked by a wide spectrum of zzso being the targets of zzso bacteria, zzso zzso zzso and zzso Over the course of their evolution, plants have developed numerous defense mechanisms including the chemical and physical barriers that are zzso elements of plant cell responses locally and/or zzso However, the modern approach in plant sciences focuses on the evolution and role of plant protein receptors corresponding to specific pathogen zzso The recognition of an zzso molecules could be in most cases a prerequisite sine zzso non for plant zzso Although the predicted three-dimensional structure of plant resistance proteins zzso is based on research on their animal zzso advanced technologies in molecular biology and zzso tools enable the investigation or prediction of interaction mechanisms for specific receptors with pathogen zzso Most of the identified R proteins belong to the zzso zzso The presence of other zzso (including the zzso zzso apart from zzso and zzso is fundamental for the zzso of R proteins into zzso Recently discovered additional zzso zzso zzso of R proteins allowed the examination of their zzso in plant cells and the role they play in signal zzso during the plant resistance response to zzso stress zzso This review focuses on the current state of knowledge about the zzso family of plant R zzso their structure, function and evolution, and the role they play in plant innate zzso
