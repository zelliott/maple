zzso leg development requires the cooperation of two zzso signals, zzso zzso and zzso zzso to form the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are also required to pattern the zzso zzso axis of the zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes expressed at different positions along the zzso zzso are activated by zzso signaling and zzso by zzso zzso a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The levels of both zzso and zzso determine which of these zzso genes is zzso Surprisingly, zzso does not play a role in zzso axis zzso in the leg, suggesting that zzso uses two distinct mechanisms for generating the zzso and zzso zzso Based on these results, we present a model for how zzso and zzso which are present as zzso and zzso zzso respectively, induce nearly circular zzso of gene expression along the zzso zzso
