The clinical application of zzso an exceptionally good zzso agent, is limited by its zzso zzso Our recent study showed that tumor necrosis zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso signaling against zzso zzso injury and zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the potential targets of zzso zzso zzso signaling by global zzso zzso analysis using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso treatment induced the zzso of several zzso functions and energy zzso genes in double zzso zzso mice, notably, zzso zzso a protein involved in fatty acid metabolism and calcium zzso The role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso against zzso injury was evaluated by measuring changes in cardiac function using zzso ultrasound zzso Selective zzso of zzso C activity in zzso mice by its zzso zzso exacerbated zzso cardiac zzso zzso of zzso zzso resulted in the significant decrease of left zzso ejection fraction and fractional zzso and the decreased levels were similar to those observed in zzso double zzso zzso zzso The data derived from the global zzso analysis identified zzso zzso as an important target for zzso receptors and revealed the critical role of zzso zzso signaling in the protection against zzso zzso
