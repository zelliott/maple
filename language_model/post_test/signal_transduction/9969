This study was designed to examine whether the zzso improvement in the plasma concentration of zzso bodies in experimental diabetes zzso could be explained by changes in the activity of the zzso zzso body synthesis zzso and/or the plasma free fatty acid zzso Diabetes zzso was induced by an intravenous injection of zzso zzso zzso and training was carried out on a zzso The plasma concentration of zzso acid was increased zzso zzso zzso in sedentary diabetic rats, and this was partly reversed by training zzso zzso zzso The plasma concentration of free fatty acids was increased zzso zzso zzso in sedentary diabetic rats, and this was reversed to normal by training zzso zzso zzso Diabetes was also associated with an increased activity of the zzso zzso body synthesis zzso When the data are expressed as per total liver, physical training decreased the activity of the zzso zzso body synthesis zzso by zzso in zzso rats zzso zzso zzso and by zzso in diabetic rats zzso zzso zzso the activity present in trained diabetic rats being not statistically different from that of sedentary control zzso These data suggest that the beneficial effects of physical training on the plasma zzso acid levels in the diabetic state are probably explained in part by a decrease in the activity of the zzso zzso body synthesis zzso and in part by a decrease in plasma free fatty acid zzso
