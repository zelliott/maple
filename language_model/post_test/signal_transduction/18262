The zzso domain zzso zzso is characterized by a zzso I motif in the zzso domain, an unusually long zzso zzso zzso region, and a zzso domain that is zzso identical to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso also has a major zzso form, which has a 37 zzso acid insert in the zzso region with a consensus zzso zzso site that is lacking in the shorter zzso One class of zzso for the zzso receptors has recently been identified as being derived from the collagen family, but neither native zzso cells, which express modest amounts of zzso nor zzso zzso cells, which express much larger amounts of zzso respond to this zzso A zzso zzso containing the zzso domain of zzso fused to the zzso and zzso regions of zzso also fails to mediate zzso differentiation in zzso zzso zzso cells and is only zzso zzso However, zzso zzso which are composed of combinations of zzso regions from zzso and zzso (with the zzso domain of zzso in some cases provided zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Those with the zzso zzso domain and the zzso zzso regions were able to produce differentiation to varying degrees, whereas the opposite combination did zzso Analysis of the signaling responses of the two zzso with zzso zzso sequences (with and without the zzso indicated that the shorter sequence bound and activated zzso whereas the zzso form activated zzso zzso Both activated zzso through the zzso zzso of the zzso domain zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of this site zzso eliminated zzso zzso zzso there are no other cryptic binding sites for zzso in the zzso zzso and markedly reduced the zzso activity of the zzso This is in contrast to zzso (or zzso zzso where zzso of this zzso has no notable effect on zzso cell zzso zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso and zzso (leading to zzso zzso is weaker in the zzso zzso than in zzso alone, and the zzso contribution becomes essential for full zzso Nonetheless, both zzso zzso regions contain potentially usable signaling sites, albeit they apparently are not activated directly in zzso (or zzso zzso in a zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso receptors do have signaling capacity but may require additional components or altered conditions to fully activate their zzso zzso and/or sustain the zzso of the zzso zzso
