zzso zzso zzso the growth of nervous and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso are the main cell zzso involved in liver zzso display molecular markers of zzso cells and respond to zzso 

To evaluate the role of zzso zzso on liver zzso 

zzso rat zzso zzso zzso were used to evaluate cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso zzso Liver zzso was induced in rats by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso receptors showed a different pattern of expression when measured in zzso and activated (in zzso and in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso receptors increased zzso proliferation and collagen zzso zzso zzso stimulation induced a zzso protein zzso C alpha zzso zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso the effect of zzso zzso on zzso proliferation and collagen zzso In zzso rats, the zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso muscle zzso expression (as a marker of zzso zzso and collagen deposition, both measured by zzso after 5 weeks of zzso In both zzso rats and human liver zzso from chronic liver diseases, zzso receptors were observed in zzso in area of active zzso The zzso zzso zzso increased its expression in zone 3 zzso close to the area of necrosis after zzso administration and in the cellular target of chronic liver injury in human zzso and zzso zzso proliferation and collagen zzso 

zzso zzso released during chronic liver injury participate in the process of liver zzso by stimulating zzso proliferation and collagen production in a zzso zzso
