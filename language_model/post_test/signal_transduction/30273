Light and zzso zzso mediate many essential and partially overlapping plant zzso zzso zzso proteins are zzso zzso that block zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation of zzso proteins via the zzso pathway, but light promotes zzso of zzso proteins by reducing zzso zzso It was proposed that zzso proteins restrain plant growth largely through their effect on gene zzso However, the precise mechanism of their function in zzso zzso zzso and gene expression remains zzso Here we characterize a nuclear protein interaction cascade zzso zzso of zzso signals to the activity regulation of a zzso zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso zzso proteins accumulate to higher levels, interact with zzso factor 3 zzso a zzso zzso zzso and prevent zzso from binding to its target gene promoters and regulating gene zzso and therefore abrogate zzso light control of zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso elevate their direct interaction with zzso proteins in the nucleus, trigger zzso zzso zzso and zzso degradation, and thus release zzso from the negative effect of zzso zzso
