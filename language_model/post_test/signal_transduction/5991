We previously demonstrated that delivery of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso induced an innate zzso zzso state that protected against zzso challenge with zzso zzso virus zzso We report that zzso but not zzso delivery of zzso for zzso zzso zzso but not zzso induced protection against zzso zzso challenge that was not accompanied by the local inflammation and zzso seen after treatment with zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was shown to be higher than that of zzso or zzso in zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso cells were shown to express more zzso for zzso than zzso or zzso yet treatment of these cells with zzso zzso provided greater protection than zzso or zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso a more potent zzso response than zzso and zzso zzso and may be a safer means of protecting against sexually transmitted viral zzso
