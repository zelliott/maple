The physical attributes of the zzso zzso play a key role in zzso function by modulating the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Despite the recognized importance of zzso zzso it is currently not known how the arrangement of adhesive zzso affects the zzso signal zzso zzso and migration of zzso zzso We aimed to study how zzso cells respond to the average spatial arrangement of zzso zzso We designed zzso silicon surfaces with average spacing ranging from zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso acid zzso We found that zzso cells zzso to and spread on surfaces independently of zzso zzso In contrast, organization within focal zzso zzso was extremely sensitive to zzso zzso requiring a zzso average zzso spacing of 44 zzso to form zzso raft zzso at zzso The localized membrane organization strongly correlated with the signaling efficiencies of zzso zzso and regulated vascular zzso growth factor zzso signaling zzso zzso this zzso in signal zzso directly affected the migratory ability of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso cells sense zzso variations in the spacing of zzso zzso which in turn influences signal zzso zzso Average zzso spacing similar to that found in zzso leads to zzso raft zzso at zzso enhances sensitivity to zzso zzso and controls migration in zzso zzso
