zzso cells contain specialized storage zzso called zzso bodies zzso that release their content into the vascular zzso in response to specific zzso that raise zzso zzso or zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso release is dependent on protein zzso A zzso and involves zzso of the small zzso zzso Here, we have investigated a possible role for another zzso zzso signaling zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso namely the zzso zzso exchange factor zzso and its zzso the small zzso zzso zzso stimulation of zzso cells leads to zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso abolished zzso zzso of zzso and resulted in decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression and prevention of zzso zzso through zzso of zzso effectively reduced zzso but not zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these data uncover a new zzso zzso by which zzso cells can regulate zzso zzso in response to zzso that signal through zzso
