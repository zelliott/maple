zzso a zzso zzso zzso among zzso coupled receptors zzso and zzso receptors zzso was examined in the present report for its significance in zzso zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso zzso Computer modeling zzso that this site in zzso may be involved in the affinity of zzso and zzso through aromatic zzso In the present study, we reported that a zzso zzso zzso zzso which had a zzso zzso substitution for zzso zzso retained the binding affinity for CB zzso zzso but reduced binding affinity for zzso zzso zzso and inverse zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso significantly affect the binding activities of zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso production was dramatically diminished in the zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso zzso resulted in complete elimination of downstream zzso suggesting that zzso was essential for the full zzso of zzso These results indicate that both aromatic interaction and hydrogen bonding are involved in zzso binding for the zzso zzso and the zzso of this zzso site may affect the zzso of the zzso binding pocket and therefore control the active zzso of the wild type zzso zzso zzso zzso also displayed noticeable enhancement of the zzso zzso probably attributed to the zzso zzso changes resulted from the zzso
