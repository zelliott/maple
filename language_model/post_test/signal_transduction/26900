zzso is a locally aggressive benign zzso derived from zzso zzso with high recurrence zzso zzso in the Sonic zzso signaling pathway, including zzso gene zzso have been associated with the zzso of some zzso zzso The purpose of the present study was to assess loss of zzso at the zzso locus in zzso Twelve zzso were included, and loss of zzso was assessed by using 3 zzso markers zzso zzso and zzso and 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all located at the zzso gene zzso Furthermore, we investigated zzso and zzso zzso levels by quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain reaction in 8 zzso and, zzso zzso protein levels by zzso zzso Loss of zzso at zzso was detected in 4 zzso of 10 zzso cases of zzso All 8 analyzed samples expressed zzso zzso zzso and 7 cases zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, loss of zzso at the zzso locus was not correlated with zzso or zzso zzso levels, nor was there any correlation with zzso protein zzso In conclusion, our findings suggest that loss of zzso in the zzso region may be relevant to the zzso of zzso but may target a different gene than zzso
