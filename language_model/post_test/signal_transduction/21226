A zzso zzso zzso is known to bind directly to the cell surface through its central portion and to act as a signaling zzso for zzso zzso zzso several zzso zzso and synthetic zzso we identified the cellular recognition sequence of zzso in the central portion of this zzso zzso acids zzso zzso termed zzso zzso Interestingly, although a model cell type bound to the zzso as strong as to the full-length zzso this zzso itself didn't induce the cellular functional responses so far zzso We found that the zzso behaved as an zzso for the zzso zzso and severely zzso lung branching zzso in organ zzso These results not only revealed a part of the functional mechanism of zzso but also demonstrated that zzso zzso interaction through the zzso sequence is a critical step for lung zzso zzso
