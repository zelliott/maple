All cells have the capacity to evoke appropriate and measured responses to signal molecules (such as zzso zzso environmental changes, and other external zzso zzso progress has been made in identifying the proteins that mediate cellular response to such signals and in zzso how events at the cell surface are linked to subsequent zzso changes in the zzso and zzso An emerging area of investigation concerns how signaling components are assembled and regulated (both zzso and zzso so as to control properly the specificity and intensity of a given signaling zzso A related question under intensive study is how the action of an individual signaling zzso is integrated with (or insulated zzso other pathways to constitute larger networks that control overall cell behavior zzso This review describes the signal zzso zzso used by budding zzso zzso zzso to respond to its zzso mating zzso This zzso is comprised by zzso a zzso G zzso and a protein zzso cascade all remarkably similar to counterparts in zzso zzso The primary focus of this review, however, is recent advances that have been made, using primarily genetic methods, in identifying molecules responsible for regulation of the action of the components of this signaling zzso Just as many of the constituent proteins of this zzso and their zzso were first identified in zzso the functions of some of these regulators have clearly been zzso in zzso and others will likely serve as additional models for molecules that carry out analogous roles in higher zzso
