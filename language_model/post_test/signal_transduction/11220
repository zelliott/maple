To investigate the effect of maternal dietary omega-3 zzso fatty acid zzso zzso and zzso on food appetite zzso 

zzso rat zzso were maintained on diets either supplemented with zzso or deficient in zzso omega-3 zzso All offspring were raised on the maternal diet until zzso After zzso two groups remained on the respective maternal diet zzso and zzso zzso whereas a third group, born of zzso fed the zzso diet, were switched to the zzso diet zzso zzso on food intake began when the male rats reached 16 weeks of zzso Food intake was zzso either by a period of food zzso by blocking zzso zzso (by zzso zzso or by blocking zzso of fatty acids (by zzso zzso 

zzso animals consumed more than zzso animals in response to all zzso with the greatest difference zzso demonstrated following administration of zzso zzso animals also consumed more than zzso animals in response to food restriction and zzso but not to zzso 

These findings indicate that supply of omega-3 zzso particularly during the zzso period, plays a role in the normal development of mechanisms controlling food zzso especially zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso appetite zzso zzso zzso of omega-3 zzso from 3 weeks of age restored intake responses to fatty acid zzso signaling but did not reverse those in response to food restriction or zzso zzso
