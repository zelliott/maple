A key role for zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso in the zzso patterning of early zzso is well zzso The regulation and role of zzso signaling in zzso embryonic zzso however, is less well zzso While a variety of zzso zzso zzso are implicated in various stages of zzso zzso the zzso zzso has been shown to have a particular role in zzso patterning in the zzso Mouse zzso is specifically localized to the developing tail and is essential for normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is inhibited by its own zzso and zzso zzso of this zzso is thought to be necessary for zzso zzso The contribution of this zzso regulatory mechanism to zzso zzso during zzso in zzso and to the development of zzso pattern, has not been zzso We investigate here the role of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso during the development of zzso zzso and the role of this zzso in zzso zzso We also demonstrate that the activity of zzso zzso is necessary for the normal zzso zzso of zzso zzso during zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso has a central role in the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso stage zzso zzso and provide the first evidence that zzso zzso zzso is important for zzso of zzso in zzso
