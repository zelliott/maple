zzso signaling and zzso genes pattern cell fate along the zzso axis in many zzso In general, zzso signaling zzso in establishing the zzso zzso whereas zzso genes zzso regional identities to cells along the zzso However, recent work in zzso zzso suggests that the ancestral patterning system relied on zzso with a later zzso of zzso genes to replace zzso in regional zzso Here we provide direct experimental support for this model from zzso zzso where a regional zzso patterning system is uncovered in zzso gene zzso zzso patterning of zzso cell fate in the zzso zzso tail is normally dependent on the zzso gene zzso If the zzso gene zzso zzso is also zzso however, a zzso signal can promote zzso fate in the absence of zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso in the zzso cell is influenced by an zzso element that is essential in wild type, but not in zzso zzso double zzso identifying regulatory parallels between zzso cell fate zzso and zzso zzso regulation in the zzso zzso Together, our results identify complex regulatory relationships among signaling pathways and zzso zzso and uncover a layering of patterning systems that may reflect their evolutionary zzso
