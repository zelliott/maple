zzso zzso is the most common acquired diffuse disorder of the peripheral nervous zzso It is generally assumed that insulin benefits human and experimental diabetic zzso indirectly by lowering zzso zzso zzso also provides potent direct support of zzso and zzso and there is a possibility that abnormalities in direct insulin signaling on peripheral zzso relate to the development of this zzso Here we report that direct zzso zzso delivery of low doses of insulin zzso zzso daily), insufficient to reduce zzso or zzso zzso but not zzso saline or subcutaneous insulin, improved and reversed slowing of motor and sensory zzso zzso in rats rendered diabetic using zzso Moreover, insulin and zzso similarly reversed zzso in zzso sensory zzso in the zzso zzso That zzso insulin had the capability of signaling sensory zzso was confirmed by observing that zzso zzso insulin given zzso zzso and labeled individual zzso zzso root zzso zzso Moreover, we confirmed that such zzso express the insulin zzso as previously suggested by zzso et zzso Finally, we zzso zzso insulin in zzso rats using an zzso zzso zzso slowing and zzso zzso resembling the changes in diabetes were generated by zzso but not by an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso direct signaling of insulin on peripheral zzso through routes that include the zzso fluid may relate to the development of diabetic peripheral zzso
