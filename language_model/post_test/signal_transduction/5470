To explore the effect and mechanism of Poly zzso in inducing growth zzso and zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cells were treated with different doses of Poly zzso for 24, 48, and 72 zzso and the cell growth zzso rate was analyzed with zzso zzso The cell cycle and the zzso were analyzed using flow zzso with zzso and zzso zzso and quantitative zzso analysis were used to detect the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso 

In the cells exposed to Poly zzso at low, moderate, and high doses, the zzso rates was the highest in high-dose Poly zzso group, and at a given Poly zzso dose, prolonged exposure resulted in significantly increased cell growth zzso rate zzso zzso zzso showed that Poly zzso induced cell zzso in a zzso and zzso manner and significantly increased the percentage of zzso cells as compared with that in the control zzso The zzso level of zzso zzso and zzso were also increased following Poly zzso treatment in comparison with the control zzso 

Poly zzso can induce significant growth zzso and zzso of zzso cells in a zzso and zzso manner possibly by causing cell cycle arrest and zzso signaling zzso zzso that leads to zzso production and cell zzso
