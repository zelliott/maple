zzso zzso is a recently described zzso that appears to play a critical role in a variety of inflammatory diseases including chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso However, thus far, the regulation of zzso production has not been fully zzso Here, we report on signaling pathways that regulate the production of zzso the most abundant zzso in the human zzso zzso cell line, zzso zzso was expressed and zzso by zzso The zzso expression was attenuated by zzso (a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (a protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso rather than other zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso small interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The suppression of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso a well-known zzso signaling zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso also inhibited expression of zzso and zzso of zzso but not of zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed the expression of zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not of zzso Of interest, both zzso and zzso signals regulated zzso suggesting that it is a zzso zzso Among zzso zzso zzso only zzso regulated zzso expression and zzso zzso With these results, we demonstrated that the expression and zzso of zzso are regulated by zzso zzso and independent zzso zzso and that zzso and zzso are critical for the zzso zzso zzso
