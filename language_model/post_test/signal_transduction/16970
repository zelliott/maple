zzso zzso is a worldwide zzso zzso in zzso Although extensive studies on zzso toxicity have been conducted using in zzso and in zzso models, the exact molecular mechanism of zzso toxicity remains zzso Here, the zzso zzso analysis of gene zzso sequencing technology was used to zzso zzso response to zzso exposure at the zzso zzso Based on more than 12 million zzso tags mapped to zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso were identified from a relatively abundant transcripts zzso zzso zzso per zzso based on minimal zzso zzso By gene zzso zzso these zzso expressed genes were significantly enriched in several major biological processes including zzso reduction, translation, iron zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso the main pathways disturbed include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer, zzso zzso zzso Analysis further revealed a network with four important upstream factors or hub zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso The network indicated apparent molecular events involved in zzso stress, zzso and zzso In order to identify potential zzso genes for zzso exposure, 27 out of 29 zzso transcripts were validated by zzso analysis in pooled zzso zzso Among these, 14 transcripts were further confirmed for zzso by a lower dosage of zzso in majority of individual zzso Finally, at least four of these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso carrier family 40 zzso zzso member 1) could be confirmed in individual zzso fish similarly treated by zzso thus, these four genes might be robust zzso zzso across zzso Thus, our work represents the first comprehensive investigation of molecular mechanism of zzso toxicity and zzso search for potential zzso for zzso zzso
