The zzso zzso control many cellular zzso Here, we show that zzso inhibit calcium zzso cell zzso and subsequent cell detachment of zzso skeletal muscle zzso The mechanism underlying the cell detachment zzso was studied by using a quantitative cell detachment zzso We demonstrate that cell detachment induced by depletion of zzso calcium is due to zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso skeletal muscle cell detachment was shown to be zzso by the zzso and increased zzso but was surprisingly not dependent on the classical downstream zzso zzso or zzso nor was it dependent on zzso zzso or zzso However, zzso of zzso channels blocks the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso channels fully zzso the results of zzso zzso In conclusion, we present a novel finding that zzso signaling zzso zzso and thus cell detachment in zzso skeletal muscle cells by a zzso and zzso channel dependent zzso
