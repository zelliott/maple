Although experimental animal and clinical trials have suggested that additional mechanisms other than protein zzso C zzso zzso are involved in the vascular pathology of diabetic zzso current knowledge on the role of zzso is incomplete and zzso Human zzso vein zzso cells zzso were cultured in both high and normal zzso conditions and infected with zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso expression was also zzso using the zzso zzso zzso Using flow zzso analysis, we showed that zzso is activated and zzso to the nucleus under high zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and cell cycle arrest were observed in a zzso manner in the zzso Furthermore, zzso analyses identified 51 high zzso and zzso zzso and subsequent zzso laser zzso time of flight mass zzso analysis uncovered a total of 37 unique zzso The majority of identified proteins were previously unknown targets of zzso signaling and were involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and zzso tumor suppression, transcription, stress and signal zzso within the zzso Our data show that zzso is an important zzso of cell zzso and cell cycle arrest in zzso under high zzso zzso
