zzso a natural zzso analog of zzso is known to have diverse zzso activities including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the effects of zzso in preventing invasion of cancer cells have not been zzso Here, we report our finding that zzso significantly suppressed zzso zzso zzso invasion, migration and zzso of human zzso cells zzso zzso zzso in the zzso activity, protein and zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso were observed in zzso zzso cells, and these were blocked by zzso In addition, zzso can inhibit zzso expression of vascular zzso growth factor, zzso growth factor and zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso experiments also showed that zzso strongly inhibited zzso nuclear factor zzso B zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso can suppress zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1/2, zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 and zzso zzso and protein zzso C that are upstream of zzso and zzso zzso therapeutic effects were further demonstrated in zzso by treating nude mice with zzso zzso and 250 zzso zzso after zzso with zzso cells into the tail zzso Presented data reveal that zzso is a novel, effective, zzso agent that functions by zzso zzso gene zzso
