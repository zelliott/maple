In zzso the patterning of zzso (AP) axis is a fundamental process during zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathways play important roles in regulating the patterning of zzso zzso zzso Mouse zzso encodes a zzso factor that has been demonstrated to be involved in the zzso of the zzso tissue in mouse embryonic zzso Here, we prove that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso development, indicating the requirement of zzso in this zzso Meanwhile, gain of zzso function is sufficient to induce zzso zzso structures in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso activates the expression of zzso and zzso which are two zzso of zzso development, suggesting a mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso patterning via zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
