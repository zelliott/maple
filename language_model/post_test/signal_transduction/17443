zzso is a life-threatening pregnancy zzso However, its zzso remains zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso zzso symptoms via heightened zzso zzso zzso zzso pregnant and zzso rats were divided into zzso and hypoxic zzso zzso from the zzso day zzso zzso zzso zzso had no significant effect on blood pressure or zzso in zzso rats but significantly increased blood pressure on day 12 zzso blood pressure, zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and day 20 zzso blood pressure, zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in pregnant rats and urine protein zzso zzso ratio on day 20 zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared with the zzso control zzso This was accompanied with zzso fetal growth zzso zzso resulted in impaired zzso invasion and zzso vascular zzso In addition, plasma zzso levels, as well as the abundance of zzso zzso zzso type A zzso and zzso II type 1 zzso protein in the kidney and zzso were significantly increased in the chronic hypoxic group, as compared with the control zzso Treatment with the zzso type A zzso zzso zzso during the course of zzso exposure significantly attenuated the zzso hypertension and other zzso zzso The results demonstrate that chronic zzso during gestation zzso zzso symptoms in pregnant rats via heightened zzso and zzso type A zzso zzso providing a molecular mechanism linking zzso zzso and increased risk of zzso
