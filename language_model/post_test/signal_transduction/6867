The precise regulation of zzso maintenance is critical to the development and function of zzso zzso Using an in zzso zzso screen targeting the zzso zzso and zzso we identify 11 zzso and zzso controlling zzso stability by regulating zzso zzso or zzso zzso We focus on zzso zzso 2 zzso and demonstrate that the regulatory zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso are essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is required in the zzso zzso and its interaction with zzso zzso zzso by two zzso zzso of zzso is essential for zzso zzso complex stability and function in zzso Using genetic and zzso approaches we identify zzso as a key zzso target of zzso to maintain zzso zzso In addition, zzso activity controls the zzso organization of individual synaptic release sites within the zzso nerve zzso Our study identifies zzso of structural synaptic components as a compelling mechanism to actively control the development and longevity of synaptic zzso
