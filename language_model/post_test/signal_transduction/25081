zzso from several laboratories have suggested that zzso factors known as zzso may play roles zzso changes in synaptic activity to lasting changes in synaptic zzso zzso with this idea, increases in synaptic activity and zzso calcium induce the expression of the gene that encodes the zzso zzso zzso zzso Recently, a zzso has been zzso in zzso by which the influx of zzso calcium evokes zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso activates zzso zzso through two adjacent calcium response elements within one of the promoters of the zzso zzso One of the two elements binds to the zzso zzso zzso zzso response element binding protein zzso zzso factor, and interfering with zzso or related family members zzso zzso zzso zzso This review focuses on the mechanisms by which calcium influx regulates zzso zzso factor expression and the implications that these results have for potential roles of zzso in synaptic zzso
