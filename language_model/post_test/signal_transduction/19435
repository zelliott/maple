zzso proteins are regulated by zzso of the most zzso zzso zzso switching them from an activated to an zzso zzso However, little is known about the control of this zzso Previous work in our group demonstrated that zzso of acid zzso acts upstream of zzso zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso To define the role of specific zzso we employed zzso bacterial zzso zzso as a direct probe of zzso metabolism at the plasma zzso zzso induced a rapid zzso and zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso was driven by zzso generation and not by zzso zzso as shown using zzso zzso zzso The generation of zzso at the plasma membrane was sufficient for zzso regulation, and no zzso zzso zzso was required, as was zzso using zzso zzso probe, which specifically binds zzso Interestingly, zzso of plasma membrane zzso zzso using bacterial zzso caused zzso zzso and formation of cell surface zzso The effects of plasma membrane zzso zzso were due to zzso zzso formation, as zzso zzso was blocked by an inhibitor of zzso zzso and induced by zzso zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate a new regulatory mechanism of zzso zzso by zzso with opposing actions of zzso and zzso zzso The approach also defines a tool kit to probe zzso signaling at the plasma zzso
