zzso of the transforming growth factor zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling zzso is a common mechanism for zzso growth of head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso zzso protein of 85 zzso zzso is an zzso protein that zzso zzso zzso Little is known, however, about a role of zzso in zzso signaling as well as its relevance to tumor development and progression of zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso is highly expressed in zzso tumor samples compared with adjacent normal zzso and this zzso is significantly correlated with advanced clinical zzso The experiments using zzso and zzso zzso cell lines showed that zzso promotes zzso growth and zzso zzso zzso without apparently affecting zzso of zzso Moreover, zzso promoted zzso zzso of Ras and zzso of downstream molecules such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso leading to expression of zzso that is critical for sustained proliferation of zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso not only controls zzso zzso but also promotes the zzso tumor development and zzso and thus, zzso may serve as a potential therapeutic target in a subset of zzso
