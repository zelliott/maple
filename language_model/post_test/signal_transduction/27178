zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression is an important zzso of zzso zzso zzso We have zzso the bovine adrenal zzso zzso coding region using zzso designed from the published bovine zzso zzso zzso This has been used as a probe on Northern blots to detect changes in the levels of zzso zzso zzso in primary cultures of bovine zzso zzso cells in response to zzso of several different signal zzso mechanisms in addition to two major adrenal steroid products, cortisol and zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased in response to zzso zzso (10 zzso treatment, but returned to zzso levels following zzso zzso zzso This effect was zzso by the zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso and the calcium zzso zzso (1 zzso both zzso and in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso (1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso also decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, both IGF-1 (10 zzso and zzso zzso (12 zzso increased the levels of zzso zzso zzso Finally, cortisol (10 zzso but not zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso We conclude that the regulation of zzso zzso zzso in bovine zzso zzso cells could involve several different signal zzso systems in addition to zzso steroids zzso
