Many zzso pathogens link the expression of zzso genes to the presence of carbon source zzso using overlapping pathways for global control of carbon zzso zzso However, how these pathways are integrated to control the behavior of the zzso in zzso and zzso patterns is typically not well zzso In the present study, global zzso profiling was used to determine the extent to which zzso alters gene expression in zzso zzso zzso A zzso and the contributions of the zzso and zzso zzso control pathways to the regulation of this response in zzso This analysis revealed that the expression of as many as zzso of the genes examined was regulated and that zzso and zzso together contribute to the regulation of zzso of this zzso However, numerous patterns were observed, including both zzso and zzso and independent regulation, zzso and regulation of genes by these pathways independently of zzso In addition, zzso and zzso had zzso effects on most zzso zzso To resolve the roles of these regulators during infection, the expression of selected transcripts representative of different regulatory patterns was examined in a zzso model of soft tissue zzso This revealed distinct patterns of zzso with respect to time in zzso versus zzso zzso Taken together, these data support an important role for zzso in the regulation of the zzso in tissue and suggest that the zzso and zzso pathways are organized to function at different times during the course of an zzso
