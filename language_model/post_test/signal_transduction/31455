The importance of the initial zzso pool in fertility in female adult zzso has recently been zzso zzso a mathematical model of the dynamics of zzso progression zzso to primary to zzso we examined whether the initial zzso pool is sufficient for adult fertility through zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in each stage were counted from zzso day 6 through 12 months and data were fit to a series of zzso differential equations representing two zzso an initial pool of primordial zzso as the only zzso source zzso pool zzso or an initial primordial zzso pool supplemented by zzso stem cells zzso cell zzso The fixed pool model fit the experimental data, accurately representing the maximum observed primary zzso number reached by 4-6 months of zzso Although no zzso stem cells could be identified by zzso zzso the stem cell model was tested using a range of de zzso primordial zzso production zzso The stem cell model failed to describe the observed decreases in zzso over time and did not parallel the zzso and subsequent reduction in primary zzso during the early fertile lifespan of the zzso Our results agree with established dogma that the initial endowment of zzso zzso is not supplemented by an appreciable number of stem zzso rather, it is sufficient to ensure the fertility needs of the adult zzso
