Biological pathways are structured in complex networks of interacting zzso zzso the architecture of such networks may provide valuable information, such as how zzso cause zzso Here we present a method zzso for accurately determining quantitative genetic interactions on a zzso scale in zzso zzso is based on the assembly of a saturated zzso zzso zzso zzso After library selection, changes in frequency of each zzso zzso are determined by sequencing the zzso regions en zzso These changes are used to calculate each zzso zzso Using this approach, we determined fitness for each gene of zzso pneumoniae, a zzso agent of pneumonia and zzso A zzso screen for genetic interactions of five query genes identified both alleviating and zzso interactions that could be divided into seven distinct zzso zzso to the wide activity of the zzso zzso zzso has the potential to contribute to the exploration of complex pathways across many different zzso
