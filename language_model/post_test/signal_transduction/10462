zzso immunity is triggered at the immune zzso where zzso zzso complexes and zzso molecules expressed by zzso cells zzso are physically presented to T zzso Here we describe transmission of the inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso between these zzso zzso take up zzso from the zzso and from activated T cells zzso zzso zzso and this zzso is inhibited by the antidepressant, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is regulated by DC zzso exposure to microbial zzso and physical interactions with T zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso is stored within zzso zzso and subsequently released via zzso zzso which was confirmed by zzso zzso In turn, zzso zzso can reduce zzso levels of zzso a zzso of zzso zzso Thus, through the zzso of zzso at sites of zzso and from activated T cells, zzso may shuttle zzso to zzso T cells and thereby zzso zzso proliferation and zzso These data constitute the first direct measurement of triggered zzso by zzso and reveal a new and rapid type of signaling that may be zzso by the intimate synaptic environment between zzso and T zzso Moreover, these results highlight an important role for zzso signaling in immune function and the potential consequences of commonly used drugs that target zzso zzso and zzso
