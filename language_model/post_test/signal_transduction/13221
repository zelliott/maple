zzso zzso proteins zzso serve as important regulators of zzso organization and zzso These modular zzso which are zzso among zzso species, act to promote zzso filament assembly in response to cues from various signal zzso zzso zzso analysis has revealed a requirement for the single zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso decisions governing specific zzso zzso We have used this unique zzso context to assess the contributions of established signaling and zzso partners of zzso We present zzso and genetic evidence that, as expected, zzso zzso performs its zzso role via the zzso complex, indicating conservation of the zzso aspect of zzso function in zzso In contrast, we find that association with the key signaling molecules zzso and zzso is not an essential requirement, zzso that zzso of zzso function in zzso depends on additional or alternative signaling zzso
