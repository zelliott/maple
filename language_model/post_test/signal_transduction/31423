When subjected to zzso cells from the vascular compartment show a spontaneous collapse of the plasma membrane zzso asymmetry and zzso is exposed at the external zzso Thus, zzso zzso is essential for normal zzso and zzso The mechanism governing the migration of zzso to the zzso leaflet is not yet fully zzso We have proposed that zzso calcium entry zzso constitutes a key step of this zzso Here, interaction of zzso zzso and zzso pathways and zzso exposure was examined in human zzso zzso The membrane permeable zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso enhanced the zzso signal induced by zzso and zzso zzso to zzso and zzso were independent of protein zzso A, protein zzso G zzso or zzso zzso zzso of small zzso reduced or abolished the increase of zzso induced by zzso or zzso zzso zzso but not zzso enhanced the ability of cells to expose zzso This effect was not prevented by the zzso of zzso or small zzso These results show the differential role of zzso zzso in the zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso is another regulatory element for the completion of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells through a mechanism implicating small zzso
