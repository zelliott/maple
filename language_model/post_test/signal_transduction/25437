zzso plays a key role in zzso zzso synaptic plasticity and zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso which mediate the cellular actions of zzso are expressed in the zzso and other zzso regions, but their functional significance remains zzso Here, we report a novel role of zzso as crucial zzso in the development of zzso which is the process zzso a normal brain becomes progressively zzso because of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso which lacks both the zzso and zzso zzso exhibited an increased resistance to zzso in the zzso and zzso kindling zzso Lack of zzso markedly impaired the persistence of seizure expression at 4 weeks after kindling zzso We further show that selective zzso of zzso in the brain by zzso zzso or pharmacological blockade of zzso by zzso zzso resulted in a significant decrease in zzso in zzso zzso zzso The delayed zzso in zzso zzso mice was not substantially affected by zzso of zzso zzso Mice lacking zzso show zzso to the zzso responses of zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso in the zzso are linked to signaling pathways that control zzso to zzso and possibly persistence of an zzso zzso The zzso zzso may represent a unique target for preventing or zzso zzso in zzso
