zzso zzso zzso is among the most common and lethal zzso worldwide with a poor prognosis mainly due to a high recurrence rate and chemotherapy zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso drug that has been effectively used as an zzso drug in acute zzso zzso However, a Phase II trial involving patients with zzso indicates that the use of zzso as a single agent is not effective against zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that interferes with zzso zzso growth zzso zzso which plays a zzso role in zzso In the present study, we demonstrated that zzso induced zzso zzso via zzso zzso and led to downstream induction of zzso zzso However, zzso could also induce zzso expression via a zzso regulation mechanism to antagonize this zzso Using a zzso zzso probe pull-down zzso and in zzso zzso zzso analysis, we identified that zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and prevented it from zzso zzso treatment increased the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso and reduction of zzso expression inhibited zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to mediate the zzso regulation of zzso in response to zzso Finally, we also demonstrated that the zzso of zzso could sensitize zzso zzso cell zzso zzso we propose that the zzso zzso may regulate the zzso regulation of zzso expression to antagonize zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso or zzso expression combined with zzso treatment may be a promising strategy for zzso zzso
