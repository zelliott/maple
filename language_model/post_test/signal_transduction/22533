Here we investigate the structural and functional basis of the interactions between zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Using zzso and pull-down zzso we show that zzso can bind directly a form of zzso that is stabilized upon zzso zzso Moreover, we show that the mechanism by which zzso zzso is able to zzso zzso is by promoting its zzso traffic to a compartment where it is zzso and that this activity depends on zzso
