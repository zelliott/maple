zzso zzso function, zzso and transport are main features of neurodegenerative zzso To date, zzso transport within zzso is thought to rely mainly on zzso whereas zzso might mediate short-range movements and zzso zzso Here, we analyzed the impact of zzso on zzso zzso size and zzso zzso enhanced zzso size and zzso number in zzso and growth zzso In contrast, raising zzso resulted in zzso fragmentation and decreased zzso zzso Cellular zzso levels also regulate serum response factor zzso gene regulation, suggesting a possible link between zzso and zzso zzso Indeed, zzso zzso display neurodegenerative hallmarks of zzso including disrupted zzso zzso and impaired zzso zzso as well as zzso energy zzso zzso zzso active zzso induced formation of zzso networks and rescued zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso and zzso dynamics are connected via the zzso severing protein zzso and its zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso our data suggest that the zzso signaling axis zzso zzso zzso zzso
