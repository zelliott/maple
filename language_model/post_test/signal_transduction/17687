zzso growth factors beta zzso and zzso zzso zzso both participate in growth and differentiation of the developing zzso secondary zzso and elicit similar biological zzso zzso between these two signal zzso pathways in cells derived from the embryonic zzso has been demonstrated zzso In the present study, we have examined nuclear convergence of these zzso pathways at the level of zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso a consensus zzso binding element zzso or a zzso zzso response element zzso were mixed with cell extracts from zzso embryonic zzso zzso zzso cells that were treated with either zzso or zzso zzso complexes were zzso with zzso and zzso by Western zzso to identify proteins in the complex bound to each consensus zzso zzso treatment of zzso cells increased the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso response element binding protein zzso and the zzso zzso binding protein zzso that were part of a complex bound to the zzso Treatment of cells with zzso a zzso of zzso zzso increased the amount of zzso zzso and zzso but not the amount of zzso zzso bound in a complex to the zzso Additionally, the presence of the zzso zzso and zzso was demonstrated as part of a complex bound to the zzso (but not the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso found in the zzso complex increased in response to either zzso or zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso forms a complex with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso on a consensus zzso This suggests cooperative regulation of genes with zzso promoters by the zzso and zzso zzso pathways in the developing zzso
