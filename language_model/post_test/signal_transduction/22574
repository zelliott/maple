Nuclear receptors have been zzso to regulate gene expression via their association with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso We report that hormone zzso dramatic zzso at zzso target genes through the zzso activity of zzso zzso this zzso is transient and zzso with zzso of zzso gene zzso In exploring the underlying zzso we found that the zzso zzso can be zzso by zzso The zzso zzso the positive charges of two zzso zzso adjacent to the core zzso motif and zzso the association of zzso zzso complexes with zzso zzso zzso These results provide strong in zzso evidence that zzso zzso plays a key role in zzso gene zzso and define zzso zzso as a novel regulatory mechanism in hormonal zzso
