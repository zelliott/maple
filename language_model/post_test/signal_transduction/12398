The most recently characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed zzso in the bone zzso raising the question of its role during zzso Here we show that both zzso and human zzso cell populations express this zzso zzso on zzso and protein levels and respond to its zzso by reduced growth zzso cell cycle progression that leads to decreased zzso zzso and zzso colony zzso zzso zzso prevents the induction of cell cycle genes through a zzso zzso that is not associated with zzso It is zzso specifically through zzso signaling since gene zzso or treatment with selective zzso restores normal cell cycle zzso The arrest of growth zzso zzso transition protects zzso and human zzso cells from the toxicity of the cell zzso zzso drug zzso in zzso and reduces zzso in a zzso model of zzso This first evidence for functional zzso expression in zzso zzso opens new therapeutic perspectives for alleviating zzso side effects of zzso zzso
