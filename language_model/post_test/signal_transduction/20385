zzso is a zzso syndrome mainly characterized by zzso disorder and zzso after zzso weeks zzso So far the zzso of zzso remains zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso exhibited decreased zzso expression and zzso in promoter region of the zzso imprinted zzso gene compared with normal zzso zzso has recently been identified to zzso the precursor of zzso indicating a possible novel functional zzso of the zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to identify the roles of zzso gene via zzso zzso in human zzso cells, and to figure out the involvement of this zzso in zzso of zzso zzso of zzso gene or zzso of zzso exhibited similar zzso effect in human zzso zzso zzso Target gene prediction in combination with zzso zzso revealed that zzso could directly zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso protein expression by binding to zzso sequence of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells could rescue zzso cell proliferation and zzso of zzso while zzso had additive effect with zzso in suppression cell proliferation and zzso of zzso In zzso zzso zzso expression levels of zzso gene and zzso were appreciably lower, while zzso protein level was higher than those in normal zzso Taken together, our data suggested that zzso gene could inhibit human zzso cell proliferation via zzso zzso that targeted zzso and zzso lowered expression of zzso in zzso may participate in the excessive proliferation of zzso cells observed in zzso severe zzso by zzso zzso which targets zzso and interferes with zzso zzso
