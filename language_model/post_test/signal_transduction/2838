zzso stimulation of the zzso motor zzso zzso the superior zzso and the facial nerve nucleus elicits zzso zzso A possibility of the superior zzso as one of the relay zzso between the zzso and the facial nerve nucleus was investigated by injecting an zzso neural zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into the zzso identified zzso and a retrograde zzso zzso toxin B zzso zzso into the facial nerve nucleus in zzso zzso In the lateral half of the superior zzso the termination field of zzso from the zzso overlapped with the distribution field of projection zzso to the facial nerve zzso In some cases, zzso terminal zzso were closely zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso We conclude that signals descending from the zzso are relayed through the lateral half of the superior zzso to the facial nerve zzso
