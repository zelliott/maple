zzso and zzso clones of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso were loaded with the fluorescent zzso zzso zzso to measure zzso free calcium zzso When the cells were treated with the calcium zzso zzso in the nominal absence of zzso zzso there was an increase of zzso that was further elevated by addition of either zzso zzso or the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso Similar results were obtained when the order of additions was zzso Taking into account the relative importance of the zzso and the zzso plus zzso zzso pools, it is apparent that a significant amount of the zzso stored in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is present in an zzso compartment rich in zzso zzso zzso indicated that more zzso zzso is stored zzso in virulent zzso than in virulent zzso or zzso cells of both zzso This higher amount of zzso zzso was correlated with the presence of zzso signals in the virulent zzso during invasion of zzso zzso signals and invasion were reduced by zzso the zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not by a zzso analog zzso zzso The gene zzso an zzso zzso was cloned and zzso and found zzso in virulent zzso as compared with all other zzso Together, these results demonstrate a significant link between expression of a zzso zzso zzso pool content and zzso and zzso
