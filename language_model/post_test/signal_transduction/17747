We tested the hypothesis that zzso regulates zzso zzso to zzso by zzso the zzso zzso zzso We also tested whether zzso and zzso oxide zzso mediate zzso increases in zzso via the zzso zzso zzso 70 flux across human zzso vein zzso cell zzso served as an index of zzso whereas Western blots assessed the zzso of zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso DNA zzso directed against zzso and by blockade of zzso and zzso activities (20 zzso zzso and 5 zzso zzso These blocking agents also reduced zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso I (10 zzso blocked both zzso zzso zzso and zzso The NO zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the NO scavenger zzso zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso but did not block zzso zzso These observations demonstrate zzso zzso involves zzso of zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, our data suggest that zzso and zzso are elements of different signaling pathways in zzso zzso
