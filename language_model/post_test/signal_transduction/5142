The mechanisms regulating the entry into zzso in zzso germ cells remain incompletely zzso We investigated the involvement of the zzso family members in fetal germ cell zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso family, and its target genes are zzso expressed in embryonic zzso and show sexual zzso in favor of the developing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were identified in male germ zzso zzso itself, zzso and zzso and zzso are targets of zzso signaling and were all found specifically expressed in male germ zzso To zzso the role of this signaling pathway, zzso zzso that mediate zzso signaling were inhibited in zzso d zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso disrupted normal male germ cell development and induced germ cell entry into zzso such as that observed in female germ cells at the equivalent zzso Interestingly zzso the gatekeeper of the zzso switch, was induced independently of any change of either zzso or zzso zzso the two genes currently identified as zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso significantly dampened zzso expression and germ cell zzso in cultured zzso d zzso zzso Our results allowed us to propose for the first time an zzso role of zzso during the development of germ cells and indicate that members of the zzso family may reinforce the male fate and prevent zzso in embryonic germ zzso
