The zzso protein from zzso zzso senses both the zzso and fixed nitrogen status to regulate nitrogen fixation by controlling the activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has a domain architecture similar to that of the zzso zzso protein zzso It contains two zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso region containing a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso binding zzso domain corresponding to the zzso core of the zzso zzso Despite these similarities, zzso does not exhibit zzso activity and regulates its partner zzso by direct zzso interactions rather than zzso zzso senses the zzso status via a zzso zzso located within the zzso domain and responds to the nitrogen status by interaction with the signal zzso protein zzso which binds to the zzso zzso The ability of zzso to inhibit zzso is antagonized by the binding of zzso to the zzso zzso domain of zzso In this study we have performed zzso zzso of the H domain of zzso to examine its role in signal zzso Our results suggest that this domain plays a major role in transmission of signals perceived by the zzso and zzso zzso to ensure that zzso achieves the required zzso necessary to inhibit the zzso form of zzso Some of the zzso discriminate the zzso and fixed nitrogen sensing functions of zzso zzso that the zzso requirements and/or domain interactions necessary for zzso zzso differ with respect to the signal zzso
