zzso zzso are actively recruited to the muscle cell surface upon insulin zzso Key to this process is zzso reorganization of zzso zzso beneath the plasma zzso but the underlying molecular mechanisms have yet to be zzso Using zzso rat skeletal zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso we found that zzso acting downstream of zzso zzso is responsible for the cortical zzso zzso evoked by zzso zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso complex zzso zzso zzso and impaired zzso zzso zzso also led to zzso of the zzso protein zzso on zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso was prevented by strategies zzso remodeled zzso zzso B or zzso zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso zzso drives severing to enact a dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso caused overwhelming zzso zzso that subsequently inhibited zzso zzso This zzso was relieved by zzso zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso that zzso permanent zzso zzso recycling was not affected by depleting zzso or zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso We propose that zzso and zzso coordinate a dynamic cycle of zzso branching and severing at the cell cortex, essential for zzso zzso zzso in muscle zzso
