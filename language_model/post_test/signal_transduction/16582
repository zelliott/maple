zzso zzso or zzso is the founding member of a novel family of inflammatory zzso and emerging evidence indicates that it plays a central role in inflammation and zzso zzso is made primarily, if not exclusively by T cells, but relatively little is known about how its expression is zzso In the present study, we examined the requirements and mechanisms for zzso expression in primary mouse zzso Like many zzso zzso is induced rapidly in primary T cells after stimulation of the T cell zzso zzso through zzso zzso Surprisingly, however, the pattern of regulation of zzso is different in mice than in humans, because zzso of T cells through zzso only mildly enhanced zzso zzso whereas levels of zzso were dramatically zzso Similarly, several other zzso molecules such as zzso zzso and zzso exerted only very weak enhancing effects on zzso zzso In agreement with other reports, zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso However, zzso production can occur autonomously in T cells, as neither zzso cells nor zzso were necessary for promoting short-term production of zzso Finally, to begin to characterize the zzso signaling zzso required for zzso production, we showed that zzso expression is sensitive to zzso and zzso zzso suggesting the involvement of the zzso and zzso signaling zzso
