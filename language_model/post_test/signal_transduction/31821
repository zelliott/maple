It remains unknown whether a zzso zzso mediates sugar zzso Here, we report that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with five members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family, and zzso zzso the interaction between zzso and a zzso member zzso We observed that zzso of zzso and three zzso zzso members zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of seed zzso The zzso zzso double zzso displays slightly stronger zzso zzso than either the zzso or zzso single zzso We showed that the zzso signaling in the zzso zzso of seed zzso does not require zzso or the currently known zzso signaling zzso These data provide evidence that the zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso to positively mediate zzso and zzso signaling in the zzso zzso of seed zzso
