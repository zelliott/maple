We analyzed the interactions between zzso in zzso zzso zzso signaling components to examine the roles that the zzso play in regulating zzso signaling zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mini zzso were each analyzed in double zzso combinations with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso whose molecular nature is not zzso Similar to the zzso zzso zzso we found that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are also zzso to the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso excluding a class of zzso zzso as candidates for zzso In zzso fin double zzso we observed a mutual suppression of the zzso and mini fin zzso zzso frequently to a wild type zzso Thus, the zzso fin zzso that normally zzso and zzso zzso activity is zzso when zzso antagonism is zzso These results suggest that zzso encodes a zzso and zzso zzso zzso By analyzing genes whose expression is very sensitive to zzso signaling levels, we found that the absence of zzso or zzso antagonism did not increase the zzso activity remaining in zzso or zzso zzso zzso These results, together with other studies, suggest that additional molecules or mechanisms are essential in generating the zzso zzso zzso activity zzso that patterns the zzso zzso zzso we observed a striking increased zzso of the zzso dominant zzso zzso when zzso function is also zzso Loss of the zzso zzso zzso is expected to increase zzso signaling levels in a swirl zzso but instead we observed an apparent decrease in zzso signaling levels and a loss of zzso tail zzso As has been proposed for the fly zzso of zzso short zzso our paradoxical results can be explained by a model zzso zzso both zzso and promotes zzso zzso
