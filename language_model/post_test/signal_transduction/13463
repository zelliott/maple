zzso in zzso is a highly dynamic process driven by zzso extension movements of internal zzso cells, under the regulatory activity of the zzso or zzso zzso In a large-scale screen for genes expressed in the zzso we have isolated a novel zzso termed zzso an zzso for zzso marginal zzso zzso encodes a protein containing two widely spaced zzso zzso coiled zzso zzso protein is found in zzso zzso in the zzso and associated with the inner plasma zzso We show that zzso is expressed in a dynamic fashion around the zzso zzso in zzso cells undergoing zzso movements, in a pattern similar to zzso target zzso Likewise, zzso expression can be induced by zzso zzso signaling and the early zzso expression is dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in zzso that display a reduced zzso of the zzso axis and in a pronounced zzso of zzso movements in zzso and zzso marginal zone zzso zzso zzso does not interfere with zzso induction or maintenance per zzso Our results suggest that zzso is a novel zzso target gene that is required for zzso movements during zzso in zzso
