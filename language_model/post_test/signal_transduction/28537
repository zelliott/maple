zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso which is a zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be important in the zzso zzso and signal zzso of B zzso zzso in zzso result in B cell immune zzso disorders, such as zzso zzso in humans and zzso zzso in zzso Although zzso plays multiple roles in the life of a B cell, its functional role in zzso cells has not been zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that zzso activates zzso factor, zzso response element zzso protein zzso and subsequent zzso gene zzso during basic zzso growth factor zzso zzso differentiation in immortalized zzso zzso cells zzso The zzso activity of zzso is also induced by zzso and zzso directly zzso zzso at zzso zzso indicating that zzso has a dual protein zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso outgrowth induced by zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso of zzso and the subsequent zzso of zzso at zzso are important in the zzso differentiation of zzso zzso zzso
