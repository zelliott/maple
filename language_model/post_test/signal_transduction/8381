The zzso system is a zzso assembly zzso by zzso and zzso that helps stabilize the zzso outer membrane zzso We show that zzso zzso through the zzso zzso protein zzso is central to zzso function in zzso coli and that this is zzso by zzso such as zzso to initiate their zzso zzso zzso interactions with the zzso zzso govern two zzso states that are adopted by the zzso zzso 12 zzso of zzso that bind zzso in the inner zzso zzso promotes disorder of this zzso zzso and recruitment of zzso In contrast to zzso binding of the zzso zzso zzso to the same site zzso zzso changes that zzso the zzso box to the zzso surface in which it exhibits little or no zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso is an OFF switch for the zzso zzso whereas zzso promote an ON state even though mimicking zzso zzso of the zzso mechanism to that of zzso zzso zzso exchange factor zzso suggests that zzso zzso may be more prevalent in zzso proteins than currently zzso
