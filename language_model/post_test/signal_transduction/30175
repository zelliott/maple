Growth factors and cell zzso are both required for cell cycle zzso zzso but it is unclear whether their function is zzso through the same set of cell cycle components and whether they are both required during the same periods of zzso We separately analyzed the requirements of serum and zzso during zzso progression and found that human zzso zzso as well as wild type, zzso and zzso mouse embryonic zzso needed serum zzso zzso until zzso but required cell zzso until late zzso to be competent for zzso zzso zzso however, zzso zzso mouse embryonic zzso lacked serum requirement in zzso but still required cell zzso until late zzso to enter zzso Our results indicate that zzso and zzso do not constitute the last control point for zzso factors during zzso zzso and they functionally separate the requirements for serum and cell zzso in terms of involved cell cycle zzso
