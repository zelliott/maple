The regulation of cochlear blood flow is crucial for auditory function due to the sensitivity of this sensory organ to zzso Part of the regulation of cochlear blood flow occurs in the spiral zzso artery, which provides the main blood supply to the zzso Blood flow in general is most effectively regulated through the control of the vascular zzso The vascular diameter is determined by the degree of zzso of the smooth muscle cells in the vascular zzso A zzso of the smooth muscle cells reduces the diameter of the vascular zzso and thereby decreases blood flow, whereas a relaxation of the smooth muscle cells increases blood zzso The degree of zzso of the smooth muscle cells in the spiral zzso artery is carefully controlled and must be adjusted properly to the demands of the cochlear zzso To achieve proper control, smooth muscle cells integrate information from various zzso zzso and zzso may originate from the zzso surrounding the vessel, from zzso cells lining the vascular zzso or from the smooth muscle cells zzso Recent advances revealed that smooth muscle cells from different zzso differ widely in their endowment with mechanisms that regulate the degree of smooth muscle cell zzso Signal zzso mechanisms, which mediate these zzso local and zzso regulations of smooth muscle zzso are now beginning to be zzso This report reviews recently obtained evidence for zzso regulation of cochlear blood flow and then focuses on a novel zzso mechanism that involves zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
