WW zzso are small protein zzso that recognize zzso zzso motifs or zzso zzso sites in zzso zzso Within host proteins these zzso are joined to other protein zzso or to a variety of zzso zzso acting together as zzso or targeting anchors of zzso An important aspect of signaling by WW zzso is their ability to recognize their zzso zzso in zzso zzso WW zzso not only act in a synergistic manner but also appear to zzso the function of each zzso In this review, we focus on structure, function, and mechanism of the tandem WW zzso zzso as well as independent zzso We emphasize here the implications of tandem arrangement and cooperative function of the zzso for signaling zzso
