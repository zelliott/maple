zzso of zzso molecular patterns zzso by zzso pattern recognition receptors zzso constitutes an important layer of innate immunity in zzso The zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are the zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are derived from bacterial zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso and mass zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso and zzso undergo zzso zzso in zzso with several zzso zzso zzso that belong to the zzso zzso zzso zzso family, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using a novel zzso zzso that does not exhibit zzso defects in zzso and cell death responses, we determined that zzso and zzso cooperate genetically to achieve full signaling capability in response to zzso and zzso and to the zzso molecular pattern zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that zzso and zzso contribute to disease resistance against the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our work reveals that the establishment of zzso immunity zzso relies on the rapid zzso recruitment of multiple zzso within zzso complexes and provides insight into the early zzso signaling events underlying this important layer of plant innate zzso
