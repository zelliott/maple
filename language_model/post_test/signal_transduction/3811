zzso 1 zzso is a recently described zzso sharing many biological properties with those reported previously for zzso zzso factor zzso In the present study we show that zzso binds to the zzso zzso cancer cell surface through a zzso zzso complex which includes the zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso and a third component displaying a molecular weight of 80 zzso zzso activates zzso and zzso beta zzso zzso as zzso by zzso their zzso zzso zzso The zzso process is relayed to the nucleus by the recruitment of the zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso cell line culture zzso after zzso treatment indicates that zzso stimulates the production of zzso 6 zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso This stimulation of zzso production by zzso is associated with an increase in zzso levels of zzso zzso This study suggests that at least in some pathological situations zzso might represent an zzso regulating zzso gene zzso
