Cell death can occur either from physical damage zzso or cellular suicide zzso zzso is essential for the development of zzso organisms and zzso zzso zzso many human zzso The zzso zzso zzso is a membrane signaling protein that mediates a death signal following its zzso by the zzso zzso We have described methods to induce the association of proteins using zzso molecules called chemical zzso of zzso zzso Here we describe the synthesis of a novel zzso zzso that has two identical zzso surfaces derived from the zzso zzso A zzso We use this zzso to deliver a death signal to cells expressing a fusion protein containing zzso zzso the protein zzso for zzso and the zzso signaling domain of zzso 

zzso was zzso in six synthetic steps and zzso overall yield from zzso It binds to two zzso proteins zzso but does not inhibit zzso zzso presumably because the zzso complex does not bind to zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins undergo zzso in response to zzso quantities of zzso zzso containing a zzso in the zzso signal are defective for zzso 

The zzso signaling zzso can be activated with a zzso zzso derived from zzso in cells expressing an appropriately engineered zzso zzso which must be localized at the zzso This new class of zzso zzso will be useful for in-depth analysis of protein association events in complex systems, including transgenic zzso Now that several zzso with distinct zzso characteristics are available, it should be possible to induce the zzso of multiple pathways with complete zzso
