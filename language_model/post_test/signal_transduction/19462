Human embryonic stem cells zzso offer new avenues for studying human development and disease progression in addition to their tremendous potential toward development of zzso therapies for various cellular zzso We have earlier reported the derivation and characterization of zzso zzso the first fully characterized zzso line generated from the Indian zzso Recent studies have demonstrated discrete differences among zzso lines, in terms of both their growth properties and their differentiation zzso To address some of these issues in the context of zzso research in India, we have recently generated two new zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Both these cell lines were derived using a zzso approach of zzso followed by mechanical surgery for inner cell mass zzso The cell lines exhibit the usual zzso characteristics including their ability to differentiate both in zzso and in zzso to yield the three zzso zzso Whole zzso zzso analysis of these cell lines was compared with zzso and it showed that approximately zzso genes were expressed by these zzso As expected the expression pattern of these new cell lines bore close resemblance to that of zzso A majority of the zzso genes and the genes known to inhibit various differentiation pathways were also expressed by these cell zzso We also observed that each of these cell lines expressed a unique set of genes that are mutually exclusive from each zzso These results represent the first detailed characterization of a set of zzso lines originating from zzso
