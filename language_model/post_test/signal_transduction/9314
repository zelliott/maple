zzso zzso is a powerful zzso zzso zzso in the treatment of virus infections and tumors, but recent studies have also uncovered regulatory functions of zzso zzso Since zzso triggering suppresses zzso by accumulating zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso in an zzso zzso manner, we asked whether similar molecular and cellular changes were induced by zzso triggering in zzso zzso zzso triggering increased zzso and zzso and suppressed zzso T cells, in zzso mice infected with the type 1 zzso strain of zzso zzso virus zzso as it does in an zzso disease zzso zzso analysis of the zzso T suppression showed that freshly activated zzso T cells underwent zzso in the early phase of suppression, and zzso zzso T cells in the later zzso Although zzso triggering resulted in similar cellular changes - increased zzso T and decreased zzso T cells, it had different effects on mortality in mice infected with zzso zzso zzso and Japanese encephalitis virus zzso it increased mortality in zzso mice but decreased it in zzso zzso Since the dominant type of immune cell generated to protect the host was different for each virus - zzso T cells and zzso in zzso zzso infection, both zzso T and zzso T cells in influenza infection, and a crucial role for B cells in zzso infection, zzso triggering resulted in different therapeutic zzso We conclude that the therapeutic outcome of zzso triggering is determined by whether the protective immunity generated against the virus was zzso altered by the zzso zzso
