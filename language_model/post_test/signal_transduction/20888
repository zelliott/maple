Numerous studies have been published these last few years on the involvement of zzso zzso in signal zzso reflecting their importance in cell cycle and cell growth zzso The identification and the characterization of their direct upstream zzso has considerably enlarged our understanding of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso protein zzso which zzso and activate zzso zzso To date, zzso zzso have been found in zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso switch constitutes a basic module activated in distinct pathways in zzso and in zzso zzso regulation studies have led to the discovery of at least four zzso zzso pathways in higher zzso One of these is similar to the zzso zzso response zzso which includes the zzso protein zzso Two other pathways require the zzso of either one or both of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Additionally, recent studies suggest a possible effect of the cell cycle control regulator zzso zzso 1 zzso on zzso zzso Finally, zzso seem to be essential zzso through which signals must pass before reaching the zzso
