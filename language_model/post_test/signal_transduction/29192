Women have less muscle than men but lose it more slowly during zzso To discover potential underlying zzso for this we evaluated the muscle protein synthesis process in zzso conditions and during feeding in zzso zzso year old men zzso zzso zzso and women zzso zzso zzso We discovered that the zzso concentration of zzso zzso was approximately zzso less zzso and the zzso rate of zzso was approximately zzso greater zzso zzso zzso in women than in zzso the zzso zzso of muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not different between the zzso Feeding increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the same extent in men and women but increased zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso in men zzso zzso feeding increased zzso in men zzso but not in zzso The zzso muscle zzso zzso for zzso and myostatin were not different between zzso feeding doubled zzso zzso zzso and zzso that of myostatin zzso in both zzso Thus, there is sexual zzso in zzso and its control in older adults; a greater zzso rate of zzso operating over most of the day may partially explain the slower loss of muscle in older zzso
