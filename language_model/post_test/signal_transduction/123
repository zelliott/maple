zzso strong zzso of zzso zzso cells produces a slow inward zzso zzso This zzso called zzso slow current zzso is triggered by zzso influx in the zzso cell and is attenuated by a blocker of zzso zzso Previous work in other brain regions, such as the zzso zzso and zzso zzso area, has shown that zzso can be released from zzso to produce zzso and zzso zzso Here, we test the hypothesis that zzso release of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso receptors is involved in zzso Light zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type 2 zzso and zzso plasma membrane zzso zzso were all expressed in zzso zzso zzso However, their expression was strongest in the zzso region of zzso zzso IX and zzso zzso of zzso across zzso revealed that it was weak in the anterior portions of the zzso zzso II, zzso and zzso and strong in zzso IX and zzso zzso was blocked by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Likewise, zzso was strongly attenuated by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso These drugs did not produce zzso zzso through blockade of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso slices derived from zzso mice expressed zzso but this zzso ran down at a significantly higher rate than zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that strong zzso cell zzso produces zzso release of zzso zzso zzso that then excites zzso cells in an zzso zzso
