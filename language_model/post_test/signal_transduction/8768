The present study evaluated zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and an zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso on patients with varying grades of cervical zzso zzso zzso I, II and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were collected from women with zzso I, II and III zzso zzso zzso and controls without zzso zzso or human zzso virus zzso infection zzso zzso zzso The presence of high and low-risk zzso DNA was determined using hybrid zzso The zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined by zzso with specific zzso 

The control group exhibited a greater frequency of zzso expression zzso zzso than the zzso samples zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while, the expression of zzso was also greater in the control samples zzso zzso than in the patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso simultaneous expression of both receptors was observed only in the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Among the zzso samples, there was one case of low expression of zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was present in zzso zzso of the zzso samples but was not expressed in the control zzso zzso zzso were expressed in zzso zzso of the zzso samples and zzso zzso of the control samples (not statistically zzso Fifty percent zzso of the zzso samples were positive for zzso zzso 

zzso biopsy samples from control women or those without zzso or zzso infection displayed higher zzso zzso expression than those with zzso while simultaneous expression of both zzso zzso zzso was found only in the control zzso There was no significant difference in zzso expression of zzso and zzso between the control and zzso zzso Then we concluded that the samples obtained from patients with zzso present low levels of the zzso zzso zzso
