zzso zzso zzso stimulates production of zzso through signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso studies have shown an association between zzso in the genes zzso zzso and zzso and elevated serum zzso in patients with zzso zzso Some authors, including us, have reported an association of zzso disease and elevated serum zzso To zzso the relationship between zzso and zzso zzso and elevated serum zzso in patients with zzso disease, 169 patients with zzso disease were zzso We investigated whether these zzso affect zzso zzso in cultured human zzso A high frequency of both the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso repeat zzso of the zzso gene was observed in patients with zzso disease and elevated serum zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso versus zzso but not in subjects with normal zzso zzso human zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso repeat zzso of zzso showed increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso P zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso in the zzso and zzso genes play an important role in zzso of serum zzso through increased zzso action in patients with zzso zzso
