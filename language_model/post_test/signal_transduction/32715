zzso was identified in a genetic screen as an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso triggers cell recruitment in the eye, and zzso eyes have excess zzso cone cells, and zzso zzso zzso function is, however, more zzso We show that it also interacts genetically with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and it was first discovered through its effect on zzso zzso zzso In contrast to an earlier proposal that zzso is zzso we show by zzso analysis that zzso is an zzso zzso associated with the inner surface of the plasma zzso zzso binds to two zzso components of the Ras pathway, zzso and zzso Our results indicate that zzso is a widespread inhibitor of Ras zzso signal zzso
