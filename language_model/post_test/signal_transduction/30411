Nerve growth factor zzso has an important role in regulating sympathetic zzso survival and target field zzso during zzso Here we show that zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso protein zzso a member of the zzso zzso and its zzso zzso are zzso in mouse sympathetic zzso when their zzso are zzso their targets under the influence of zzso zzso In culture, zzso enhanced zzso zzso growth from zzso sympathetic zzso and preventing zzso interaction in these zzso or knocking down zzso inhibited zzso zzso growth without affecting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have reduced sympathetic zzso density in zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 by zzso that is necessary for zzso zzso Our results reveal a previously unknown signaling loop in developing sympathetic zzso that is crucial for zzso zzso growth and target zzso
