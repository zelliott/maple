zzso zzso dependent protein zzso II zzso is an important zzso signal zzso zzso zzso is rich in the primary sensory zzso and specifically presents in the small- and zzso zzso It remains unclear about the zzso on the zzso of primary sensory zzso by zzso zzso By current clamp recording, we found that the zzso of zzso small and medium zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly reduced by a zzso specific zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The zzso is represented as the reduction of numbers of action potential zzso decrease of the zzso of zzso increase of zzso and zzso of duration of zzso zzso by zzso clamp recording, we found that both zzso sodium channels zzso and zzso zzso channels zzso were inhibited by zzso and zzso in the order of total sodium zzso current zzso zzso sustained zzso zzso current zzso zzso zzso zzso current zzso In addition, zzso (a selective zzso zzso zzso and zzso caused a similar zzso of zzso and zzso Those zzso show that the zzso of zzso sensitive small and medium zzso zzso can be regulated by zzso zzso through modulating zzso and zzso Considering the specific distribution of zzso and its zzso to many zzso zzso zzso zzso may play an important role in the peripheral sensory zzso especially in zzso
