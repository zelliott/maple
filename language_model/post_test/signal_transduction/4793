zzso valve zzso are common human zzso heart zzso zzso zzso valves occur in zzso of the population, and zzso valve zzso constitutes zzso of all zzso heart disease in adults zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso valve defects cause valve zzso zzso or zzso leading to zzso or zzso heart zzso These complications often require prolonged medical treatment or surgical zzso Despite the medical importance of valve disease, the regulatory pathways governing zzso valve development are not entirely zzso In this report we investigated the zzso role of zzso signaling in zzso valve zzso We generated conditional knockout mice with zzso gene disrupted in various zzso during zzso valve zzso Our studies showed that zzso zzso signals in the secondary heart field zzso but not in the zzso tract zzso or neural crest cells to regulate zzso valve zzso Without zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso site of prospective zzso valve zzso develop and then zzso due to zzso resulting in a striking zzso with complete absence of the zzso and zzso valves, severe valve zzso and zzso zzso This role of zzso signaling in the zzso is different from the requirement of zzso in the zzso for zzso valve formation zzso et zzso 2004) zzso indicating that zzso signals in multiple zzso to organize zzso valve zzso Also, our studies suggest distinct mechanisms of zzso signaling for zzso and zzso valve zzso zzso we demonstrate a novel zzso mechanism in which zzso signals through zzso in the secondary heart field to promote zzso valve zzso revealing a new supportive role of the secondary heart field for zzso valve zzso
