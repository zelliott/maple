In addition to zzso growth factors are also implicated in the development and zzso growth of the prostate zzso zzso is a potent zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in mice has led to the development of a number of abnormalities in the male zzso system, including zzso of the prostate zzso and zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso in prostate zzso zzso We have recently reported that zzso is expressed at a higher level by zzso zzso prostate cancer cells as compared to zzso prostate cancer cells or normal prostate zzso and zzso zzso In addition, we have demonstrated that a synthetic zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso sequence of the zzso C domain of zzso zzso cell zzso migration and invasion and activated the zzso signaling zzso in prostate cancer zzso The biological zzso of zzso C and zzso in prostate cancer are not zzso 

Here, we report that zzso C, in a cell zzso and zzso manner, acts as a survival factor, activates the zzso pathway, zzso zzso zzso and -9 expression and/or activity, and decreases the zzso nuclear zzso of zzso in prostate cancer cells under zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso C, or zzso decreased the zzso effect, zzso activity, and zzso cell death induced by zzso We also discovered that zzso C activates the zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso manner in prostate cancer zzso Our data also show that the zzso activity of zzso C is at least partially zzso via zzso signaling zzso 

We zzso that as a zzso survival, and zzso factor for prostate cancer cells, zzso C or zzso may contribute to prostate zzso at its early zzso or zzso zzso zzso
