Lung cancer is the leading cause of zzso deaths, with zzso lung cancer zzso accounting for approximately zzso of zzso A significant proportion of zzso cases are not diagnosed until a late stage, when aggressive treatments are required but often prolong survival only zzso Recent advances in molecular characterization of zzso have enabled identification of numerous cell growth and proliferation pathways that are disrupted in these zzso This knowledge has provided insight into the mechanisms of tumor development in various zzso zzso of zzso and has pointed the way toward targeted treatment zzso In this review, we highlight literature findings of zzso zzso in genes involved in cell growth and proliferation that are commonly found in the various zzso of zzso and we discuss how these findings may relate to treatment zzso
