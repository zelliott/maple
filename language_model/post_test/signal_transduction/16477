It is increasingly appreciated that steroid hormones such as zzso and zzso can mediate important cardiovascular zzso Many of these effects occur over a time course not consistent with the zzso actions of these hormones acting through classical nuclear receptors zzso zzso zzso Further, multiple receptors have been implicated in zzso these rapid effects of both zzso and zzso including a newly appreciated zzso zzso zzso In previous studies we demonstrated that both zzso and zzso mediate contraction in vascular smooth muscle cells, as assessed in single cell zzso However, the zzso mechanisms underlying these effects remained zzso zzso we studied the actions of zzso and zzso on rat zzso vascular smooth muscle zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso a zzso increase in contraction, as assessed in zzso deformation zzso with zzso in the range of zzso per zzso These effects paralleled increased zzso light chain zzso The effects of zzso were inhibited by the zzso selective zzso zzso Further, zzso zzso effects were enhanced by increased expression of the zzso zzso The zzso effects of zzso were inhibited by zzso zzso zzso antagonists, zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso Further, zzso effects were enhanced by the increased expression of both zzso and the zzso zzso zzso To assess the potential role of zzso in zzso the effects of zzso and zzso zzso was zzso since these cells lose zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso of zzso enhanced both zzso and zzso zzso These studies demonstrate that in rat zzso vascular smooth muscle cells, both zzso and zzso mediate vascular smooth muscle contraction and that these effects can be zzso by zzso zzso and by zzso
