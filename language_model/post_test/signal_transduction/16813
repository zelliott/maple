zzso analysis of zzso has been extensively carried out using their zzso lines and knockout zzso in zzso Since zzso zzso exists in an active or inactive form, zzso zzso zzso does not mean that zzso signaling pathways are activated in the transgenic zzso zzso expression of the zzso active form of the zzso zzso will magnify a role of zzso signaling pathways in plant growth and development, and ultimately yield zzso Here, we describe the method to study function of zzso in zzso development using the zzso active form of the zzso zzso in zzso
