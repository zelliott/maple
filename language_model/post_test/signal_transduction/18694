zzso inflammatory signals can disrupt the zzso regulation of energy balance, causing anorexia and weight zzso In the current studies, we investigated whether zzso the primary, but not zzso zzso signal zzso zzso for zzso zzso 4 and zzso zzso I, is necessary for anorexia and weight loss to occur in response to stimuli that activate these key innate immune zzso Our findings demonstrate that the absence of zzso signaling zzso complete protection against anorexia induced by either zzso zzso (20 h food intake in zzso mice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso g in zzso control mice, P zzso zzso or zzso beta (20 h food intake in zzso mice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso g in zzso control mice, P zzso zzso However, absent zzso signaling does not prevent these inflammatory zzso from causing weight loss zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice, zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso weight loss occurs in the absence of zzso fever, or zzso axis zzso in zzso zzso In addition, the peripheral inflammatory response to zzso is surprisingly intact in mice lacking zzso Together, these observations indicate that zzso reduces food intake via a mechanism that is zzso from its effect on peripheral zzso production, and whereas the presence of circulating zzso zzso per zzso is insufficient to cause anorexia in the absence of zzso zzso it may contribute to zzso weight zzso
