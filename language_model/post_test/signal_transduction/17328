zzso zzso maintain the ability to grow continuously and their zzso zzso is covered with zzso zzso zzso zzso factor is expressed in zzso zzso in mouse zzso and its absence in zzso mice results in a zzso in embryonic tooth zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso maintenance in adult tissue was not studied because of death at birth in zzso zzso Here, we examined compound zzso zzso mice, one zzso of which has an zzso acid substitution of zzso at position 826 for zzso that exhibited zzso zzso zzso with lower zzso of minerals at the zzso and the zzso accompanying the zzso bone zzso zzso examinations revealed zzso of the zzso cervical loop in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region, and impairment in differentiation and proliferation of zzso zzso Interestingly, however, juvenile mice at zzso after birth did not show marked change in these zzso These results suggest that attenuated zzso activity zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The number of zzso zzso cells, putative stem cells, was lower in zzso zzso which suggests the zzso zzso may be in part a result of the decreased number of stem zzso Interestingly, the level of zzso and zzso expressions, which are assumed to play key roles in the development and maintenance of zzso and zzso was not zzso though the expressed areas were more restricted in zzso zzso and zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso Those data suggest that the zzso maintenance by zzso is not directly related to the zzso zzso signaling loop including zzso but is intrinsic to zzso zzso and possibly stem zzso
