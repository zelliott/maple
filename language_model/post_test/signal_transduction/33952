The use of targeted radiation therapy zzso in conjunction with zzso zzso zzso zzso delivers high clinical response rates in zzso zzso as part of zzso The mechanisms underlying these impressive responses, particularly in patients whose zzso have become zzso to chemotherapy, are poorly zzso 

In this study, we have investigated the signaling pathways and mode of cell death induced in zzso zzso cells after the combination of zzso and either type I zzso or type II zzso zzso zzso 

Increased tumor cell death was observed when zzso was combined with zzso but not zzso This additive cell death was found to be zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and could be reversed with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as small interfering zzso targeting zzso Furthermore, we found that this increased death was associated with zzso nuclear zzso after zzso treatment, which was enhanced in combination with zzso zzso although zzso zzso resulted in resistance to zzso zzso it had no effect on the tumor cell death induced by zzso plus zzso indicating a zzso form of cell zzso 

These findings indicate that zzso and type II zzso zzso combine to stimulate a zzso function of the zzso pathway, which is able to overcome zzso resistance potentially explaining the efficacy of this zzso in treating patients with zzso zzso
