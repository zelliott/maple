zzso is an zzso protein associated with the signaling by zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the induction of type I zzso Here, we demonstrate a mechanism by which zzso signaling controls cell proliferation and zzso We show that zzso and zzso can induce cell cycle entry via zzso which targets the cell cycle inhibitor zzso for zzso zzso by zzso complexes, and zzso zzso These events are antagonized by type I zzso induced by the zzso zzso Furthermore, in human zzso cells treated with zzso zzso or zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso signaling zzso zzso degradation and zzso identifying an zzso zzso function of type I zzso These findings reveal a previously zzso function of zzso signaling in cell proliferation and zzso
