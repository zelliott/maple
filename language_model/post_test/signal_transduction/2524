Recently, one of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to interact with the zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Reed, zzso zzso zzso Science zzso zzso suggesting a role for protein zzso in zzso zzso To investigate whether this interaction is zzso in zzso we performed zzso zzso interaction experiments and zzso studies in mouse T cell zzso For the corresponding zzso motif in the mouse zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso only an interaction with human but not with mouse zzso could be zzso zzso of the zzso motif proper, which is unique for human zzso rather than the structural context of its zzso zzso apparently explains the initially observed zzso To test for functional conservation of any indirect involvement of zzso in zzso zzso we generated T zzso cell lines zzso expressing mouse or human zzso zzso with and without zzso No zzso effect of zzso was observed upon triggering zzso using mouse or human zzso zzso Together with the markedly different tissue expression patterns for zzso and zzso zzso our findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso does not play a key role in the zzso death zzso
