Despite significant advances in pharmacological and clinical treatment, heart failure remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality zzso zzso coupled receptors are a wide zzso of plasma membrane receptors which represent an important target of heart failure drug zzso Since heart failure is characterized by the zzso of different zzso such as catecholamines and zzso II, responsible for several zzso effects on the cardiovascular system, over the last decade therapeutic strategies targeting zzso and zzso receptors have been zzso Despite the introduction of successful drug classes, such as zzso zzso blockers, zzso zzso zzso and zzso heart failure still poses an enormous challenge, thus indicating the urgent need to develop innovative treatments that might counteract mechanisms involved in heart failure onset and zzso It is now established that a single zzso activated by the same zzso can elicit several different signaling pathways often resulting in opposite cellular responses, some beneficial and some zzso However, drugs currently used in heart failure target receptors on their zzso domain by competing with the zzso zzso Thus, they can inhibit zzso all the zzso signaling pathways including those with beneficial activity whose blockade would not be desirable in heart zzso These observations stress the need for the generation of new therapeutic molecules able to target specific signaling pathways which might result in innovative therapies for cardiovascular zzso
