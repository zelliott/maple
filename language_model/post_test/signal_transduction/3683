zzso cells respond to a variety of external stimuli such as growth factors, zzso and membrane zzso by zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that both zzso calcium influx and treatment with zzso stimulate zzso zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso Using a zzso expression system in conjunction with a zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso and zzso triggered signals involve zzso function upstream of zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso is critically dependent on the presence of zzso zzso and when triggered by zzso treatment, calcium influx is already sufficient to induce zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our results establish zzso zzso zzso as a signaling mechanism zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso
