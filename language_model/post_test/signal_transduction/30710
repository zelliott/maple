zzso zzso response of the type zzso II cells against zzso stimulation is considered to arise from the difference in dominant signaling pathways zzso In the type I cells, zzso signaling predominantly takes place via the direct zzso of zzso by activated zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a major role in the type II zzso To zzso the selection mechanism of dominant pathway, we carried out systematic model analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso An increase in the expression level of zzso induced a switch of dominant zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso showing a zzso change from type II to type I zzso With the aid of sensitivity analysis and kinetic considerations, we succeeded in constructing a minimal network model relevant for the zzso transition, which revealed that zzso origin of the transition lies in the competition between the activated forms of zzso and zzso for their common zzso zzso The zzso dominance was found to be primarily controlled by the balance between the zzso rate of zzso and the initial level of zzso In the full network model, we showed that differential formation ability of the zzso signaling complex zzso can also induce zzso transition, in accordance with the experimental zzso
