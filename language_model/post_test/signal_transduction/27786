Plants continuously analyze the nature of environmental light signals using an array of at least eight informational zzso each with differential functional zzso zzso and genetic studies are identifying an increasing assembly of potential or established zzso zzso involved in zzso perceived signals from these zzso to zzso zzso The emerging picture suggests a complex network with both separate and shared early zzso zzso segments which appear to zzso to regulate zzso important genes through a set of master zzso
