zzso acids are nutrients responsible for zzso target of zzso zzso regulation in zzso zzso The zzso protein is mainly known for its role in regulating cell growth, notably via protein zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso is regulated by insulin via a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso between zzso acids and insulin zzso We show that in freshly isolated rat zzso insulin stimulates the zzso of zzso on zzso zzso a protein zzso B zzso consensus zzso zzso This site is also zzso by zzso zzso which in contrast to insulin do not activate zzso Moreover, insulin and zzso acids have an additive effect on zzso zzso indicating that they act via two independent zzso zzso zzso zzso notably zzso permit insulin to stimulate zzso when zzso zzso is zzso They also rescue zzso transport and the zzso zzso Further, zzso alone can improve insulin zzso of zzso in zzso zzso Our results define the importance of zzso acids in insulin signaling and reveal zzso as a key zzso acid in disease situations associated with zzso in zzso
