The zzso the major proteins of the developing tooth zzso zzso are highly zzso throughout most species zzso The gene structure is similar, with a set of seven zzso and intervening zzso and remarkable conservation of particular zzso sizes over divergent zzso Studies of zzso skipping and zzso alternative gene zzso suggest that, in zzso zzso definition is zzso In this zzso zzso size is zzso If too small, an zzso can be readily zzso if too large, internal cryptic zzso sites may be zzso Other factors, such as zzso length and specific zzso sequences at the zzso boundaries also zzso zzso efficiency, but zzso gene zzso zzso well to the generalized zzso length zzso zzso 1, 2 and 7 are not subject to zzso that affects the zzso protein product, but zzso 3, 4 and 5 are at the lower boundary of zzso size, rendering them, 4 and 5 especially, subject to zzso On the other hand, zzso 6 is very long and has cryptic zzso sites that can be zzso In the zzso nine distinct zzso product proteins have been zzso The question now is the functions of these zzso The larger forms, those that contain the intact zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso are important for zzso zzso Recent work suggests that the small proteins resulting from deletion of a major part of zzso gene zzso 6 via zzso of a cryptic site may have signal zzso functions during tooth zzso Furthermore, new work also suggests that zzso zzso express the small zzso during the period that zzso signaling between zzso and zzso determines the course of tooth zzso The same peptides have been demonstrated to act on zzso cells and effect their zzso expression patterns in zzso and to induce bone formation in implants in zzso
