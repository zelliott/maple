zzso from zzso and humans express different receptors recognizing hormones of the zzso family, zzso zzso with zzso in the control of insulin zzso We have recently reported that isolated zzso from mice zzso for a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit a zzso zzso response to zzso This observation can be interpreted in two different ways: 1) the presence of zzso is not essential for the zzso response of isolated zzso to zzso alone; 2) zzso in zzso zzso underwent zzso changes in response to the zzso zzso To explore these possibilities, we studied zzso from control zzso mice in the absence or presence of 1 zzso zzso zzso a specific and potent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso insulin zzso from both zzso and zzso incubated zzso zzso by 50% zzso zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso production in parallel zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso 1) reduced zzso zzso in the presence of 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso versus control zzso 12 zzso 1 zzso 27 zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso P zzso zzso and exaggerated acceleration of zzso production by 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso over 20 zzso zzso by zzso in knockout zzso versus control zzso 66 zzso 5 zzso 14 zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso P zzso zzso 2) increased mean zzso zzso zzso at 7, 10, and 15 zzso zzso in knockout zzso versus control zzso and 3) signs of zzso of zzso zzso between different zzso zzso In conclusion, disruption of zzso signaling is associated with reduced zzso but enhanced zzso zzso production and abnormalities in zzso and zzso zzso These abnormalities suggest that zzso signaling is an essential upstream component of multiple zzso signaling zzso
