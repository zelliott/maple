We have previously observed expression of zzso zzso 2 zzso the key zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso in reproductively active Syrian zzso zzso cells, and reported an zzso role of zzso on zzso zzso zzso In this study, we further investigated zzso expression in zzso zzso cells during sexual development and zzso zzso zzso Since zzso is mostly expressed in zzso and reproductively active adult zzso with high circulating levels of zzso and zzso we studied the role of these hormones in the zzso of zzso zzso In active zzso zzso cells, zzso and testosterone induced zzso and zzso production, and their actions were abolished by the zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso does not exert a direct effect on PG zzso zzso also zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso within minutes and hours, but the testosterone zzso zzso had no effect on zzso and zzso Because zzso and zzso an inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso abolished testosterone actions on zzso and zzso our studies suggest that testosterone directly zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells via zzso receptors and a zzso mechanism that involves zzso zzso Since zzso zzso testosterone production, it might imply the existence of a regulatory loop that is setting a brake on zzso Thus, the zzso environment might be crucial for the regulation of zzso PG production at least during sexual development and zzso variations in zzso
