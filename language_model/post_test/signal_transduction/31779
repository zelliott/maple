zzso cells are important zzso cells in zzso They usually have a long life span and resist cell death zzso zzso zzso and zzso immune zzso zzso has been demonstrated in zzso cells, but not in mast zzso The aim of the current study was to investigate whether mast cells could respond to zzso induction by zzso immune complex zzso of zzso zzso It is known that mouse mast cells express the zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso which bind zzso especially in the form of zzso immune zzso 

Mouse bone zzso cultured mast cells were examined for surface expression of zzso and zzso zzso of such cells from zzso zzso or zzso mice was measured following zzso zzso by zzso immune zzso 

Our data demonstrate that zzso of either zzso or zzso by zzso immune complexes induced zzso of mouse bone zzso cultured mast zzso However, mast cells expressing both zzso and zzso were able to resist cell death induction by zzso immune zzso 

Our findings reveal a zzso system for regulating mast cell zzso through zzso zzso receptors by zzso immune zzso Such zzso regulation may have a substantial impact on mast cell zzso during allergic zzso
