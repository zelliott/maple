Unlike zzso DNA, zzso zzso and synthetic DNA containing zzso zzso zzso in specific sequence contexts are recognized by the zzso zzso 9 expressed by B cells and zzso zzso cells, and trigger the zzso of the innate and zzso immune zzso Upon zzso zzso DNA zzso B cells, natural killer cells, zzso and zzso cells to zzso zzso take up, and present zzso and zzso a variety of zzso zzso and predominantly zzso zzso zzso studies in mice and primates show that DNA sequences containing zzso motifs can selectively promote cellular and/or zzso immune responses in zzso Early results from ongoing clinical studies indicate that zzso zzso zzso are well tolerated and improve the immune response to microbial zzso This work examines the progress in utilizing zzso zzso as zzso in conventional and DNA zzso
