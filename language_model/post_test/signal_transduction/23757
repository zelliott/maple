In all zzso tight control of zzso protein zzso zzso activity plays an important role in modulating zzso zzso in response to changing zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso (also known as zzso or zzso is highly activated in response to a variety of external zzso To avoid segregation of damaged zzso or zzso strong zzso zzso zzso blocks zzso and cell division until such stresses have been dealt zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to reduce zzso zzso zzso tight control of zzso zzso is central for stress adaptation and for cell division to zzso In contrast to zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is under environmental zzso zzso has a unique sequence (the zzso zzso between the zzso domain and the zzso zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso region is a zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso region is highly zzso to increase zzso protein stability and this zzso is zzso zzso Our data suggests that zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso to increase the stability of the zzso This zzso zzso zzso allows cells to zzso zzso zzso and resume cell division, once stresses have been dealt zzso
