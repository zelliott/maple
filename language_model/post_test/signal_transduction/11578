Cellular metabolism depends on the appropriate concentration of zzso zzso zzso however, little is known about how zzso zzso are zzso The similarity of zzso a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso to the zzso sensors zzso and zzso has led to the hypothesis that zzso is an zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso strains have defects in zzso zzso they zzso express zzso a zzso zzso zzso We began these studies to determine the role of zzso zzso in signaling zzso zzso Previous experiments demonstrated a zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso however, the zzso strain expresses zzso zzso when grown in zzso zzso We determined that zzso cells have a significant zzso in zzso zzso even when grown in high zzso zzso zzso of unrelated zzso zzso or a zzso zzso in the zzso strain suppresses the zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso is not required for sensing zzso We further characterized putative zzso zzso identifying two new zzso zzso zzso and zzso A synthetic lethal zzso was observed when five zzso zzso were zzso and the contribution of each zzso to zzso in high zzso conditions was zzso Finally, a zzso compensation response was zzso the abundance of zzso at the plasma membrane increases in cells that are defective in other zzso zzso
