zzso zzso is an zzso bacteria that zzso the zzso barrier and invades its host through zzso zzso tissue and zzso patches zzso We show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso barrier dysfunction by zzso signaling of the innate immune zzso zzso a zzso that can be reversed by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso inactive zzso zzso zzso critical sites in the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso which are central zzso of zzso zzso and decreases the affinity of zzso for zzso zzso zzso interacts with and activates zzso resulting in increased levels of zzso Finally, zzso within zzso plays an essential role in inducing zzso barrier zzso Thus, zzso alters zzso zzso and promotes the dissemination of zzso as well as zzso bacteria by exploiting the zzso inflammatory zzso
