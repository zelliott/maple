zzso zzso zzso is acknowledged to induce zzso damage in a number of regions of the brain, particularly the zzso the main area implicated in zzso However, little research has been conducted on zzso to zzso zzso in depression and the cellular and molecular basis for these zzso In the present study, we aimed to determine whether zzso causes zzso in primary cultured zzso zzso and to investigate the protective effects of zzso an active natural ingredient from the Chinese plant, zzso zzso zzso Our study demonstrates that exposure of zzso zzso to zzso causes a significant loss in zzso a significant decrease in zzso membrane potential, an increase in zzso activity, an zzso in zzso zzso oxygen species zzso and decreased zzso zzso zzso However, zzso of cells with zzso prior to zzso exposure was identified to noticeably suppress these zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso may prevent zzso cell death via zzso of the zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso is able to prevent zzso zzso cell zzso via zzso of the zzso zzso
