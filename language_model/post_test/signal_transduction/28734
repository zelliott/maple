In zzso cells zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso initiating the zzso zzso is controlled by a complex zzso zzso zzso We showed previously that the zzso cascade involves the zzso zzso and a zzso step, which precedes the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We have now further characterized the cascade component requiring zzso A zzso protein zzso that shows several characteristics of the conventional type of zzso protein zzso C zzso was detected in protein extracts from zzso cell zzso zzso It zzso the in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and was markedly inhibited by a zzso zzso zzso However, it was only modestly activated by the zzso zzso and zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not show any zzso Nevertheless, its activity was found to be associated with a zzso of zzso that was recognized by a zzso zzso raised against the zzso of rabbit zzso zzso In addition, this protein zzso was also inhibited by the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Surprisingly, it was found to be zzso in zzso zzso albeit to a low extent, and this did not change during zzso induction by zzso zzso zzso and zzso were shown to markedly inhibit zzso zzso in zzso zzso These results support the view that this protein zzso is a good candidate to represent the zzso component of the zzso zzso zzso
