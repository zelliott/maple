The zzso zzso zzso responsible for the degradation of zzso to zzso free iron and zzso have been heavily implicated in zzso zzso aging and zzso In normal brain, the expression of zzso is zzso abundant and fairly zzso whereas zzso zzso and protein are confined to small populations of scattered zzso and zzso In zzso to zzso the zzso gene zzso is exquisitely sensitive to induction by a wide range of zzso and other zzso In zzso disease and mild cognitive zzso zzso zzso protein is zzso in zzso and zzso of the cerebral zzso and zzso relative to zzso cognitively intact controls and zzso to senile zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In Parkinson disease, zzso is markedly zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso bodies in affected zzso zzso zzso is also zzso in zzso cells surrounding human cerebral zzso zzso and zzso within multiple sclerosis zzso and in other degenerative and inflammatory human zzso zzso zzso free zzso iron, zzso and zzso are biologically active substances that have been shown to either zzso or exacerbate neural injury contingent upon specific disease models zzso the intensity and duration of zzso expression and the nature of the prevailing zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso of zzso iron and zzso and may thereby contribute to the pathological iron deposition and zzso failure zzso documented in zzso disease, Parkinson disease and other zzso neurodegenerative zzso zzso zzso expression may also impact cell survival and zzso in these conditions by modulating brain zzso metabolism and zzso degradation of zzso protein zzso
