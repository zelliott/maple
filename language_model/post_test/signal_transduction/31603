zzso zzso is critical for cell fate determination and involves the functions of zzso zzso and its zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso proteins mediate the repressive effects of N in diverse zzso the role of zzso was zzso The studies we describe zzso a common role for the highly zzso zzso protein zzso zzso during eye and bristle zzso zzso the functions of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso elicits a rough eye and defects in the zzso zzso zzso These zzso are exacerbated by zzso in zzso and suppressed by an increase in the dosage of this protein zzso The appearance of the rough eye zzso in time and space, to the zzso and refinement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with this zzso compromising zzso elicits zzso zzso at the zzso margin of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso characteristic of loss of zzso and impaired lateral zzso We also show that compromising zzso elicits zzso and split zzso The former reflects the zzso of excess bristle zzso while the latter suggests roles during zzso divisions that drive zzso of this sensory zzso In addition, these zzso are exacerbated by zzso in zzso or zzso indicating genetic interactions between these two zzso Given the zzso of zzso to the repressive effects of zzso our studies suggest zzso roles for this protein zzso during lateral zzso Candidates for this regulation are the zzso zzso the terminal zzso of this zzso
