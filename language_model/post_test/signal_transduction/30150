The zzso zzso zzso model of zzso insulin zzso zzso predicts that zzso derived from zzso metabolism zzso fatty acid zzso thereby increasing the availability of zzso for zzso signaling to cellular processes involved in zzso For directly testing the model, zzso cell clones zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso manner were generated, and zzso and rat zzso were infected with zzso zzso zzso activity was increased more than zzso and the zzso content was markedly zzso This was associated with enhanced fat zzso at high zzso a suppression of the zzso increase in cellular free fatty acid zzso content, and reduced zzso at elevated zzso of zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso but not in their absence, reduced zzso in all zzso lines and in rat zzso It also markedly curtailed the stimulation of insulin zzso by other fuel and zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso the zzso responses to all types of zzso were amplified by the provision of zzso fatty zzso In the presence of zzso zzso the fatty zzso zzso inhibitor zzso C reduced zzso in response to zzso and zzso zzso The data show the existence of important links between the zzso zzso factor zzso the zzso of fatty zzso and the stimulation of insulin zzso to both fuel and zzso zzso
