Recently the zzso zzso zzso has become a focus of interest for many researchers, because of its function at the interface between signal zzso and zzso zzso It is required for the proper progression of the cell cycle in zzso zzso and is essential for development in plants and zzso However, its function in zzso cells remains zzso Although the zzso shares structural similarities with the zzso zzso lid complex zzso its functions seem to be different from that of the zzso A variety of zzso zzso interactions have been described in zzso zzso However, it is currently unclear how many reflect true functions of the zzso Two activities associated with the zzso have been identified so far: a protein zzso and a zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso factors, which determines their stability towards the zzso zzso The associated zzso regulates the activity of specific zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso thus appears to be a platform connecting zzso with zzso
