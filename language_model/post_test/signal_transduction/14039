The zzso proteins are zzso zzso factors involved in multiple regulatory zzso from plant organ development to response to various environmental zzso One of the mechanisms that regulates the zzso genes involves the zzso zzso which controls their activity at the zzso zzso zzso studies on zzso genes are available in many different zzso however, in zzso one of the largest plant families, studies are restricted to a few species, all belonging to the zzso zzso In the present study, we report the isolation of an zzso gene in the Mediterranean zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso locus includes 10 zzso and 9 zzso and its transcript is alternatively zzso resulting in the long zzso and the short zzso zzso with the latter skipping zzso zzso Both zzso contain the zzso target site for zzso whose action is demonstrated by the presence of zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso are present in the zzso and lip before and after zzso at different expression zzso In addition, the zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso before zzso and in the root and zzso The zzso expression pattern suggests a functional differentiation of the zzso alternatively spliced zzso The expression profile of zzso is complementary to that of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso before zzso whereas after zzso and in zzso tissue before and after zzso this relationship disappears, suggesting the existence of zzso zzso mechanisms in these zzso that differ from that involving zzso
