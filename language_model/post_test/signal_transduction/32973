The signaling pathways that regulate smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation are incompletely zzso zzso muscle cells express at least 3 families of zzso zzso zzso that mediate cell zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso the zzso family of zzso zzso and zzso growth factor 1 zzso The zzso nerve growth factor zzso and zzso growth factor 1 induce the migration but not the proliferation of smooth muscle cells, whereas zzso stimulates both zzso To determine whether distinct signaling pathways downstream of zzso zzso zzso specifically mediate smooth muscle cell migration or zzso the zzso zzso of different signaling pathways in smooth muscle cells was zzso zzso zzso prolonged zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared with zzso The zzso of zzso zzso however, was zzso greater in response to zzso compared with zzso zzso growth factor 1 activates only zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibit zzso and zzso migration, whereas an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso has no zzso Our results suggest that zzso different zzso zzso zzso use similar patterns of zzso of signaling pathways to mediate distinct biological outcomes of cell migration and zzso zzso zzso activates signaling proteins in smooth muscle cells similar to those activated during zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso effects of different signaling pathways are important for the regulation of smooth muscle cell migration and zzso Further studies using zzso zzso receptors will help to define the signal zzso pathways zzso zzso smooth muscle cell zzso
