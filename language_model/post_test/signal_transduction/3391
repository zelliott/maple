zzso allows bacteria to follow zzso of nutrients and other environmental zzso The zzso zzso coli performs zzso via a zzso strategy in which sensitive zzso comparisons lead to a biased random walk, with longer runs in the preferred zzso zzso The zzso network of zzso coli has developed over the years into one of the most thoroughly studied model systems for signal zzso and behavior, yielding general insights into such properties of cellular networks as signal amplification, signal integration, and zzso Despite its relative zzso the operation of the zzso coli zzso network is highly refined and zzso zzso at many zzso For example, recent studies revealed that the network adjusts its signaling properties dependent on the zzso environment, apparently to zzso zzso under particular zzso The network can even zzso potentially zzso zzso fluctuations in protein levels and reaction rates to maximize the zzso performance of the zzso
