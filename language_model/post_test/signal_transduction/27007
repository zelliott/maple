The zzso control of zzso zzso is zzso by episodic zzso zzso and zzso zzso surges of zzso hormone zzso which interacts with specific plasma membrane receptors in zzso zzso Similar zzso receptors and their zzso transcripts were found to be expressed in immortalized zzso zzso which release zzso in a zzso manner in zzso zzso of these zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration responses that were dependent on calcium zzso and entry and were inhibited by zzso zzso Exposure of zzso zzso to a zzso zzso analog caused a transient zzso of zzso release and subsequent suppression of the zzso zzso zzso This was followed by zzso induction of less frequent but larger zzso zzso and ultimately by single massive episodes of zzso zzso The ability of zzso to exert zzso actions on its zzso zzso and to promote episodic release and synchronized discharge of the zzso could reflect the operation of the zzso pulse generator and the genesis of the zzso zzso surge in zzso
