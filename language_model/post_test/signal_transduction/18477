Cell zzso are fascinating zzso zzso that not only form a barrier between compartments but also harbor many chemical reactions essential to the existence and functioning of a zzso Here, it is proposed to review the molecular dynamics and mosaic organization of the plasma zzso which are thought to have important functional zzso We will first zzso the basic concepts of zzso diffusion and zzso domain formation in model zzso and then track the development of ideas and tools in this field, outlining key results obtained on the dynamic processes at work in membrane structure and zzso We will focus in particular on findings made using fluorescent labeling and imaging procedures to record these dynamic zzso We will also discuss a few examples showing the impact of lateral diffusion on cell signal zzso and outline some future zzso challenges which must be met before we can answer some of the questions arising in this field of zzso
