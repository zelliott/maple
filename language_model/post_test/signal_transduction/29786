zzso and zzso play key roles in development and sensory zzso and several human disorders, including zzso kidney disease, are associated with the failure to assemble zzso Here, we show that the aurora protein zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso has a central role in two pathways for eliminating zzso zzso rendered deficient in zzso were defective in regulated zzso zzso and regulated zzso zzso Exposure of cells to altered zzso conditions, the absence of a zzso body for zzso zzso zzso zzso of delivery of zzso components to their tip assembly site, and formation of zzso all led to zzso of the regulated zzso zzso as indicated by zzso of zzso and the absence of zzso We propose that cells have a sensory zzso that detects conditions that are inappropriate for possession of a zzso and that zzso is a key zzso of zzso zzso in that zzso
