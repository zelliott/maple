zzso transplantation is a promising therapy for type 1 zzso however, most zzso zzso fail within 5 zzso zzso immunity has been suggested to play a role in zzso zzso zzso potentially zzso by zzso receptors zzso a class of innate immune zzso Lack of zzso in particular, has been reported to improve zzso zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso may be involved in zzso zzso zzso and that deletion of zzso may improve zzso graft zzso 

zzso were isolated from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso animals and transplanted into zzso recipients with zzso zzso Blood zzso levels were used to determine graft viability and zzso to assess graft zzso and immune cell zzso The roles of the zzso zzso molecules zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso were assessed using zzso isolated from mice lacking zzso zzso zzso zzso or the combined double knockout zzso 

zzso to our hypothesis, zzso and zzso zzso zzso had similar failure zzso zzso failed at zzso and zzso days zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso maintained zzso for up to 10 weeks zzso indicating that failure of zzso zzso zzso could not be attributed to an intrinsic zzso in zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso donors did not have improved zzso survival compared with zzso zzso 

These findings indicate that zzso zzso rejection in mice is independent of zzso and the zzso zzso molecules zzso and zzso speaking against an essential role for zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso
