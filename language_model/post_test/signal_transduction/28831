zzso factors from the family of Signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso are activated by numerous zzso Two members of this family, zzso and zzso zzso called zzso have gained prominence in that they are activated by a wide variety of zzso such as zzso erythropoietin, growth hormone, and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso is observed in the majority of zzso and many solid zzso zzso studies in mice as well as human zzso have provided insight into many of zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling through zzso results in a variety of zzso effects, ranging from a defective immune system and impaired zzso the complete absence of zzso development during pregnancy, to zzso liver zzso On a molecular level, zzso has been linked to cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso Evidence is growing that the diverse outcomes of zzso signaling are not only determined by the expression of specific receptors but also by the interaction of zzso with zzso and the zzso activity of members of the zzso family, which zzso regulate zzso zzso In this review, we focus on emerging concepts and challenges in the field of zzso zzso zzso zzso First, we discuss unique functions of zzso in three distinct zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso and regulatory T zzso Second, we present an example of how zzso can achieve cell specificity in zzso through a physical and functional interaction with the zzso zzso Third, we focus on the relevance of zzso in the development and progression of zzso Next, we discuss lessons derived from human zzso and zzso Finally, we address an emerging issue that the interpretation of experiments from zzso mice and cells might be compromised as these cells might zzso and zzso zzso signals to the zzso zzso and thus acquire inappropriate zzso We propose that mice with zzso in various components of the zzso signaling zzso are living laboratories, which will provide insight into the versatility of signaling hardware and the zzso of the zzso
