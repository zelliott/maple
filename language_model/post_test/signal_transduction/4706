During the last two decades, it became increasingly evident that zzso cells accomplish a more important role in brain function than previously zzso zzso cells express zzso and zzso which are member zzso of two protein families that form membrane channels termed zzso These channels communicate zzso and zzso compartments and allow the release of zzso signaling molecules zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso as well as the zzso of small molecules zzso zzso An increasing body of evidence has situated zzso zzso as potential regulators of the beginning and maintenance of zzso imbalances observed in diverse brain zzso Here, we review and discuss the current evidence about the possible role of zzso zzso on neurodegenerative zzso A zzso pathological threatening condition leads to zzso zzso which keeps active defense and restores the normal function of the central nervous zzso However, if the stimulus is zzso zzso cells and the zzso become zzso both releasing zzso molecules zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which increase the activity of zzso zzso reducing the zzso zzso functions, and further reducing zzso zzso Because zzso and zzso are released via zzso zzso in neurodegenerative conditions, it is expected that they contribute to zzso More importantly, toxic molecules released via zzso zzso could increase the zzso entry in zzso also via zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso blockade of zzso expressed by zzso cells and/or zzso during zzso might prevent zzso
