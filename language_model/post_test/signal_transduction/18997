zzso is a trace element that is essential for the function of many zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso results in defects in innate and acquired immune zzso However, little is known about the zzso by which zinc affects immune cell zzso Here we show that stimulation with the zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso altered the expression of zinc zzso in zzso cells and thereby decreased zzso free zzso A zinc zzso zzso the effects of zzso whereas zinc supplementation or zzso of the gene zzso zzso a zinc zzso whose expression was reduced by zzso inhibited zzso zzso of major zzso complex class II and zzso zzso These results establish a link between zzso zzso signaling and zinc zzso
