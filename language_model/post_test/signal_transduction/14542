The zzso zzso zzso zzso senses small fluctuations of the zzso calcium zzso concentration and translates them into potent changes in zzso hormone zzso zzso the regulatory mechanisms of zzso signal zzso may provide insights into the physiology of the zzso and identify new molecules as potential drug targets for the treatment of osteoporosis and/or zzso zzso can be zzso by protein zzso C zzso and G zzso zzso zzso zzso and has been shown to bind to zzso potentially contributing to zzso of zzso although the mechanisms by which zzso signal zzso is terminated are not zzso We used a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso to delineate zzso zzso zzso cell sorting was used to determine whether zzso zzso contributed to zzso zzso of zzso 2 or 3 reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso by more than zzso whereas a zzso 2 zzso deficient in G zzso binding zzso was without major zzso zzso of zzso 4-6 did not reduce zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso 1 or 2 revealed a modest zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso production zzso which was not observed for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not account for the described zzso Thus, we conclude that zzso zzso of zzso contributes to zzso zzso of zzso zzso to G zzso In contrast, zzso 2 predominantly interferes with G zzso zzso formation by binding to G zzso
