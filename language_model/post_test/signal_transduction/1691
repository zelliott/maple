Our previous reports showed that zzso zzso arising in zzso transgenic mice are resistant to zzso zzso Here we show that induction of zzso in zzso zzso involves a process that is zzso and which depends on the zzso of protein zzso A zzso despite the lower level of zzso type I in these zzso compared to zzso Further, we show that treatment of the zzso with zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso restores their zzso to zzso zzso zzso indicate that zzso restoration of sensitivity to zzso proceeds through a zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso instead of its zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso
