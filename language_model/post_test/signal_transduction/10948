Because expressed at a significant level at the membrane of human T cells, we made the hypothesis that the cellular prion protein zzso could behave as a zzso and be responsible for signal zzso zzso engagement by specific zzso was observed to induce an increase in zzso calcium concentration and led to enhanced activity of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso did not influence calcium zzso or zzso The effect was zzso after the formation of a network involving zzso and zzso zzso to zzso and was inhibited after raft zzso zzso zzso was not restricted to zzso in resting cells but engagement was a prerequisite for signaling zzso with zzso zzso recruitment into zzso These results suggest a role for zzso in signaling zzso and show that lateral zzso of the protein into zzso is important for subsequent signal zzso
