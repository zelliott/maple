The herb zzso zzso zzso has been considered to have zzso properties for diabetes, asthma and neurodegenerative zzso To examine the effects of steaming time and frequency of manufactured red LP zzso on the nerve growth factor zzso zzso ability and zzso zzso signaling pathway, the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso signaling zzso and calcium concentration were analyzed in zzso cells treated with several types of zzso manufactured under different zzso The maximum zzso zzso was observed in zzso cells treated with 50 zzso LP extract steamed for 9 h zzso and with two repeated steps (3 h steaming and 24 h zzso carried out 7 times zzso No significant changes in viability were detected in any of the cells treated with the various zzso with the exception of zzso and zzso In addition, zzso cell differentiation was induced by treatment with the zzso conditional medium zzso collected from the zzso zzso The levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the high affinity zzso zzso signaling zzso were significantly higher in the cells treated with zzso or zzso CM compared with those treated with the vehicle zzso In the low affinity zzso zzso pathway, the expression levels of most components were higher in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells compared with the vehicle zzso zzso However, this level was significantly altered in cells treated with zzso zzso Furthermore, an examination of the zzso function on calcium regulation revealed that only the zzso or zzso cells exhibited changes in zzso and zzso calcium zzso zzso induced a significant decrease in the zzso calcium levels and an increase in the zzso calcium zzso These results suggest the possibility that zzso LP may aid in the relief of neurodegenerative diseases through the zzso zzso ability and zzso signaling zzso
