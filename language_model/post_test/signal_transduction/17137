Regulatory networks composed of interacting genes are responsible for pattern formation and cell type zzso in a wide variety of zzso zzso Evolution must act on these regulatory networks in order to change the proportions, distribution, and characteristics of specified zzso Thus, understanding how these networks operate in zzso systems across multiple levels of zzso divergence is critical for understanding the evolution of zzso zzso Among the most thoroughly characterized regulatory networks is the zzso patterning system of the fly zzso zzso Due to the thorough understanding of this system, it is an ideal starting point for comparative zzso Here we report an analysis of the zzso patterning system of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso a mode of long germ zzso that is zzso nearly identical to that of zzso but one that was likely independently zzso We have found that while the expression of genes just prior to the onset of zzso is almost identical in zzso and zzso both the upstream network responsible for generating this pattern, and the downstream zzso movements that it sets in motion, are significantly zzso From this we conclude that many network structures are available to evolution to achieve particular zzso zzso
