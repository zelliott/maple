We report on a highly ordered array of carbon zzso zzso that serves as a universally direct zzso interface for zzso proteins and provides an efficient zzso for electron zzso The zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso tips is found to have a marked effect on enhancing electron transfer properties, as measured by zzso zzso A zzso electron transfer rate of 1500 zzso has been measured for this system, a value exceeding the rate of oxygen reduction by zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso array zzso can be zzso as a zzso zzso zzso
