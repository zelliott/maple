Critical zzso for zzso zzso in inward zzso zzso channels are only now being zzso The zzso region of zzso plays a crucial role in zzso blockade and single-channel zzso zzso A zzso charged zzso in the putative second zzso domain zzso zzso is essential for zzso block by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso We have now localized the zzso effect in zzso to a single, zzso charged zzso zzso zzso of zzso to G, Q and S drastically reduced zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso decreased block by zzso and zzso and, like the zzso zzso caused a dramatic reduction in the apparent single-channel zzso zzso The double zzso zzso zzso zzso was markedly insensitive to zzso block, displaying an affinity similar to zzso The results are compatible with a model in which the zzso charged zzso at position zzso zzso is a major zzso of pore properties in zzso By means of a specific interaction with the zzso charged zzso at position zzso zzso zzso contributes to the formation of the binding pocket for zzso and zzso a characteristic of strong inward zzso
