Numerous basic and clinical studies have clearly identified that zzso oxygen species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso has a major role in the development of cardiovascular zzso However, we still have no strong therapeutic strategy for clinical benefits of zzso zzso One potential reason for those could be a crucial role of zzso for zzso signaling pathways that is important for vascular functions in a very low zzso zzso contributes to the physiology and pathology of zzso but precise molecular regulations remain zzso The mechanism how excessive zzso zzso zzso deteriorate vascular function and promote vascular diseases has not been clearly zzso zzso A zzso has been studied as a zzso protein that is zzso in a variety of inflammatory conditions, such as zzso arthritis, zzso disease, and zzso zzso has been classified as an zzso and has a variety of zzso functions including zzso zzso protein trafficking, and the regulating other zzso Besides zzso functions, we revealed that zzso is a zzso zzso that has a pathological role in the cardiovascular zzso zzso has emerged as a potential zzso and zzso of cardiovascular zzso
