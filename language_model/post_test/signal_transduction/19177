zzso embryonic stem zzso cells are cultured on a cell layer of mouse embryonic zzso zzso as zzso cells to support zzso growth of zzso zzso In this study, zzso interactions between mouse zzso and zzso cells were artificially engineered via an zzso cell zzso zzso zzso whose expression is considerable in zzso zzso Mouse zzso zzso and zzso cells that were genetically engineered to express zzso were used in zzso cell cultures as zzso zzso zzso cells cultured on the zzso zzso cells maintained the expression of stem cell zzso alkaline zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the efficiency of zzso colony formation was comparable to zzso and much better than parental zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso cells maintained on the zzso zzso cells possessed the ability to differentiate into the three germ layers both in zzso and in zzso The results indicated that zzso expression in zzso cells could improve the performance of zzso cells, which may be further zzso to create new artificial zzso cell zzso
