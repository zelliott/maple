zzso in zzso eye zzso disc is controlled by interactions of positive and negative regulatory zzso The basic zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso plays an essential zzso function in the zzso zzso to induce the formation of zzso founder zzso Bar zzso proteins are required for zzso repression of zzso in the zzso zzso retinal precursor cells to prevent zzso zzso zzso to the zzso of the eye zzso Thus, precise regulation of Bar expression in the zzso zzso cells is crucial for neural patterning in the zzso We show evidence that Bar expression in the zzso zzso cells is regulated by at least three different zzso depending on the zzso time and the position in the eye zzso First, at the time of zzso zzso Bar expression is induced independent of zzso by zzso zzso signaling from the zzso margin of the zzso Second, during zzso zzso Bar expression is also induced by zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso signaling from the zzso zzso Finally, once zzso Bar expression can be maintained by positive zzso zzso we propose that the domain of Bar expression for zzso repression is established and maintained by a combination of non autonomous zzso signaling pathways and zzso of zzso
