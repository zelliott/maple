zzso are zzso by the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso which contains an unusually large regulatory zzso In most zzso zzso expression is under the control of two distinct promoters a zzso and a zzso zzso In humans, this gene contains 10 zzso promoters that are alternatively used in various cell types and zzso Each promoter is regulated by a distinct set of regulatory sequences and zzso factors that bind to these specific zzso The zzso zzso is considered to be the primary signaling cascade through which the zzso zzso promoter is zzso Very interestingly, in rat zzso cells, the zzso promoter is not controlled in a zzso dependent zzso zzso these cells express zzso at high levels similar to those found in zzso zzso suggesting that alternative and powerful mechanisms control zzso expression in zzso cells and that the rat corpus zzso represents an important paradigm for understanding alternative controls of the zzso zzso Here, the molecular and cellular mechanisms controlling the expression of the zzso gene in zzso and zzso cells are zzso
