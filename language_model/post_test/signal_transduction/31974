Previously, we demonstrated that the zzso zzso of type I zzso zzso was required for robust zzso zzso of the downstream adapter zzso zzso zzso with the expression of genes zzso zzso and zzso characteristic of alternatively activated zzso We located an zzso motif zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain but not in the zzso Thus, we predicted that the zzso tail directed enhanced zzso zzso To test this, zzso signaling responses were examined in a zzso of the key zzso motif zzso zzso zzso and different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso or zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso was not diminished in zzso zzso zzso suggesting zzso was not required for the robust insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was observed in zzso cells expressing zzso and zzso but not in zzso and zzso zzso In addition, when zzso cells expressed zzso zzso or zzso with zzso zzso induced zzso only in the zzso and zzso zzso Our data suggest that a smaller (5 zzso zzso zzso than previously determined is necessary for zzso zzso signaling in response to zzso and zzso zzso zzso chains of the zzso tail fused to the zzso zzso and zzso domain did not elicit robust zzso zzso in response to zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso not the zzso zzso control signaling zzso zzso this zzso fully will lead to rational drug design for allergic zzso
