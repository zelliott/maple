The embryonic heart precursors of zzso are arranged in a repeated pattern of zzso zzso There is growing evidence that the development of individual elements of this pattern depends on both zzso intrinsic patterning information and zzso signals from the zzso In this study, we demonstrate that two zzso zzso zzso early and zzso late, are involved in the zzso zzso in zzso Their expression is specific to a subset of zzso and zzso cell precursors and is critically dependent on zzso zzso function, zzso zzso signaling and the coordinate action of zzso zzso zzso regulation by zzso is required to restrict zzso expression to two out of six zzso in each zzso zzso of zzso causes a zzso of heart precursors and alters the identity of zzso zzso zzso Loss of zzso function leads to the opposite zzso suggesting that zzso zzso in the determination of heart lineages and is required to specify the identities of zzso of heart zzso We find that both early zzso signaling and zzso late zzso signaling are required for proper heart zzso Thus, we propose that zzso plays a dual role in zzso zzso during the early phase, it is involved in zzso of a zzso subset of heart precursors as a component of the zzso zzso and zzso during the late phase, it is needed for maintaining wingless activity and thereby sustaining the heart pattern zzso These events result in a diversification of heart cell identities within each zzso
