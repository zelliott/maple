The zzso wing zzso disc is subdivided into zzso hinge and blade territories during the third zzso zzso by formation of several deep zzso zzso The molecular mechanisms of these subdivisions and the subsequent initiation of zzso processes during metamorphosis are poorly zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso genes promote the progression of zzso folds that not only separate the hinge and blade regions of the wing disc but also contribute to zzso development by changing cell shapes and zzso the wing zzso We found that Doc expression was restricted by two zzso zzso and zzso leading to two narrow Doc stripes where the folds separating hinge and blade are zzso Doc zzso clones prevented the lateral extension and deepening of these folds at the zzso stage and delayed wing disc zzso in the early zzso zzso zzso Doc expression was sufficient to generate deep zzso folds by causing a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso web and a zzso of zzso zzso of both the zzso zzso folds and of folds zzso by zzso Doc expression expressed zzso zzso 2 zzso In these zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins were zzso zzso of Doc along the zzso folds caused precocious wing disc bending, which could be suppressed by zzso zzso
