zzso acid zzso and zzso have been well established to be crucial factors controlling seed zzso of zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso and zzso are both critical signals involved in zzso and zzso seed zzso Wild type plants depended on zzso and zzso for seed zzso whereas this dependence on either zzso or zzso was not required for zzso of zzso and zzso as well as their double zzso zzso zzso While seed zzso of wild type plants was sensitively inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were all strongly resistant to zzso or zzso treatments, and in contrast, plants zzso zzso or zzso were zzso to zzso and zzso zzso treatment significantly induced increases in zzso and zzso zzso These results clearly indicate that zzso and zzso are involved in the zzso and sugar signaling in the process of seed zzso Further experiments showed that zzso was capable of inducing zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso and zzso this zzso of zzso and zzso was arrested in the zzso zzso double zzso indicating that the zzso of seed zzso by zzso is potentially resulted from zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
