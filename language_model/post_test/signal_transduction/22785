To get further information on bacterial surface sensing and zzso regulation of gene expression in zzso coli zzso random zzso zzso with zzso zzso a zzso carrying the zzso zzso zzso was performed with an zzso adherent strain, and a simple screen was developed to assess changes in gene expression in zzso cells versus zzso zzso This screen revealed that major changes in the pattern of gene expression occur during zzso development: the zzso of 38% of the genes was affected within zzso Different cell functions were more expressed in zzso zzso the zzso zzso the zzso transport system of zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso formerly called zzso zzso T zzso and the zzso zzso transport system zzso On the other hand, the zzso of zzso zzso and of a putative protein of 92 zzso acids zzso were both reduced in zzso Such a genetic zzso of gene expression in zzso seems to result from changes in multiple environmental zzso zzso In this work, we show that bacteria within zzso encounter zzso conditions, greater oxygen zzso and higher cell density than in the liquid zzso
