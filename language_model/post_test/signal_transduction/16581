zzso radiation and zzso both produce zzso damage and zzso breaks in zzso zzso breaks and zzso damage are highly toxic and cause cell cycle arrest, provoking DNA repair and zzso in cancer cell zzso To investigate the response of normal human cells to agents causing zzso damage, we monitored zzso in gene expression in zzso normal human zzso Treatment with zzso and zzso altered the expression of 23 and 68 known zzso respectively, with no genes in zzso Both agents altered the expression of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, and arrested the treated cells in zzso phase 12 h after zzso 24 h after zzso the percentage of zzso cells increased, whereas after zzso treatment the percentage of zzso cells remained constant for 24 zzso Our results suggest that zzso cells respond differently to zzso and zzso DNA damage, probably using entirely different zzso zzso
