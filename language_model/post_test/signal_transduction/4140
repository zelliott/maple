This study of zzso molecular species in zzso and differentiated zzso zzso zzso cells demonstrated only minor differences in the distribution of species between the zzso and zzso pools of zzso in these zzso The two most prominent species of zzso present in both the zzso and differentiated cells were those containing zzso zzso higher in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Cell differentiation exerted little effect on the distribution of molecular species of zzso between the zzso and zzso pools in zzso cells, although the levels of zzso zzso were significantly lower and the zzso zzso higher in both pools from the differentiated zzso Our results indicate the same species of zzso available at both the outer layer of the plasma membrane and inner layer of the plasma membrane (plus zzso zzso of zzso cells, serve as precursors for generation of the zzso that participate in signal zzso processes initiated by cell zzso
