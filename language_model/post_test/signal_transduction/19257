zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is the most common genetic zzso in type I zzso zzso In the majority of these tumors, zzso expression is lost in the zzso but maintained in tumor zzso Currently reported zzso knockout mouse models initiate type I zzso cancer zzso with loss of zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso outcome of selectively zzso the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso remains zzso To address this question, we established a malleable in zzso zzso zzso system from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso responded to zzso variations in hormonal milieu similar to the native zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso via zzso loss of zzso or zzso of zzso in adult zzso zzso in this model was sufficient to initiate zzso zzso zzso tumors were serially zzso demonstrating permanent genetic changes in zzso zzso zzso confirmed loss of zzso or zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso that were surrounded by zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is sufficient for the initiation of zzso zzso in zzso adult zzso zzso This in zzso model provides an ideal platform for testing the response of zzso zzso to targeted therapy against this common genetic zzso
