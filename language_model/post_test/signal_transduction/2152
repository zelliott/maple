zzso T cell differentiation into cells capable of producing zzso and zzso zzso zzso requires the presence of zzso and is zzso zzso Here we show that zzso is not required for zzso or zzso production by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso did not diminish zzso production by zzso cells in response to zzso zzso nor did zzso enhance zzso production in response to stimulation of zzso cells with limiting amounts of zzso zzso cells prepared from zzso knockout mice were capable of producing zzso zzso in response to stimulation with immobilized zzso zzso did not increase zzso zzso zzso Despite the failure of zzso to effect zzso production by primed zzso cells, a zzso binding element was demonstrated in the zzso zzso The authenticity of this element was demonstrated by zzso competition, by zzso with zzso zzso and by zzso effects on zzso of a reporter gene under the control of a zzso element fused to an zzso minimal zzso Nonetheless, an zzso promoter construct lacking the zzso binding element was as effective as a construct containing this element in zzso reporter zzso Thus, this element, if biologically active, must function at a step in T cell responsiveness distinct from the acute production of zzso by zzso cells in response to zzso or zzso
