To understand the induction of the zzso response under various stress conditions, it is important to determine the partnership between zzso zzso and response regulators in the bacterial zzso system zzso The genes zzso zzso partners are usually comprised of an zzso in the zzso but many of them are orphans in the zzso zzso There is little information on their partnerships in zzso zzso zzso zzso Our comprehensive analysis of zzso interactions among all 37 full-length proteins and the truncated zzso of 24 orphans revealed a number of specific zzso They involved zzso zzso orphan proteins among zzso species such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our investigation of the zzso of interaction partners indicates that orphan zzso comprise a complex signaling zzso
