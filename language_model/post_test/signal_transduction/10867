Cell shrinkage is a ubiquitous feature of programmed cell death zzso but whether it is an obligatory zzso event in zzso is zzso Heat shock protein 70 zzso zzso zzso zzso in many cells, by mechanisms that are incompletely zzso In the present investigation, we found that severe zzso stress greatly diminished the viability of zzso zzso cells zzso and immortalized zzso embryonic zzso zzso This effect was attenuated markedly by zzso zzso To determine whether the protective effect of zzso was zzso via an effect on volume regulatory zzso zzso we compared regulatory volume decrease zzso and increase zzso in control zzso cells and after increasing zzso levels by heat shock or zzso zzso zzso levels affected neither zzso zzso nor the relative contributions of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso stress induced zzso activity in zzso cells and zzso an effect zzso by zzso in zzso cells but inhibited by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with zzso zzso zzso release in zzso and attenuated by zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Treatment with zzso or the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso reduced the viability of zzso cells further under zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso Thus, it is concluded that zzso zzso involves both zzso and zzso death mechanisms and is zzso zzso by zzso
