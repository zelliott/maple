The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso various zzso transitions during its infectious cycle that are triggered by environmental signals encountered inside insect and zzso zzso zzso differentiation of the zzso zzso stage is induced by pH and temperature shifts that affect protein zzso activities and downstream protein zzso Identification of zzso proteins with zzso activity during zzso infection may reveal new targets for pharmacological zzso Here we describe an improved protocol to trace this activity in zzso zzso extracts at high resolution combining zzso zzso zzso and two-dimensional gel zzso This zzso procedure allowed us to identify proteins that are associated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso previously identified by zzso zzso provides a novel tool to establish specific protein zzso relationships thus improving our understanding of zzso signal zzso with relevance for future drug zzso
