zzso availability is a key zzso of animal zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling pathways are two of the best characterized regulators of cell and tissue growth in response to nutritional zzso Studies in zzso larvae show that one mechanism by which these pathways drive growth is by regulating the expression of zzso zzso especially those genes required for protein zzso Here we examine a role for the zzso factor zzso in zzso some of these zzso and growth zzso We find that loss of zzso leads to a decrease in zzso zzso These effects are in part due to a requirement for zzso function in zzso zzso We also uncover a zzso role for zzso activity in the zzso fat zzso Previous studies show that zzso of zzso in the fat body couples nutrition to insulin release from the zzso we find that zzso of zzso in the fat body can zzso effects of zzso deprivation and zzso zzso zzso leading to a reduction in systemic insulin zzso delayed zzso growth and smaller final zzso Using genetic zzso we find that zzso is required for growth downstream of zzso but not zzso zzso Moreover, we show that zzso can control zzso zzso levels, in part via the zzso factor zzso Finally we show that zzso is required for normal expression of many zzso zzso zzso suggesting that one mechanism by which zzso is required for growth is through the control of protein synthetic zzso Together these findings suggest zzso is an essential zzso factor in the nutritional control of cell and tissue growth during zzso zzso Given that zzso is zzso this role may also be important in the control of growth in other zzso
