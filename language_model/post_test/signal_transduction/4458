zzso cancer zzso remains the second most common cause of zzso death in Western zzso A previous zzso study suggested that the nuclear membrane protein zzso zzso to be a maker to discriminate low- and zzso score tumors and to identify high-risk zzso To characterize its function in PC cells, we performed a detailed expression analysis in PC tissue and explored the consequences of down or zzso of zzso zzso in PC zzso Our results confirm an increased zzso zzso protein expression in high-risk zzso and show association of expression with tumor cell zzso at the invasion fronts of tumors and in invasion zzso tumor cell zzso In the prostate tumor cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso small hairpin zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso resulted in zzso or zzso respectively, of cell growth, colony formation, migration and zzso Further mechanism studies suggested that the zzso zzso zzso behavior is regulated through zzso of the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso Western zzso results indicated that zzso or zzso of zzso zzso decreased or increased, respectively, protein levels of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in all three cell zzso zzso in the zzso cell lines zzso and zzso and, increased or zzso respectively, zzso protein levels in zzso zzso zzso Together, our data suggest that zzso zzso proteins are positively involved in zzso behavior of PC cells through the zzso zzso zzso zzso may represent a new zzso factor and a novel therapeutic target for zzso
