Complex systems are often modeled as zzso networks in attempts to capture their logical structure and reveal its zzso zzso zzso the dynamics of continuous variables by discrete values and zzso logic gates may, however, introduce zzso possibilities that are not accessible to the original zzso We show that large random networks of variables coupled through continuous transfer functions often fail to exhibit the complex dynamics of corresponding zzso models in the zzso zzso regime, even when each individual function appears to be a good candidate for zzso zzso A suitably modified zzso theory explains the behavior of systems in which information does not zzso faithfully down certain chains of zzso Model networks incorporating calculated or directly measured transfer functions reported in the literature on zzso regulation of genes are described by the modified zzso
