Human zzso leukemia virus type 1 zzso is an zzso agent of adult zzso zzso zzso is exclusively detected in zzso zzso in infected individuals, but zzso is zzso expressed in zzso zzso lines in zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the role of zzso in the persistent zzso infection in zzso zzso zzso showed that only two out of eight zzso zzso zzso lines expressed zzso whereas all five zzso ones expressed zzso and the level of expression was higher in zzso than in zzso zzso The high zzso expression in zzso cell lines was not due to zzso since zzso had little effect on the expression of zzso in zzso zzso Using western zzso we showed that zzso zzso zzso lines expressed a lower level of expression of the viral zzso regulatory protein Tax than zzso ones, and that the level of expression correlated zzso with that of zzso However, the expression of Tax in one zzso zzso line little affected the expression of zzso suggesting that Tax at least alone does not suppress the expression of zzso in zzso zzso lines, and that other viral or cellular zzso are probably involved in such zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso lines in zzso zzso to the persistent zzso cells in zzso and zzso cells in zzso are immortalized in zzso zzso
