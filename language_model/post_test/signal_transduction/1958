Although hydrogen zzso zzso is generally thought of in terms of a poisonous gas, it is zzso produced in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso selectively enhance zzso zzso responses and alter the induction of zzso long-term zzso zzso Here we use zzso zzso zzso zzso mice to clearly show that CBS produces zzso zzso in the brain and that zzso production is greatly enhanced by the zzso neurotransmitter zzso as well as by electrical zzso This increased CBS activity is regulated by a zzso involving zzso In addition, zzso is altered in CBS zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso is produced by CBS in response to zzso zzso and that it may regulate some aspects of synaptic zzso
