Growth and maintenance of skeletal muscle mass is critical for long-term health and quality of zzso zzso muscle is a highly adaptable tissue with well-known sensitivities to environmental cues such as growth factors, zzso zzso and mechanical zzso All of these factors act at the level of the cell and signal through pathways that lead to changes in zzso through multiple zzso In this review, we discuss the animal and cell culture models used and the signaling mechanisms identified in understanding regulation of protein synthesis in response to mechanical zzso zzso zzso emphasis has been placed on 1) zzso in mechanical loading and regulation of protein synthesis in both in zzso animal studies and in zzso cell culture studies and 2) upstream zzso regulating zzso target of zzso signaling and protein synthesis during skeletal muscle zzso
