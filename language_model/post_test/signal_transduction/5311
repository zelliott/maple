zzso zzso is important for zzso barrier function and regulation of tight junction zzso zzso but the zzso mechanisms of action remain zzso The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that zzso regulates zzso junction integrity and zzso proteins through the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso decreased zzso electrical resistance zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso prevented the zzso decrease and the zzso increase induced by zzso deprivation zzso zzso zzso zzso deprivation also caused decreased zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso treatment prevented this effect zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased zzso zzso zzso supplementation reversed this zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso associated with zzso deprivation were not observed in small interfering zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso regulates zzso junction integrity and zzso proteins through the zzso zzso
