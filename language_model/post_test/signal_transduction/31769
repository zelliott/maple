In cancer, zzso signaling can produce an invasive cellular zzso We modeled the invasive transition as a theoretical switch between two zzso zzso focal zzso and zzso zzso zzso We constructed molecular interaction networks of each structure and identified upstream regulatory hubs through zzso zzso We compared these regulatory hubs to the status of signaling components from head and neck zzso which led us to analyze zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso with previous studies, zzso activity promoted both the formation and the activity of zzso We found that zzso induction of zzso was increased by zzso of zzso zzso zzso 2) zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso which converts the zzso zzso zzso that is produced by zzso activity to zzso zzso zzso which is believed to promote zzso zzso zzso of zzso had divergent effects on zzso formation, depending on the status of zzso Loss of zzso inhibited zzso formation in cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in cells with zzso active zzso (through zzso zzso zzso or lacking the zzso opposing zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso studies revealed a negative feedback loop from zzso that dampened zzso activity and invasive behavior in cells with genetic zzso of the zzso zzso These studies demonstrated the potential of network modeling as a discovery tool and identified zzso and zzso as interacting regulators of invasive zzso
