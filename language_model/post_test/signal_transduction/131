The zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso signals into mouse embryonic stem zzso cells to maintain zzso Although the zzso zzso is essential and sufficient to mediate zzso signals, it is still unclear how these signals are linked to the core zzso of zzso zzso factors, consisting of zzso (also called zzso zzso and zzso Here we show that two zzso zzso pathways are each connected to the core zzso via different zzso zzso In mouse zzso cells, zzso is mainly activated by the zzso zzso and zzso activates zzso whereas zzso is zzso regulated by the zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso pathways and predominantly stimulates zzso In the absence of zzso artificial expression of zzso or zzso is sufficient to maintain zzso while maintaining the expression of zzso zzso zzso of zzso supports zzso zzso of mouse zzso cells in the absence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are involved in zzso zzso zzso to the core zzso but are not directly associated with the maintenance of zzso because zzso cells keep zzso without their expression in the particular zzso
