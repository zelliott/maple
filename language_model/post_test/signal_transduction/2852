The initiation of T cell responses against zzso requires two distinct zzso The first, the essential signal is the engagement of T cell zzso to zzso zzso in the context of zzso molecules on zzso presenting cells zzso The presence of the second signal zzso zzso determines whether responding T cells to be fully responsive or to be zzso zzso specific zzso There are numbers of such zzso zzso pairs including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Among those zzso zzso pairs, zzso zzso is chosen and the molecular mechanism how T cell responses are regulated by zzso is zzso
