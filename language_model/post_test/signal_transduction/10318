zzso release by viable cells is a feature of activated cell types, including tumors, fetal cells, and cells of the immune zzso zzso critically regulate immune zzso by zzso zzso cell zzso Fetal cells may mimic these events to selectively delete zzso zzso In this study the presence and composition of zzso zzso are demonstrated in the maternal circulation along with their consequences on T cell zzso zzso For all pregnant patients, zzso were isolated from zzso obtained between 28 and 30 zzso zzso For pregnant women, subsequently delivering at term, circulating levels of zzso zzso were zzso times greater than those delivering zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso subsequently delivering at term expressed significantly higher levels of biologically active zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso than those from zzso delivering zzso zzso for protein zzso zzso from zzso zzso exhibited greater suppression of zzso and zzso than those delivering zzso The suppression of zzso and zzso correlated with zzso expression levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso by continuously zzso zzso indicated that intact 42 zzso zzso and an unidentified zzso protein were associated with zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso from zzso ultimately delivering at term are present at significantly greater zzso than those from zzso delivering zzso however, zzso from zzso zzso also exhibit significantly greater suppression of zzso and zzso
