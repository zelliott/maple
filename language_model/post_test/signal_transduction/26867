zzso zzso in the gene zzso zzso have been identified in the zzso form of human zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso benign but aggressive zzso zzso accounting for up to zzso of zzso zzso zzso Recently, we generated an zzso mouse model and revealed that, as in human zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso occurs only in a very small proportion of cells, which form zzso Here, combining mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso techniques, we have isolated these cells from zzso mouse zzso and shown that the zzso cells are enriched for zzso cells when cultured in stem zzso media, and have longer zzso indicating shared properties with normal zzso zzso cells zzso Global gene profiling analysis has revealed that these zzso cells express high levels of zzso zzso signals, such as members of the zzso zzso and zzso family, in addition to several zzso and their zzso suggesting an important zzso role of these cells in the zzso of zzso and a zzso communication with their zzso Finally, we highlight the clinical relevance of these findings by showing that these pathways are also zzso in the zzso cell clusters identified in human zzso As well as providing further support to the concept that zzso stem cells may play an important role in the zzso of human zzso our data reveal novel disease zzso and potential pharmacological targets for the treatment of these devastating childhood zzso
