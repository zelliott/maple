Although zzso have altered zzso zzso termed the Warburg effect, which describes the increased zzso and conversion of zzso to zzso by cancer cells under adequate oxygen tension, changes in the metabolism of zzso and fatty acid have also been zzso The zzso zzso which contributes to the genesis of many human zzso encodes a zzso factor zzso which links altered cellular metabolism to zzso zzso regulates genes involved in the zzso of zzso and zzso and regulation of zzso and zzso zzso With zzso zzso zzso genes involved in zzso metabolism and DNA zzso and zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso With the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso program for hypoxic zzso zzso regulates gene expression either directly, such as zzso genes including zzso zzso A zzso or zzso such as repression of zzso zzso to increase zzso zzso protein expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso therefore, could zzso drive zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso to provide sufficient energy and anabolic zzso for cell growth and proliferation in the context of the tumor zzso zzso these studies indicate that zzso altered cancer cell energy metabolism could be translated for the development of new zzso zzso
