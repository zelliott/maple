A zzso interaction has been reported to occur in the zzso interface of the zzso zzso crystal zzso We sought to investigate whether a similar phenomenon could be observed with zzso zzso zzso and if so, to assess the role of cholesterol in this class of G zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was determined to be the zzso site of zzso zzso of this zzso to Ala did not affect the binding of zzso but attenuated zzso signaling and decreased cholesterol associated with the zzso signaling zzso In addition, both zzso of zzso zzso (by zzso of zzso to zzso and zzso of cholesterol synthesis (by treating the cells with zzso a zzso zzso zzso impaired zzso zzso possibly by decreasing zzso zzso and zzso zzso this was demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso resonance energy transfer zzso zzso A zzso model of the zzso zzso structure indicated that a specific zzso interaction can facilitate zzso zzso at the zzso zzso 

We demonstrate that zzso is the zzso site of zzso and identify a zzso interaction in the zzso zzso Our findings suggest that this interaction contributes to zzso signaling by zzso zzso zzso and G protein zzso This conclusion is supported by zzso modeling of the zzso zzso
