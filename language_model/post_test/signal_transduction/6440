zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are known to have zzso properties that include the zzso of zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and inflammatory gene zzso We have recently observed that increased expression of heat shock protein zzso zzso with, but is not required for, the zzso actions of zzso zzso on zzso zzso In this study, we provide evidence that the zzso actions of zzso zzso on zzso signaling are associated with zzso zzso zzso stress or unfolded protein response zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso zzso zzso at zzso that inhibit zzso zzso stimulates zzso of zzso initiation zzso and this event is followed by a rapid zzso of protein zzso Under conditions of impaired translation, zzso zzso stimulate the expression of a number of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso stress zzso in response to zzso zzso or known zzso zzso results in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso induce zzso stress, that zzso stress zzso is associated with an zzso of zzso signaling in zzso and that the zzso of responsiveness to zzso stimuli appears to be a novel protective action of the zzso in cells undergoing zzso zzso
