zzso is a key regulator of the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso syndrome protein zzso Although several studies have separately demonstrated the requirement for both zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso their precise roles in the signal cascade leading to zzso are still zzso Reduction of zzso zzso expression by using zzso interference (short hairpin zzso zzso severely impaired the zzso capacity of zzso zzso due to defects in zzso cup formation, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso a zzso zzso inhibitor showed extensive zzso of zzso zzso zzso and cell extension identical to the zzso seen upon reduction of zzso zzso However, using zzso bone zzso zzso or zzso of zzso or zzso indicated a requirement for both zzso and zzso in zzso zzso was necessary for zzso zzso as determined using a zzso zzso against zzso and partial restoration of zzso in zzso reduced cells by expression of a zzso activated zzso In addition, zzso was required for proper zzso zzso zzso which was also necessary for zzso These results indicate that zzso is essential for the zzso of zzso and zzso leading to zzso assembly and zzso cup formation by zzso during zzso zzso
