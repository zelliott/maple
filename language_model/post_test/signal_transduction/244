zzso and/or amplification of the zzso zzso as well as zzso of the zzso tumor zzso are two important genetic events in human breast zzso To address the biological impact of conditional zzso of zzso on zzso zzso zzso we generated a novel transgenic mouse model that zzso the zzso zzso tumor virus zzso promoter to directly couple expression of activated zzso and zzso zzso to the same zzso zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso model system dramatically accelerated the formation of zzso and highly zzso zzso tumors, which exhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with an increase in zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso in the zzso mouse model resulted in zzso of the zzso zzso signaling zzso However, like the parental strain, tumors obtained from zzso mice displayed zzso and molecular features of the zzso zzso of primary human breast zzso Taken together, our findings provide important implications in understanding the molecular zzso of zzso zzso driven by zzso zzso and zzso zzso and could provide a valuable tool for testing the efficacy of therapeutic strategies that target these critical signaling zzso
