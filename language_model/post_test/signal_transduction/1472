zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in animal cap when zzso Here we generated zzso fusion construct zzso to perform zzso study for this zzso zzso zzso showed an extremely zzso effect, causing a partial secondary embryonic axis when expressed at zzso marginal zone of zzso In zzso marginal zone cells, this zzso protein induced organizer genes and suppressed zzso markers mimicking those effects reported for dominant negative zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso rescued the zzso zzso caused by the zzso zzso expression of zzso but not by that of zzso These results suggested that zzso functions at downstream of zzso as a zzso zzso which acts separately from zzso and the dominant negative effect gained by this specific zzso is zzso for the further studies of zzso downstream zzso
