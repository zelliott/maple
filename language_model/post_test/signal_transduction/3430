The discrete modeling zzso of zzso Thomas is a well known approach for the modeling and analysis of Biological Regulatory Networks zzso This zzso uses a set of parameters which reflect the dynamics of the zzso under zzso These parameters are initially unknown but may be deduced from the appropriately chosen observed dynamics of a zzso The discrete model can be further enriched by using the model checking tool zzso along with delay zzso This zzso the way to accurately zzso a zzso and to make predictions about critical zzso which lead to a normal or diseased zzso In this paper, we apply the formal discrete and hybrid zzso and zzso modeling approaches to characterize behavior of the zzso associated with zzso zzso key protein involved with innate immune response to zzso In order to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our current work, different zzso and corresponding conditions that may lead to the development of cerebral malaria zzso are zzso Our results suggest that the system zzso towards zzso if zzso zzso zzso zzso remains zzso active along with pre-existing high zzso levels which may play an important role in CM zzso
