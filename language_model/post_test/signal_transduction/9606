Cell signaling is a complex process which controls basic cellular activities and coordinates actions to zzso normal cellular zzso zzso in signaling processes have been associated with zzso diseases, such as Alzheimer's and zzso zzso as well as cancer, zzso and zzso Recent evidence also indicates a role for signaling molecules in the adverse effects associated with the exposure to environmental zzso One of these signaling molecules is zzso acid zzso AA is abundant in the membrane zzso of the brain, where its release has been shown to be involved in synaptic plasticity zzso such as long-term zzso AA release is primarily produced by the zzso of zzso most commonly by zzso zzso zzso The release of zzso is often used as a measure of zzso activity in cell culture zzso In our laboratory, we have demonstrated the relationship between the stimulation of zzso release by persistent zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the associated zzso following in zzso zzso zzso the role of the AA signaling zzso in zzso effects on the nervous system will provide specific mode of action information that can be used in assessing the compound zzso
