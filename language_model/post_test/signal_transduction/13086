The mechanisms underlying the action of the potent zzso zzso zzso are poorly zzso Here we show that, in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein with potential zzso effect, via a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein synthesis or activity significantly reversed the zzso effect of zzso on production of tumor necrosis zzso induced by zzso zzso Additional experiments revealed the involvement of carbon zzso one of the products of zzso zzso degradation, in the zzso effect of zzso in zzso zzso of zzso by zzso was also evident in zzso zzso protection against zzso septic shock in mice was significantly attenuated by zzso with the HO zzso zinc zzso The identification of zzso as a downstream zzso of zzso provides new possibilities for improved therapeutic approaches for treating inflammatory zzso
