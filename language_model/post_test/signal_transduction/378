zzso syndrome zzso is a familial cancer disorder due to inherited loss of function zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients develop gastrointestinal zzso with zzso zzso often in the second decade of life, and demonstrate an increased predisposition toward the development of a number of additional zzso Among zzso signaling zzso the zzso of zzso complex 1 zzso zzso is zzso in zzso and tumors derived from zzso zzso zzso with a central role for zzso in these tumors, zzso as a single agent results in a dramatic suppression of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, the key targets of zzso in zzso tumors remain zzso We demonstrate here that these zzso and zzso and zzso mouse embryonic zzso show dramatic zzso of the zzso zzso factor and its downstream zzso targets in an zzso zzso The zzso targets zzso II and zzso are zzso in these zzso and using zzso we demonstrate that zzso mice show increased zzso zzso in focal regions of their zzso tract corresponding to these gastrointestinal zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso from human zzso patients similarly exhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, like zzso and its target zzso the zzso signal in the zzso tract of these mice is abolished by zzso zzso These findings suggest a number of therapeutic zzso for the treatment and detection of zzso in zzso patients, and potential for the screening and treatment of the zzso of sporadic human lung zzso bearing zzso zzso
