The molecular mechanisms that render a carotid zzso plaque symptomatic have not yet been zzso Using an zzso Human zzso set, we analyzed the gene expression patterns of 44 zzso zzso transcripts in surgically removed carotid artery plaques from six patients with symptomatic stroke and four zzso zzso The age, body mass index and the degree of zzso were similar in the two zzso Some 236 transcripts zzso zzso of the total transcripts zzso were expressed more abundantly in the symptomatic than the zzso zzso Of these, 61 transcripts are those that participate in zzso zzso signal zzso and zzso The other groups of transcripts zzso in the symptomatic plaques include zzso growth factors, tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso factors, and zzso zzso and processing zzso This study indicates that the higher zzso activity in some zzso plaques leads to their faster growth and zzso of stroke zzso The implications of these findings are that both diagnosis and prevention of stroke symptoms may become possible at the genetic zzso
