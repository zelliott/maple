We analyzed expression of candidate genes zzso cell surface or zzso proteins in normal kidney and kidney zzso This screen identified a bone zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso in kidney zzso To confirm screening results, we zzso zzso dot blots with zzso The zzso message was decreased in zzso kidney tumors compared with normal kidney zzso zzso confirmed significant decrease of zzso protein in clear cell zzso zzso relative to normal zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was not decreased in zzso and zzso kidney zzso zzso was abundantly expressed in zzso zzso zzso and transitional zzso of the normal zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso is zzso and binds to neighboring cells and/or the zzso zzso zzso suppresses both zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Restoration of zzso in zzso clear zzso cells profoundly suppresses zzso zzso these results demonstrate that zzso is expressed in the human kidney and decreased in zzso clear cell zzso Because zzso suppresses proliferation of zzso zzso cells, restoration of zzso signaling may represent a novel target in treatment of zzso clear cell zzso
