zzso A virus zzso is a zzso zzso and in zzso cells zzso zzso a number of zzso processes by interacting with cellular zzso Here, we report that zzso binds directly to zzso a regulatory zzso of zzso zzso but not to the related zzso zzso zzso of zzso in influenza zzso cells depended on zzso zzso and showed zzso that correlated with zzso zzso Additionally, it was found that expression of zzso alone was sufficient to zzso activate zzso causing the zzso of a downstream zzso of zzso signal zzso zzso zzso analysis of a potential zzso motif within zzso indicated that the highly zzso zzso at zzso 89 is important for both the interaction with zzso and the zzso of zzso A zzso influenza virus zzso expressing zzso with the zzso zzso acid substitution exhibited a zzso zzso and grew more slowly in tissue culture than zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso of zzso signaling in influenza A zzso cells is important for efficient virus zzso
