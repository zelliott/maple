The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is critical for T cell development and mature T cell zzso zzso zzso however, the structural requirements of zzso for zzso zzso and mature T cell function remain largely zzso In this study, transgenic mice were generated to examine the requirements for specific zzso of zzso in zzso and peripheral T cells in zzso zzso of mice expressing various zzso of zzso on the zzso background demonstrates a differential requirement for specific zzso of zzso in zzso and T cells and provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso
