Plants have developed a complex zzso network to fight off invading zzso In recent years, the full importance of zzso molecular pattern zzso immunity zzso within this network became zzso Several new zzso have been isolated and new zzso receptors zzso zzso The discovery of the zzso protein zzso sheds light on the immediate downstream zzso zzso Further, zzso analyses identified a core set of approximately 100 zzso zzso These studies also revealed a significant overlap with genes regulated during zzso immunity zzso zzso zzso seems to operate by alleviating the negative feedback regulation of zzso leading to stronger zzso This review discusses recent findings in zzso recognition and zzso and illustrates the need to discover new regulators of zzso responses for a full understanding of plant innate zzso
