zzso of muscle zzso plays a critical role in muscle zzso caused by zzso zzso because zzso gene zzso prevents muscle zzso caused by zzso The goal of the present study was to identify the zzso zzso responsible for the zzso zzso action in zzso muscle zzso We first assessed the zzso zzso zzso zzso caused by zzso administration and their zzso by local zzso zzso performed by zzso Muscle zzso induced by zzso zzso administration occurred with a decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso together with a decrease in zzso protein levels zzso zzso Prevention of zzso by zzso was associated with restoration of zzso zzso and zzso zzso We then investigated whether muscle zzso of these zzso zzso could mimic the zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso active form of zzso induced a marked fiber zzso in zzso animals zzso of zzso area; zzso and prevented zzso zzso This zzso was associated with an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso content zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of a zzso zzso or a stable form of zzso increased fiber zzso area by, respectively, zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso rats, preventing completely the zzso effect of zzso In conclusion, this work indicates that zzso zzso and zzso probably contribute together to the zzso zzso effect in zzso muscle zzso
