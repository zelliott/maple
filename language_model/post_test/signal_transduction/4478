zzso interactions between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are fundamental to signal zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso linked through zzso bonds between internal zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso can be assembled with varied zzso to mediate different cellular zzso We have developed and applied a rapid and sensitive zzso zzso zzso zzso method to determine zzso zzso and affinity of zzso zzso We demonstrate the technique using zzso and zzso complexes with a number of zzso and zzso zzso zzso from proteins with roles in neurodegenerative diseases and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso range were determined to be in excellent agreement with data derived from other zzso techniques, where zzso Application of the methodology provided further insights into the zzso linkage specificity of the zzso domain, confirming its role in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain of zzso showed no linkage specificity for zzso zzso and the zzso zzso also exhibited little or no zzso The discovery that a number of zzso are able to bind zzso zzso zzso with affinities similar to those for the zzso form indicates that zzso zzso may be capable of playing a role in zzso zzso of a zzso complex involving zzso interacting simultaneously with two different zzso demonstrated the zzso of zzso zzso opening the way for the study of zzso between individual zzso zzso
