Previous studies showed that centrally administered zzso and zzso exert different effects on food zzso decreasing and zzso increasing food zzso Because of the uncertainty of whether zzso can cross the zzso the question is zzso can dietary zzso directly enter the zzso Evidence is presented that zzso administered by zzso zzso injection to mice is rapidly zzso zzso converted to zzso in the zzso Thus, zzso can cross the zzso to enter the zzso for conversion to zzso without prior zzso conversion to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is not, however, responsible for the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso administered at a level equivalent to that of zzso generates a higher level of zzso zzso which rapidly triggers zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with these findings, zzso or centrally zzso administered zzso rapidly increases zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suppresses the expression of the zzso and increases the expression of the zzso zzso which decrease food zzso All downstream effects of zzso zzso are blocked by zzso administered zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso thus zzso the central action of zzso
