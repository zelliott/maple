zzso exhibit a complex network of zzso and zzso signaling zzso which interact with each other to maintain an zzso balance and zzso cellular responses to external zzso During most of the 1980s, a great effort was put into the characterization of zzso cell surface receptors for zzso and growth zzso In the last decade, a large number of zzso receptors have been identified and it has become apparent that zzso signaling pathways are subject to intricate regulatory zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways work in concert with each other to establish zzso thresholds and provide sensitive tuning mechanisms that help control cellular zzso zzso are a novel family of zzso and zzso receptors expressed both in zzso and zzso zzso They contain two or four zzso zzso in the zzso region and their zzso zzso are either very short and without any signaling motifs or are long and contain a variable number of zzso zzso zzso motifs zzso zzso within the first group send zzso signals by association with the zzso common gamma chain and zzso within the second group deliver zzso signals by association with the protein zzso zzso zzso This review summarizes our current knowledge on the zzso their zzso and biological zzso
