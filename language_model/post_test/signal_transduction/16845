The root architecture of higher plants is amazingly zzso In this review, we compare the lateral root zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso In zzso cells in the zzso are recruited to form the new root cap and zzso cortical cells divide to facilitate the emergence of the lateral root zzso The zzso zzso receptors and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso regulatory proteins are zzso in zzso and zzso Several elements of this regulatory network are common to lateral and crown roots in zzso Also, the ground zzso from which crown roots differentiate shows similarities with the root zzso Studies in zzso promise to give complementary insights into the mechanisms regulating the development of zzso roots in zzso
