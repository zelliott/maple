zzso zzso zzso is zzso in zzso zzso including breast zzso though the mechanism of zzso is zzso This study aimed to determine zzso expression in zzso zzso in zzso zzso in comparison to invasive breast cancer zzso and normal breast, and also to investigate the relationship of zzso expression with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grade and cellular proliferation zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression were determined by zzso on zzso tissue sections of zzso zzso zzso zzso and normal breast reduction tissue zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was significantly greater than in normal breast zzso There was no difference in zzso expression level between zzso and zzso zzso or between normal breast from reduction zzso tissue and normal breast ducts around zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso expression was associated with higher cellular proliferation rates zzso nuclear grade zzso with zzso zzso zzso and with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is zzso in in zzso breast cancer and is associated with surrogate markers of an aggressive zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may potentially prevent the development of zzso and zzso breast zzso
