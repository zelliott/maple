Since many receptors apparently contain only one or two zzso zzso their zzso zzso should be zzso This feature suggests that these receptors share common mechanisms of zzso zzso To test the degree of conservation of signaling properties, a zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso domain of the zzso coli zzso zzso and the zzso portion of the human insulin zzso was zzso This zzso zzso is active as a zzso zzso and zzso stimulates its zzso Some interesting differences are noted in the target proteins zzso by the zzso compared to the zzso insulin zzso These results indicate that features of the signaling mechanisms used by these diverse receptors are zzso but that interesting changes in the protein properties are caused by differences in the neighboring zzso
