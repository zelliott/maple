zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso depends on zzso via the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso at the poles of the zzso triggers restricted expression of the zzso gap genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this paper, we show that the Groucho zzso zzso acts in this process to zzso terminal gap gene expression to the embryonic zzso zzso lacking maternal zzso activity display zzso zzso and zzso zzso the former zzso in turn, to lack of abdominal expression of the zzso and zzso gap zzso We show that torso zzso permits terminal gap gene expression by zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso is employed in diverse zzso contexts and, probably, by a variety of zzso zzso
