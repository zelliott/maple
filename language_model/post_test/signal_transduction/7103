The skeleton is no longer seen as a static, isolated, and mostly structural zzso Over the last two decades, a more complete picture of the multiple functions of the skeleton has emerged, and its interactions with a growing number of apparently unrelated zzso have become zzso The skeleton not only zzso to mechanical loading and zzso zzso and mineral challenges, but also acts of its own zzso by zzso factors controlling the function of other zzso including the kidney and possibly the zzso and zzso It is thus becoming widely recognized that it is by nature an zzso organ, in addition to a structural organ and site of mineral storage and zzso zzso and by definition, bone zzso must be tightly regulated and integrated with the biology of other zzso to maintain whole body zzso and data uncovering the involvement of the central nervous system zzso in the control of bone zzso support this zzso The sympathetic nervous system zzso represents one of the main links between the zzso and the zzso based on a number of zzso zzso and genetic studies focused on zzso zzso zzso signaling in bone zzso The goal of this report was to review the data supporting the role of the zzso and zzso signaling in the regulation of skeletal zzso
