zzso zzso and zzso injury induce transient or permanent zzso failure, and may result in zzso zzso or zzso We have previously shown that zzso depletion and zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso during zzso injury zzso zzso zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however, also exerts zzso functions in zzso The molecular switches that determine these differential outcomes are not well zzso Using an approach combining zzso zzso imaging and zzso zzso we here demonstrate that zzso injury activated the zzso promoter in a zzso zzso The zzso of zzso reduced zzso zzso and led to zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that zzso gene zzso during zzso injury required direct zzso zzso by zzso in the nucleus as a second zzso zzso zzso of this zzso prevented zzso expression and protected zzso against zzso and zzso zzso zzso Systems analysis and zzso modeling revealed that these two zzso steps defined a coherent zzso zzso a network motif capable of filtering any effects of short-term zzso zzso on zzso gene zzso This may prevent unwanted zzso zzso expression and zzso during transient or zzso zzso zzso
