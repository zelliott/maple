Type I zzso the major component of zzso zzso in skin and other zzso is a zzso of two zzso and one zzso collagen zzso The synthesis of both chains is highly regulated by different zzso at the zzso zzso zzso synthesis and deposition of collagen in the zzso region causes thick and hard skin, a clinical manifestation of zzso To better understand the causes of zzso or other tissue fibrosis, it is very important to investigate the molecular mechanisms that cause zzso of the Type I collagen synthesis in these zzso Several zzso regulatory elements and zzso protein factors, which are involved in zzso as well as zzso Type I collagen gene zzso have been identified and zzso zzso of Type I collagen in zzso skin zzso may be due to abnormal activities of different positive or negative zzso factors in response to different zzso induced signaling zzso In this review, I discuss the present day understanding about the involvement of different factors in the regulation of zzso as well as zzso Type I collagen gene expression and its implication in zzso zzso
