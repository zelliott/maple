A small zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and certain related species causes zzso zzso effects in the host zzso Although recent studies have uncovered some of the upstream events zzso this zzso the mechanisms through which this signal is relayed downstream leading to the eventual induction of zzso pathways remain zzso 

In this study, we employed zzso DNA zzso and quantitative zzso to examine the zzso of an zzso disruption zzso that is completely deficient in the production of zzso a major zzso zzso zzso The production of zzso another prominent antibiotic, was, however, zzso only marginally in the zzso Principal component analysis of zzso gene expression profiles identified two major gene classes each exhibiting a distinct coordinate differential expression zzso Surprisingly, nearly zzso of the zzso zzso expressed genes were conspicuously associated with zzso zzso response, particularly those of zzso nitrogen and zzso Furthermore, expression profiles of some zzso regulators including at least two zzso factors were zzso in the zzso In almost every case, the effect of zzso disruption was not observed until the onset of stationary zzso 

Our data suggests a comprehensive role for zzso zzso zzso as a master regulator of both zzso synthesis and nutritional stress response, reminiscent of alternative zzso factors found in several zzso
