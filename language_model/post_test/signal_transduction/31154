zzso is a member of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Previous studies have demonstrated high levels of expression in several regions of the central nervous system, and a zzso active form of zzso promotes zzso zzso cellular zzso survival, and zzso However, the zzso functions of zzso during zzso and zzso development have not been zzso By using a specific zzso zzso we demonstrated a high level of zzso expression in zzso in addition to zzso zzso zzso was activated by several zzso factors in zzso including zzso growth factor zzso basic zzso growth factor, and zzso growth zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso by zzso was more sustained compared to zzso zzso A mouse strain deficient in zzso was generated to investigate its role in zzso zzso zzso mice appeared zzso normal, and there was a lack of zzso zzso and neurological zzso In addition, primary zzso derived from zzso mice did not appear to display substantial zzso in the zzso of both the zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso pathways in response to zzso zzso
