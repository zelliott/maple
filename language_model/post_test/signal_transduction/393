The zzso zzso signal zzso system regulates the expression of genes in response to stimuli associated with the maintenance of the bacterial cell zzso Additionally, the zzso system is important for zzso in several bacterial zzso In this study, we analyzed the zzso system of the human zzso zzso zzso We provide evidence that zzso of zzso is zzso and that the response regulator zzso zzso affects zzso of zzso coding for the zzso function zzso factor zzso thereby linking at the zzso level two systems involved in envelope zzso A zzso form of zzso that cannot be zzso zzso affects zzso of zzso and zzso similar to the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso zzso regulate zzso of zzso indicating zzso and zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso Moreover, overproduction of zzso zzso and zzso result in a growth zzso Interestingly, a zzso zzso strain could not be zzso We conclude that the zzso status of zzso needs to be tightly controlled by zzso and that the zzso system has a central role in regulating basic cellular zzso In addition, we show that zzso and zzso zzso strains have no zzso in zzso zzso invasion of host zzso
