The purpose of this study was to develop a framework for analyzing retinal zzso zzso zzso expression profiles from zzso eye zzso 

The fish model we used was zzso zzso zzso zzso dependent regulator of zzso zzso zzso member 4 zzso a retinal zzso zzso with a previously described retinal zzso and expression zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses were conducted to characterize the zzso defects and underlying differential zzso zzso 

zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso was formed, but its differentiation was zzso In particular, zzso analysis of zzso zzso by transmission electron zzso demonstrated several defects in zzso The nature of these defects also suggests that the zzso zzso which are tightly linked with zzso were impaired in zzso zzso To compare the expression profile of normal zzso zzso and zzso zzso the gene expression profiles of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were measured with zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression values were then estimated from these samples by zzso the retinal expression values from the expression values of the zzso zzso A zzso analysis was conducted using the expression values of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso rules zzso were built using the zzso of the resulting fitted models to select for three groups of zzso 1) zzso zzso zzso 2) zzso retinal zzso and 3) zzso zzso genes that are not zzso expressed in the zzso Interestingly, the third group consists of 39 genes that are highly related to zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso signal zzso 

Our zzso framework provides an experimental approach to identify zzso genes in the zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso in which both of these zzso are affected by the underlying zzso Specifically, we have used the method to identify a group of 39 genes that can potentially explain the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In addition, several genes in this group are zzso signaling zzso Thus, this observation further implicates that the zzso zzso might play a role in the retinal zzso zzso in zzso
