The innate immune system is a universal and ancient form of host defense against zzso zzso immune recognition relies on a limited number of zzso zzso These receptors evolved to recognize zzso products of microbial metabolism produced by microbial zzso but not by the zzso zzso of these molecular structures allows the immune system to distinguish infectious zzso from zzso zzso zzso receptors play a major role in pathogen recognition and initiation of inflammatory and immune zzso zzso of zzso receptors by microbial products leads to the zzso of signaling pathways that result in the induction of zzso genes and inflammatory zzso In addition, stimulation of zzso receptors triggers zzso cell maturation and results in the induction of zzso molecules and increased zzso zzso Thus, microbial recognition by zzso receptors helps to direct zzso immune responses to zzso derived from microbial zzso
