The upper lip and primary zzso form an essential separation between the brain, zzso structures and the oral zzso zzso little is known about the development of these structures, despite the fact that abnormalities can result in various forms of zzso zzso We have uncovered that zzso acid is a critical regulator of upper lip and primary zzso development in zzso zzso zzso acid synthesis zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso gamma zzso are expressed in complementary and partially overlapping regions of the zzso zzso that fate mapping revealed contribute to the upper lip and primary zzso zzso zzso and zzso result in a median zzso in the upper lip and primary zzso To further understand how zzso acid regulates upper lip and zzso zzso we searched for genes zzso in response to zzso zzso in zzso zzso and uncovered zzso genes zzso and zzso These genes are both expressed in overlapping zzso with zzso and together their loss of function also results in a median zzso in the upper lip and primary zzso zzso of zzso and decreased zzso function result in decreased cell proliferation and failure of zzso anterior zzso to zzso These results suggest a model zzso zzso acid signaling regulates zzso and zzso which together direct the tissue growth and differentiation necessary for the upper lip and primary zzso zzso This work has the potential to better understand the complex nature of the upper lip and primary zzso development which will lead to important insights into the zzso of human zzso zzso
