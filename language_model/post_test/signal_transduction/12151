zzso zzso is an inflammatory disease with distinct zzso and zzso zzso 

The objective was to analyze the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and collagen deposition in chronic zzso 

zzso zzso samples obtained from chronic zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chronic zzso without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and controls zzso zzso 10) were analyzed for zzso zzso 1 and 2 by means of zzso and zzso and for zzso zzso 2, and 3 by zzso and zzso As downstream zzso zzso 2 zzso 2) and collagen were analyzed by performing zzso and zzso red zzso zzso 

zzso 1 and 2 protein zzso zzso zzso zzso I and zzso zzso zzso zzso the number of zzso zzso cells, and total collagen amount were significantly higher in zzso versus zzso In zzso zzso 1 protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the number of zzso zzso cells, and total collagen amount were significantly lower versus zzso Only zzso 2 protein was found higher in zzso versus zzso 

A high zzso 1 protein zzso increased zzso zzso zzso and a high number of zzso zzso cells all indicate an enhanced zzso signaling in zzso whereas a low zzso 1 protein zzso a decreased expression of zzso zzso and a low number of zzso zzso cells in zzso indicate a low level of zzso signaling in zzso These findings are compatible with the zzso patterns observed, reflected by a lack of collagen in zzso and excessive collagen production with zzso of the collagen fibers in the zzso zzso in zzso
