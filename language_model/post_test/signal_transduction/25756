zzso cell plasticity enables certain types of highly zzso tumor cells to zzso and engage a plastic zzso zzso zzso which enables them to zzso during tumor progression and escape conventional therapeutic zzso This plastic zzso of aggressive cancer cells enables them to express zzso zzso markers and form zzso structures, a zzso that has been linked to aggressive behavior and poor zzso We demonstrate here that the transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso an zzso cell marker, is expressed by tumor cells and its expression zzso with tumor cell plasticity in two types of human cancer, Ewing zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso expression was significantly associated with worse survival of Ewing zzso zzso zzso zzso in tumor cells interferes with tumor cell plasticity and reduces zzso and zzso growth in zzso Ewing zzso and melanoma cells with reduced zzso levels showed reduced tumor growth in zzso zzso we provide evidence that zzso while interfering with zzso zzso is required for efficient bone zzso zzso zzso focal zzso zzso and zzso signaling in order to maintain tumor cell zzso The present study zzso an important role of zzso in tumor cell plasticity and progression of aggressive zzso
