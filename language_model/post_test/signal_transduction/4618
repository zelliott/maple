zzso zzso an oral zzso agent used in the treatment of superficial zzso has been reported to exert an zzso effect in various cancer zzso However, the effect of zzso on oral cancer has not been zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased cell number in cultured human oral zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was also observed in two other zzso cell lines, zzso and SCC zzso zzso zzso zzso was not zzso and its zzso on zzso cell growth was zzso zzso zzso incorporation and flow zzso analyses revealed that zzso DNA synthesis and induced the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso arrest occurred when the zzso zzso 2 activity was inhibited just as the protein levels of zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso zzso zzso arrest was completely blocked when the expressions of zzso and zzso were zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the zzso - and zzso zzso signaling pathways might be involved in the zzso zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited the zzso tumor zzso In these zzso tumors, increases in the levels of zzso and zzso protein and decreases in the number of zzso cell nuclear zzso cells and the zzso density were zzso These findings demonstrate for the first time that zzso might have potential to serve as a therapeutic tool in the treatment of oral zzso
