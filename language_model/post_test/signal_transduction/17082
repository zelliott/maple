zzso natural killer T cells zzso zzso are unique zzso with characteristic features, such as expression of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recognition of zzso zzso presented by zzso zzso and ability to rapidly produce large amounts of zzso including zzso zzso and zzso 4 zzso upon zzso zzso Many studies have demonstrated that zzso cells participate in immune response against diverse zzso including bacteria, zzso zzso zzso and zzso Generally, these cells play protective roles in host defense against zzso However, in some contexts they play zzso roles, by inducing or zzso zzso Recent reports show that zzso cells recognize zzso zzso from zzso bacteria including zzso pneumoniae, and they contribute to host defense against zzso zzso cell responses to these microbial zzso zzso are highly zzso between zzso and humans, suggesting that zzso cells are zzso zzso because their zzso zzso is useful in detecting certain zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso cell zzso during zzso has zzso activity, enhancing zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso is an attractive target for developing new vaccines for infectious zzso
