zzso in genes zzso zzso channels in brain zzso have been identified in various zzso zzso In zzso networks, zzso of channels in zzso zzso could lead to zzso while zzso in zzso transmission zzso zzso zzso system, both of which can result in zzso A working hypothesis to view zzso as a disorder of channel or zzso seems rational to explore the zzso of zzso However, the imbalance resulting from channel dysfunction is not sufficient to delineate the zzso of all zzso syndromes of which the underlying channel abnormalities have been zzso zzso identified in zzso mainly in genes zzso zzso of zzso zzso undermine zzso trafficking, thus leading to retention of channel molecules in the zzso zzso zzso This process may cause zzso stress followed by zzso which is a known zzso of certain neurodegenerative zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso trafficking zzso may provide a new paradigm to zzso to zzso questions underlying zzso such as differences between generalized zzso with zzso zzso plus and severe zzso zzso in zzso which share the zzso genetic abnormalities in the same genes and hence are so far considered to be within the spectrum of one disease entity or zzso zzso
