zzso are a group of small proteins that have a variety of functions, including the zzso and recruitment of immune cells during episodes of zzso In common with many zzso it has been observed that zzso have the potential to bind zzso zzso zzso which are normally expressed on zzso components of the cell surface and zzso zzso The significance of this interaction for zzso activity remains a subject of zzso In this study, Chinese zzso zzso cells were zzso separately with the human zzso receptors zzso and zzso and these receptors were shown to induce an zzso zzso flux and cellular zzso following stimulation with the natural zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso normal T cell zzso and zzso In further experiments, zzso zzso cells, with a zzso in normal zzso zzso zzso were also zzso with, and shown to express similar levels of, zzso and zzso Although these receptors were functional, it was found that the zzso cells required exposure to higher zzso of zzso than the zzso cells in order to produce the same zzso zzso zzso zzso binding experiments demonstrated that specific zzso receptors expressed by zzso cells had a significantly greater affinity for zzso than similar receptors expressed by zzso zzso However, there was no significant difference between these cells in their affinity for zzso or zzso In conclusion, it has been demonstrated clearly that zzso expression is not necessary for the biological activity of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso However, the presence of cell surface zzso does enhance the activity of low zzso of these zzso by a mechanism that appears to involve zzso onto the cell zzso
