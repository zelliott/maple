Human melanoma cell line zzso is extremely sensitive to growth zzso effects of zzso M zzso zzso cells resistant to the zzso effect of zzso were isolated by exposing zzso cells to zzso methane zzso zzso for 24 h followed by continuous exposure to zzso An zzso zzso resistant to zzso growth zzso was selected by a limiting dilution technique and designated zzso The resistant cells were completely zzso to zzso even up to a concentration of 500 zzso Interestingly, the resistant cells were also zzso to the growth zzso effects of zzso zzso Other zzso such as transforming growth factor beta zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis factor alpha and beta zzso and zzso exhibited similar growth zzso effects on zzso or zzso zzso zzso cells were found to possess approximately zzso of zzso receptors with the same affinities as compared to the parental zzso zzso However, the affinities and number of receptors for zzso were the same on both cell zzso The zzso treatment did not alter the zzso zzso zzso level of either the parental or the resistant zzso The zzso cell line will be very useful in zzso the mechanism of zzso growth zzso
