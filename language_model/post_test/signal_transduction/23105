zzso familial zzso zzso is a special zzso of genetic human prion diseases that is caused by the zzso zzso of the prion protein gene zzso According to the surveillance data from 2006, zzso accounts for about half of all genetic prion disease cases in zzso In this study, global expression patterns of the zzso and zzso zzso from three patients with zzso were analyzed by zzso Human Genome zzso zzso zzso A total of zzso genes in the zzso and 332 ones in the zzso lobe were determined to be zzso expressed genes zzso The percentage of zzso zzso is much less in the zzso zzso zzso than that in the zzso lobe zzso zzso Moreover, 255 of those zzso showed the same altering tendencies in both tested regions, including 99 zzso and 156 zzso zzso The reliability of the results was confirmed by the real-time zzso zzso There were zzso and 531 biological processes affected in the zzso and the zzso zzso respectively, as well as 391 overlapping ones in both zzso The most significantly changed molecular functions included zzso and zzso regulation of transcription, zzso zzso zzso electron zzso zzso The changed functions in the zzso contained more numbers of zzso than zzso zzso According to zzso zzso there were 167 and 115 different pathways changed in the zzso and the zzso zzso respectively, while 102 were changed in zzso Interestingly, the top three changed pathways in the three groups mentioned above were Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and zzso zzso These results demonstrate the greater damage in the zzso than in the zzso lobe during zzso zzso which is consistent with previous pathological zzso This study aims to describe the global expression profiles in various brain regions of zzso while proposing useful clues for understanding the zzso of zzso and selecting potential zzso for diagnostic and therapeutic zzso
