zzso is a tumor zzso gene that is either zzso or deleted in a number of human zzso zzso acts as a negative regulator of the zzso survival zzso and thus plays an important role in cell fate, zzso growth, and zzso Recent evidence suggests that zzso may also be involved in the zzso of neurodegenerative disorders such as spinal zzso injury zzso zzso of zzso appears to cause zzso of zzso in zzso resulting in increased cell zzso Given this newly discovered role for zzso it has been identified as a potential molecular target for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against zzso zzso zzso following zzso may occur due to zzso of zzso and zzso zzso including zzso Exposure of zzso zzso to zzso (10 zzso for 24 h resulted in significant zzso of zzso and decreased levels of activated zzso zzso of zzso following zzso exposure was associated with decreased overall cell viability due to increased zzso as assessed by Wright zzso and analysis of cell death markers including zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso activity, indicating a prominent role for zzso in suppression of the zzso survival zzso to promote zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso cells for 1 h prior to zzso exposure partially decreased zzso zzso allowing adequate zzso or zzso of zzso zzso to prevent zzso cell zzso Thus, it appears that zzso may mediate zzso through decrease in zzso zzso In conclusion, our studies suggest that zzso zzso may be used as an important zzso for evaluation of the efficacy of zzso in prevention of zzso loss in neurodegenerative zzso
