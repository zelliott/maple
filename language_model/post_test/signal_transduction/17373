Language disorders cover a wide range of conditions with zzso and overlapping zzso and complex zzso harboring both genetic and environmental zzso zzso approaches including the identification of genes linked to speech and language zzso and the characterization of normal and zzso functions of these genes have, in recent years, unraveled complex details of molecular and cognitive mechanisms and provided valuable insight into the biological foundations of zzso zzso with this approach, we have reviewed the functional aspects of zzso zzso of genes which are currently known to be either zzso associated with disorders of speech and language or impact upon the spectrum of normal language zzso We have also reviewed candidate genes associated with zzso speech and language zzso In addition, we have evaluated language zzso and associated genetic components in zzso syndromes that, together with a spectrum of altered language abilities, manifest various zzso and offer details of zzso zzso of language zzso Data from this review have revealed a predominance of regulatory networks involved in the control of differentiation and functioning of zzso zzso tracks and connections among brain structures associated with both cognitive and language zzso Our findings, zzso have highlighted several zzso zzso in overlapping speech and language zzso zzso this analysis has revealed an interconnected zzso network and a close association of the language faculty with cognitive functions, a finding that has the potential to provide insight into linguistic hypotheses defining in particular, the contribution of genetic elements to and the modular nature of the language zzso
