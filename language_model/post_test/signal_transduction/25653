Cellular electrical activity is the result of a highly complex processes that involve the zzso of zzso channel zzso Ion channels make pores on cell zzso that rapidly transit between zzso and zzso states, allowing different zzso to flow down their zzso zzso across cell zzso In the case of zzso cells, zzso channel activity zzso action zzso traveling through zzso enabling electrical communication between cells in distant parts of the zzso zzso sensation zzso ability to feel touch, temperature and noxious zzso require zzso channels able to sense and respond to our peripheral zzso zzso integration involves the summing of various environmental cues and their conversion into electrical zzso Members of the zzso zzso Potential zzso family of zzso channels have emerged as important zzso of both cellular sensing and sensory zzso The regulation of the spatial and zzso distribution of membrane receptors is recognized as an important mechanism for controlling the magnitude of the cellular response and the time scale on which cellular signaling zzso Several studies have shown that this mechanism is also used by zzso channels to zzso cellular response and ultimately fulfill their zzso function as zzso However, the zzso of this mode of control for zzso channels remains poorly zzso The question of whether zzso zzso regulate their own zzso trafficking or weather the dynamic regulation of zzso channel residence on the cell surface is caused by zzso changes in the rates of zzso zzso or retrieval remain zzso This review will examine the evidence that zzso zzso of zzso channels plays an important role in regulating their activity and explore the mechanisms that control the trafficking of zzso containing zzso zzso
