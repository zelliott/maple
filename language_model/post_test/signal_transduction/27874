In zzso cells the plasma membrane is divided into zzso that are zzso and functionally zzso In zzso cells for example the zzso domain is facing the zzso zzso and is involved in the zzso of zzso while the zzso domain is zzso zzso zzso and zzso We are interested in deciphering the mechanisms underlying the creation and maintenance of such specialized zzso As an zzso model we have used the zzso cell line zzso and we have studied the transport and sorting of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso in these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is first transported to the zzso membrane and then is accumulated on the zzso membrane after zzso This final zzso zzso is controlled by the presence of a membrane anchor and a cluster of zzso sites located in the part of the zzso close to the zzso Among the mechanisms likely to be involved in the sorting of zzso components we have looked for a role of zzso zzso formation in the zzso zzso These membrane zzso are highly enriched in zzso zzso zzso anchored zzso zzso and zzso proteins such as zzso zzso zzso Such a composition is also found for zzso structures called zzso which are made of zzso zzso We have expressed zzso 1 in zzso cells which do not express it and also zzso 2, a related protein of unknown zzso zzso of zzso 1 led to formation of zzso indicating that this protein is necessary for zzso formation while zzso 2 is restricted to the zzso apparatus and has no effect on zzso zzso However zzso 2 increased the amount of zzso incorporated in zzso suggesting a role in recruitment into the zzso zzso The choice for a site of fusion for transport zzso is the last step of control during zzso To identify proteins involved in that step we have cloned and characterized two members of the zzso family, namely zzso 3 and zzso zzso 3 is present on the zzso membrane and forms a complex with zzso which is also localized on the zzso membrane where it forms a complex with zzso zzso zzso of zzso 3 in zzso led to a decrease of zzso zzso towards the zzso membrane confirming that zzso 3 is involved in targeting the fusion of zzso transport zzso to the zzso pole of the zzso
