zzso is a large zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which interacts with zzso at the zzso zzso domain, composed of A, B, and zzso zzso Recently, we generated zzso mice zzso whose zzso without the A zzso has decreased zzso zzso binding zzso thereby exhibiting reduced deposition of zzso in the zzso zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso within 20 passages zzso more slowly and acquire zzso Whereas the zzso zzso of the wild type zzso exhibited a network structure of zzso and zzso that of the zzso zzso exhibited approximately 35 and approximately zzso deposition of zzso and zzso without such a zzso The zzso zzso showed a substantial increase of zzso zzso and expression of zzso markers zzso zzso and zzso Treatment of wild type zzso with zzso and zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso and treatment with an zzso zzso that blocks zzso interaction inhibited the zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is essential for zzso assembly involving zzso and that diminished zzso deposition increases free zzso fragments that interact with zzso and increase zzso of zzso leading to cellular zzso
