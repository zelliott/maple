zzso patients experience exaggerated zzso zzso after zzso zzso Recently it has been shown that circulating smooth muscle zzso cells zzso contribute to zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso differentiation would be increased in diabetes and focused on zzso of zzso signaling as potential underlying zzso 

We isolated zzso from zzso mice with zzso diabetes and zzso zzso differentiation was evaluated by zzso zzso for zzso and collagen Type zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso was zzso using real-time zzso zzso formation was assessed in zzso zzso zzso zzso of bone zzso derived cells to zzso zzso segments was evaluated in animals transplanted with bone zzso from zzso zzso 

We observed that zzso differentiation was accelerated and zzso outgrowth increased in diabetic animals zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso per zzso after 10 days, p zzso zzso zzso real-time zzso showed increased expression of zzso and decreased expression of the zzso in diabetic zzso zzso were zzso positive, indicative of zzso zzso zzso formation in zzso zzso segments was increased in diabetic mice zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In zzso mice, bone zzso derived cells were observed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells per zzso and particularly in the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells per zzso zzso cells were in part zzso positive, but rarely expressed zzso 

In conclusion, in a diabetic mouse model, zzso levels are increased and zzso zzso expression is zzso zzso zzso expression is known to regulate smooth muscle cell differentiation and may facilitate zzso zzso This may contribute to exaggerated zzso zzso in diabetes as bone zzso derived cells home to sites of zzso zzso
