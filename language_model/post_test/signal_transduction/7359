Treatment for iron zzso anemia can involve iron supplementation via dietary or zzso routes that result in different cellular iron zzso The effect of the administered iron on the iron regulatory system and zzso in the liver has not been well zzso zzso the zzso central zzso zzso is itself regulated through the bone zzso protein zzso signaling zzso Specifically, zzso expression is zzso in response to iron and zzso zzso through zzso of zzso The zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso are known upstream regulators of zzso although their precise roles are still zzso To investigate the mechanisms of this regulation and the roles of the zzso and zzso we subjected zzso zzso zzso and zzso mice to iron loading via dietary or zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso is required for effective zzso of zzso in response to zzso iron, but not zzso zzso zzso is not required for zzso zzso regardless of iron zzso but rather, is required for efficient downstream transmission of the regulatory zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso and zzso play separate roles in the regulatory responses to iron zzso in different cell types and further zzso the regulatory mechanisms controlling iron zzso
