In contrast to systemic arteries those of the pulmonary circulation zzso in response to zzso a mechanism known as zzso pulmonary zzso zzso It is has been established that changes in zzso oxygen tension are the primary stimulus for triggering zzso The mechanisms underlying this unique response are zzso Neither the role of the zzso nor that of the smooth muscle of the pulmonary arteries in oxygen sensing has been zzso although both zzso may be zzso Evidence is accumulating to suggest that zzso channels located in the plasma zzso of pulmonary zzso smooth muscle cells may play an important role in oxygen zzso This process may involve novel mechanisms of signal zzso and zzso channel regulation by charged zzso zzso reactions or zzso zzso
