The members of the protein inhibitor of activated zzso zzso family of proteins are implicated in fundamental cellular zzso including zzso regulation, either through action as zzso zzso zzso or through zzso zzso We report here the identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein of 200 zzso as a new zzso zzso We show that the interaction depends on the integrity of the zzso finger of zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso Both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso failed to reveal any zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso is not a bona fide zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso either upon forced zzso expression or in the absence of zzso revealed that interaction with zzso redistributes zzso from the zzso to the nucleus, zzso with zzso of zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso enhances the zzso zzso of the zzso promoter by zzso whereas zzso zzso activity is severely reduced upon zzso depletion by zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrates that zzso zzso and zzso are zzso to the zzso zzso Altogether, these results provide the first evidence for the existence of a zzso zzso of regulation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso
