We have shown previously that zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso through zzso target of zzso zzso zzso zzso of insulin zzso zzso zzso Here we report that chronic insulin and high zzso zzso inhibit zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso via the zzso zzso Resident zzso zzso zzso from diabetic zzso mice showed a zzso reduction in zzso zzso activity zzso by zzso compared with zzso from zzso zzso control zzso zzso from zzso mouse zzso also showed a zzso increase in zzso motif zzso without a difference in zzso zzso To investigate the mechanism of this zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were treated chronically with insulin (1 zzso 18 zzso and high zzso zzso zzso 48 zzso In these cells, zzso zzso zzso activity was reduced by zzso zzso chronic insulin or high zzso alone did not impact zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin + high zzso did reduce zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso association by 54 and zzso respectively, but did not effect zzso zzso zzso When zzso zzso motif zzso was zzso chronic insulin + high zzso resulted in a zzso increase in zzso zzso motif zzso without a change in zzso zzso zzso of matured zzso cells with zzso blocked chronic insulin + high zzso zzso zzso motif zzso and restored zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together these results indicate that zzso zzso signaling in zzso is impaired in models of type 2 diabetes zzso through a mechanism that relies on zzso zzso motif zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso
