The regulation of gene expression at the zzso level has been considered for long as the main mechanism of cellular zzso zzso Since the turn of the century, however, it is becoming clear that higher organisms developed a complex, sensitive and maybe equally important network of regulatory zzso relying largely on protein zzso zzso modifications and zzso Here we review the involvement of the zzso zzso of protein degradation at different levels of cellular life in relation with zzso and with a special focus on zzso It comes out that the zzso system plays a major role in signal zzso associated with stress and zzso in skin in particular through the control of zzso and zzso zzso The understanding of specific zzso targeting by zzso zzso zzso the way for a new generation of active molecules that may control particular steps of normal and pathological zzso
