zzso stem zzso cells are zzso cells derived from the inner cell mass of zzso zzso of mouse zzso cells depends on zzso of zzso by zzso zzso factor zzso in collaboration with bone zzso protein zzso The zzso factor zzso is essential in maintaining zzso but the mechanisms involved are poorly zzso Here we examine the functional interactions of zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to bind to and zzso activate zzso zzso We also found that zzso binds to zzso zzso however, zzso binding inhibited zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso expression increased during differentiation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins promoted zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso either by genetic zzso of the zzso gene or zzso of the zzso zzso increased expression of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso the zzso activities of zzso and zzso with zzso to maintain zzso
