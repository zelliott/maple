The authors review the current literature on the major biological advances in the molecular testing of brain zzso The incorporation of several new aspects required for proper disease management into traditional pathology service is the focus of this zzso One of the important achievements of the last years in zzso is the observation that the promoter zzso status of the zzso zzso DNA zzso gene determines the treatment efficacy of zzso zzso in zzso This can best be evaluated by zzso zzso zzso using tumor tissue obtained for zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso signaling through gene amplification has been recognized and targeted by zzso approaches in high-grade zzso The zzso zzso zzso is practically unique to zzso cells hence analysis of zzso seems to be justifiably demanded either by zzso or zzso zzso zzso can easily be included in routine laboratory zzso In addition to this FISH analysis can be performed for the assessment of zzso gene copy numbers at cellular zzso zzso the zzso status at a genetic and simultaneously at the protein expression level seems to be a valid approach for making treatment zzso zzso complex and even less clear biological background characterizes the behavior of tumors with zzso zzso The deletion of the zzso regions zzso and zzso was found to be associated with favorable outcome and good response to the zzso treatment zzso zzso decisions are therefore also enabled on the basis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso therapy is often indicated on the basis of zzso zzso The zzso status can be assessed by FISH or, less zzso by zzso or zzso zzso Based on the in-depth overview of the literature the authors highly recommend the adaptation of molecular zzso testing that most efficiently could be done in zzso zzso zzso This approach would comply with the increasing need for personalized zzso therapy while best satisfying zzso zzso
