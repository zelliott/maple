zzso 12 zzso was zzso by the automatic solid phase method with the use of zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso and identified by zzso zzso and mass zzso Acute zzso zzso was induced by zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso at the onset of the zzso at doses of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso was applied at a dose of 10 zzso 10 zzso prior to zzso alone or before zzso administration zzso zzso saline was used in zzso The indicated zzso doses induced a transient reduction of the zzso zzso blood pressure zzso to 85, 58, and zzso of the initial level, respectively, which was accompanied by its recovery by the end of zzso All zzso doses significantly limited zzso zzso size by 26, 40 and zzso respectively, compared to the value in zzso After administration of zzso at dose of zzso zzso this effect was combined with reduction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activities in plasma at the end of zzso by 56 and zzso respectively, compared to the values in zzso zzso of NO formation by zzso increased zzso but did not affect zzso zzso size compared with that in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso resulted in lesser reduction of zzso during zzso than injection of zzso zzso This intervention led to an increase in zzso size by zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso activities, respectively, compared to the values in the zzso zzso The results indicate that NO is involved as a zzso of the effects of zzso on the overall protection consisting in a limitation of zzso size and reduction of zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso mechanisms of zzso action are zzso
