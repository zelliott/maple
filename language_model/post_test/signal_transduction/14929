zzso is a zzso factor that acts as a master regulator of gene expression induced by zzso Recent studies have demonstrated that the potent inflammatory factor, zzso zzso can also activate zzso in zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms at the zzso level of zzso induction by zzso remained zzso Here, we investigated the regulatory mechanism of zzso expression by zzso in zzso and identified that zzso zzso mediate gene zzso of a typical inflammatory mediator, zzso factor alpha zzso Increased zzso gene expression by zzso was defined in a series of zzso cell lines by zzso Western zzso and promoter zzso zzso The zzso signaling and zzso zzso were required to induce the zzso gene zzso by zzso The finding that a cascade zzso zzso of distinct set of zzso factors, zzso and zzso in response to zzso stimulation associates with induction of zzso gene zzso lends new insights into the functional mechanisms by which complex patterns of gene regulation on zzso zzso zzso are zzso
