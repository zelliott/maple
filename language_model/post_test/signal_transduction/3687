The zzso activity of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso increases in response to agents acting on a variety of cell surface zzso including receptors linked to zzso G zzso In this report, we demonstrated that zzso protein zzso activity in the mouse zzso zzso was induced by chronic zzso administration in whole zzso To investigate the molecular nature underlying cellular responses to zzso zzso we have zzso zzso rat zzso zzso zzso cells with human zzso zzso fusion gene zzso and used zzso differential display in search of messages induced by zzso zzso Through this approach, the gene zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was identified as one of the target genes activated by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso resulted in a delayed and sustained increase of zzso expression in the zzso zzso The induction of zzso zzso level is sensitive to both the protein synthesis inhibitor zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso zzso The role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso in the zzso induction was highlighted by the result that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso and zzso zzso zzso Altogether, these findings support the notion that the zzso signaling zzso at least in part, regulates zzso zzso of the zzso architectural protein zzso
