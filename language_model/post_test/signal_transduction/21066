The zzso zzso 1 zzso is an important zzso of zzso destruction in zzso zzso but the mechanisms by which zzso mediates signal zzso in zzso is poorly zzso Previous results have indicated that zzso receptors zzso with focal zzso zzso Page, Gillis and zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso discrete adhesive zzso of cells that function in cell attachment and possibly in signal zzso We have determined whether focal zzso restrict zzso zzso zzso in primary cultures of bovine zzso In cells grown for 24 h on zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration zzso was zzso zzso zzso increases of zzso above baseline were induced by 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso above zzso There was no significant difference between cells zzso on zzso or type II collagen zzso zzso zzso above zzso zzso zzso were significantly decreased by the inclusion of zzso zzso zzso in the bathing buffer zzso zzso above zzso and 1 zzso zzso completely blocked zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso or suspended cells showed no zzso increases, whereas cells grown on zzso exhibited zzso zzso responses that corresponded temporally to the zzso cell spreading after zzso on zzso zzso zzso on zzso and incubated with zzso beads exhibited zzso zzso in association with the zzso In identical cell zzso zzso induced a zzso zzso increase of zzso above baseline in response to 10 zzso zzso There were no zzso zzso increases when cells on zzso were incubated with zzso beads for only 15 zzso at 37 degrees C, in cells maintained for 3 h at 4 degrees C, in cells incubated with zzso beads for 3 h at 37 degrees C, or in cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso receptors with zzso showed zzso more specific zzso of focal zzso complexes in cells incubated with zzso beads compared with cells incubated with zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso binding or the number of zzso receptors was increased in focal zzso These results indicate that, in zzso zzso zzso zzso is dependent on focal zzso formation and that focal zzso recruit zzso receptors by zzso in the cell zzso
