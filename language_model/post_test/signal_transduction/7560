zzso zzso has been shown to inhibit the growth and induce zzso of certain cancer zzso The aim of this study was to determine the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and the underlying zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to determine the cell growth zzso by zzso zzso induced by zzso was investigated by both zzso zzso and flow zzso The cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow zzso The zzso levels of the zzso zzso were analyzed by quantitative zzso The expression of zzso and its zzso at zzso were detected by western zzso The zzso of zzso at zzso for zzso zzso and zzso cells were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso higher proportion of zzso cells entered the zzso upon treatment with zzso for zzso compared with control zzso zzso decreased the zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso The protein levels of zzso decreased and its zzso at zzso was zzso with zzso zzso zzso inhibited growth by affecting the cell cycle and induced zzso in different zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso The results suggest the potential of zzso as an zzso agent in the prevention or treatment of zzso
