The problem of zzso complex dynamic systems is zzso especially with a view to identifying those variables that take part in the essential qualitative zzso of zzso The author presents a series of reflections about the methods of zzso together with the principles that govern the global operation of zzso In particular, a section on zzso zzso and circular causality and a rather detailed description of the zzso use of the zzso zzso logical description, together with a brief description of its synthetic use zzso zzso Some basic rules are recalled, such as the fact that a positive circuit is a necessary condition of zzso Also, the interest of considering as a model, rather than a zzso set of differential zzso a variety of systems that differ from each other only by the values of constant terms is zzso All these systems have a common zzso zzso and for all of them phase space has exactly the same zzso It means that all can be zzso in the same way as regards the signs of the zzso and thus as regards the precise nature of any steady states that might be zzso Which steady states are actually present, depends on the values of terms of order zero in the ordinary differential equations zzso and it is easy to find for which values of these terms a given point in phase space is zzso Models can be zzso first at the level of the circuits involved in the zzso zzso zzso determines which types and numbers of steady states are consistent with the zzso then only at the level of terms of order zero in the zzso zzso determines which of the steady states actually zzso hence the title zzso zzso
