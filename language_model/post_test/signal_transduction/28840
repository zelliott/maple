zzso is an zzso neurotransmitter that binds to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso Each zzso was first characterized and cloned in the central nervous system zzso zzso is also present in the zzso and zzso receptors have been identified in zzso zzso including bone, heart, zzso zzso and zzso zzso play a central role in normal zzso and zzso as well as contributing greatly to diseases such as stroke and zzso zzso Despite the presence of zzso in zzso zzso the role of zzso during zzso is zzso We now show that activated zzso release zzso that zzso express zzso zzso and that zzso increases zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso binding to the zzso increases zzso sodium concentration and zzso zzso which are important steps in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso treated with the zzso zzso zzso or zzso derived from zzso knockout mice are resistant to zzso zzso zzso mice lacking zzso have a prolonged time to zzso in zzso Our data identify zzso as a regulator of zzso zzso and suggest that the zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso
