In an ex zzso organ zzso system, that of the isolated zzso joint zzso of rat small zzso and liver, insulin infused into the portal vein increased zzso zzso zzso This insulin action against the zzso can be blocked by zzso indicating a propagation of the insulin signal via zzso nerves, which zzso with previous studies with zzso and zzso zzso action could also be zzso by zzso zzso zzso acting directly on the zzso zzso Because zzso zzso is a common late complication of diabetes zzso the possible impairment of these nerves in the diabetic state was studied in zzso zzso In the isolated joint zzso zzso zzso was applied as a zzso into the zzso its zzso was measured in the portal zzso In zzso diabetic as well as in control rats, portal insulin, zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso In zzso diabetic rats portal insulin and zzso zzso failed to stimulate zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso still did so, indicating an undisturbed function of the zzso zzso The lack of an effect of portal insulin and zzso zzso and the unchanged action of zzso in the chronically diabetic rats indicated that the signaling chain via the zzso nerves was impaired, which is in line with a diabetic zzso
