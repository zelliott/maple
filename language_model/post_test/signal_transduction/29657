zzso blood vessels form in a zzso pattern that zzso with other embryonic structures and zzso but the sources and identities of signals that pattern vessels are not well zzso We hypothesized that the neural tube provides vascular patterning zzso that direct formation of the zzso vascular zzso zzso that encompasses the neural tube at zzso Both surgically placed zzso neural tubes and zzso neural tubes engineered genetically were able to recruit a vascular zzso showing that the neural tube is the source of a vascular patterning zzso In zzso zzso with the graft separated from the neural tube by a buffer of host cells, zzso vascular cells contributed to the zzso indicating that the neural tube zzso can act at a zzso zzso neural tube vascular zzso growth factor A zzso expression was temporally and zzso correlated with zzso formation, suggesting it is a component of the neural tube zzso A collagen zzso model was developed in which zzso zzso zzso formed a vascular zzso in the presence of added zzso zzso between zzso zzso and neural tube also supported vascular zzso formation, indicating that the neural tube could replace the requirement for zzso Moreover, a combination of pharmacological and genetic zzso showed that zzso signaling through zzso is a required component of the neural tube vascular patterning zzso Thus, the neural tube is the first structure identified as a zzso signaling center for embryonic vascular pattern formation in higher zzso and zzso is a necessary component of the neural tube vascular patterning zzso These data suggest a model zzso embryonic structures with little or no capacity for zzso generation act as a zzso for vessel zzso
