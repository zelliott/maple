Our previous study found that blocking nuclear factor zzso signaling could protect human zzso vein zzso cells zzso from zzso and proliferation zzso due to high zzso zzso zzso zzso makes zzso toxicity more zzso In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of zzso zzso on zzso induced by intermittent zzso (a daily alternating zzso or zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso containing a zzso cassette targeting the zzso gene was produced, and its zzso effect on zzso gene was detected by Western zzso analysis in zzso cultured with intermittent zzso The subsequent effect on proliferation of zzso in the indicated conditions was measured by the zzso zzso The zzso expression was also detected by Western zzso The results showed that the expression of zzso protein could be inhibited efficiently by the zzso zzso zzso zzso also induced the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso could prevent the zzso At the 6th day after zzso were exposed to intermittent zzso the proliferation of zzso with zzso was significantly higher than that of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso expression of zzso under intermittent zzso conditions zzso zzso zzso These findings concluded that the zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso which can efficiently inhibit the expression of zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso reduces zzso proliferation with a zzso increase in zzso zzso of zzso partly protected zzso from proliferation zzso and may reduce zzso
