The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with particular zzso zzso zzso exchange factors zzso and thereby mediates zzso zzso zzso a process which involves the zzso zzso of zzso by zzso It is, however, unknown how zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso We show here that zzso of zzso by zzso and its subsequent zzso zzso creates zzso sites for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is thereby recruited into the zzso zzso complex and via its zzso domain activates the zzso zzso zzso exchange factor zzso zzso zzso zzso is independent of its zzso zzso The recruitment of zzso has no effect on the zzso zzso protein activity of zzso but is required for zzso zzso growth cone collapse as well as for the zzso effects of zzso on cancer zzso These data demonstrate a novel zzso function of zzso as an important mechanism of zzso signaling which links zzso zzso of zzso to the regulation of a zzso protein and downstream cellular zzso
