Quality of life zzso in patients with chronic disease is impaired and cannot be solely explained by disease zzso We explored whether genetic zzso and activity contributes to zzso in patients with zzso syndrome zzso a genetic zzso tissue zzso 

In 121 MFS patients, patient characteristics zzso demographics and zzso zzso were zzso Patients completed the zzso to measure zzso In addition, zzso wide gene expression and 484 Single zzso zzso zzso in zzso genes were zzso zzso was first analyzed and associated with patient zzso zzso physical zzso was impaired and zzso related with age and zzso whereas mental quality of life zzso was zzso To explain a largely lacking correlation between disease severity and zzso we related zzso wide gene expression to zzso Patients with lower zzso scores had high expression levels of zzso and zzso zzso genes zzso zzso similarly, patients with low vitality scores had high expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso independent of patient zzso zzso we associated zzso related zzso to mental zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso gene showed a weak association with zzso and vitality zzso association zzso Although overall mental zzso was normal, zzso of patients had low scores for zzso and zzso zzso analysis of systemic inflammatory zzso showed that patients with lowest zzso and vitality scores had high levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Variation in the zzso genetic zzso and its zzso is related to mental zzso These findings might allow us to identify and, ultimately, treat patients susceptible to poor zzso
