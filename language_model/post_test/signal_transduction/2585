The specific mechanisms underlying the relative zzso of aging remain to be zzso zzso We used frequent zzso sampling zzso zzso zzso sensitive and specific zzso and testosterone zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso time series to delineate the differences between healthy young zzso zzso 10, age zzso zzso and aged zzso zzso 8, age zzso zzso men in the nocturnal zzso of zzso and testosterone and their zzso We found that elderly men zzso young men had more frequent bursts of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso less testosterone zzso per testosterone zzso burst zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and less testosterone zzso per hour zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso As the frequency of nocturnal zzso zzso bursts increased, the frequency of testosterone bursts decreased zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso We conclude that healthy aging is associated with diminished nocturnal testosterone production attributable to 1) a zzso in the mass of testosterone released per burst and 2) an inadequate response by the zzso zzso to enhance testosterone production via an accelerated zzso zzso pulse zzso We speculate that this may reflect a partial zzso of zzso cells to zzso
