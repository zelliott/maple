The authors and others have shown previously that the zzso zzso zzso is a potent zzso in the retinal zzso zzso increases in retinal blood flow zzso in response to several zzso zzso The current experiments were undertaken to zzso the involvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channels and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso system in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were zzso in zzso newborn zzso and changes in zzso transit times and retinal zzso and zzso diameters were used to estimate zzso changes in zzso 

zzso zzso zzso of 5 zzso and 50 zzso zzso caused zzso increases in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso channel zzso zzso zzso zzso and 5 zzso caused a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso response to 5 zzso zzso The specificity of zzso for blocking zzso channels was demonstrated by its ability to block by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5) the increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso of the zzso channel zzso zzso (5 zzso whereas it had no effect on the zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5) induced by the zzso oxide donor sodium zzso (15 zzso zzso zzso was not zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso and was not attenuated by zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso In addition, no significant increases in zzso could be zzso by zzso to 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso 

These results in the zzso indicate that zzso increases blood flow in the zzso by zzso zzso channels, not by increasing in zzso zzso secondary to zzso zzso zzso They also underscore the potential importance of zzso channels in the zzso of retinal zzso responses to other zzso
