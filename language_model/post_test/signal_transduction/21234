We have previously described the cloning of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso that is similar to the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso factors, shows specific binding to the zzso and can activate zzso in cell zzso In this report, we describe the gene structure for zzso protein expression patterns throughout development and the necessary role for this gene in zzso The zzso transcript is zzso in six zzso that are distributed over 21 zzso of zzso There are seven start sites and no zzso consensus sequences zzso The zzso protein is expressed in the zzso of the embryonic zzso zzso zzso and zzso Late in zzso zzso cell zzso and specific zzso within the segments show zzso with zzso zzso In adult female zzso zzso is expressed in the stage 9 through stage 11 zzso cell zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene give rise to animals that no longer express zzso protein and die late in zzso before or at zzso The absolute requirement of zzso for zzso demonstrates a zzso function for a zzso protein that will be useful in studying the role of specific signal zzso zzso in zzso
