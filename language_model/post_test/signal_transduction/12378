zzso is a widespread zzso caused by zzso zzso zzso that are transmitted by zzso infected zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to stimulate zzso cells via zzso 2 and zzso Host defense mechanisms remain obscure, although zzso has been shown to be involved in clearing zzso In this study, we show that double zzso and zzso knockout zzso mice rapidly died from severe zzso and zzso failure following zzso zzso zzso the severe zzso response detected in the liver and kidney from zzso zzso mice appears to be independent of zzso the main zzso of zzso zzso of zzso mice constructed with zzso and zzso mice, and infection of several lines of transgenic mice devoid of T and/or B zzso identified B cells as the crucial zzso subset responsible for the clearance of zzso through the early production of specific zzso zzso zzso zzso against the zzso zzso We also found a protective tissue zzso zzso production of zzso by B and T zzso in the liver and zzso zzso In contrast, the tissue inflammation observed in zzso zzso mice was further characterized to be mostly due to B zzso in the liver and T cells in the zzso zzso these findings demonstrate that zzso and zzso play a key role in the early control of zzso but do not directly trigger the inflammation induced by zzso zzso
