With the rapid progress in the identification of the molecular components of calcium and protein zzso regulatory systems, it is presently an exciting time for those studying plant signal zzso A clear message that was conveyed at the meeting was the need for an interdisciplinary approach to the problems currently facing researchers in this zzso Thus, while the powerful methods of plant molecular biology allow for rapid advances in the identification of new zzso this approach needs to be combined with careful zzso and zzso zzso This was exemplified by the large number of protein zzso described at the meeting but the surprisingly few reports of zzso function of zzso Similarly, while calcium has emerged as a major regulatory zzso in plants, little is known regarding the exact molecular mechanisms of calcium and zzso protein zzso These are clearly areas for future study that should reveal the elusive pathways that lie between stimuli and responses in the plant zzso
