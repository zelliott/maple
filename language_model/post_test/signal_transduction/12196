The zzso cell zzso zzso factor zzso is a potent survival factor for several zzso populations in different brain regions, including the zzso However, no information is available on zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in the zzso actions upon zzso zzso identity of zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso pathways involved in the zzso zzso in the zzso We addressed these questions in zzso zzso slices exposed to zzso in presence of zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso slices zzso acts through the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso without involving the zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso mainly occurred in the zzso region where the two activated proteins zzso zzso protected in a greater extent zzso rather than zzso following zzso zzso This zzso effect targeted zzso zzso as assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with a significant increase of zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso images revealed that upon zzso exposure, zzso zzso occurred in zzso cells in the zzso and zzso following zzso zzso zzso this study shows that zzso and zzso zzso regions are highly responsive to zzso zzso zzso and zzso and suggest that, upon zzso such zzso involves a zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso
