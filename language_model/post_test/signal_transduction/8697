We have demonstrated that zzso acid zzso a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso can improve animal survival after zzso zzso and protect zzso from zzso zzso This study investigated whether zzso treatment works through the zzso zzso zzso zzso survival zzso 

zzso rats underwent zzso shock zzso blood loss over 60 zzso followed by zzso treatment with zzso zzso zzso without any additional resuscitation zzso The experimental groups were: zzso zzso (no zzso no zzso zzso no resuscitation zzso no zzso and zzso zzso zzso The animals were sacrificed at 1, 6, or zzso zzso and liver tissue was zzso zzso and nuclear proteins were isolated and analyzed for zzso zzso at zzso zzso total and zzso zzso and activated zzso by Western zzso 

zzso animals were in severe zzso with mean zzso pressures of zzso zzso and zzso acid 7-9 zzso As expected, only the zzso treated animals survived to the 6- and zzso zzso none of the zzso animals survived to these time zzso Treatment of zzso animals with zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso which peaked at zzso and returned back to normal by zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso zzso and increased activated zzso levels, representing a commitment to subsequent cell zzso Treatment with zzso decreased the zzso zzso expression at zzso without changing the total levels of zzso zzso and this correlated with zzso of activated zzso at zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso 

Treatment with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and reduces zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso This discovery establishes for the first time that zzso may protect cells after severe zzso through zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
