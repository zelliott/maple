zzso protein restriction diminishes zzso zzso zzso type 2 zzso activity and causes fetal growth restriction in zzso However, it is unknown whether such effect was caused directly by zzso zzso or indirectly through the mediation of maternal zzso In the present study, a human zzso cell line zzso was cultured in zzso as control and zzso as low zzso acids zzso media for 48 h to investigate the effects of zzso acids zzso on zzso expression and zzso Despite a significant zzso of zzso zzso expression in zzso cells, zzso activity and protein content were decreased by 38 and zzso respectively zzso indicating a mechanism of zzso zzso Among 5 zzso targeting zzso zzso was expressed significantly higher in zzso zzso zzso concentration was significantly lower zzso in zzso zzso The zzso expression of both zzso of zzso zzso was significantly higher in zzso cells, although no difference was detected at protein zzso To further clarify whether zzso is involved in zzso the effect of zzso on zzso activity, zzso was supplemented to zzso zzso whereas three specific zzso of zzso signaling zzso zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso respectively were added to control zzso zzso restored the diminished zzso activity in zzso cells, whereas zzso (5 zzso and zzso zzso zzso significantly decreased zzso activity in control zzso In conclusion, the present results indicate that zzso diminishes zzso expression and activity in zzso cells through zzso zzso and zzso zzso
