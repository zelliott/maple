The sodium zzso zzso zzso is an intrinsic plasma membrane protein that mediates active zzso transport into the zzso zzso and into several zzso zzso in particular the zzso zzso zzso Cloning and molecular characterization of the zzso have allowed the investigation of its key role in zzso physiology as well as its potential zzso and therapeutic implications in benign and zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso the mechanisms underlying the regulation of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and breast cancer, in which more than zzso of cases express zzso zzso may lead to findings that have novel implications for zzso and zzso Two approaches may, in the future, pave the way to extend the use of zzso treatment to zzso zzso One is based on the zzso of zzso zzso expression in zzso and breast cancer by targeting the main mechanisms involving zzso transformation and zzso The other is based on the application of zzso as a novel zzso gene therapy zzso zzso offers the unique advantage that it can be used both as a reporter and as a therapeutic zzso so that it is possible to image, zzso and treat the tumor with zzso just as in differentiated zzso zzso This review summarizes the main recent findings in zzso research that have a direct impact on diagnosis and therapeutic zzso
