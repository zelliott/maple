The zzso mechanisms of the zzso action of zzso and zzso two zzso zzso were investigated in the mouse hot plate test by using an zzso zzso Mice were injected zzso with zzso zzso zzso complementary to the sequence of the zzso sequence of the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso h prior to the hot plate zzso Treatment with zzso against zzso zzso and zzso zzso reduced the analgesia induced by both zzso (15 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso effect disappeared 7 days after the end of the zzso treatment, indicating the absence of irreversible damage or zzso Treatment with zzso against zzso zzso and zzso at the active doses, did not modify the zzso pain zzso indicating the absence of any zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso at the zzso effective doses, did not produce any zzso of motor coordination of the mice, as revealed by zzso experiments, and spontaneous zzso as revealed by the zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso induce their zzso effect by zzso all three zzso of the zzso
