The zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso has been known to play a critical role in zzso of smooth muscle zzso In this study, we investigated the role of ROCK in zzso zzso body smooth muscle contraction induced by electrical field stimulation and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ROCK zzso and specific zzso to zzso and zzso zzso which are two zzso of zzso were zzso zzso field stimulation induced zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso zzso originating from the zzso zzso zzso inhibited both zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced two types of zzso an initial contraction which occurred immediately after the addition of zzso during short zzso and a sustained contraction which zzso continued after the initial zzso zzso initial and sustained zzso were reached at zzso M zzso zzso significantly inhibited both zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso increased the level of zzso in the 20 zzso regulatory light chain of zzso II zzso at zzso from zzso zzso to 1 zzso and then declined after 2 zzso The level changes of zzso zzso during the 5 zzso paralleled with those of zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso in membrane zzso of muscle was increased by zzso more specifically, zzso continually expressed up to 5 zzso Taken together, ROCK may be involved in zzso and zzso contraction via zzso to the membrane in zzso zzso smooth zzso
