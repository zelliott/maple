Fibrosis is one of the most common pathological zzso in heart failure, and zzso migration is an essential process in the development of cardiac zzso Experimental zzso zzso zzso is a model of inflammatory heart disease characterized by inflammatory cell zzso followed by healing without residual zzso However, the precise mechanisms zzso termination of inflammation and zzso healing remain to be zzso zzso analysis of hearts from model mice at multiple time points after zzso induction identified several zzso proteins zzso during zzso healing, including the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso a human zzso of zzso activated zzso zzso in zzso but not in zzso indicating that zzso were the target of zzso zzso In addition, zzso decreased zzso migration in the in zzso scratch zzso zzso zzso zzso a well-known zzso for zzso was involved in zzso zzso biological effect on cardiac zzso zzso of zzso a zzso zzso activated zzso in zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso deletion abolished both zzso zzso zzso and zzso reduction in zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso zzso during zzso prevents zzso zzso by restricting zzso migration via zzso of the zzso signaling zzso
