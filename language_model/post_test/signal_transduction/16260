The retinal zzso zzso zzso plays an essential role in the survival and function of the neural zzso zzso uncontrolled proliferation leads to the development of zzso zzso zzso among which zzso zzso zzso is the main cause of retinal surgery zzso Upon the breakdown of the zzso due to trauma or zzso imbalance the contact of zzso with zzso zzso has been shown to stimulate the proliferation of otherwise zzso zzso zzso Although the molecular mechanisms involved in this effect are still zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso G protein coupled zzso zzso activates zzso and zzso known to play an essential role in zzso The present study demonstrates that: 1) zzso stimulates zzso zzso zzso zzso without affecting zzso 308 zzso zzso in zzso zzso 2) zzso zzso stimulation promotes zzso D1 zzso through the zzso zzso of zzso thus preventing zzso zzso zzso D1 zzso nuclear export and degradation; 3) zzso signaling requires the upstream zzso of zzso and zzso Since the pharmacological zzso of these pathways or the zzso of zzso expression prevent zzso zzso cell zzso these results contribute relevant evidence for establishing the mechanism involved in the development of zzso eye zzso
