The zzso proteins zzso by zzso the tumor zzso have been extensively used as model systems to study zzso signaling and cell zzso These proteins stimulate cell growth in cultured cells and induce tumors in virus infected or transgenic zzso One of these zzso zzso zzso acts like a zzso activated zzso growth factor zzso zzso recruits several cellular zzso into a zzso complex located at cellular zzso This results in the zzso of cellular zzso involved in the regulation of cell zzso like zzso zzso of the zzso family, a zzso zzso and a zzso exchange factor for zzso These activities are all required for stimulation of cell growth by zzso and activate members of the zzso zzso zzso Here we investigate the role of T zzso pathways in the stimulation of zzso of immediate early zzso These genes are essential for progression of resting cells into S zzso Our data show that zzso family zzso play an essential role in cell transformation by zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that the zzso promoter is activated by two zzso signaling zzso One is zzso and requires binding of zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso This zzso signals via zzso complex factor zzso to the serum response element zzso of the zzso zzso Signaling to zzso by zzso also depends on functional zzso but not zzso as demonstrated in zzso reporter zzso with an zzso zzso zzso The second zzso is zzso does not require zzso but functional zzso zzso and zzso signals via zzso to serum response factor zzso zzso of dominant negative zzso blocks nuclear zzso of zzso in zzso zzso This lends support to the idea that the two signaling zzso initiated by Ras show zzso at the level of zzso zzso signaling to nuclear zzso zzso
