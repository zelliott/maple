zzso and zzso originate from a common zzso which arises from bone zzso zzso zzso cells zzso Aging causes a decrease in the number of zzso zzso and an increase in the number of zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that, during aging, the status of zzso changes with respect to both their intrinsic differentiation potential and production of signaling zzso which contributes to the formation of a specific zzso zzso necessary for maintenance of bone zzso Aging causes a decrease in the commitment of zzso to the zzso lineage and an increase in the commitment to the zzso zzso This is reflected by changes in the expression of zzso gene zzso The expression of zzso zzso factors, zzso and zzso and zzso zzso collagen and zzso is decreased in aged zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso factor zzso shown previously to regulate zzso development and bone formation zzso and to regulate zzso zzso differentiation zzso is increased, as is a gene marker of zzso zzso fatty acid binding protein zzso Furthermore, production of an zzso zzso zzso that stimulates zzso differentiation and production of zzso zzso that suppresses the zzso zzso are also zzso In addition, expression of different components of zzso and zzso signaling pathways is altered, suggesting that activities of these two zzso essential for bone zzso change with zzso
