zzso is a founding member of the zzso family and a key regulator of membrane zzso In the context of zzso cell corpse zzso zzso acts with its zzso zzso zzso exchange factor, zzso in an zzso zzso zzso to promote zzso Here we show that in the context of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso promote zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso binds to the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso that zzso contributes to recruitment of zzso to zzso and that recycling cargo is trapped in recycling zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso defective zzso also traps recycling zzso Our results indicate that zzso of early zzso regulator zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso cascade is an important step in the transport of cargo through the zzso recycling zzso for delivery to the plasma zzso
