zzso growth factor zzso 21, a structural relative of zzso that regulates zzso zzso is a regulator of zzso zzso transport in zzso and plays a role in the regulation of body zzso It also regulates zzso and zzso responses to zzso We report that in a zzso zzso zzso zzso system using zzso cells, which do not zzso express any type of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso alone does not activate zzso and that zzso is required for zzso to activate two specific zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso on zzso cells enabled zzso but not zzso to activate zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso a protein related to zzso enabled zzso but not zzso to activate zzso zzso indicating that expression of zzso zzso target cell specificity on zzso In all of these cases, zzso enhanced the zzso but was not zzso In zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression by zzso was associated with expression of zzso which was absent in zzso zzso zzso It is thus suggested that zzso expression is a crucial zzso of the zzso specificity of the target cells upon which it acts in an zzso zzso
