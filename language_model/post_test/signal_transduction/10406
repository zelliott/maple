We have examined the role of zzso zzso zzso in zzso of the suppressed immune functions and zzso of zzso head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso zzso The suppressed killing activity of zzso of zzso patients towards zzso zzso and zzso cell lines could be restored by in zzso treatment of zzso with zzso as detected by zzso release zzso zzso patients with zzso + zzso + zzso treatment showed greater zzso efficacy than corresponding zzso zzso Analysis of culture zzso of zzso by zzso revealed the lower zzso of zzso and zzso with increased level of zzso and zzso This altered zzso status was zzso after in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso Increased zzso of zzso derived zzso was observed after zzso treatment that can enhance the zzso release, a key regulator for zzso zzso zzso enhancement of zzso cells may be the source of greater amount of zzso zzso activated zzso and zzso signaling is observed to be involved in the regulation and maintenance of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso may be effective as a tool for zzso therapy along with conventional therapies to overcome the zzso in zzso zzso
