We have shown that in the zzso rat zzso toothless zzso zzso are absent from older bone surfaces in zzso and that zzso zzso in zzso lack the prominent stress fiber zzso polarized along bone surfaces in zzso from normal zzso Our recent data demonstrate that in normal zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso have different, characteristic zzso zzso and that zzso zzso zzso fail to zzso sort these zzso Because bone zzso and formation are highly zzso and injections of zzso a growth factor, increase bone zzso and growth in zzso rats, we examined the effects of zzso treatment on zzso survival and zzso in zzso and ability to sort zzso zzso in zzso Neonatal zzso treatment of zzso restores zzso on older bone surfaces, zzso the zzso distribution of stress fibers in zzso in zzso and promotes normal sorting of zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso without zzso zzso zzso These data suggest the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso are sorted by different mechanisms and that the differential sorting of zzso zzso is related to the characteristic polarization of stress fibers in zzso and their survival on bone zzso This experimental system can be used to explore the relationships and regulation of these aspects of cell and tissue zzso
