To study the signal zzso mechanisms of tamoxifen via the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in order to understand its regulation of gene zzso 

The effects of tamoxifen zzso on the zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso were evaluated using a human cervical zzso zzso zzso cell zzso 

zzso activated both zzso and zzso activities in a zzso and zzso manner in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was enhanced when the cells were zzso with zzso zzso 

These studies show that zzso activates the signal zzso zzso zzso and zzso which may play important roles in the regulation of gene expression by zzso
