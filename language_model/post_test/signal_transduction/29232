Severe zzso is a life-threatening systemic inflammatory response to microbial zzso Although mortality from severe zzso has decreased modestly over the past three decades, its zzso is increasing zzso Current treatment of severe zzso relies primarily on identification and appropriate zzso coverage of the invading zzso with supportive therapies aimed primarily at reducing the risk of associated organ zzso Current efforts to identify the invading pathogens are successful in approximately only 50% of patients with severe zzso In this review, we examine zzso interactions through the zzso receptors and zzso signaling systems as principal mechanisms of the innate immune response, and explore the application of zzso zzso technologies that have permitted a more complete dissection of the innate immune response during severe zzso Early controlled studies suggest that these zzso tools can readily identify zzso host responses in zzso and zzso zzso However, despite considerable progress, clinical application of these approaches to pathogen recognition in hospitalized patients with severe zzso is still years zzso
