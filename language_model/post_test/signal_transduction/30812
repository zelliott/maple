zzso zzso and white zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to investigate the role of the zzso growth factor bone zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso in zzso trunk neural crest zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso caused a zzso zone around the zzso reduction of the zzso fin above the zzso and disappearance of zzso zzso We established a novel method that allows controlled induction of protein synthesis and zzso zzso animal cap zzso cells injected with heat zzso zzso for zzso and zzso were implanted into zzso zzso and protein expression was induced at defined time zzso With this approach, we could demonstrate for the first time that zzso can stimulate zzso migration in the white zzso We further showed that zzso of zzso expressing zzso cells alters zzso cell distribution without affecting muscle and zzso fin zzso
