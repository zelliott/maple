zzso increases in nucleus zzso zzso actively regulate alcohol consumption, and the alcohol responsiveness of zzso zzso systems relates to genetic zzso in alcohol zzso Here, we extend earlier data for zzso mouse strain differences in zzso zzso by examining for differences in zzso and zzso changes in the zzso expression of zzso signaling molecules between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso alcohol treatment (8 zzso 2 zzso increased the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso as well as the activated forms of protein zzso C zzso zzso and zzso within zzso but not zzso zzso Regardless of prior alcohol experience, zzso mice exhibited higher zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and activated zzso zzso zzso mice, whereas an zzso rise in zzso zzso zzso expression was observed only in zzso zzso We next employed zzso gene transfer approaches to ascertain the functional relevance of the observed strain difference in zzso zzso expression for zzso differences in zzso zzso zzso as well as alcohol zzso zzso nucleus zzso shell zzso expression actively regulated these measures in zzso mice, whereas zzso mice were relatively insensitive to the zzso and behavioral effects of zzso changes in zzso zzso These data support the zzso hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling may be an zzso related to genetic zzso in alcohol zzso If relevant to humans, such data pose zzso affecting zzso zzso signaling in the zzso of zzso
