zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso gene family in zzso encodes a zzso protein with a SIX zzso interaction zzso In zzso zzso genes are required for normal eye as well as brain zzso However, the normal function of zzso in zzso remains unknown due to lack of zzso zzso Previous studies suggest that zzso is likely to play an important role as part of the retinal determination zzso zzso To zzso normal zzso function during retinal development, multiple zzso zzso for zzso have been zzso zzso zzso in zzso result in zzso at the zzso zzso Surprisingly, close examination of its function during eye development reveals that, unlike other members of the zzso network, zzso is required only for zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso The mechanisms by which zzso regulates zzso progression is likely through regulation of signaling molecules in the zzso Specifically, although unaffected during zzso zzso expression of zzso in the zzso is dramatically reduced in zzso zzso zzso In zzso we find that zzso is regulated by sine zzso and eyes zzso key members of the zzso zzso Furthermore, positive feedback between zzso and sine zzso and eyes absent is observed, which is likely zzso through zzso signaling zzso Together with the observation that zzso expression does not depend on zzso or zzso we propose that zzso functions together with zzso to regulate zzso in the zzso serving as a link between the zzso network and the patterning pathways controlling normal retinal zzso
