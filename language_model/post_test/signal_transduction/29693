The sites and modes of interaction between G zzso receptors and their zzso zzso G proteins remain poorly zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso is the best established site of contact of G proteins with zzso but structural analyses and zzso studies suggest the possibility of interactions at the zzso of zzso as zzso We screened for zzso in the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso gene that specifically affect the ability of the G protein to be activated by the zzso zzso factor zzso The screen led to identification of zzso of zzso or zzso for zzso of zzso that reduce the response to the zzso zzso and zzso without affecting cellular levels of the zzso or its ability to interact with beta and gamma zzso The zzso do not appear to affect the intrinsic ability of the G protein to be converted to the activated zzso The low yield of different zzso with this zzso indicates either that the zzso segment of the zzso zzso zzso does not undergo extensive interactions with the zzso zzso or that this region can not be altered without zzso effects upon the formation of G protein zzso
