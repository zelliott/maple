Even in the absence of guidance cues, zzso cells are often spontaneously zzso which should accompany a spontaneous symmetry breaking inside the zzso A shallow zzso zzso can induce these cells to move zzso without much change in cell zzso As the zzso becomes zzso the accuracy of zzso zzso It is not clear how the zzso is expressed or zzso internally in the signaling network, which in turn zzso activates the zzso apparatus for zzso In zzso cells, zzso polarization activities in the signaling network have been zzso In this paper, we conducted a theoretical study of the response of this zzso system to guidance zzso Our analyses indicate that zzso systems respond sharply to a shallow external zzso by increasing the precision of polarity direction and modulating the frequency of zzso We also show how the precision increase and frequency zzso are zzso Our results indicate that zzso activity, independent of external cues, is the basis for the sensitive and robust response to shallow zzso Finally, we show that the system can sense the direction of zzso waves of a zzso for which zzso cells exhibit zzso in the zzso zzso
