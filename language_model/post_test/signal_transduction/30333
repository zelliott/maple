In this review we will describe the interaction between insulin and zzso which enhances and zzso zzso zzso We will describe how zzso of zzso prevents and reverses the early zzso abnormalities in type 1 diabetic zzso such as zzso activity and zzso vascular NO release, resulting in prevention and reversal of early nerve zzso The effects on expression of zzso factors and their zzso zzso by corrections of early gene responses and zzso factors, have downstream beneficial effects on zzso protein zzso and protein zzso Similar effects probably zzso corrections of cell adhesive zzso The zzso are prevention and reversal of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Similarly, progressive zzso of the zzso and zzso is prevented and repaired by zzso replacement with zzso of the molecular constituents of these functionally important zzso zzso dysfunction is now recognized as a complication of type 1 zzso zzso it is linked to impaired synaptic plasticity and eventually zzso zzso loss caused by impaired insulin action and zzso zzso zzso replacement partially prevents zzso zzso zzso and cognitive zzso It is therefore becoming increasingly clear that zzso has major functions in supporting insulin action with a multitude of beneficial effects on diabetic zzso and primary diabetic zzso in type 1 zzso
