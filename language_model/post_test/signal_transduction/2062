The expression of a wide variety of zzso functions in many bacterial species is modulated by zzso zzso a zzso zzso mechanism that involves the production and detection of zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a gene zzso an zzso of zzso which is required for zzso zzso production in other bacterial species, but does not contain genes predicted to zzso any known zzso zzso zzso This study demonstrates that zzso zzso produces functional zzso activity through the ability of zzso extracts to specifically induce zzso in zzso zzso zzso a reporter strain for zzso system zzso zzso of this zzso compound was shown to be dependent upon the product of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso While the zzso zzso showed comparable growth rate, resistance to zzso stress and ability to invade zzso cell zzso to the parental strain, it exhibited decreased zzso zzso in zzso media, suggesting a role for zzso sensing in the regulation of zzso
