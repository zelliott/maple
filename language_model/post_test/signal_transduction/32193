Several different zzso and growth factors zzso by zzso stem cells zzso have been hypothesized to play a role in breast cancer zzso By using a small panel of breast cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso zzso we analyzed the role of zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor A zzso in the zzso between zzso and breast cancer zzso We performed migration zzso in which breast cancer cells were allowed to migrate in response to zzso medium from zzso zzso in absence or in presence of the zzso zzso zzso or an zzso zzso alone or in zzso We found that zzso and zzso zzso inhibited the migration of breast cancer cells and that the combination had an higher zzso zzso We next evaluated the effects of zzso zzso and zzso proteins on breast cancer cell growth and zzso zzso and zzso had not significant effects on the proliferation of breast zzso zzso In contrast, both zzso and zzso significantly increased the ability to migrate of zzso zzso and zzso cells, with the combination showing a greater effect as compared with treatment with a single zzso The combination of zzso and zzso produced in breast cancer cells a more significant and more persistent zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso and zzso may act as zzso factors to sustain breast cancer cell zzso
