zzso zzso zzso play a central role in the biological activity and signaling behavior of basic zzso growth factor zzso Recent studies, however, indicate that zzso may be able to signal in the absence of zzso raising the question of the nature of the role of zzso in zzso zzso In this study, we present a conceptual framework for zzso signaling and derive a simple model from it that describes signaling via both zzso and zzso zzso The model is validated with zzso cell proliferation data using zzso zzso zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso zzso zzso In addition, this model can predict the cellular response of zzso and its zzso as a function of zzso and zzso concentration based on zzso determined zzso zzso We show that zzso cellular response is a function of both zzso and zzso zzso and that a reduction of one of the components can be compensated for by an increase in the other to achieve the same measure of cellular zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso molecules show that reduction in zzso binding interactions and primary zzso site binding interactions can also be compensated for in the same zzso These results suggest a molecular mechanism that could be used by cells in zzso systems to zzso the zzso cellular response by controlling zzso zzso
