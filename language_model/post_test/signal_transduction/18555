Late treatment with zzso zzso as well as the administration before the onset of or during the acute stage of zzso zzso zzso has recently been shown to mitigate zzso heart zzso We investigated the mechanisms, including the downstream signaling zzso for the beneficial effect of late treatment with EPO on chronic zzso heart zzso 

EPO zzso zzso twice a week) was administered to mice beginning 6 weeks after induction of large zzso The EPO treatment for 4 weeks diminished left zzso zzso and improved zzso It significantly reduced inflammatory cell zzso and fibrosis, and increased vascular density in zzso zzso The elevated levels of the inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso and transforming growth zzso seen in the failing hearts were returned nearly to control levels by EPO zzso zzso damage in surviving zzso was also significantly attenuated by zzso zzso of EPO zzso was zzso in failing hearts, and EPO treatment led to zzso zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso These in zzso effects of EPO were confirmed in zzso in experiments that showed the zzso and zzso effects of EPO to be zzso via zzso and zzso zzso Finally, the beneficial effects of EPO were found to persist for 4 weeks after zzso zzso 

It thus appears that zzso reduction of inflammation and zzso production and zzso zzso of zzso stress accompany the beneficial effects of late treatment with EPO on chronic zzso heart zzso
