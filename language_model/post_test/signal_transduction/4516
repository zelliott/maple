zzso are key signaling zzso required for triggering many zzso zzso In B zzso zzso signaling is required for zzso proliferation and robust production of most zzso zzso Paradoxically, zzso was found to have a zzso regulatory function regarding zzso class switch zzso and blockade of zzso can strongly zzso zzso zzso In this article, we explore the mechanisms of this unexpected negative regulatory function of zzso regarding zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso selectively regulates zzso switch in a B zzso manner by controlling zzso zzso of the zzso promoter zzso Although zzso can regulate zzso of zzso zzso zzso via zzso repression of zzso and zzso switch is not dependent on zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso leads to reduced expression of zzso zzso B cell zzso 6 zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and other zzso zzso zzso inhibitor treatment zzso alters the balance between zzso and zzso (a zzso factor that zzso zzso leading to increased zzso and decreased zzso expression levels in zzso center B zzso zzso expression of zzso can partially overcome the elevated zzso and zzso zzso switching in zzso B zzso To our knowledge, these results provide the first evidence that zzso zzso signaling regulates zzso expression and indicate that zzso promotes the zzso center B cell program and selectively zzso zzso switch by maintaining sufficient levels of zzso
