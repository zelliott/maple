zzso cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality and its zzso resulting from zzso cancer cells of diffuse type, is clinically zzso as zzso to the liver and zzso The aim of the present study was to identify putative tumor zzso genes in human gastric cancer cells of diffuse zzso An zzso cell line zzso expressing green fluorescent protein zzso was established and selected using the zzso system for invasive zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are highly invasive compared to the zzso The zzso levels were measured with zzso zzso and correlated with their invasion abilities in these zzso Many of the genes identified with a positive or negative correlation are associated with zzso cell cycle, zzso and cell zzso zzso and cell zzso as well as cellular signal zzso In particular, novel genes without known functions were also zzso zzso and western zzso analyses were applied to verify the expression of selective zzso Following zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated significantly higher in zzso tumor zzso than parental zzso in zzso induction and liver zzso in zzso We have identified putative gastric tumor zzso as well as novel zzso These genes and their protein products are to be further explored for their functional roles associated with tumor zzso The molecular profiles of these identified zzso gene transcripts and proteins in the patient specimens are likely to be useful zzso for zzso therapeutic and/or zzso Most importantly, they may be used as molecular targets for the discovery of zzso drugs against human gastric cancer zzso
