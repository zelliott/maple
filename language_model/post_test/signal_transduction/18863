The zzso T zzso has recently been found to promote facial zzso zzso survival after nerve zzso Signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso are key proteins involved in the zzso T cell differentiation pathways leading to T helper type zzso and zzso cell development, zzso To determine which zzso T cell subset mediates zzso survival, the facial nerve zzso paradigm was applied to zzso zzso and zzso zzso A significant decrease in zzso survival 4 weeks after zzso was observed in zzso mice compared to zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso mice with zzso T cells obtained from zzso mice promoted zzso levels of zzso survival after zzso Furthermore, rescue of zzso from zzso cell death in zzso zzso gene zzso mice zzso T and B zzso could be achieved only by zzso with zzso T cells expressing functional zzso zzso To determine if either the zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso survival, facial nerve zzso was applied to zzso and zzso zzso A significant decrease in zzso survival after zzso occurred in zzso but not in zzso mice compared to zzso mice, indicating that zzso but not zzso is important for zzso survival after nerve zzso In zzso mice, zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was examined in zzso T cells from draining cervical zzso zzso 14 days after zzso and substantial increase in the production of both zzso zzso T cell zzso was zzso zzso these data suggest that zzso zzso T cell differentiation into the zzso subset is necessary for zzso zzso A hypothesis relevant to zzso disease progression is zzso
