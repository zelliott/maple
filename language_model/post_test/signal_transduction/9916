zzso a controlled rapid drop in zzso rate and body temperature zzso is a zzso adaptation to stressful environmental conditions, which occurs in many small zzso zzso and zzso To date, signaling pathways required for zzso have not been zzso We examined the role of the sympathetic nervous system zzso in zzso the zzso adaptation to zzso by zzso monitoring the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso mice, which lack the ability to produce the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Control zzso mice readily reduced serum zzso levels and entered zzso after a fast in a cool zzso In contrast, zzso mice failed to reduce serum zzso and enter zzso under zzso conditions, whereas restoration of peripheral but not central zzso lowered serum zzso levels and rescued the zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso mice immediately after administration of either the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not after administration of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso severely blunted zzso zzso in control mice, whereas other zzso zzso were zzso These results define a critical role of peripheral zzso activity at zzso zzso in the zzso adaptation to limited energy availability and cool ambient zzso
