Both zzso zzso the major zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso (a primary zzso zzso are associated with zzso zzso and tissue repair following central nervous system zzso zzso In this study we investigated the question of whether zzso interaction influences zzso signaling and zzso Our data indicated that zzso binding to the cultured zzso zzso zzso signaling and zzso zzso To determine the cellular and molecular basis of these events, we focused on zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso in zzso We determined that zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso activity which, in turn, zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and attenuated the ability of zzso to zzso zzso Further analyses indicated that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso gamma zzso with zzso and zzso of zzso with zzso zzso inhibited zzso gamma zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain also functions as a zzso zzso to block zzso zzso gamma zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that zzso interaction with zzso gamma plays a pivotal role in zzso zzso and zzso zzso These newly discovered zzso zzso function may provide important insight into novel therapeutic treatments for tissue repair following zzso zzso
