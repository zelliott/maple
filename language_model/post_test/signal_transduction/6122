Pro bone zzso zzso zzso is initially zzso at a consensus zzso motif adjacent to the mature zzso domain (the zzso zzso and this allows for subsequent zzso at an upstream motif (the zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso zzso regulates the activity and signaling range of mature zzso but the mechanism by which this occurs is zzso Here, we show that the zzso and mature zzso of zzso remain zzso associated after zzso zzso generating a complex that is targeted for rapid zzso zzso requires zzso and zzso function and is enhanced by interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso site zzso mature zzso from the zzso thereby stabilizing the zzso We also show that zzso at the zzso but not the zzso site, is enhanced at reduced zzso consistent with the possibility that the two zzso occur in distinct zzso zzso Based on these results, we propose a model for how zzso at the upstream site regulates the activity and signaling range of mature zzso after it has been released from the zzso
