We aimed to investigate the role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso target of zzso zzso signaling zzso and its negative feedback factor, zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of Crohn's disease zzso 

zzso blood was collected from patients with CD and healthy controls while colon tissue samples were collected from CD patients and those complaining of zzso but with normal zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from peripheral zzso The expression of zzso zzso components and zzso was evaluated in the peripheral zzso zzso using zzso chain reaction and Western zzso and in zzso zzso zzso using zzso 

zzso expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in peripheral zzso zzso were zzso in CD patients compared with healthy controls zzso However, the differences were not significant zzso zzso zzso Western zzso showed that the ratios of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in peripheral zzso zzso were higher in CD patients zzso The composite zzso score of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso also increased in patients with CD compared with those with zzso Both zzso zzso and protein expressions in either peripheral zzso zzso or zzso zzso were lower in patients with CD than in the healthy controls and those with zzso 

The zzso signaling zzso was activated in zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso caused by zzso zzso may be involved in the zzso of zzso
