zzso remains a major medical problem for which there is no effective zzso zzso damage plays an important role in zzso zzso and may represent a target for treatment of zzso Recent studies have suggested that nuclear factor zzso zzso factor 2 zzso binds to zzso response element zzso to induce zzso and phase II zzso zzso under conditions of zzso stress, which reduces zzso damage and zzso of toxic zzso This study evaluated the role of zzso signal zzso in protecting the brain from zzso zzso zzso rats and zzso or control mice were chronic zzso in the zzso zzso zzso was used to activate zzso signal zzso The progression of zzso the cognitive impairment and zzso stress parameters were assessed to determine the extent of zzso brain zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso signal zzso with zzso in zzso suppressed the progression of zzso zzso and also ameliorated the cognitive impairment and zzso stress induced by zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso signal zzso may represent a strategic target for zzso zzso
