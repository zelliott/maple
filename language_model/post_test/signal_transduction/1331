zzso of zzso in cell signaling are zzso by zzso factors such as nuclear zzso B zzso zzso and zzso as well as by zzso modifications of zzso zzso These signaling pathways play roles in the zzso regulation of numerous zzso Here we tested the hypothesis that zzso genes are not randomly distributed in the human zzso but are arranged in zzso zzso blood zzso cells were isolated from healthy adults before and after supplementation with zzso zzso zzso for 21 zzso zzso were cultured ex zzso with zzso A for 3 hours to stimulate gene zzso zzso of zzso zzso approximately 14,000 genes were zzso by both DNA zzso and reverse zzso chain zzso The expression of 139 genes increased by at least zzso in response to zzso zzso whereas the expression of 131 genes decreased by at least zzso in response to zzso zzso The following clusters of zzso genes were zzso 1) zzso of zzso gene products localized to the cell zzso at least zzso of zzso genes play roles in signal zzso zzso findings are consistent with a role for zzso in cell zzso and 2) of the zzso zzso zzso clustered on zzso 1, 2, 3, 11, 12, and 19, whereas no zzso genes were found on zzso 10, 16, 18, 21, and zzso This suggests that position effects play a role in zzso gene zzso zzso these findings suggest that the human zzso contains clusters of zzso zzso
