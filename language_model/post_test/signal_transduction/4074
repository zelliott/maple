zzso receptors located on zzso in the zzso zzso area zzso inhibit zzso synaptic transmission to zzso projection zzso The resulting zzso of zzso cells in the zzso is thought to play a pivotal role in drug zzso however, little is known about how this zzso zzso is affected after chronic zzso zzso The regulation of zzso release during acute withdrawal from zzso was studied in slices from animals treated for zzso d with zzso Slices containing the zzso were prepared and maintained in zzso solutions, and zzso zzso were recorded from zzso zzso The zzso of evoked zzso and the frequency of spontaneous miniature zzso measured in slices from zzso guinea pigs were greater than zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso protein zzso with zzso caused a larger increase in zzso in slices from zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso decreased zzso zzso to a greater extent after drug zzso The results indicate that the probability of zzso release was increased during withdrawal from chronic zzso treatment and that this effect resulted from an zzso of the zzso zzso Increased zzso release from zzso zzso during acute withdrawal may be one zzso mechanism that results from prolonged zzso zzso
