Signaling proteins often contain multiple modular zzso interaction zzso of the same zzso The zzso zzso checkpoint zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso zzso zzso To investigate if the precise position of these zzso relative to each other is important, we created three zzso zzso in which zzso and zzso zzso were individually or simultaneously zzso to the opposite zzso All three zzso were approximately zzso hypersensitive to DNA zzso whose survival requires intact zzso zzso domain functions, but they were not hypersensitive to DNA damage that is addressed in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could still be recruited for zzso by upstream zzso but then failed to zzso and activate zzso zzso downstream zzso The results indicate that precise zzso domain positions are important for their roles in zzso possibly via regulation of the zzso of zzso zzso signaling zzso
