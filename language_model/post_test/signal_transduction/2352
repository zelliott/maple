zzso zzso receptors zzso signals that transmit information from the zzso environment to the cell zzso Although zzso lack intrinsic zzso zzso activity, stimulation of the alpha 4 beta 1 zzso on human zzso T cells results in rapid zzso zzso of proteins in the 105 to 115 zzso zzso In this study, we report that alpha 4 zzso stimulation of zzso T cells results in zzso zzso of three distinct zzso zzso zzso and human zzso of zzso 1 zzso all of which associate with the adapter protein zzso However, zzso can be distinguished from zzso and zzso by its ability to associate with the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are zzso distinct from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The functional significance of zzso association with zzso is suggested by the ability of alpha 4 zzso stimulation to activate zzso zzso zzso zzso These studies show that alpha 4 zzso stimulation of T cells results in the zzso zzso of several distinct zzso The association of these zzso with zzso signaling zzso such as zzso and zzso may play a critical role in zzso regulation of T cell zzso
