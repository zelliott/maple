zzso muscle is a major target of insulin zzso The possible role of zzso zzso zzso in insulin zzso signaling in muscle was zzso After a zzso fast, rats were injected zzso with insulin or zzso muscles were excised after zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were partially zzso by ammonium zzso zzso and zzso Q zzso zzso was zzso as zzso into zzso basic zzso Two activity zzso were zzso peak I zzso with approximately zzso M zzso and peak II with approximately zzso M zzso Three zzso after insulin injection the activity of peak II increased zzso zzso peak I was zzso After 10 zzso the activity of peak II returned toward zzso while peak I was activated approximately zzso zzso confirmed the presence of zzso zzso zzso with activity zzso I and zzso the former as a approximately 41 zzso protein and the latter as a zzso of approximately 42 and approximately 44 zzso The data suggest sequential zzso of two zzso zzso in zzso the zzso which zzso rapidly may represent zzso while the more slowly responding zzso may be zzso
