zzso coli zzso is zzso by membrane zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso domain produces a hybrid, zzso that forms soluble complexes with zzso and zzso The three-dimensional reconstruction of these complexes was different from that anticipated based solely on structures of the isolated zzso We found that analogous complexes zzso with a zzso zzso domain zzso of the zzso zzso without the zzso zzso zzso zzso These complexes have essentially the same size, zzso and architecture as those formed from zzso Thus, the organization of these zzso complexes is determined by zzso interactions between the constituent zzso proteins and may represent the active form in zzso To understand this structure in its cellular context, we propose a model involving parallel membrane segments in zzso zzso zzso in zzso
