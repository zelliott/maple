zzso plays critical roles in stimulating smooth muscle gene zzso during zzso and smooth muscle cell zzso zzso zzso evidence demonstrates that zzso modification plays important roles in regulating gene zzso Here, we investigated the effect of changes in the expression of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso promoter zzso We found that zzso zzso proteins such as zzso and zzso enhances zzso zzso promoter activities; conversely, zzso zzso inhibitor such as zzso (but not zzso and zzso suppresses this effect of zzso We also found that zzso a zzso inhibitor that stimulates zzso zzso of the zzso zzso further enhances the zzso activity of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso the zzso effect of zzso zzso and the dominant negative zzso of zzso zzso also stimulates the association of zzso (a potent zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso zzso show that zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso This study demonstrates that the balance of zzso and zzso expression affects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is accompanied by zzso zzso at the zzso zzso This study provides the first evidence showing that zzso zzso of the zzso promoter is a target of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso zzso is involved in the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso gene zzso
