The zzso zzso plays important roles in embryonic development, adult stem cell maintenance and zzso In zzso these effects are zzso by zzso Desert and Indian zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and dual zzso prior to zzso and forming a response zzso zzso processing and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso has not previously been zzso This study reports on the zzso processing, zzso and signaling activities of zzso zzso and zzso zzso expressed in cultured cells, providing unexpected evidence that zzso does not undergo substantial zzso or zzso and does not function in zzso zzso Rather, zzso functions as a zzso signaling zzso to activate a cell zzso zzso signaling response, consistent with its zzso signaling in zzso Further, the zzso prostate cancer cell, when induced to express zzso zzso and zzso is active only in zzso zzso zzso swap studies reveal that the zzso domain of zzso regulates its processing and zzso These findings establish a new regulatory role for zzso in zzso zzso signaling in development and zzso
