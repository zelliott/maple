In zzso differentiation of mouse and human stem cells into early T cells has been successfully demonstrated using artificial zzso signaling zzso However, generation of mature, zzso functional T cells, directly from human stem cells has remained zzso except when using zzso zzso of stem cells zzso zzso with zzso T cell receptors zzso Here we show that human zzso zzso blood zzso zzso zzso stem cells can be successfully differentiated into functional, zzso zzso zzso T cells without direct zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso medium successfully induced the development of zzso and zzso early T zzso These cells, upon continued culture with zzso zzso or zzso virus zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in the generation of a zzso population of zzso or zzso zzso T cells, zzso Upon further zzso with zzso target cells, these zzso stem zzso T cells exhibited zzso zzso specifically zzso surface zzso zzso gamma zzso production, and zzso B zzso Such zzso in zzso generation of functional, zzso T cells from human stem cells could eventually provide a readily available cell source for adoptive transfer zzso and also allow better understanding of human T cell zzso
