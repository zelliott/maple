zzso is widely used as a sedative and zzso induction zzso The aim of this study was to systematically examine the zzso mechanisms of zzso in zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso (15 and 30 zzso inhibited zzso zzso in washed human zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso (15 and 30 zzso also inhibited zzso breakdown and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso (15 and 30 zzso increased the formation of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso increase in zzso was markedly inhibited in the presence of zzso (15 and 30 zzso Rapid zzso of a zzso protein of molecular weight zzso zzso zzso a marker of protein zzso C zzso was triggered by zzso zzso zzso This zzso was markedly inhibited by zzso (15 and 30 zzso zzso (30 zzso did not significantly reduce the electron spin resonance signal intensity of zzso zzso in activated zzso In the zzso study, intravenous injection of zzso (10 zzso significantly prolonged the zzso period of inducing zzso plug formation in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso can significantly prevent zzso formation in zzso Its zzso activity may be involved in the zzso of the zzso of zzso C and the zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso These lead to lower zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso
