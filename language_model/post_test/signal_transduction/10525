zzso zzso protein zzso is essential to maintain a pool of zzso immature zzso in the growth plate of long zzso In chick and zzso expression of zzso in the growth plate is restricted to the zzso zone and is down regulated as zzso maturation zzso zzso expression is lost in the growth plates of mice engineered to lack zzso signaling and, conversely, is maintained by zzso expression of zzso in developing zzso zzso preventing zzso zzso by forced expression of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso blocks zzso maturation by acting as a zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso of zzso that has been converted into a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso maturation factor zzso and zzso zzso can rescue the zzso blockade of zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso signals block zzso zzso by, in part, maintaining the expression of zzso which in turn zzso the expression of genes required for zzso zzso
