Several approaches are currently being taken to zzso the mechanisms and the molecular components responsible for protein targeting to and zzso across the membrane of the zzso zzso Two experimental systems dominate the field: a zzso system derived from zzso zzso zzso and a combined genetic and zzso system employing the zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained in each of these systems have contributed novel, mostly zzso zzso Recently, much effort in the field has been dedicated to identifying membrane proteins that comprise the zzso zzso proteins involved in zzso have been identified both in the zzso system, using a combination of zzso and zzso approaches, and in zzso zzso by selecting for zzso in the zzso zzso None of the membrane proteins isolated, however, appears to be zzso between the two experimental zzso In the case of the signal recognition zzso the two systems have zzso which has led to a better understanding of how proteins are targeted to the zzso zzso zzso
