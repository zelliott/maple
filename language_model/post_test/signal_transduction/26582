zzso zzso plays critical roles in normal central nervous system zzso function, neurodegenerative diseases, and zzso We determined whether zzso signaling could be evoked within the zzso normal adult rat zzso with clinically relevant peripheral stimulation and recorded (at zzso with zzso ceramic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels and both zzso zzso and electrical zzso zzso release were measured within the zzso nucleus, a relay of the zzso zzso columns zzso zzso The zzso with zzso zzso tips were more effective at tissue penetration than the flat, blunt zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected from zzso to zzso below the zzso zzso zzso zzso evoked zzso signals showed an zzso of zzso and a duration of zzso zzso signals, zzso zzso evoked signals, like zzso ones, were both rapid and slowly zzso zzso evoked signals, especially those evoked by stimulation trains, were more zzso and had an zzso of zzso duration of zzso and zzso from stimulus onset of zzso zzso signals, zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso signals evoked by electrical stimulation had longer zzso and were recorded primarily in the middle and zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso and electrical stimulation of the zzso zzso and zzso did not evoke zzso zzso With the use of zzso these results show, for the first time, zzso specific changes in zzso levels during peripheral zzso and electrical zzso
