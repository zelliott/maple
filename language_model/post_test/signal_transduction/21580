Based on indirect evidence, a role for zzso released copper and zinc as zzso of zzso activity has been zzso To test this proposal directly, we studied the effect of copper, zzso and other zzso zzso on zzso currents in zzso zzso zzso zzso and on their firing rate induced by small zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso range zzso up the zzso zzso and increased the zzso of the inward sodium zzso In the zzso range, they caused a dose dependent zzso of the inward zzso and zzso currents zzso and zzso and reduced de zzso of the zzso zzso outward current zzso On the other hand, the firing rate of zzso zzso increased when exposed to zzso concentration of zzso zzso and decreased when exposed to zzso zzso This zzso effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso may be explained by the interaction of these zzso with high and low affinity sites in zzso zzso Our results support the idea that these zzso are normal zzso of zzso zzso
