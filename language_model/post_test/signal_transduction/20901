We have examined the role of zzso expression in the zzso of cellular toxicity to zzso We have demonstrated that treatment of zzso cells, which zzso the zzso product of the human zzso zzso with a zzso zzso directed against the zzso domain zzso results in enhanced zzso zzso A similar enhancement was obtained when cells were exposed to zzso A and its analogue zzso zzso both of which inhibit zzso zzso zzso Using the host cell zzso zzso of reporter gene expression from zzso zzso and unscheduled DNA synthesis zzso following zzso treatment of cells, we have found that zzso of zzso by zzso was associated with zzso of DNA zzso zzso alone, under conditions which zzso DNA repair, slightly reduces the zzso of the cell cycle, while zzso induced arrest at S and zzso zzso Combination of zzso and zzso only slightly prevented zzso S and zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso is one of the major signaling components coupled to zzso we have examined the role of zzso in DNA repair zzso zzso expression of a zzso dominant negative zzso zzso prevents DNA repair zzso by zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso regulates DNA repair zzso at least in part, through zzso zzso
