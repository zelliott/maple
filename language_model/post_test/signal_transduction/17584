zzso binding sites in a human zzso cell line zzso have been characterized in zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso cells with high zzso zzso was zzso and selective, and dependent on time and zzso zzso analysis revealed the presence of high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso affinity binding sites for zzso in zzso zzso The zzso experiments also showed that zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso The association data, however, indicated the presence of only one binding zzso zzso zzso was more potent than human zzso and rat zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso zzso peptides did not zzso zzso zzso zzso was, however, less potent than rat zzso in zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with rat zzso (10 zzso reduced the specific binding of zzso by zzso whereas rat zzso (10 zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as rat and human zzso zzso the zzso zzso activity of zzso cell membrane preparation in a zzso manner, with an order of potency of zzso zzso rat zzso zzso human zzso A zzso zzso zzso significantly attenuated the zzso effect of both zzso and zzso on zzso zzso zzso These investigations show that distinct receptors of zzso and zzso are present in zzso cells, and that zzso stimulates zzso zzso activity through zzso zzso This system could now be exploited for studying zzso receptors and zzso signal zzso
