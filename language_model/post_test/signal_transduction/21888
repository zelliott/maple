Opiates have been shown to inhibit cell growth and trigger zzso but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso zzso expression and promotes zzso zzso Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso with a dominant negative zzso death domain zzso zzso revealing that zzso zzso is dependent on zzso Furthermore, suppression of zzso zzso expression by zzso interference technology considerably attenuated the zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso seems to be dependent on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso by the zzso inhibitor zzso significantly enhanced zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso or nuclear zzso zzso expression by zzso interference technology also dramatically increased zzso zzso Our study thus demonstrates that zzso zzso zzso cell zzso through zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
