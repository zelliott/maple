The expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene is zzso by zzso in zzso although its promoter does not contain a classical zzso element, suggesting an alternative mechanism of zzso expression of this zzso The aim of this work was to assess whether zzso zzso of the zzso gene depends on zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso zzso both signaling pathways being activated by zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso reporter zzso was analyzed in the absence and presence of zzso and zzso zzso The expression of zzso was also compared with the zzso of the complement zzso which contains a classical zzso element zzso Our results demonstrate that the induction of zzso expression by zzso requires longer stimulation than that necessary for complement zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of the zzso gene depends on zzso activity, while zzso zzso of the zzso requires zzso activity, pointing to a role of these zzso zzso pathways in the zzso regulation of the zzso
