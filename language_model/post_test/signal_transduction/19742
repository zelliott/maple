A defining characteristic of the brain is its remarkable capacity to undergo zzso functional and zzso zzso via mechanisms of plasticity that form the basis of our capacity to zzso and retain zzso Today, it is generally accepted that one key zzso mechanism underlying the formation of memories reside in zzso modifications of synaptic strength and structural zzso of neural networks activated during zzso The discovery and detailed report of the phenomenon generally known as long-term zzso a long-lasting zzso form of synaptic zzso opened a new chapter in the study of the zzso zzso of memory in the zzso brain, and this form of synaptic plasticity has now become the dominant model in the search for the cellular bases of learning and zzso To date, the key events in the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity and memory formation are starting to be zzso They require the zzso of specific receptors and of several molecular zzso to convert zzso signals into persistent functional changes in zzso zzso zzso evidence suggests that the rapid zzso of zzso gene programs is a key mechanism underlying the enduring modification of neural networks required for the laying down of zzso The recent developments in the search for the cellular and molecular mechanisms of memory storage are zzso
