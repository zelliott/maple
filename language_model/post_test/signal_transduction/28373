zzso zzso 1 zzso has been shown recently to induce zzso in the zzso zzso a zzso also zzso by zzso of zzso zzso a known indicator of the zzso zzso Here we investigated the role of the zzso zzso in the expression of zzso D1 using tissue culture models and transgenic mice expressing activated zzso in zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso from zzso active zzso transgenic mice exhibit a zzso to zzso increased expression of zzso D1 as compared with zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso levels were elevated in human breast tumors and also correlated well with increased zzso D1 zzso Increased expression of zzso in breast cancer cells zzso zzso D1 promoter activity, elevated levels of zzso D1 zzso zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by an zzso zzso zzso acids zzso or zzso zzso by short interference zzso markedly reduced the expression of zzso zzso suggesting a requirement of a functional zzso zzso for optimal expression of zzso zzso zzso from deletion and zzso analysis indicate that zzso regulates zzso D1 zzso by means of an zzso zzso Together, these findings suggest a model wherein zzso regulation of zzso D1 expression might involve an zzso zzso and that zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso mice may be zzso at least in part, with the zzso of zzso zzso and that zzso is zzso in human breast zzso
