Double strand breaks zzso are the most deleterious of the DNA zzso that initiate zzso instability and promote zzso zzso have evolved a complex protein network to zzso zzso and repair zzso In zzso cells, a key component in this network is zzso which becomes rapidly zzso at zzso zzso at zzso Here we show that zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso complex is critical for the efficient formation of zzso and functions as a zzso regulator in zzso zzso damage zzso zzso interacts with zzso in a DNA zzso manner and is required for zzso of zzso at zzso As a functional consequence, we show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the recruitment of zzso zzso to zzso and thereby reduces the formation of zzso and the recruitment of zzso to DNA damage zzso These data suggest that zzso of zzso plays a critical role in initiating DNA damage zzso zzso with these zzso impairment of zzso function by zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso zzso all leads to significant defects both in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso at zzso and in zzso of zzso and zzso Additionally, the regulatory effect of zzso on zzso formation is dependent on zzso zzso their ability to properly activate the DNA damage signaling pathway, zzso zzso cells exhibit impaired DNA repair and increased sensitivity to zzso zzso Together, our findings demonstrate a distinct zzso mechanism that is required for zzso zzso and the initiation of zzso
