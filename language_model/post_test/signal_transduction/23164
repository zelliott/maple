zzso compounds are promising agents in the therapeutic treatment of diabetes zzso but their mechanism of action has not been fully zzso The current work investigated the effects of zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are important targets of zzso zzso The experimental results revealed that zzso complexes increased the expression and zzso of zzso in differentiated rat zzso zzso caused zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso decreased the expression of zzso however, compound C zzso zzso did not significantly reduce the expression of zzso In addition, zzso complexes induced zzso interaction between zzso and a zzso zzso heat shock protein zzso Overall, our results suggest that zzso complexes may zzso zzso by suppressing zzso degradation, and thus stimulate zzso expression and zzso The present work has provided new insights into the mechanism of the zzso actions of zzso zzso
