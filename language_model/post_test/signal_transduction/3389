Bone zzso protein zzso signaling controls development and maintenance of many zzso zzso and quantitative approaches in zzso reveal that zzso zzso show distinct function in wing zzso zzso control of zzso patterning depends on a network of zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso that regulate zzso signaling strength and zzso zzso zzso feedback regulation of zzso zzso and zzso expression provides a system where cells actively respond to, and zzso the zzso zzso landscape to form a zzso that exhibits remarkable properties, including zzso zzso of zzso patterning with tissue size and the zzso of uniform tissue zzso This system provides valuable insights into mechanisms that mitigate the influence of zzso to regulate zzso interactions and maintain organ zzso
