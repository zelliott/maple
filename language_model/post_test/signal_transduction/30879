Virtually every zzso cell, including zzso possesses an intrinsic zzso zzso The role of this zzso based molecular mechanism in cardiovascular biology is poorly zzso We hypothesized that the zzso clock within the zzso influences zzso variations in zzso zzso zzso therefore, generated a zzso zzso clock zzso zzso mouse to test this zzso At 12 zzso of age, zzso mice exhibit normal zzso zzso function in zzso as assessed by zzso zzso studies reveal zzso of heart rate zzso variations and zzso in zzso mice (in the absence of zzso system zzso zzso heart rate persisted in zzso hearts zzso ex zzso in the working mode, highlighting the intrinsic nature of this zzso zzso but not zzso hearts exhibited a marked zzso variation in responsiveness to an zzso in workload zzso zzso plus 1 zzso zzso ex zzso with a greater increase in cardiac power and efficiency during the dark zzso phase zzso the light zzso zzso Moreover, zzso oxygen consumption and fatty acid zzso rates were increased, whereas cardiac efficiency was zzso in zzso zzso These observations were associated with no zzso in zzso content or structure and modest zzso dysfunction in zzso zzso Gene expression zzso analysis identified zzso and 176 genes in zzso and zzso respectively, whose normal zzso expression patterns were altered in zzso zzso These studies suggest that the zzso zzso clock influences zzso zzso function, zzso and gene zzso
