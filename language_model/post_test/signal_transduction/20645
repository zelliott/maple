zzso represent the largest cell surface zzso family, regulating all zzso functions and thus constitute major drug zzso Until recently, the zzso was believed to work as an zzso switch able to promote zzso of all signaling zzso associated with this zzso The new concept of biased zzso led recently to the notion of functional selectivity of zzso favoring the zzso of specific signaling zzso thus paving the way for developing zzso drugs with increased efficacy and decreased side zzso However, recent publication of new zzso with high sensitivity probing the first signaling events close to the active zzso and combined with the analysis of the zzso of more downstream zzso has challenged the definition of biased zzso This review highlights the importance of zzso functional zzso for biased zzso screening and the future strategies for pharmacological mapping zzso aiming to select new drugs with enhanced therapeutic zzso
