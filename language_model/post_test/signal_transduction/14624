Construction of the brain is one of the most complex zzso zzso zzso signals shape all zzso including the brain, and the tumor zzso zzso zzso coli zzso is a key negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso We carried out the first assessment of the role of zzso proteins in brain development, simultaneously zzso both zzso and zzso in clones of cells in the zzso zzso zzso zzso We focused on the zzso where zzso neural zzso shift from zzso to zzso divisions across the zzso zzso Loss of both zzso triggers dramatic defects in zzso lobe zzso Double zzso cells segregate from zzso neighbors, while double zzso zzso form tangled zzso zzso suggesting changes in cell zzso zzso zzso are graded along the zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling downstream of zzso mimics these zzso a zzso zzso blocks them, and a known zzso target, zzso is activated in double zzso zzso strongly suggesting that the zzso result from activated zzso zzso We also explored the roles of classic zzso in differential zzso Finally, we propose a model suggesting that zzso signaling regulates fine scale cell fates along the zzso zzso in part by creating an zzso zzso and consider possible alternate explanations for our zzso
