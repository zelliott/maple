During zzso zzso both the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the membrane bound zzso zzso zzso are required for proper guidance of zzso and motor zzso We provide evidence that zzso zzso signaling by zzso and its zzso zzso An zzso zzso function zzso zzso suppresses most zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso and motor zzso zzso while increased zzso and decreased zzso expression dramatically increase the zzso of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso do not affect zzso zzso zzso These results support the hypothesis that zzso zzso the zzso genetic pathway, perhaps as an upstream zzso We also find that zzso of the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that two different zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso modify zzso zzso patterning in quite different zzso
