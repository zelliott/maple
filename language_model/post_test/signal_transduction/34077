In order to investigate the toxic effect of intermittent high zzso zzso and sustained high zzso zzso on rat pancreatic beta cell functions and the potential involved mechanisms, isolated rat zzso and zzso beta cells were exposed to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and 25 zzso zzso alternating every 12 zzso for 72 zzso The results showed that zzso induced a more significant impairment of insulin release response in rat zzso and zzso cell than zzso zzso the zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso stress were more markedly increased in zzso and zzso cells exposed to zzso However, there was no significant difference between reducing cell zzso insulin content and gene expression induced by zzso and zzso Taken together, this study suggested the more serious toxic effect on rat pancreatic beta cell function induced by zzso treatment may be due to excessive zzso of cellular zzso
