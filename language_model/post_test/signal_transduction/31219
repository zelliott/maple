The maintenance of synaptic transmission requires that zzso be recycled after releasing zzso Several modes of retrieval have been proposed to operate at small synaptic terminals of central zzso including a fast zzso mechanism that releases neurotransmitter through a fusion zzso Using an improved fluorescent reporter zzso zzso fused to zzso we find that only a slow mode of zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso operates at zzso zzso when zzso fusion is triggered by a single nerve impulse or short zzso This retrieval mechanism is blocked by zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso or by zzso of zzso using zzso and it is associated with the movement of zzso and zzso proteins out of the zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso is the major, if not zzso mechanism of zzso retrieval after zzso zzso
