zzso receptors zzso are considered as important targets for drug zzso The zzso zzso zzso is an attractive host for zzso screening of zzso zzso for human zzso because it can simplify the complicated signaling pathways that are present in zzso cell zzso Unfortunately, many human zzso induce only partial signal zzso in zzso cells depending on their zzso efficiency with zzso zzso This problem often results in unsatisfactory detection sensitivity, thereby resulting in a limitation to zzso detection zzso Here we introduce a new highly sensitive detection method that provides robust zzso detection of human zzso Our strategy is designed to invoke feedback zzso of signals within zzso zzso signaling zzso Briefly, zzso stimulation of human zzso triggers expression of an artificial signal zzso that zzso zzso We chose human zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso as a model of a human zzso Investigation of the response of zzso zzso to various zzso of zzso demonstrated that feedback zzso of the signal can successfully improve the detection limit and the maximum level of zzso This novel approach will enhance the usefulness of zzso screening of zzso zzso for a variety of human zzso
