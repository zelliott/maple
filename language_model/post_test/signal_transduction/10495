zzso zzso of the zzso family of zzso factors plays an important role in zzso processing in the zzso Interestingly, the zzso family of zzso specific for zzso proteins is localized in the zzso which is critical for nuclear import of zzso proteins in a zzso zzso Here, we report molecular dissection of the mechanism involved in zzso zzso in the zzso Common among all zzso the zzso zzso zzso core is separated by a unique zzso zzso The zzso in zzso zzso and zzso share little sequence zzso but they function zzso in restricting the zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso had little effect on the zzso activity, but it caused a quantitative zzso of the zzso to the nucleus and consequently induced zzso of zzso factors in the zzso Rather than carrying a nuclear export signal as suggested zzso we found multiple redundant signals in the zzso that act together to anchor the zzso in the zzso Interestingly, a cell cycle signal induced nuclear zzso of the zzso at the zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso may play an important role in linking signaling to zzso metabolism in higher zzso zzso
