Chinese cabbage zzso zzso is widely recognized for its economic importance and contribution to human nutrition but zzso and zzso stresses are main obstacle for its quality, nutritional status and zzso In this study, zzso Express zzso zzso zzso sequences were generated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso library and the unique transcripts were classified functionally using a gene zzso zzso zzso zzso encyclopedia of genes and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the structural domain data were obtained from the biological database for stress related genes zzso zzso zzso provided a wide outlook of functional characterization of zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis revealed % 83 of zzso to be well zzso towards zzso one zzso zzso zzso of zzso returned zzso zzso and zzso zzso giving a total of zzso putative zzso zzso This zzso contained zzso zzso sequences functionally zzso to stress responses and from which expression of randomly selected zzso were analyzed against cold, salt, drought, zzso water and zzso zzso Most of the zzso showed zzso expression against these zzso Thus, the zzso zzso is very important for discovering the potential genes related to stress resistance in Chinese cabbage, and can be of useful resources for genetic engineering of zzso zzso
