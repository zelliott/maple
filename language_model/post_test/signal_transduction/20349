zzso and zzso signals are important for establishing zzso zzso asymmetry in zzso In sea zzso zzso signaling prevents the formation of the zzso on the right zzso However, the opposing zzso to zzso signaling during zzso axis establishment is not zzso Here, we revealed that zzso signaling is activated in the left zzso pouch, specifically in the zzso zzso but not in the small zzso By zzso zzso activities, we demonstrated that zzso signaling is required for zzso the expression of the zzso genes and the formation of the zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso signals on the right side inhibit zzso signaling and control zzso zzso separation and zzso of the small zzso Our findings show that zzso signaling is the positive signal for zzso development in sea zzso suggesting that the opposing roles of zzso and zzso signals in establishing zzso asymmetry are zzso in zzso
