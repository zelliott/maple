zzso is the only approved ALS zzso zzso influences several cellular zzso but its exact mechanism of action remains zzso Our goal was to study the drug's influence on the zzso transport rate in two ALS relevant cell types, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso human zzso zzso motor zzso cells and rat zzso zzso were exposed to zzso The rate of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso to the cell's plasma membrane and the main zzso transport regulatory zzso zzso levels were zzso We found that zzso increases the zzso transport rate and zzso the zzso of zzso zzso to plasma membrane in both types of zzso zzso leads to zzso zzso and to the zzso of its downstream target, zzso In conclusion, increasing the zzso transport rate in ALS affected cells might be one of the mechanisms of zzso therapeutic zzso These findings can be used to rationally design and zzso novel zzso drugs that zzso zzso transport in zzso and skeletal zzso
