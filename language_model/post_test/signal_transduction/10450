Ethanol exposure during zzso and early zzso zzso zzso within certain embryonic cell zzso leading to zzso and neurological zzso There is currently little information about the initial zzso of zzso zzso and interest in the ability of zzso survival factors to moderate zzso is zzso Ethanol alters zzso zzso leading to cell death in chick zzso suggesting that zzso could occur rapidly and that signaling pathways activated by survival factors might reduce zzso 

zzso mice were zzso with 1, 2, or 4 zzso ethanol on day zzso of zzso zzso 1, 3, or 6, hours before harvesting zzso zzso Control animals received zzso Blood alcohol zzso zzso were determined by gas zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso were cultured in zzso for 1 or 3 zzso with 0 or 400 zzso ethanol and 0 or 5 zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso growth factor zzso zzso was zzso using zzso zzso to detect zzso V binding and DNA fragmentation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso in zzso or zzso zzso 

Both zzso V binding and zzso were elevated zzso zzso zzso in zzso exposed in zzso to 1 zzso ethanol for 3 hours, increasing zzso with time and ethanol zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso in all germ cell zzso Mice treated with 4 zzso sustained zzso of 400 zzso for nearly 3 hours, significantly increasing zzso within the first zzso zzso zzso exposed to 400 zzso ethanol displayed zzso to zzso more zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however, zzso zzso prevented zzso 

Ethanol rapidly produced zzso in zzso zzso consistent with induction by zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was blocked by the zzso survival factor, zzso zzso in the expression of survival factors within individual zzso could be partly responsible for variations in the zzso effects of ethanol among offspring exposed zzso
