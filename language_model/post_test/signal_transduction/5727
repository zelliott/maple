The differentiation of resident zzso to zzso is central to wound zzso In the context of organ fibrosis, however, persistence of these zzso is associated with progressive zzso This study examines mechanisms controlling the maintenance of the zzso zzso zzso were induced by adding transforming growth zzso zzso (10 zzso to zzso for 72 zzso The zzso was maintained for up to 120 h following removal of zzso Western zzso for zzso and zzso demonstrated persistent zzso despite removal of zzso zzso This persistence was because of zzso synthesis of zzso which was inhibited by both zzso zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso of zzso was also associated with increased zzso zzso generation, synthesis of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso coat zzso These were all inhibited by zzso zzso zzso To further investigate the importance of zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso the zzso pool of zzso acid, essential for zzso chain zzso This prevented formation of the zzso zzso zzso and decreased expression of zzso zzso had no effect, however, on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by short interfering zzso prevented zzso zzso without altering zzso zzso zzso thus suggesting that zzso regulation of cell zzso was independent of zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso in areas of zzso maintain their own zzso through zzso zzso action and that zzso zzso zzso are an essential zzso of zzso We propose a model in which the formation of the zzso zzso zzso regulates the outcome of zzso zzso zzso zzso and therefore persistence of the zzso zzso
