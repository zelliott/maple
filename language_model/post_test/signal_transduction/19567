zzso zzso zzso zzso play critical roles in regulating cellular differentiation and zzso zzso and signaling zzso zzso is a novel zzso that zzso zzso activity and promotes cell zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether zzso expression was altered in zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with normal zzso in a Chinese zzso 

We examined zzso zzso zzso in 30 cases in both normal zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso zzso from the same patient in zzso zzso embedded tissue zzso 

zzso protein expression levels are decreased in zzso SCC compared to the zzso normal zzso 

This pattern of zzso expression suggests that it may act as a negative regulator in zzso SCC cell zzso
