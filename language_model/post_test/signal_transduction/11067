The ability of zzso to produce both zzso and zzso has provided zzso advantages in survival and zzso of these zzso Here we provide evidence of an zzso mechanism that balances zzso and zzso production in the model zzso fungus zzso zzso We have discovered a putative zzso zzso that functions in association with a previously characterized zzso zzso to integrate fatty acid derived zzso and spore zzso In contrast to zzso deletion of zzso significantly increased zzso production and decreased zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso indicate that this ratio control is associated with two apparent feedback zzso The first loop shows zzso and zzso expression is dependent zzso and regulates the expression of, zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso factors required for zzso or zzso production, zzso The second loop suggests zzso zzso products zzso signal the generation of zzso zzso These data support a case for a zzso zzso zzso indicative of relative sexual and asexual spore zzso
