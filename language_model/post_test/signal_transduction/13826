zzso zzso zzso formed between more than zzso of land plants and zzso from the zzso zzso is an ancient association that is believed to have evolved as plants moved onto land more than 400 zzso zzso zzso the plant hormones zzso and zzso are thought to have been present in the plant lineage since before the divergence of the zzso in the case of zzso and before the zzso of land in the case of zzso The discovery of zzso in the 1930s predates the discovery of zzso as a plant hormone in 2008 by over 70 zzso Recent studies in pea suggest that these two signals may interact to regulate zzso zzso Furthermore, the first quantitative studies are presented that show that low zzso content of the root is correlated with low zzso production, an interaction that has implications for how these plant hormones regulate several zzso programs including shoot zzso secondary growth and root zzso With recent advances in our understanding of zzso and zzso zzso together with the discovery of the zzso signals that activate the plant host, the stage is set for real breakthroughs in our understanding of the interactions between plant and zzso signals in zzso zzso
