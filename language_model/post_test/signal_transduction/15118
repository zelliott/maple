In early zzso age-related zzso zzso zzso zzso thinning of zzso membrane is associated with zzso of zzso zzso into the zzso zzso To determine whether there is a link between zzso stress and zzso zzso zzso degradation by the retinal zzso zzso the present study focused on the effect of zzso stress on zzso and zzso zzso two zzso with zzso specificity for components of zzso zzso 

zzso human zzso cells were exposed to zzso zzso To investigate the role of signal zzso zzso cells were zzso with the specific zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected by zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso of zzso was determined by quantitative real-time zzso zzso degradation by retinal zzso zzso was assessed by zzso zzso 

zzso stress increased zzso and zzso protein release but reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso disclosed increases of zzso and zzso zzso after zzso stress with no zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was slightly zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso markedly reduced zzso zzso whereas zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso was less zzso zzso expression was attenuated by both zzso zzso zzso type I collagen degradation by zzso cells was reduced by simultaneous treatment with a synthetic zzso or a zzso zzso against zzso 

zzso and zzso in the retinal zzso zzso are zzso by zzso zzso The directional shift in the zzso ratio is associated with increased type I collagen zzso This may be an important mechanism contributing to the zzso of early zzso zzso
