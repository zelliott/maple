In the rat zzso zzso cell line, zzso of the alpha zzso zzso zzso gene is prominently zzso by zzso Although zzso zzso and zzso zzso enhance expression of the zzso gene in liver, they have no zzso effect on this gene in zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso cells have zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and respond to zzso by increasing expression of the zzso zzso The zzso for the zzso zzso receptors is increased zzso following zzso zzso Even with elevated zzso zzso zzso no zzso regulation of the zzso gene is zzso The lack of response to zzso is also found with the zzso zzso gene zzso suggesting the absence of specific zzso zzso Since zzso promotes only a minimal stimulation of the zzso protein zzso zzso cells lack the indirect zzso signaling zzso to acute phase plasma protein genes that has been found to be crucial in other zzso cell zzso Considering that a similar zzso regulation of the zzso gene is zzso in zzso cells and normal liver, a separate zzso zzso zzso controlling the zzso gene is assumed to be missing in zzso zzso
