An imbalance in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso contributes to zzso plaque zzso and zzso Here we determined whether zzso accumulating in advanced zzso zzso play a role in plaque zzso In human zzso zzso cells, we investigated the effects of an zzso mixture of composition similar to that in advanced human carotid plaques on the expression and synthesis of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso and zzso A marked zzso of zzso gene zzso but not of its zzso was observed by real-time zzso zzso zzso activity was also found increased by gel zzso zzso a net zzso of zzso protein level was also observed by zzso Using antioxidants or specific zzso or zzso we demonstrated that the zzso mixture zzso zzso expression zzso zzso overproduction of zzso oxygen species, probably by zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso signaling pathways via protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso These results suggest, for the first time, that zzso accumulating in advanced zzso zzso significantly contribute to plaque vulnerability by promoting zzso imbalance in zzso zzso
