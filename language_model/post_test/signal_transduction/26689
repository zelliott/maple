The primary function of the zzso cascade is to promote zzso and limit blood loss in response to tissue zzso In addition, there is now considerable evidence that zzso plays pivotal roles in orchestrating inflammatory and tissue repair responses via both the generation of zzso and zzso of the family of zzso receptors zzso zzso uncontrolled zzso and zzso signaling responses have been shown to contribute to excessive inflammatory and zzso responses in the context of a broad range of conditions, including acute lung injury and zzso lung zzso In terms of the cellular origin of excessive zzso activity in the context of lung injury, zzso zzso are principally thought to be derived from the circulation and locally activated via the zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso More recently, we have provided compelling evidence that several key zzso zzso are locally zzso by the zzso zzso zzso in pulmonary zzso In terms of signaling receptors activated in response to the zzso zzso current evidence suggests a major role for zzso in influencing zzso barrier zzso inflammatory cell zzso and collagen deposition in response to lung injury, whereas zzso signaling has been implicated mainly in zzso lung inflammatory zzso This article reviews current understanding of zzso pathways in acute and zzso lung injury and expands on the scientific rationale for strategies that specifically target zzso zzso or zzso signaling zzso
