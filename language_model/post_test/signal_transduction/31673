The available estimate of the energy zzso for signaling in rat zzso is refined to examine the separate contribution of zzso and synaptic activity as a function of average zzso firing zzso By taking into account a zzso model of short-term synaptic zzso we show that the transition from low to high cortical activity is accompanied by a substantial increase in relative energy consumed by action zzso zzso synaptic zzso This consideration might be important for a deeper understanding of how information is represented in the zzso and which zzso pathways are zzso to sustain cortical zzso
