zzso recurrence and zzso are the major obstacles to improving the prognosis of patients with zzso zzso zzso To identify novel risk factors associated with zzso recurrence and zzso we have established a panel of zzso zzso zzso by comparing zzso expression in zzso and zzso human zzso tissue samples using zzso zzso is defined as zzso disease occurring within a zzso time point of the original zzso Among the panel, expression of the zzso cluster was consistently and significantly zzso in zzso tissue samples and cell lines associated with early tumor zzso poor zzso survival, and an zzso transition zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso increased the zzso cell population, migration, and zzso ability of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and mothers against zzso zzso 7 zzso were subsequently identified as two functional targets of zzso and both zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso zzso expression of zzso or zzso partially rescued zzso zzso cell migration, and zzso properties of zzso zzso Previously, zzso was shown to be a transforming growth factor beta zzso type 1 zzso zzso Here, we further demonstrated that zzso of zzso acted as a positive feedback regulator for the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso involved in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso K zzso signaling in zzso zzso Additionally, zzso of the zzso and zzso pathways in zzso cells resulted in an acquired resistance to zzso whereas blocking zzso of the zzso zzso overcame zzso zzso resistance and prevented tumor zzso in zzso 

zzso of zzso activates the zzso and zzso pathways by targeting zzso and zzso contributing to zzso and tumor recurrence in zzso
