zzso proteins belong to a family of zzso molecules expressed in all zzso cells, which play an important role in a multitude of signaling zzso zzso proteins bind to zzso motifs in a zzso zzso More than 200 zzso binding partners have been found that are involved in cell cycle regulation, zzso stress responses, cell metabolism and zzso zzso A zzso interaction has been reported to occur between zzso and a zzso domain within zzso S zzso a bacterial zzso toxin from zzso zzso In this study, we have investigated the effect of zzso acid zzso in this zzso domain of zzso on zzso activity and the zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso of zzso is the most critical zzso for zzso zzso activity, as zzso analysis reveals that substitution of this zzso significantly zzso the ability of zzso to mediate cell zzso zzso is also required for the ability of zzso to modify the zzso zzso target zzso Finally, single zzso acid zzso of positions zzso reduce the interaction potential of zzso with zzso in zzso
