zzso of G zzso receptors from the cell surface is a commonly observed phenomenon following zzso This process is now believed to be important for zzso zzso as well as for signal zzso Over the years, numerous studies have aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso such as the G zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso which were initially characterized as desensitizing zzso have been shown to be important regulators of the zzso zzso Recently, numerous interacting partners have been identified for each of these two classes of zzso However, the details regarding the sequence of these interactions and the zzso between signaling pathways containing the different protein complexes are just beginning to be zzso In this review, we zzso these findings and discuss the role of zzso and zzso two families of key regulatory proteins that regulate G zzso zzso zzso
