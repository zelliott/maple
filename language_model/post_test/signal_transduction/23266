The zzso signaling zzso represents a central and critical signaling system involved in plant response to zzso stress and hormone zzso In this study, we focused on zzso zzso which have been shown to be required for development and salt tolerance in zzso but the zzso regulatory mechanism of zzso gene and whether it plays a role in zzso signaling is still zzso Here, we showed that in addition to its expression induced by salt and drought stress, the transcripts of zzso gene were largely accumulated in zzso acid treated zzso compared to zzso level zzso Moreover, promoter sequence analysis revealed that there are some elements involved in stress and hormone response detected in the promoter region of zzso zzso transgenic zzso unraveled that zzso promoter is zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso gene in zzso increased plant tolerance to salt stress, but sensitivity to zzso Our results contribute to the understanding of zzso regulatory mechanism of zzso gene and may also provide a good zzso promoter candidate for transgenic zzso
