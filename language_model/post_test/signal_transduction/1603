In zzso the zzso of zzso by zzso cells is zzso by zzso and inhibited by zzso We have previously shown that zzso abrogates the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to characterize the zzso zzso zzso the action of zzso and to investigate the zzso mechanisms involved in the zzso effect of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were detected by zzso and zzso by in zzso zzso zzso in the intermediate lobe of the zzso Various zzso zzso inhibited in a zzso manner the spontaneous zzso of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso with the following order of potency zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso on zzso release was inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso but not by zzso and zzso These data indicate that the zzso effect of zzso on spontaneous zzso release is zzso zzso through zzso zzso whereas the suppression of zzso zzso zzso by zzso probably involves zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso toxin zzso 1 zzso 12 zzso did not abolish the zzso effect of zzso on zzso formation and spontaneous zzso release, but restored the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso indicating that the zzso zzso zzso is not involved in the action of zzso on zzso zzso zzso In the majority of zzso cells, zzso zzso a sustained and zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso of cultured cells with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed the plateau phase of the zzso response induced by zzso However, although zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not, showing zzso between the zzso zzso concentration increase and the zzso zzso zzso these data indicate that in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso spontaneous zzso release and zzso formation through zzso of a zzso zzso coupled to zzso insensitive G zzso whereas zzso suppresses the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso through a zzso zzso coupled to a zzso G zzso zzso
