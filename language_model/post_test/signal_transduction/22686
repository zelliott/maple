We had previously reported a decrease in zzso zzso dense zzso zzso in blood samples from male adolescents with and without Conduct Disorder zzso In an zzso sample, we have now employed zzso modeling to examine the simultaneous effects of CD and regular monthly alcohol and marijuana use on both the dense zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

Blood samples were obtained from adolescents with and without a CD zzso zzso dense zzso zzso and zzso responses to a variety of zzso were examined in the zzso 

zzso zzso interactions of CD status with regular marijuana use were found for responses to zzso zzso alone, and zzso plus zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso from youth with CD, but without regular marijuana use differed from other zzso zzso main effects of marijuana use alone on zzso responses to zzso acid and zzso plus zzso zzso of zzso were zzso No effects of alcohol use were zzso 

The results demonstrate an interaction between CD and the effects of chronic marijuana use for several zzso in this zzso model system, and further support the possibility of a variation in signal zzso mechanisms in zzso
