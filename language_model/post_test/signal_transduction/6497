The editing of B cell zzso zzso zzso through successive zzso of zzso genes has been considered to be a major mechanism for the central B cell zzso which zzso appearance of zzso B cells, through studies using zzso zzso mouse zzso However, contribution of the zzso editing in the development of the normal B cell repertoire remains zzso In addition, the signaling zzso directing this event is zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso editing in zzso zzso zzso mice is impaired in the absence of an zzso protein zzso zzso that is involved in zzso zzso zzso the supposed hallmarks of zzso editing such as zzso chain zzso zzso sequence zzso at zzso zzso and presence of zzso zzso joins in the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso sequence zzso were all diminished in zzso mice with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso in zzso was also impaired in zzso B zzso Furthermore, the zzso mice showed an excessive zzso response to a DNA carrier zzso suggesting the presence of zzso zzso B cells in the zzso These results not only define a signaling zzso required for zzso editing but indicate that the zzso zzso editing indeed operates in the development of normal B cell repertoire and contributes to establishing the B cell zzso
