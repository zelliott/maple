We have shown in a previous study that zzso zzso zzso zzso increases cell survival and proliferation in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This is highly interesting since inflammatory conditions of the zzso are associated with an increased risk of developing colon zzso The zzso zzso 2 zzso is important in this context since it is zzso in colon cancer zzso and in zzso cell zzso Treatment with the zzso inhibitor N zzso zzso has been shown previously to cause zzso in zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we attempted to zzso the underlying mechanisms and we can now show that a zzso zzso is zzso zzso of zzso causes release of zzso zzso as shown by both zzso and zzso studies, and as with zzso this is significantly decreased by zzso Since previous studies showed increased zzso levels on zzso zzso we further studied zzso regulation at the zzso zzso From this we could exclude the involvement of the zzso protein zzso as well as its zzso counterpart zzso since they are not zzso Furthermore, the activity of the zzso protein Bad zzso causing cell zzso was completely zzso However, zzso of zzso caused zzso of zzso 8 into a 41 zzso zzso associated with zzso and caused the appearance of an activated 15 zzso zzso of zzso This indicates that N zzso zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso of zzso 8, via generation of truncated Bid, and thereafter release of zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso not only reverses the effects induced by zzso of zzso but also reduces the zzso potential by lowering the zzso level of zzso 8 zzso and truncated Bid zzso
