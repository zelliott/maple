zzso II is a potent growth factor for vascular smooth muscle cells and shares many signal zzso mechanisms with zzso including stimulation of zzso protein zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso involves both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To investigate the role of zzso in zzso zzso events, we studied the expression of a zzso regulated zzso zzso which has selective activity toward zzso zzso zzso II rapidly induced zzso zzso (30 zzso zzso in a zzso manner zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor, zzso hydrogen zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso also induced zzso but to levels lower than zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso II was partially inhibited after zzso protein zzso C but was fully inhibited after zzso zzso zzso Treatment with both zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso zzso to levels seen with zzso II, indicating that zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso can act zzso to induce zzso zzso II zzso zzso protein synthesis after 1 h as measured by zzso of zzso from zzso cells using zzso zzso These results establish zzso as a zzso zzso immediate early gene in vascular smooth muscle cells and suggest a role for zzso in regulating zzso zzso events zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso
