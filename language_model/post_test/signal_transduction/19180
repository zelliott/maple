The size of skeletal muscle cells is precisely regulated by zzso signaling networks that determine the balance between overall rates of protein synthesis and zzso zzso growth and protein synthesis are zzso by the zzso target of zzso zzso zzso In this study, we show that the zzso factor zzso is also a major zzso of whether adult muscles grow or zzso We found that in zzso zzso zzso is excluded from the nucleus and that decreasing zzso expression by zzso interference in adult muscles causes zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso without affecting satellite cell proliferation and zzso protein synthesis independently of the zzso zzso When zzso is zzso into zzso muscles, fiber zzso is zzso zzso blocks zzso binding to zzso and zzso promoters and thus reduces protein zzso zzso zzso is important not only in dividing populations but also in adult muscle, where it is required for the maintenance of muscle size and can induce rapid zzso and block zzso
