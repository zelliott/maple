Various zzso such as zzso enhance newborn cell survival in the zzso zone and their migration zzso in chains toward the zzso zzso The present study assessed the fate of newborn zzso from zzso zone to zzso bulb under conditions of chronic cerebral zzso and examined the role of zzso element binding protein signaling on the survival of these zzso by using zzso a potent inhibitor of type III zzso zzso underwent bilateral common carotid artery zzso They were divided into zzso zzso zzso zzso and type III zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso section for zzso and a series of zzso and zzso markers were analyzed at days 7, 14, 21 and 28 after zzso The reduction of zzso bulb size gradually progressed in the vehicle group zzso but not in the zzso and type III zzso zzso zzso The zzso zone of the zzso rats contained significantly larger numbers of newborn zzso after zzso compared with zzso rats zzso but significantly lower numbers in the zzso migratory stream and zzso bulb zzso Treatment of rats with type III zzso inhibitor increased the number of zzso and enhanced the survival and differentiation of cells zzso zzso zzso element binding protein within zzso was markedly decreased in the zzso zone, zzso migratory zzso and zzso bulb of zzso rats zzso but treatment with type III zzso inhibitor resulted in recovery of this expression throughout zzso leading to enhanced zzso zzso These effects were zzso by protein zzso A and C zzso Our results indicated that zzso element binding protein signaling is a key zzso of zzso after prolonged zzso and provide the basis for new zzso therapies for zzso brain zzso
