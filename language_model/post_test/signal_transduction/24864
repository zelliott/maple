zzso oxide zzso has diverse roles in zzso communication and (at higher zzso in zzso cell zzso NO zzso with many cellular targets, with zzso effects correlated to zzso of key zzso through zzso of their zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso dependent on the zzso state of its zzso zzso zzso centers, is also activated in zzso coli on exposure to zzso zzso We show here that zzso zzso by NO occurs through direct modification of the zzso centers to form zzso zzso zzso which we have observed both in intact bacterial cells and in zzso zzso after NO zzso zzso zzso through zzso of zzso centers contrasts with the zzso typically caused by this zzso zzso zzso zzso has zzso activity similar to that of oxidized zzso and is relatively zzso In contrast, zzso zzso is short-lived in intact cells, indicative of mechanisms that actively dispose of zzso zzso zzso
