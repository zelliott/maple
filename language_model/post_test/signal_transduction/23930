Previous studies have observed that zzso zzso concentration is elevated in zzso and contributes to impaired cerebral zzso following fluid percussion brain injury zzso in an zzso zzso This study was designed to characterize the effects of zzso on the vascular activity of two zzso of a zzso zzso G zzso zzso and zzso as a function of age and the role of zzso in such effects in newborn zzso days old) and juvenile zzso weeks old) pigs equipped with a closed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso artery zzso that was blunted more by zzso in newborn versus juvenile pigs (9 zzso 1 and 16 zzso 1 zzso 3 zzso 1 and 5 zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso 1 and 15 zzso 1 zzso 6 zzso 1 and 9 zzso zzso zzso Similar results were observed for zzso but the inactive analogue zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso partially restored impaired zzso zzso after zzso in the newborn but not in the juvenile (3 zzso 1 and 5 zzso 1 zzso 7 zzso 1 and 11 zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso 1 and 9 zzso 1 zzso 6 zzso 1 and 10 zzso zzso zzso These data show that G protein zzso elicits zzso that is blunted following zzso in an zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso contributes to the impairment of G zzso zzso in an zzso manner after zzso
