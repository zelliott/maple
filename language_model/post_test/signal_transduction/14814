zzso zzso binding protein zzso I zzso targets protein zzso zzso to specific zzso zzso exerting critical control over zzso zzso zzso synaptic zzso zzso synaptic zzso which promotes synaptic depression upon long-term depression zzso zzso serves to prevent synaptic depression under zzso zzso The present studies investigate this opposite regulation of zzso trafficking during zzso synaptic transmission and zzso by expressing zzso or zzso zzso which is defective in zzso zzso in zzso slice or zzso zzso We find that expression of the zzso zzso to interfere with zzso targeting dramatically reduces zzso synaptic transmission, which is correlated with the reduction in surface expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrates that the zzso zzso selectively increases the zzso of zzso at zzso consensus zzso site, zzso zzso which is known to favor zzso interaction with zzso zzso density zzso zzso zzso 1) protein zzso zzso interacting with C zzso zzso of zzso activity or zzso interaction completely reverses the synaptic depression in zzso expressing the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso synaptic zzso zzso the zzso transmission by zzso controlling zzso zzso of zzso and the subsequent zzso decrease in zzso zzso surface zzso zzso from zzso transmission, blocking zzso interaction or zzso activity produces minimal effects on zzso in zzso zzso Instead, zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso at both zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso 880 zzso zzso Our studies thus zzso that zzso zzso in response to distinct synaptic activities, regulates the synaptic trafficking of specific zzso zzso
