Exposure to stress levels of zzso produces zzso responses that are characteristic of type 2 diabetes, such as peripheral insulin resistance and impairment in zzso trafficking of zzso zzso 4 zzso in muscle and zzso In the central nervous system, stress produces zzso and zzso changes in the zzso that are associated with cognitive zzso 

In view of these zzso the current studies examined the effects of short-term (1 week) exposure of stress levels of zzso upon insulin zzso zzso expression and zzso including zzso zzso in the rat zzso 

One week of zzso zzso treatment produced insulin resistance in response to peripheral zzso zzso In the zzso zzso expression was unchanged in zzso rats as compared with zzso zzso However, zzso zzso of the zzso total zzso levels and total zzso levels were reduced in zzso rats when compared to zzso In addition, zzso zzso of zzso zzso to the plasma membrane was completely abolished in zzso zzso 

These results demonstrate that in addition to zzso peripheral insulin resistance, short-term zzso administration zzso insulin signaling in the rat zzso effects that may contribute to the deleterious consequences of zzso states observed in type 2 zzso
