Although the zzso function of type II major zzso complex zzso is presentation of zzso peptides to T zzso these molecules can also zzso signals leading alternatively to cell zzso or zzso zzso zzso is a zzso of two zzso zzso each containing a short zzso tail that is zzso for zzso of death zzso This suggests the function of an undefined zzso zzso in signaling the death zzso Here we describe a novel plasma membrane zzso zzso that is associated with zzso and mediates its zzso of death zzso zzso is unusual among zzso in containing an extended zzso zzso tail zzso 140 zzso zzso with multiple embedded signaling zzso zzso is zzso zzso upon zzso zzso and associates with zzso zzso and zzso zzso Finally, zzso class zzso cell death signaling requires zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso
