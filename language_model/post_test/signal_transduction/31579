An increase in zzso has been suggested to contribute to the enhanced insulin sensitivity observed in the presence of zzso zzso To investigate a potential zzso zzso effect on an insulin target zzso the effect of zzso on zzso zzso and insulin signaling was studied in primary rat zzso Whereas zzso zzso zzso was not altered, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which was blocked by zzso a zzso B2 zzso zzso The zzso effect on zzso zzso was zzso oxide zzso dependent, zzso by NO donors and absent in zzso from zzso NO zzso zzso Investigation of insulin signaling revealed that zzso enhanced insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were decreased in the presence of zzso accompanied by decreased zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso did not enhance insulin action in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso or in zzso from zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso enhances insulin sensitivity in zzso via an zzso zzso that acts by modulating the feedback zzso of insulin signaling at the level of zzso
