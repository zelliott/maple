Animals and humans respond to zzso with a complex neuroendocrine response that ultimately leads to an increase in zzso a sparing of lean body mass zzso and burning of fat, and an overall decrease in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso is a pathological state of zzso associated with many infections and chronic diseases, wherein appetite is diminished zzso with an increase in zzso rate, and a relative wasting of zzso In previous studies, we demonstrated that anorexia and weight loss in mouse zzso models induced by zzso zzso administration and by tumor growth are ameliorated by central zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the results seen with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso knockout zzso mice show zzso anorexia and weight loss with zzso administration and with zzso administration, and they have similar decreases in zzso Both zzso and zzso have an intact zzso response and fever with zzso zzso In tumor models, we show that zzso mice resist the loss of zzso brought about by tumor growth, whereas zzso animals show enhanced tissue zzso These data underscore the importance of central zzso signaling in weight zzso and demonstrate differential effects of zzso and zzso blockade on the development of zzso
