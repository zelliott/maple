The study was designed to zzso the influence of the protein zzso A zzso signal zzso zzso on zzso of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is one of the key zzso involved in steroid hormone zzso and zzso with mediation of the zzso pathway, increases its zzso However, the mode of regulation of zzso gene expression by zzso remains zzso It was found that stimulation of the zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso caused a twofold increase in zzso transcript accompanied by appreciable rise in the protein product of the gene and cortisol zzso zzso zzso II inhibitor zzso and protein synthesis inhibitor attenuated this zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso increased zzso activity of zzso promoter A in cells zzso with the zzso reporter zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso increased zzso promoter activity, while transient zzso of zzso expression with specific zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso via the zzso zzso stimulates expression of zzso which activates zzso of zzso presumably by interaction with putative binding sequences within promoter zzso A novel mechanism contributing to the long-term effect of zzso on adrenal zzso is zzso zzso stimulates zzso of zzso which interacts with the putative zzso sequences within the promoter and activates zzso zzso An increased level of zzso results in an enhanced supply of cholesterol required for steroid hormone zzso
