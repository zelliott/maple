zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso switch zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of the zzso signal zzso pathway, and zzso cannot reactivate from zzso in cells zzso for the zzso target protein zzso Here we show that zzso promotes DNA binding of zzso a mechanism that is fundamentally different from that established for the zzso zzso zzso zzso domain zzso and zzso virus zzso Although zzso active zzso and zzso do not zzso zzso promoters zzso zzso of an zzso zzso lacking its zzso domain robustly restores zzso zzso Cooperation requires intact DNA binding sites for zzso and zzso and zzso complex formation between the three molecules in zzso In infected cells, zzso is virtually zzso on a series of viral and cellular promoters during zzso zzso but is significantly enriched following zzso expression during viral zzso zzso zzso but not zzso and zzso zzso the complete viral zzso zzso
