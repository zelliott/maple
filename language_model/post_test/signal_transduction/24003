zzso root zzso has long been considered to be regulated by differential distribution of the plant hormone zzso However, the cells establishing these zzso and the transport mechanisms involved, remain to be zzso Here, we describe a zzso zzso zzso to monitor zzso during zzso root zzso at cellular zzso We identify elevated zzso levels at the root zzso in zzso cells, the site of gravity perception, and an zzso zzso flux from these cells to the lateral root cap zzso and toward the zzso zone after zzso We differentiate between an zzso lateral zzso transport from zzso to zzso cells, and an zzso and zzso zzso transport from the zzso to the zzso zzso We further demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso develop even in the presence of an zzso source of zzso zzso zzso imaging provides unprecedented insights into zzso zzso flux at cellular resolution, and strongly suggests that this flux is a prerequisite for root zzso
