zzso is known to have various effects outside the frame of the immune system and it could have a role as an zzso zzso agent in certain cardiac zzso associated to inflammatory cell zzso of the zzso In this study, by means of binding zzso on cardiac zzso or by evaluating zzso and zzso levels of isolated rat zzso in the presence of zzso we demonstrate that zzso may indirectly stimulate zzso function by triggering the zzso release of zzso zzso on isolated rat zzso Thus it zzso with cardiac tissue inducing a positive zzso response that can be blocked by the zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is not affected by zzso Furthermore, chemical zzso with zzso zzso prevents the zzso effect of zzso while cocaine treatment zzso zzso to zzso indicating that zzso zzso is required, and that the zzso effect of zzso is zzso In addition, zzso mimics zzso stimulation increasing zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso stimulation as well as positive zzso and both effects of zzso were additive with zzso However, zzso synthesis could only be partially blocked by zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso synthesis both by a zzso zzso independent mechanism and by a zzso dependent zzso We conclude that zzso zzso a positive zzso response in isolated rat zzso through two different zzso an indirect zzso of zzso zzso receptors by releasing catecholamines and a direct action by increasing the production of the second zzso zzso
