zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is involved in the regulation of cell growth and cellular zzso The zzso of zzso in response to diverse zzso stimuli is zzso by multiple zzso coordinated by the zzso and zzso signaling zzso We have recently found that both forms of zzso are modified by zzso Following these findings, we demonstrate here for the first time that zzso associates specifically with zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso The interaction was initially identified in the zzso zzso screening and further confirmed by pull-down and zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso leads to an increase in zzso zzso zzso with this zzso we showed that the zzso level of zzso is regulated by zzso since zzso of zzso by specific zzso promotes stabilization of zzso zzso The results suggest the involvement of zzso in zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso
