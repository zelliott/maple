zzso is highly expressed in the zzso nervous zzso Our previous study showed that addition of zzso zzso to cultured zzso root zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso In this study, we identified a novel signaling zzso zzso this zzso Treatment with zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso outgrowth of zzso zzso in terms of total zzso zzso longest zzso zzso and total zzso branching zzso To zzso the possible signal zzso zzso involved, zzso of zzso was evaluated by Western zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso A zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced after 15 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso inhibitor zzso or an zzso zzso zzso significantly decreased the zzso outgrowth response triggered by zzso zzso indicating the involvement of both zzso In addition, zzso zzso treatment also induced transient zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and this effect was also blocked by a zzso or zzso Furthermore, the fact that zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso acts upstream of the zzso zzso In zzso the zzso zzso is a new zzso involved in the zzso zzso effect of zzso zzso
