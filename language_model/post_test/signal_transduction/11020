zzso signaling systems, in which a zzso zzso is used to control the zzso level of a response regulator, are commonly used in bacteria to sense their zzso In the zzso system of zzso coli, the zzso and thus the zzso are clustered on the inner cell zzso The zzso of this system also is recruited to zzso zzso but the reason for this association is not zzso By using zzso imaging of single cells, we show that in zzso the zzso activity is substantially larger at the zzso indicating that the signaling source (the zzso and the signaling sink (the zzso tend to be located at the same place in the zzso When this association is zzso a zzso in the concentration of the zzso response regulator appears, and the zzso response is zzso Such zzso is inevitable in systems in which the activity of the zzso and the zzso are produced by the same zzso zzso this design enables a more rapid and zzso uniform zzso
