To characterize the zzso of zzso zzso components by retinal zzso zzso cells and to determine which receptors and signal zzso pathways are zzso 

Fluorescent latex beads were coated with zzso zzso collagen type I or IV, or zzso and incubated with human retinal zzso zzso cells for 3 zzso zzso was zzso by flow zzso The effects of zzso blocking zzso to cell surface receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of specific zzso signaling pathways zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso and zzso protein zzso were determined using zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso beads was greater than zzso of beads coated with collagen type I, collagen type IV, or zzso or zzso controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso markedly inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso effects of zzso zzso were stronger in the initial stages zzso than in the later stages zzso of zzso There was no significant effect on zzso when zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso was decreased by zzso of zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso 5 zzso P zzso zzso but these zzso did not affect the zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso C zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso beads zzso zzso zzso 

zzso retinal zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso over other zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso is zzso in part through zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso and is modulated by zzso zzso of zzso zzso by retinal zzso zzso cells may represent a novel mechanism for zzso of the provisional zzso zzso during outer retinal wound zzso
