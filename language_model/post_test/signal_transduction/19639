Using transgenic mouse models of breast cancer that zzso zzso zzso and collagen A zzso expression or zzso zzso zzso we previously showed that this zzso is critical for zzso tumor onset and zzso We now provide the first evidence that zzso regulates zzso zzso in part, through its ability to regulate the zzso immune zzso zzso of zzso signaling within tumor cells results in extensive zzso zzso zzso and induction of a zzso immune response in zzso zzso This is associated with a robust zzso response in zzso zzso that are deficient in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso tumor progression of zzso zzso is accelerated in a T zzso zzso We also uncover a clinically relevant correlation between high zzso expression and low zzso zzso in human breast zzso Finally, we define a novel zzso immune signature that functions as an independent zzso marker of survival in human zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso breast zzso We reveal a novel role for tumor zzso zzso in the establishment and maintenance of an zzso zzso
