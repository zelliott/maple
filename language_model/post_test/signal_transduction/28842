Members of the zzso protein family play crucial roles in the maintenance of tissue zzso by regulating zzso in response to zzso cues or zzso zzso zzso zzso members of the zzso family are essential for initiation of cell death, and they function by zzso the zzso zzso family members zzso and/or zzso either directly or indirectly through binding to zzso zzso family zzso zzso and zzso then elicit the downstream events in zzso zzso zzso have at least eight zzso proteins and they are activated in a zzso as well as a cell zzso zzso We have generated mice lacking the zzso protein zzso factor zzso to investigate its role in cell death zzso Our studies reveal that zzso is zzso for embryonic development and certain forms of zzso zzso including loss of cell attachment zzso or zzso zzso zzso loss of zzso protected zzso against zzso induced by zzso or zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso mice develop a B zzso zzso caused by the abnormal resistance of these cells to a range of zzso zzso Finally, zzso accelerated the development of gamma zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso plays a critical role in zzso signaling and can function as a tumor zzso
