zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso growth of zzso breast cancer, is used to treat such zzso Development of resistance to zzso however, is zzso We investigated whether zzso growth zzso zzso which activates cell survival signals, interferes with the zzso action of zzso 

zzso and zzso human breast cancer models were used to assess cell zzso colony formation in soft zzso and cell cycle zzso Throughout, we used zzso at a dose of 10 zzso and zzso at a dose of 40 zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

zzso inhibited the growth of zzso cells, which zzso zzso receptors and express zzso receptors zzso only when zzso signaling was zzso For example, in zzso fetal bovine serum zzso zzso reduced cell proliferation by zzso zzso zzso however, in zzso zzso or zzso zzso had no effect on zzso In zzso cells, which zzso zzso zzso but express few zzso zzso reduced proliferation by zzso zzso zzso regardless of zzso zzso When zzso cells were genetically altered to zzso zzso and cultured with zzso zzso had no effect on zzso However, the addition of zzso zzso which decreased zzso zzso restored zzso growth zzso 

In breast cancer cell models that zzso zzso an increased level of zzso signaling appears to interfere with the action of zzso Thus, strategies that target zzso signaling may prevent or delay development of resistance to zzso
