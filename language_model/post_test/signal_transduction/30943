We have recently shown that zzso zzso cell growth when the vast majority of zzso receptors zzso are excluded from zzso zzso zzso the zzso counterpart of zzso zzso but has a strong zzso effect when the receptors are targeted to these plasma membrane zzso upon fusion with zzso a resident raft zzso The aim of this study was to investigate whether the manipulation of total cell cholesterol can influence zzso zzso and zzso Our data indicate that cholesterol depletion in zzso cells does not affect the signaling events zzso by the zzso located outside zzso When treated with 2 zzso zzso zzso the receptors remained outside and continued to inhibit cell zzso On the contrary, the zzso treatment of cells expressing receptors fused to zzso led to their zzso outside zzso and converted the zzso zzso effect into cell growth zzso These data indicate that 1) once released from zzso the receptors fused to zzso signal exactly as zzso zzso and 2) their zzso location is responsible for the specific zzso signaling leading to cell zzso Finally, we evaluated whether cholesterol loading could force the zzso into zzso zzso and change their zzso but, after cell treatment with an zzso complex, zzso stimulation continued to lead to cell growth zzso thus indicating that increasing cell cholesterol levels is not sufficient per zzso to affect zzso zzso
