Internal zzso zzso robust zzso living zzso The smallest details of living systems are molecular devices that realize zzso quantum zzso These smaller devices form larger devices zzso zzso up to living zzso The quantum device possesses its own potential internal quantum state zzso which is maintained for a prolonged time via reflective zzso zzso zzso can exhibit itself by a creative generation of iteration limits in the real zzso It resembles the properties of a zzso which interacts with the zzso applying zzso commands to zzso In this zzso zzso are molecular zzso of the zzso quantum computer, the set of which maintains highly ordered robust coherent state, and zzso represents a zzso of zzso codes into a single reflective zzso The biological evolution can be viewed as a functional evolution of measurement constraints in which limits of iteration are established, possessing criteria of perfection and having selective zzso
