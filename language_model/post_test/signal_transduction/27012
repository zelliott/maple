Low density zzso zzso and high density zzso zzso from serum stimulate zzso pathways and zzso in rat zzso type II zzso Both LDL and HDL zzso primary cultures of type II cells to zzso zzso zzso the major zzso component of pulmonary zzso The effects on zzso were preceded temporally by stimulation of zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso and zzso of protein zzso C from zzso to membrane zzso zzso which blocks the binding of zzso to the LDL zzso completely inhibited the effects of LDL on signal zzso and zzso zzso but did not inhibit the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso the size of native LDL had no effect on type II zzso however, zzso complexes containing either zzso E or zzso zzso both signal zzso and zzso zzso LDL receptors were present in type II cell zzso by zzso In contrast to findings with zzso zzso type II cells exhibited two major bands of 130 zzso and 120 zzso and a minor band at 230 zzso that also was present under reducing zzso These results are consistent with our hypothesis that the zzso zzso functions in zzso to deliver cholesterol to type II cells and that this process is coupled to zzso assembly and zzso via zzso zzso HDL elicits similar responses independent of the LDL zzso suggesting that type II cells may use the selective zzso zzso to obtain cholesterol or that HDL triggers signal zzso by mechanisms unrelated to zzso zzso
