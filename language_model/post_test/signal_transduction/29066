zzso regulates zzso differentiation and activity and exerts different overall skeletal effects in zzso depending on the schedule and dose of zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso and protein levels of zzso zzso zzso were strongly zzso by human zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso was zzso zzso at 4 zzso concentration dependent, and blocked by zzso D but not zzso The stimulation was zzso by zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso analog zzso zzso zzso and inhibited completely by the protein zzso A zzso zzso and partially by zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso Increased zzso expression was not maintained during persistent (24 zzso zzso zzso zzso primary zzso zzso from zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso mice achieved zzso greater zzso zzso formation in comparison with wild type zzso zzso This effect was blocked by restoration of zzso expression via zzso gene zzso zzso administration of zzso (10 zzso for 4 h every 48 zzso for 3-6 zzso increased zzso up to zzso over zzso levels in both zzso and zzso zzso mouse zzso cell zzso Whereas the zzso zzso analog zzso 100 zzso equivalent to 10 zzso zzso did not stimulate zzso in zzso cultures, it was twice as effective as zzso in zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso regulates zzso differentiation in zzso and zzso the zzso stimulation of differentiation by intermittent zzso We conclude also that zzso zzso signaling pathways independent of zzso restrain zzso zzso an effect normally obscured in the presence of zzso but revealed in its zzso
