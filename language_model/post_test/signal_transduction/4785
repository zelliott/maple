zzso is the most abundant zzso in zzso zzso zzso which has been prescribed as a medicinal herb for treating fever in China for a long zzso 

The present study aimed at evaluating the zzso effect of zzso and revealing the related zzso 

zzso zzso fever in rats was used to assess the zzso effect of zzso After an zzso injection of zzso zzso body temperature was tested every zzso up to zzso Different doses of zzso zzso 50, zzso were zzso administered zzso before zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were treated with various zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso including zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso oxide zzso were examined on both zzso and expression zzso Furthermore, the influences of the zzso of nuclear zzso B zzso and the zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso by zzso were zzso by western zzso 

The zzso administration of zzso at test doses clearly demonstrated apparent zzso effect through the declines in body temperature elevated by zzso in zzso The in zzso data showed that zzso inhibited the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso moreover, the zzso analysis and the western zzso analysis indicated that zzso regulated the zzso level via suppression of zzso zzso and blockade of zzso signal zzso 

In zzso the zzso property of zzso might result, at least in part, from an zzso of zzso zzso production and zzso Taken in this sense, our findings provide an explanation for zzso acting as an important constituent in zzso thus, provide scientific basis for the wide use of zzso zzso in China as a traditional zzso
