In Northern America zzso zzso zzso zzso fruits are used for more than zzso years for treatment of skin disorders, burns and as wound dressing to absorb the zzso 

The following studies attempted to characterize zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso extracts and to investigate the influence of the zzso on cell physiology of human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso raw zzso zzso were isolated from zzso zzso fruits and zzso by zzso exchange zzso zzso and size exclusion zzso zzso zzso obtained were characterized concerning zzso composition by zzso The zzso of the zzso was investigated on cell zzso zzso differentiation and gene expression zzso of zzso 

zzso was zzso into 5 zzso zzso zzso The zzso were composed mainly of zzso (more than 50% in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with differing amounts concerning to zzso and zzso zzso were detected in the zzso zzso and to a less extend in zzso zzso zzso significantly increased the proliferation of zzso whereas zzso was shown to be a potent zzso of the early differentiation process of zzso Gene expression analysis supported these results since zzso and zzso known to be part of signal pathways leading to cell zzso were significantly up zzso zzso on zzso were not observed, indicating cell specific activity of the zzso 

The results clearly indicate a rationale for the traditional use of zzso zzso fruits extracts for wound healing to the strong zzso activity of the zzso on zzso proliferation and early zzso major activities necessary for potent zzso zzso
