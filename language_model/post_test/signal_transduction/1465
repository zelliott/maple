By use of a specifically zzso zzso chemical, zzso zzso we studied the zzso of zzso zzso target zzso for zzso of a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso The chemical, which reacted with zzso proteins on the cell surface for zzso zzso induced zzso and zzso of zzso zzso When zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were exposed to zzso neither the molecular status nor the activity of the zzso was affected, suggesting that the target zzso of zzso to which cells were exposed for reaction are located in the zzso region of the zzso domain of zzso zzso Despite this result, the exposure of a zzso form of zzso or zzso zzso isolated by zzso to zzso did induce zzso of the zzso These results suggest that zzso in both the zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso can work as target sites of accessible zzso and possibly other zzso elements for structural modification and zzso of zzso zzso
