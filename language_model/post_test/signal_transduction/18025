zzso injury elicits a zzso sustained zzso state in patients characterized by accelerated zzso zzso acid metabolism and negative nitrogen zzso The transport of zzso a key zzso in zzso and zzso was examined in zzso isolated from the zzso of rats after a zzso total burn surface area zzso zzso zzso A zzso and profound two- to zzso increase in zzso zzso system N activity was first observed after 48 h in zzso from injured rats compared with controls, persisted for 9 days, and waned toward control values after 18 days, corresponding with zzso Further studies showed that the profound increase was fully attributable to rapid zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso cell swelling and that this form of regulation may be zzso in part by zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso each significantly attenuated zzso stimulation by zzso zzso The data suggest that zzso system N zzso by zzso acids may play an important role in fueling accelerated zzso nitrogen metabolism after burn zzso
