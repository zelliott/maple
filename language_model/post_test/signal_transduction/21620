zzso of beneficial zzso interactions in the zzso can result in the promotion of plant health and have significant implications for low input sustainable agriculture applications such as zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso and zzso such as zzso have been developed as commercial zzso zzso Registration of microbial zzso as zzso agents in either the European Union or the United States requires production of extensive dossiers covering zzso safety and risk zzso Despite the fact that a number of zzso zzso products have been marketed there are still some limitations zzso the development of this technology for widespread use in zzso Although many strains show good performance in specific trials, this is often not translated into consistent, effective zzso in diverse field zzso Advances in zzso technology and the publication of complete zzso sequences of a number of zzso bacterial zzso has facilitated investigations into the molecular basis underpinning the establishment of beneficial zzso interactions in the zzso The understanding of these molecular zzso processes and the functions they regulate is fundamental to promoting beneficial zzso zzso to overcome existing limitations and to designing improved strategies for the development of novel zzso zzso zzso zzso
