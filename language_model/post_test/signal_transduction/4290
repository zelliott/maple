zzso rhythms in zzso are zzso to the environmental light cycle by daily adjustments in the phase of the zzso zzso located in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso exposure of zzso maintained under constant darkness to ambient light during zzso nighttime produces both phase shifts of the zzso activity rhythm and characteristic patterns of zzso protein zzso zzso in the zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso phase shifts of the zzso activity rhythm are blocked by zzso zzso injection of the competitive zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not by the inactive zzso zzso The effects of zzso are zzso and zzso and are countered by zzso of zzso the natural zzso for zzso While effects on behavioral rhythms are zzso similar treatment does not alter the pattern of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso These results suggest that zzso oxide is a component of the signal zzso zzso that communicates zzso information to the zzso zzso zzso and that zzso oxide production is either independent of, or downstream from, pathways involved in induction of zzso zzso
