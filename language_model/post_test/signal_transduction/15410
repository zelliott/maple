zzso derived stem cells zzso differentiate into a zzso cell zzso zzso but the zzso pathways zzso this are zzso We zzso that notch might be involved, given its important role in regulating SC zzso zzso zzso were differentiated using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso for zzso and zzso receptors and the notch responsive zzso zzso were expressed throughout the differentiation process whereas zzso a notch zzso and the zzso gene were markedly zzso In contrast zzso was zzso with differentiation and was strongly expressed by rat primary zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor which blocks notch zzso had no effect on zzso of SC proteins zzso or zzso during zzso Furthermore, when zzso with zzso zzso differentiated zzso cultures treated in the absence or presence of zzso enhanced zzso outgrowth to similar zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso but zzso was only present when zzso with zzso root zzso zzso zzso did not affect the expression of these zzso zzso Thus, zzso express components of the notch zzso zzso but our studies suggest notch is unlikely to play a role in the zzso activity and zzso capability of zzso differentiated into zzso zzso
