The kidney contains a zzso system that appears to regulate systemic blood zzso zzso II zzso zzso has zzso effects on sodium transport in multiple zzso segments via binding to plasma membrane zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso II production is zzso The zzso effect of zzso II on zzso sodium transport is enhanced by zzso nerves, and is associated with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso In the cortical collecting zzso zzso receptors stimulate transport through zzso sodium channels, and in the inner zzso zzso transport is enhanced by zzso II, contributing to increased sodium and water zzso zzso receptors may also be linked to increased expression of certain zzso sodium zzso In contrast to the zzso effects of zzso receptors on sodium zzso zzso receptors expressed in the adult kidney are linked to increased urinary sodium zzso and decreased blood zzso This suggests that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso serves as a protective mechanism to increase sodium zzso and blood pressure when zzso fluid volume is threatened, whereas zzso receptors dampen this zzso The interplay between these two zzso pathways in the kidney could have significant effects on long-term blood pressure zzso
