zzso zzso are zzso zzso associated with many cellular functions including zzso cell cycle, zzso and zzso There is also increasing evidence that these ubiquitous zzso zzso control zzso signaling in zzso Here, we provide evidence that the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso pathways induce expression of zzso a potent zzso and zzso zzso in primary zzso Furthermore, deletion of zzso zzso or type I zzso zzso revealed that the zzso increase in zzso expression is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso induction of the zzso gene was markedly reduced in zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, addition of zzso zzso allowed the recovery of full zzso expression in both zzso and zzso cells zzso with zzso suggesting that zzso zzso produced in an zzso manner contributes to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso we have explored the role of zzso zzso and found that zzso and zzso mainly contribute to zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso is thus responsive to innate immunity signals, and we propose that zzso is an additional host defense weapon of activated zzso
