zzso zzso zzso help to regulate the expression of many zzso which play an important role in the zzso of a number of zzso Here we investigate the effects of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the degree of experimental spinal zzso trauma induced by the application of vascular clips to the zzso via a zzso zzso zzso Spinal zzso injury in mice resulted in severe trauma characterized by zzso zzso zzso production of a range of inflammatory zzso tissue damage, and zzso Treatment of the mice with zzso and zzso significantly reduced the degree of zzso spinal zzso inflammation and tissue injury zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso In a separate set of experiments, zzso and zzso significantly ameliorated the recovery of limb function zzso by motor recovery zzso This study provides an experimental evidence that zzso prevention of the zzso of protein zzso zzso reduces the development of inflammation and tissue injury associated with spinal zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the activity of certain zzso zzso may represent a novel approach for the therapy of spinal zzso zzso
