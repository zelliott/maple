zzso signals lead to the zzso of nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso from the zzso to the zzso This process is regulated by the zzso zzso zzso which can be zzso with zzso to the nucleus to maintain it zzso active for the duration of calcium zzso When the calcium signal zzso zzso is exported to the zzso and different zzso zzso have been reported to oppose zzso activities and regulate the nuclear export of zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso in zzso and interacts in zzso with zzso Furthermore, the zzso of this zzso in zzso cells by zzso with activated zzso and zzso zzso the zzso nuclear zzso of zzso but not that of zzso By contrast, zzso of zzso or zzso pathways failed to modify the nuclear shuttling of zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not the zzso zzso pathway, results in the zzso of zzso zzso In addition, the zzso of the nuclear zzso of zzso by zzso appears to be zzso through the zzso of zzso nuclear export and takes place in a zzso zzso fashion, suggesting the involvement of the zzso zzso in this zzso Thus, the zzso signal zzso zzso appears to play an important role in the regulation of the nuclear shuttling of zzso and in cellular zzso
