zzso and their zzso zzso are zzso zzso found in edible vegetables and zzso They act as antioxidants by scavenging zzso oxygen species and by zzso the zzso metals iron and zzso They also behave as signaling zzso modulating multiple cell zzso pathways and gene zzso including that of zzso zzso This study aimed at determining whether zzso and zzso interact with the zzso metal zinc and at assessing their effect on cellular zinc zzso We found that a zzso zzso extract zzso and the green tea zzso zzso zzso bind zinc zzso in solution with higher affinity than the zzso zzso zzso and zzso prevent zzso toxicity in the human zzso cell line zzso evaluated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso hinder zzso zzso of total zzso measured by atomic flame zzso zzso zzso increasing the level of zzso zzso zinc zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibit the zzso evaluated at the zzso level by quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction, of zzso zzso and of plasma membrane zinc exporter zzso zzso while enhancing the expression of cellular zinc zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso also produce all these effects when zzso cells are zzso to import zinc by treatment with supplemental zinc or the zzso zzso zzso We suggest that zzso zzso of zinc zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zinc may be relevant mechanisms underlying the zzso of diverse cell signaling and zzso pathways by zzso and zzso
