zzso signaling is important in development and in human zzso zzso receptors regulate zzso through direct interactions with several proteins at the promoter regions of target zzso To understand the mechanism of zzso zzso numerous deletion and zzso studies have been carried out to identify functional zzso in zzso but domain definition and their role during the assembly of the zzso active complex remains zzso Recently reported zzso and structural studies of the zzso zzso domain permit us to zzso the existing domain assignments and their predicted functional role, thereby providing further insight into the mechanism of zzso zzso
