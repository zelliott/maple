The Ras family of small zzso regulates cell zzso zzso migration and zzso and zzso transformation by binding to several protein zzso One such zzso zzso plays distinct roles in each of these zzso but to date, identified zzso zzso were shared with other Ras family members zzso zzso We zzso a new database of zzso proteins to identify zzso zzso as a novel zzso zzso zzso binds directly to zzso in a zzso manner, but does not physically associate with the closely related zzso zzso and zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso and the resulting cell spreading and migration, as well as for the ability of zzso to enhance these zzso zzso regulates zzso activity through the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso the requirement for zzso in zzso zzso and cell zzso Thus, we identify a novel zzso zzso zzso which links zzso to zzso zzso zzso through a zzso cascade that mediates cell spreading and zzso
