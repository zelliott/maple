zzso of lean tissue as a consequence of zzso zzso is a serious problem in patients with chronic zzso zzso A possible contributor is zzso by low pH of the System A zzso zzso which carries the zzso acid zzso zzso into muscle zzso The aim of this study was to determine the effect of selective zzso zzso on zzso zzso acid profiles and zzso zzso signaling through zzso target of zzso in zzso skeletal muscle zzso zzso of zzso with the selective competitive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso expression with small interfering zzso all depleted zzso zzso zzso zzso also indirectly depleted other zzso acids whose zzso zzso are maintained by the zzso zzso across the plasma zzso notably the anabolic zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly impaired signaling through zzso target of zzso to zzso protein zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso leading to impairment of protein synthesis comparable with that induced by zzso It is concluded that even though zzso is only one of several zzso zzso in muscle, it may determine zzso anabolic zzso acid levels, regulating the zzso acid signaling that affects protein mass, zzso acid zzso and cell zzso
