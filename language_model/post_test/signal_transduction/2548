zzso of zzso growth factor to zzso cells results in dramatic changes in cell zzso zzso the cells form membrane zzso accompanied by increased zzso zzso followed by cell zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso by binding zzso growth factor leads also to zzso and zzso of zzso zzso 1, a key zzso in the zzso zzso In this study we have investigated the zzso of zzso zzso 1 during cell zzso by zzso growth zzso It is shown that addition of the growth factor to zzso cells leads to a zzso of zzso zzso 1 from the zzso to the membrane zzso Interestingly, this relocation is exclusively directed to the membrane zzso Most of the zzso zzso 1 associates to the membrane and a small fraction to the underlying zzso zzso studies demonstrated that zzso zzso 1 zzso with the zzso growth factor zzso and also zzso zzso at the membrane zzso Moreover, using zzso zzso we found that the membrane zzso are significantly enriched in zzso zzso Between 5 and 10 minutes after stimulation the membrane zzso disappear and also the zzso of zzso zzso 1 with the zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso These results support the notion that zzso of zzso cells by zzso growth factor leads to the formation of a zzso complex of its zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso which is primarily localized at membrane zzso
