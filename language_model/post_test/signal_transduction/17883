The zzso wing disc is divided along the zzso axis into regions giving rise to the body wall zzso wing hinge zzso and wing blade zzso We applied DNA zzso analysis to discover genes with potential roles in the development of these zzso We identified a set of 94 transcripts enriched zzso fold or zzso in the body wall and 56 transcripts enriched in the zzso zzso zzso that are known to have highly restricted expression patterns, such as zzso twist and zzso zzso wall) and zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed strong differential expression on the zzso In zzso zzso for 50 previously zzso genes similarly revealed that transcript enrichment identified by the array analysis was consistent with the observed spatial zzso There was a broad spectrum of patterns, in some cases suggesting that the genes could be targets of known signaling zzso We show that three of these genes respond to wingless zzso We also discovered genes likely to play specific roles in zzso and zzso cell types, as these cells are part of the body wall zzso In zzso the identification of genes with restricted expression patterns using whole zzso profiling suggests that many genes with potential roles in wing disc development remain to be zzso
