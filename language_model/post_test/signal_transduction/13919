zzso zzso zzso plays a crucial role in pathological processes of brain zzso injury, and zzso zzso has been known as a regulator of zzso expression and cells zzso However, the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso expression in rat brain zzso zzso zzso remain zzso Here, we demonstrated that zzso induced the expression of zzso zzso and migration of zzso cells, which were inhibited by zzso with the inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso or the zzso calcium zzso zzso and zzso with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso In addition, zzso zzso of zzso zzso concentration was attenuated by zzso (a zzso zzso zzso further induced zzso zzso and zzso zzso which were inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso also induced zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso Finally, we showed that zzso enhanced zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels induced by zzso were reduced by zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso in zzso binding of zzso to the zzso promoter, which was reduced by zzso with zzso or zzso but not zzso These results concluded that zzso activated a zzso zzso and zzso pathway, which in turn triggered zzso zzso and ultimately induced zzso expression in zzso zzso
