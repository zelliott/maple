Heart failure zzso skeletal muscle zzso is often associated to exercise intolerance and poor zzso Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso muscle zzso may contribute to the development of pharmacological strategies to prevent or treat such zzso It has been shown that zzso system is an important mechanism for maintenance of muscle zzso However, its role in zzso zzso has not been addressed zzso zzso the aim of the present study was to evaluate zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso in zzso 

zzso rats underwent zzso or zzso zzso and after 12 weeks were submitted to zzso exercise tolerance and zzso zzso zzso L activity and expression of zzso genes and proteins were assessed in zzso and zzso muscles by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso rats displayed exercise zzso left zzso dysfunction and zzso thereby suggesting the presence of zzso The key findings of the present study were: a) zzso of zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was observed only in zzso while muscle zzso was observed in both zzso and zzso muscles, and b) zzso L activity, zzso and zzso protein levels, and levels of zzso zzso were increased specifically in zzso muscle of zzso zzso 

zzso our results provide evidence for zzso signaling regulation in zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso system is zzso regulated in zzso muscles zzso different zzso and zzso zzso
