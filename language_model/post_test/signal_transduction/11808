zzso signaling systems in zzso cells involve zzso of zzso entry across the plasma membrane and release from zzso stores as well as zzso of zzso pumps and zzso of passive zzso pathways to ensure exact regulation of free zzso zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso cells loaded with zzso cells were used as a model system to examine regulation of zzso entry and zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso and transforming growth factor alpha zzso both zzso zzso entry and release while zzso appeared only to release zzso from zzso zzso The possible role of protein zzso C zzso in modulating the zzso response to these zzso was examined by four zzso Low zzso of zzso (2 zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso release due to zzso zzso or zzso but resulted in a rapid return of zzso to baseline levels for zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso (1 and 10 zzso completely inhibited the action of zzso on zzso zzso zzso An inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso the action of zzso zzso of zzso by overnight incubation with zzso or 1 zzso zzso produced the converse effect, namely prolonged zzso entry following stimulation with zzso or zzso To show that one effect of zzso was on zzso entry, zzso loaded cells were suspended in zzso rather than zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso resulted in zzso release and zzso zzso zzso but not the inactive zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso Thus, zzso is able to regulate zzso entry due to zzso or zzso in this cell zzso zzso cells treated with higher zzso of zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso inhibited not only zzso entry but also zzso release due to zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso release, suggesting differences in the regulation of the zzso stores responsive to these two classes of zzso Furthermore, sequential addition of zzso or zzso gave a single transient of zzso showing a common pool of zzso for these zzso In contrast, sequential addition of zzso (or zzso and zzso resulted in two zzso zzso equal in size to those obtained with a single zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
