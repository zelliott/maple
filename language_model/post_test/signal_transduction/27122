The nature of the zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso breakdown and contraction of isolated smooth muscle cells from the circular layer of the rabbit zzso was zzso zzso of membrane proteins using affinity zzso zzso directed against different zzso zzso revealed the expression of G alpha zzso G alpha 11 and G alpha 12 in these zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was abolished by zzso alpha zzso whereas zzso alpha zzso were zzso Moreover, the zzso contraction of zzso cells, as determined by zzso zzso was reversed by zzso alpha zzso but not affected by zzso alpha zzso From these data, we conclude that zzso stimulates zzso zzso and cell contraction through zzso of specific zzso zzso receptors coupled to the zzso zzso G alpha zzso This is the first demonstration of G alpha zzso implication in the zzso signal zzso zzso of zzso zzso receptors in smooth muscle zzso
