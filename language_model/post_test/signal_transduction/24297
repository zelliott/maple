Multiple studies suggest that zzso zzso to skeletal muscle contributes to the development of insulin resistance, perhaps by promoting the zzso of zzso zzso capable of zzso signal zzso zzso we demonstrate that exposing muscle cells to particular saturated free fatty acids zzso but not zzso zzso zzso insulin stimulation of zzso zzso B, a zzso zzso that is a central zzso of zzso anabolic zzso These saturated zzso zzso induced the zzso of zzso and zzso two products of fatty zzso that have been shown to accumulate in zzso zzso and to inhibit early steps in insulin zzso Preventing de zzso zzso synthesis negated the zzso effect of saturated zzso toward zzso zzso zzso Moreover, inducing zzso buildup zzso and zzso the zzso effect of saturated zzso By contrast, zzso proved zzso for these zzso zzso zzso these results identify zzso as a necessary and sufficient intermediate linking saturated fats to the zzso of insulin zzso
