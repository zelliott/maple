Great progress has been made in the field of insect zzso in recent zzso zzso zzso and circuits have been defined in considerable detail, and the mechanisms by which they zzso zzso and process sensory stimuli are being zzso We provide a guide to recent progress in the field, with special attention to advances made in the genetic model zzso zzso We highlight key questions that merit additional zzso We then present our view of how recent advances may be applied to the control of zzso insects such as zzso which transmit disease to hundreds of millions of people each zzso We suggest how progress in defining the basic mechanisms of insect zzso may lead to means of zzso zzso and other zzso behaviors, thereby reducing the transmission of deadly zzso
