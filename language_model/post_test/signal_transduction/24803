The release of zzso zzso and hydrogen zzso zzso induced by tumor necrosis zzso zzso or zzso zzso has been studied in the zzso cell line zzso 304 in the presence and absence of zzso zzso zzso Both zzso elicit the production of both zzso zzso zzso which increases zzso activity, decreases the amount of zzso but not zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso or zzso oxide zzso largely prevents zzso production, whereas zzso remains above the amount accounted for by zzso of residual zzso Thus, a fraction of zzso found in the zzso derives from an zzso pool, which is under control of zzso zzso This is further supported by the observation that in zzso cells, the rate of zzso zzso zzso depletion induced by zzso treatment is faster and more zzso Because zzso supplementation decreases zzso zzso activity, whereas added zzso is inactive and zzso does not affect the zzso induced by zzso it is concluded that only zzso generated zzso has a role in zzso factor zzso by both zzso and zzso
