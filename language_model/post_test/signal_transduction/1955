zzso are the zzso cells of the zzso and their zzso is thought to play an important zzso role in many diseases modeled by zzso zzso One zzso whose expression is zzso after zzso injury is tissue zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso with dual roles in the zzso The zzso activity of zzso which converts zzso into zzso leads to zzso death during zzso Via a zzso zzso zzso also mediates zzso zzso We show here in culture studies that zzso zzso zzso and zzso can release the zzso that elicits the zzso and that zzso acts in combination with other zzso We also show that the finger domain of zzso is necessary to trigger the zzso and identify zzso II as its probable binding zzso Together, these findings suggest that zzso released by either zzso or zzso can act as a neural zzso signaling through zzso II to activate zzso in settings of disease and zzso zzso methods to inhibit the interaction of zzso with zzso II would offer a new and selective approach to interfere with zzso zzso for therapeutic zzso
