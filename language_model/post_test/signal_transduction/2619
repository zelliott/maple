We have developed a model of zzso acid zzso synaptic transmission zzso by zzso and zzso zzso including zzso in the zzso zzso binding protein zzso zzso cascade zzso the zzso of zzso channels by zzso zzso If the binding of several G proteins is needed to activate the zzso channels, then only a prolonged zzso of zzso receptors evoked zzso zzso This could occur if strong stimuli evoked release in adjacent terminals and the zzso resulted in prolonged zzso of the zzso leading to zzso responses similar to those observed in zzso zzso The same model also reproduced zzso zzso responses to zzso bursts of zzso In this case, prolonged zzso of the receptors was due to zzso release zzso This model provides insights into the function of zzso receptors in normal and zzso zzso
