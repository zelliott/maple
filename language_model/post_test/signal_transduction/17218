zzso is a zzso zzso zzso involved in the folding of newly zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Here, we reveal a previously zzso function of zzso in regulating the zzso response downstream of zzso growth factor zzso zzso the product of a well-known human zzso We find that cell stimulation with zzso leads to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain, zzso at zzso interaction zzso The released zzso zzso into the nucleus, binds to zzso natural inhibitor of activated zzso thus, acts as an zzso of the zzso zzso response to zzso Also, we reveal the zzso capacity of zzso to sense zzso stress and, in response, prevent the zzso processing of its zzso zzso Thus, cells integrate the health status of the zzso to determine the zzso of their response to zzso
