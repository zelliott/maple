zzso the biological basis for sex differences in diseases can reveal their zzso and guide the development of individualized zzso Here, we review evidence for the novel concept that zzso signaling can be sex biased such that the specific pathways engaged by zzso binding are determined by zzso As an example, this review focuses on the zzso for zzso factor zzso a stress-related zzso implicated in diverse psychiatric and medical disorders that are more prevalent in zzso There is evidence for sex biases in zzso zzso zzso to G proteins and zzso that render females more sensitive to acute stress and less able to adapt to chronic zzso Taken with evidence for sex biased signaling in other zzso systems, the studies demonstrate the broad potential impact of this characteristic in determining sex differences in disease and therapeutic efficacy and underscore the importance of studying females in medical and pharmacological zzso
