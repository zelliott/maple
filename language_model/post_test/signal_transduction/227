zzso zzso have a tendency to invade zzso into surrounding healthy brain zzso thereby zzso their successful surgical zzso The zzso zzso zzso is well known as an important regulator of cell survival and zzso In this study, we show that zzso depletion of zzso inhibited migration and invasion of zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrate the mechanisms by which zzso functions to promote cell migration and zzso zzso of zzso a critical step of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso essential for the integrity of the zzso zzso and cell migration, were zzso Furthermore, zzso growth zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were also zzso consistent with defects in zzso Thus, zzso regulates both cell zzso and zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso cells was subsequently confirmed by Western zzso consistent with the decreased invasion in zzso and in zzso These results suggest that zzso contributes to zzso cells migration and invasion by regulating the formation of zzso influencing zzso and increasing expression of zzso Our zzso results by using human zzso tissue sections also indicated that zzso expression was closely related with the zzso of zzso This is zzso with our in zzso and in zzso results from cell zzso All of these results indicate that zzso is a critical factor in zzso zzso This study identifies that zzso is a potentially zzso target for therapeutic intervention in zzso
