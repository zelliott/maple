Studies of cell commitment and gene expression suggest that the subdivision of the zzso into segments and the zzso of their zzso identity emerges from a zzso in the early neural zzso This zzso zzso a regional zzso but not a commitment of individual cells to specific zzso and may involve the spatial expression of the zzso and zzso zzso The generation of zzso zzso has shown that the zzso gene is required for the formation of definitive zzso and zzso and the zzso gene is required for zzso and zzso zzso A mouse zzso zzso has disrupted zzso zzso with zzso and zzso failing to zzso Studies of gene expression in these zzso suggest that the zzso gene has an early role, whereas the zzso and zzso genes have later roles in the formation of definitive zzso I propose that a community effect of zzso signaling may zzso the commitment of cells to specific segments and discuss the implications of this for the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes are zzso expressed and could mediate zzso interactions that regulate cell commitment and zzso zzso
