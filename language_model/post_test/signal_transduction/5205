Certain zzso zzso such as zzso zzso are not only zzso for protein synthesis but also are important regulators of protein zzso Moreover, it is known that zzso in zzso growth favor the development of chronic diseases in zzso zzso we investigated the role of zzso in combination with other zzso on effects that are induced by maternal protein restriction on fetal zzso zzso rats were divided into 4 groups according to the diet provided during zzso control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso + zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso protein restriction reduced the growth and organ weight of the offspring of zzso receiving the zzso and zzso diets compared with the C zzso zzso with zzso reversed this growth deficit, minimizing the difference or restoring the mass of zzso and carcass fat, the liver and muscle zzso and the zzso zzso compared with newborns in the C group zzso zzso zzso These effects could be explained by the zzso of the zzso signaling pathway, because zzso of zzso in the liver of offspring of the zzso group was greater than that in the C, zzso and zzso zzso The present results identify a critical role for zzso in association with other zzso in the zzso of the zzso signaling zzso for the control of altered zzso growth induced by a maternal zzso zzso
