zzso plays an important role in protective immunity against zzso including the opportunistic zzso zzso zzso The balance between zzso and zzso zzso is a key zzso of infection zzso Since zzso migration zzso factor zzso is an upstream regulator of many zzso we analyzed zzso the role of zzso zzso in the host control of zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso As revealed by their mortality rate, zzso mice were more susceptible to zzso infection than zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso of zzso mice to lethal zzso The higher tissue zzso burden early in zzso infection indicated increased zzso of zzso mice to zzso infection as zzso zzso zzso of innate and acquired zzso responses, characterized by decreased production of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso was noted in zzso infected zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was higher in zzso than in zzso zzso Taken together, our findings show that zzso contributes to host resistance against progressive invasive zzso zzso infection by controlling downstream zzso versus zzso zzso production thus determining the outcome of zzso
