zzso zzso sensing zzso systems are cell zzso regulatory networks that coordinate bacterial zzso changes from single cellular organisms at low cell zzso to zzso types when their population density reaches a threshold zzso At this stage, bacteria produce and perceive small zzso signal zzso termed zzso in order to mediate gene zzso This often results in zzso shifts, like zzso to zzso or zzso to zzso In this way, they regulate varied zzso processes by adjusting gene expression in concert with their population zzso In this review we give a synopsis of zzso zzso zzso communication in zzso The first part focuses on zzso circuits of some zzso and zzso zzso zzso attention is drawn on the recent applications of zzso in development of synthetic biology zzso for studying the principles of pattern formation, engineering zzso communication system and building artificial communication zzso Further, the role of zzso in solving the problem of zzso is also zzso
