We have recently cloned the full-length zzso of the two growth hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso species, the black zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 214 zzso zzso namely zzso and zzso zzso expression of these two zzso zzso in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso cells indicated that stimulation of zzso by growth hormone zzso zzso could evoke increases in zzso zzso concentration zzso whereas zzso appeared to play an zzso role on the signal zzso activity of zzso In the present study, we have further investigated the signal zzso mechanism of zzso The zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were able to trigger a zzso specific and zzso C zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells zzso expressing zzso This zzso calcium zzso was also dependent on protein zzso C activated zzso calcium channel zzso It was found that zzso could function in an zzso manner as it exhibited a high zzso activity of zzso zzso production in the absence of zzso indicating that the fish zzso is zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso were found to be activated upon stimulation of zzso by zzso This observation provides direct evidence in the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso Neither zzso nor zzso proteins are coupled to the zzso as zzso did not induce zzso production nor inhibit zzso zzso zzso in the zzso bearing zzso Furthermore, the ability of the zzso zzso zzso to inhibit zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity suggests that this compound is an inverse zzso In zzso the zzso appears to couple through the zzso zzso to activate zzso resulting in increased zzso production and zzso zzso from both zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso may trigger multiple signal zzso zzso to exert its zzso zzso
