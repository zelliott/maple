zzso zzso is an important component of the immune response to viral infections that can have a role both in controlling virus replication and inducing inflammatory zzso To determine the role of zzso in fatal zzso encephalitis, we have compared the responses of wild type zzso zzso mice with mice deficient in either zzso zzso or the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso after zzso infection with a zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso mice were similar to zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso mice had delayed virus clearance from the brain and spinal cord, more zzso zzso cells and lower levels of tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso However, inflammation was more intense in zzso mice than zzso or zzso mice with more zzso zzso T cells, greater expression of major zzso zzso and higher levels of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso did not develop an zzso response after treatment with zzso but showed increases in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso although these increases developed more slowly and were less intense than those of zzso zzso These data indicate that both zzso and zzso mice fail to develop an zzso zzso response, but differ in regulation of the inflammatory response to zzso zzso zzso and zzso cannot be considered equivalent when assessing the role of zzso in zzso viral zzso
