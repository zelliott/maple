zzso exerts zzso properties in zzso in two different zzso While zzso zzso which is primarily expressed in the zzso acts as an zzso zzso of zzso to regulate zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting from the shedding of the zzso zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully zzso Here, we investigated the biological role of zzso in zzso zzso Two redundant zzso of the zzso gene exist in zzso zzso and zzso predicted proteins zzso to the zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso We have used a genetic approach to investigate the functional activity of zzso in zzso zzso Here, we report that whereas zzso requires zzso zzso and zzso to promote longevity and zzso stress resistance, it is not involved in the regulation of fluid zzso controlled by zzso Besides revealing a new zzso role for zzso our data suggest that the zzso form of zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso We also report a genetic interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso While the regulation of longevity requires functional zzso zzso the control of zzso stress resistance involves a zzso independent, zzso pathway, suggesting that zzso may target either zzso or zzso depending of environmental zzso Thus, the zzso zzso form of zzso appears to zzso with both zzso and zzso pathways to exert zzso properties in zzso zzso
