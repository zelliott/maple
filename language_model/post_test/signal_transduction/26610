The light responses of rod and cone zzso in the zzso zzso are zzso different, yet extremely stable and zzso because of the extraordinary regulation of the cascade of zzso reactions that link zzso zzso and visual zzso zzso to the gating of zzso zzso channels in the outer segment plasma zzso While the molecular scheme of the zzso zzso is essentially the same in rods and cones, the zzso and protein regulators that constitute the zzso are zzso These zzso and regulators can differ in the quantitative features of their functions or in concentration if their functions are similar or both can be zzso The molecular identity and distinct function of the molecules of the zzso cascade in rods and cones are zzso The functional significance of these molecular differences is examined with a mathematical model of the zzso zzso zzso zzso by available zzso zzso and zzso data, the model simulates zzso that match well the electrical zzso measured in both rods and zzso Using simulation zzso with the mathematical model, the time course of zzso changes in zzso activities and second zzso zzso in zzso rods and cones are compared side by zzso
