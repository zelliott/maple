The positively charged protein zzso domain of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso rapidly zzso across the plasma membrane of living zzso This property is exploited for the delivery of zzso drugs, and genes into zzso The mechanism of this zzso is, however, not yet zzso Recent theories for zzso suggest binding of the protein zzso domain zzso to zzso zzso as a possible zzso We have studied the binding equilibrium between zzso and three different zzso with high sensitivity zzso zzso zzso and provide the first quantitative zzso zzso The zzso zzso were found to exhibit multiple identical binding sites for zzso with only small differences between the three species as far as the zzso parameters are zzso zzso zzso zzso molecular weight, zzso zzso 2 zzso has zzso zzso zzso independent binding sites for zzso which are characterized by a binding constant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 28 degrees zzso The binding zzso zzso is determined to equal extent by zzso and zzso zzso The zzso complex formation zzso a positive heat capacity change of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is characteristic of a charge zzso zzso This is in contrast to zzso binding reactions which display a large negative heat capacity zzso The zzso of zzso zzso molecules per HS zzso to an electric charge zzso Light scattering data demonstrate a maximum scattering intensity at this zzso ratio, the intensity of which depends on the order of mixing of the two zzso The data suggest zzso and/or zzso of zzso zzso Two other zzso namely zzso and zzso zzso B, were also studied with zzso zzso zzso The zzso parameters are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso B at 28 degrees zzso The close zzso similarity of the three binding molecules also implies a close structural zzso The ubiquitous occurrence of zzso on the cell surface together with their tight and rapid interaction with the zzso protein zzso domain makes complex formation a strong candidate as the primary step of protein zzso
