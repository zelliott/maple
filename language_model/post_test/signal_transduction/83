zzso death plays an important role in the zzso of heart zzso The nuclear factor zzso signaling zzso regulates cell death, however, the effect of zzso zzso on cell death can vary in different cells or zzso The purpose of the present study was to clarify the in zzso role of the zzso zzso in response to pressure zzso First, we subjected zzso mice to pressure overload by means of zzso zzso zzso zzso and examined the activity of the zzso zzso in response to pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were activated after zzso Then, we investigated the role of the zzso using zzso zzso mice zzso zzso displayed normal global cardiac structure and function compared with control zzso We subjected zzso and control mice to pressure zzso One week after zzso zzso showed cardiac zzso dysfunction, and lung congestion, which are characteristics of heart zzso The number of zzso cells in the hearts of zzso mice increased significantly after zzso The levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein expression in zzso after zzso were significantly attenuated compared with control zzso The levels of zzso stress and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso after zzso were significantly greater than those in control zzso zzso cell death of isolated adult zzso zzso was inhibited by treatment with either a zzso zzso zzso zzso or a zzso zzso Thus, the zzso signaling zzso plays a protective role in zzso because of the zzso of zzso stress and zzso zzso in a setting of acute pressure zzso
