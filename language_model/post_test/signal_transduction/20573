Currently, zzso has been clinically investigated as a therapeutic agent for a variety of solid zzso including breast zzso However, the exact underlying molecular mechanisms through which zzso zzso zzso zzso cell growth arrest and zzso in solid tumors have not been clearly zzso The aim of our study was to gain an insight into the effect of zzso on the human breast cancer zzso cell line and investigate cell growth zzso zzso and the molecular mechanism after zzso treatment in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso cells was determined by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso The protein expression was examined by the Western zzso analysis and zzso zzso The distribution of zzso cells was assessed by flow zzso and the zzso of the zzso cells was investigated by zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso significantly induced the zzso of zzso cells tested in this study in a zzso zzso zzso induced the decrease of zzso expression and the increase of total as well as nuclear zzso zzso which triggered the zzso of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis, and zzso revealed that the expression of zzso in zzso cells was zzso when zzso was combined with tumor necrosis zzso zzso whereas the expression of zzso was zzso in comparison with the zzso zzso These findings indicated a specific molecular mechanism by which zzso cell lines were susceptible to the zzso therapy through zzso expression and zzso This zzso zzso may be well correlated with the zzso reduction of active zzso which may provide new insights into zzso signaling zzso
