zzso dysfunction in the prefrontal zzso zzso has been implicated in the zzso of zzso On the other hand, administration of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso functions and zzso a broad range of zzso symptoms, thus has been widely used as an animal model for zzso This study sought to determine the mechanism by which zzso may alter the zzso functions in zzso In control rats, zzso of zzso zzso receptors produced a significant suppression of zzso zzso transmission in zzso zzso zzso which was dependent on the zzso of active zzso However, in zzso rats, the zzso zzso of zzso receptors was significantly impaired, with the zzso loss of zzso regulation of zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso channels was intact following zzso zzso Furthermore, treatment with the antipsychotic drug zzso restored the zzso regulation of zzso receptors in zzso zzso These findings suggest that the selective disruption of the interaction between zzso and zzso receptors in the zzso model, which is attributable to the impaired zzso downstream zzso may contribute to the zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso
