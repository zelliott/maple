zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and thereby zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso beta zzso is thought to play an important role in the regulation of cardiac zzso zzso we studied beta zzso zzso and its zzso in intact smooth muscle cells and in zzso 

beta zzso zzso zzso of beta zzso was monitored by zzso zzso with specific zzso and zzso laser scanning zzso in zzso 2 zzso smooth muscle cells and in zzso rat zzso In zzso zzso beta zzso was mainly located in the zzso After beta zzso zzso zzso the beta zzso signal was partially zzso to the zzso zzso gene transfer of the zzso of beta zzso zzso zzso as a beta zzso inhibitor led to functional expression of this protein in both cell lines with high zzso Western blots with beta zzso zzso showed a gene zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated reduced membrane targeting of the beta zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the effect of zzso zzso on beta zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso In control cells, zzso with zzso led to a subsequent reduction of beta zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso this beta zzso zzso was significantly diminished, whereas normal beta zzso zzso zzso was zzso A gene concentration of 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso smooth muscle cells led to approximately zzso and approximately zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso native beta zzso zzso These gene doses proved sufficient to zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso beta zzso zzso was evidenced in zzso smooth muscle cells and in zzso by zzso laser scanning zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene transfer to zzso was demonstrated, and necessary gene doses for beta zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso functionally zzso with zzso zzso signal zzso leading to sustained zzso zzso after prolonged zzso zzso
