The mechanisms underlying targeted sorting of zzso receptors for recycling to the plasma membrane or degradation in zzso are poorly zzso In this report, the zzso tails of the five zzso receptors zzso were expressed as zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins and studied for their interaction with zzso zzso 50 zzso and zzso factor zzso which are known to be involved in zzso recycling of receptors back to the plasma zzso and with sorting zzso 1 zzso known to be involved in targeting receptors to zzso zzso zzso did not bind any of the zzso zzso zzso zzso bound strongly to D1 and zzso and only zzso to zzso D3 and zzso However, zzso clearly distinguished between D1 and zzso as only zzso bound strongly to this zzso This report shows that there are distinct interaction patterns for zzso and zzso to the various zzso zzso zzso
