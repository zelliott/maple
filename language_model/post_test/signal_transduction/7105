The skeleton originates from stem cells residing in the zzso and neural crest that undergo zzso migration, and zzso The development of the skeletal stem cells is influenced by many signaling pathways that govern cell fate determination, zzso zzso and zzso This review will focus on zzso signaling functions in regulating the different cell types that form the skeletal system as well as the interplay between them to maintain zzso zzso require zzso signaling to maintain zzso and to prevent premature differentiation into zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling suppresses zzso zzso Moreover, zzso signaling in zzso is required for zzso proliferation and zzso and suppresses terminal zzso zzso studies demonstrated a crucial role of zzso signaling in zzso and zzso where concepts derived from zzso pathways are often zzso This brings hope of taking advantage of the molecular mechanisms learned from development to approach the pathological processes underlying abnormal zzso metabolism or zzso zzso agents that target zzso receptors or zzso in a zzso fashion would offer new opportunities for treating zzso diseases caused by zzso of zzso zzso
