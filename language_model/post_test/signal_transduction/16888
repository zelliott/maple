zzso zzso zzso zzso has been reported to exert biological effects in both the zzso zzso and outer zzso membrane zzso However, the zzso targets, and zzso of the zzso cascade in these zzso zzso remain largely zzso Here we used sensitive zzso sensors to monitor zzso and protein zzso A zzso activity in different zzso compartments in real zzso We found that zzso zzso did not enter the zzso except during zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment zzso to activate zzso soluble zzso zzso increased zzso zzso but along with zzso zzso zzso failed to induce zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso proved to be a domain of exceptionally persistent zzso zzso zzso Although zzso signaling events measured on the zzso mirrored those of the zzso zzso zzso at the zzso endured longer as a consequence of diminished control by local zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso host zzso zzso zzso with distinct functional and kinetic zzso
