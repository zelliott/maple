In the present study, we investigated the zzso effect of zzso zzso stimulation with zzso on pressure overload zzso vascular injury in the zzso zzso and defined mechanisms underlying that zzso zzso rats underwent bilateral zzso and two weeks later were further treated with abdominal zzso zzso To confirm the zzso role of zzso zzso zzso we treated rats with the zzso zzso (at zzso and zzso zzso and with the zzso zzso (at zzso for 4 weeks orally once a day after the onset of zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso decreased significantly 4 weeks after pressure zzso zzso in vehicle treated zzso zzso zzso administration significantly attenuated pressure zzso vascular injury with zzso increase in zzso expression and subsequent decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment also significantly restored pressure zzso impaired zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein expression as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso effect was nullified by zzso of a zzso zzso zzso No changes in zzso of zzso or zzso in the zzso were observed following pressure overload and after zzso zzso Our findings zzso for the first time, a potential role for zzso zzso expression and signaling in the zzso zzso in attenuating zzso vascular injury in zzso zzso Thus, we zzso for the first time, a potential role in the zzso zzso for zzso zzso expression and signaling via zzso in attenuating zzso vascular injury in zzso zzso
