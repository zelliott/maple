This paper summarizes our current stand on potential zzso targets for zzso zzso zzso Although zzso is a complicated disease, involving the cartilage, zzso zzso and zzso bone, a number of interactive pathways have been found to explain the structural changes in the disease zzso Study of these three zzso has yielded a list of targets to examine for their potential to affect disease zzso At the cartilage level, therapeutic agents, such as growth factors, could be targeted to increase zzso zzso At the zzso level, zzso and zzso zzso zzso are potential targets for zzso In the zzso bone, zzso growth factors and zzso and locally zzso factors affecting bone metabolism are also potential targets of zzso Recent progress in the understanding of the zzso of zzso has led to exploration of several interesting new approaches toward the treatment of this zzso New classes of molecules that inhibit one or more zzso disease processes are under evaluation for their potential to alter the degenerative zzso The prospect of finding a cure for zzso is more promising than zzso Based on the discovery of major zzso pathways leading to the structural changes observed in zzso novel ways to treat the progression of zzso zzso are zzso
