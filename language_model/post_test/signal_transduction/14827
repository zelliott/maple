zzso brain zzso are strengthened or weakened in response to specific patterns of synaptic zzso and these changes in synaptic strength are thought to zzso persistent zzso such as drug addiction, as well as zzso In contrast, there are few examples of synaptic plasticity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report long-term zzso of zzso synaptic transmission zzso onto zzso zzso of the rat brain zzso zzso area, a region required for the development of drug zzso This novel form of zzso is zzso requiring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso but resulting from increased zzso release at zzso zzso nerve zzso zzso zzso zzso produces zzso oxide, a retrograde signal released from the zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso in zzso nerve zzso Exposure to zzso both in zzso and in zzso prevents zzso Whereas brief treatment with zzso in zzso blocks zzso by zzso zzso zzso release, in zzso exposure to zzso persistently interrupts zzso from zzso oxide to zzso zzso These zzso to zzso drugs might contribute to early stages of addiction, and may potentially be exploited zzso using drugs targeting zzso zzso
