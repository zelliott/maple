zzso and zzso have been shown to protect the Swedish zzso zzso precursor protein zzso transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease from cognitive zzso But their mechanisms of action remain incompletely zzso These Alzheimer's mice have extensive zzso dysfunction, which likely contributes to their cognitive zzso To further explore the mechanism through which caffeine and zzso protect cognitive function in these mice, we monitored the function of isolated zzso from zzso mice treated with caffeine, zzso or both in their drinking water for one zzso zzso treatment yielded a near complete restoration of zzso function in zzso of respiratory rate, membrane potential, zzso oxygen species production, and zzso zzso zzso treatment by itself yielded a small increase in zzso zzso However, caffeine largely blocked the large enhancement of zzso function provided by zzso Studies with zzso zzso cells zzso expressing zzso showed that specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso 4 or zzso zzso also blocked zzso protection of zzso function, but zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were without zzso zzso or caffeine at the zzso used to zzso zzso function in the cells had no effect on zzso zzso activity or cellular zzso or zzso zzso zzso caffeine and increased zzso zzso levels likely block zzso signaling to zzso by independent mechanisms that do not involve zzso zzso zzso The results of this study indicate that zzso restores zzso function much more zzso than caffeine in zzso transgenic mouse and cell models of Alzheimer's zzso
