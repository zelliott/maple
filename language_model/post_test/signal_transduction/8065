zzso biological networks between proteins appears nowadays as one of the most important challenges in systems zzso zzso approaches to this problem are important to complement zzso technologies and to help biologists in designing new zzso In this work, we focus on the completion of a biological network from various sources of experimental zzso 

We propose a new machine learning approach for the supervised zzso of biological networks, which is based on a zzso of the output space of zzso zzso It zzso several features of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso to irrelevant zzso and input zzso We applied this method to the zzso of two kinds of networks in the zzso zzso zzso a zzso interaction network and an zzso zzso In both cases, we obtained results competitive with existing zzso We also show that our method provides relevant insights on input data regarding their potential relationship with the existence of zzso Furthermore, we confirm the biological zzso of our predictions in the context of an analysis of gene expression zzso 

zzso kernel tree based methods provide an efficient tool for the zzso of biological networks from experimental zzso Their simplicity and zzso should make them of great value for zzso
