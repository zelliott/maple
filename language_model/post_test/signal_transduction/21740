At the layer of first visual zzso information from zzso is processed and transmitted towards the zzso In fly compound eye, output from zzso zzso that share the same visual field is pooled and transmitted via zzso zzso to two classes of zzso large zzso cells zzso and zzso cells zzso The zzso also feed back to zzso terminals via numerous zzso zzso yet the significance of these connections has remained a zzso We investigated the role of feedback zzso by comparing zzso responses of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and in synaptic zzso to light and current zzso and to zzso light zzso The recordings were further subjected to rigorous statistical and zzso zzso We show that the feedback zzso form a negative feedback loop that controls the speed and zzso of zzso responses and hence the quality of the transmitted zzso These results highlight the benefits of feedback zzso for neural information processing, and suggest that similar coding strategies could be used in other nervous zzso
