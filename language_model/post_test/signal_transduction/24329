The zzso of zzso zzso is due to the unique ability of infected zzso zzso to adhere to vascular zzso We investigated whether zzso of zzso to zzso the major zzso zzso on human zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso signaling and regulates zzso A zzso zzso corresponding to the minimal zzso domain from P zzso zzso membrane protein 1 zzso as well as an zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso activated the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso that was dependent on zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso with a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso inhibited zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso More importantly, zzso zzso activity was also required for zzso to intact human zzso in a zzso combined zzso zzso mouse model in zzso The effect of zzso could be zzso by zzso a specific zzso zzso Firm zzso to zzso zzso was restored by zzso alkaline zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso pathways had no immediate effect on zzso zzso These results suggest a novel mechanism for the zzso of zzso under flow conditions through a signaling zzso involving zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or signaling molecules may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy against severe zzso zzso
