A method is presented for the rapid detection and characterization of trace amounts of peptides zzso from zzso including zzso zzso factors, and zzso zzso The zzso based on targeted zzso zzso uses a novel zzso laser zzso trap mass zzso to overcome limitations of current zzso methods zzso dynamic range, signal suppression effects, and chemical zzso that impair observation of low abundance peptides from complex biological zzso Here, zzso peptides that are hypothesized to be present in the zzso but that may not be sufficiently abundant to be observed in zzso mass zzso are subjected to zzso zzso zzso specific fragmentation signatures enable zzso identification of the peptides of interest and differentiation of the signals from the zzso As examples, we demonstrate the rapid zzso zzso determination of the mating type of cells in colonies of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso peptides zzso from zzso of zzso zzso We confirm the primary structures of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso for groups I, II, and IV and provide direct evidence that the native zzso zzso is a zzso zzso We also show that the zzso zzso from zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with a zzso ring formed through zzso of the zzso side chain with the C zzso of the zzso This is the first demonstration of zzso in a zzso zzso that occurs via zzso zzso These examples demonstrate the zzso power of the present procedure for characterizing zzso peptides and its potential utility for identifying zzso
