zzso in skeletal muscle size and strength, often seen with chronic wasting diseases, prolonged or high-dose zzso therapy, and the natural aging process in zzso are usually associated with reduced physical activity and testosterone zzso However, it is not clear whether the decline in testosterone and activity are zzso zzso Using a mouse model, we found that removal of zzso testosterone by zzso results in an almost complete zzso in voluntary wheel running but only a small decline in muscle zzso zzso replacement restored running behavior and muscle mass to normal zzso zzso also suppressed the zzso pathway, activated the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and suppressed several energy metabolism zzso and all of these effects were reversed by testosterone zzso The study also delineated a zzso previously unidentified set of genes that is zzso regulated by zzso and testosterone zzso These data demonstrate the necessity of testosterone for both speed and endurance of voluntary wheel running in mice and suggest a potential mechanism for declined activity in humans where zzso are zzso
