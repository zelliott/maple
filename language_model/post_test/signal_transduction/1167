zzso infection and stimulation with zzso zzso or double stranded zzso zzso induce zzso of zzso zzso regulatory factor zzso and its zzso to the nucleus, thereby leading to the zzso gene zzso Recently, two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso were suggested to act as zzso zzso and be involved in zzso production in zzso zzso zzso signaling and viral zzso In this work, we investigated the zzso roles of these zzso by gene zzso zzso embryonic zzso zzso showed dramatic decrease in induction of zzso and zzso genes in response to zzso or zzso as well as after viral zzso However, zzso expression of these genes was zzso detected in zzso cells and intact in zzso cells, but completely abolished in zzso doubly deficient zzso zzso zzso in response not only to zzso but also to viral infection, was impaired in zzso zzso Together, these results demonstrate that zzso as well as, albeit to a lesser extent, zzso play a crucial role in the induction of zzso and zzso genes in both zzso and zzso zzso
