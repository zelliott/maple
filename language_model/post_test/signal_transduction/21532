zzso zzso promote while zzso acid zzso zzso seed zzso and zzso zzso To address the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso we studied two rice zzso genes zzso and zzso that are zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of these two genes in zzso cells specifically and zzso zzso induction of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso promoter reporter construct zzso by zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso The physical interactions of zzso proteins themselves and that of zzso and zzso are revealed in the zzso of zzso cells using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso itself does not bind to the zzso promoter in zzso it interacts with zzso and enhances the binding affinity of zzso to W boxes in the zzso zzso The binding activity of zzso is abolished by deleting the zzso containing the zzso domain or substituting the key zzso acids in the zzso motif and the zinc finger zzso However, two of these zzso zzso are still able to repress zzso induction by enhancing the binding affinity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the third zzso zzso enhances zzso induction of zzso by interfering with the binding of the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso These data demonstrate the synergistic interaction of zzso zzso genes in regulating zzso zzso signaling in zzso cells, thereby establishing a novel mechanism for zzso and zzso signaling zzso
