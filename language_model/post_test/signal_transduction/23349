zzso zzso resulting from impairment of zzso integrity leads to heart failure, through still incompletely understood zzso The zzso growth factor zzso system has been implicated in tissue zzso but its role in the adult heart is not well zzso We hypothesized that the zzso system plays a role in the maintenance of cardiac zzso and the impairment of zzso zzso signaling leads to pathological cardiac zzso We showed that zzso signaling is required for zzso 43 zzso zzso at zzso contacts in isolated zzso and zzso zzso Lack of zzso signaling led to decreased zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso sites known to be important for assembly of gap zzso zzso instability induced by zzso zzso was restored by the zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting zzso zzso of these zzso zzso with these in zzso findings, zzso zzso of zzso signaling in adult mice demonstrated zzso of zzso at zzso discs, whereas zzso of zzso and zzso was not zzso This led to premature death resulting from impaired cardiac zzso We conclude that zzso zzso signaling is essential for zzso zzso through zzso of zzso at zzso zzso which are important for the maintenance of gap zzso
