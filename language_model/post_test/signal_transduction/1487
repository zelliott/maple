We investigate the mechanism of regulation of zzso zzso zzso Multiple putative sites of zzso for the major zzso are present on both zzso of the zzso We show that NO zzso after binding to the zzso group, is specifically modulated by sequential zzso zzso increases the NO stimulation at optimum level when both zzso are zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso first, zzso the zzso zzso of the alpha zzso and limits the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso However, zzso zzso first didn't prevent zzso zzso of the two zzso and the sequence zzso zzso higher level of NO zzso than zzso These zzso occur independently of NO binding and the direct zzso effect of calcium is observed for all the zzso zzso These data show that the zzso activity is regulated in a complex way, and the well-known asymmetry of the two zzso appears to cause the reading of the sequence of regulatory zzso This qualifies zzso as molecular detector on which zzso coincidental and/or sequential zzso zzso Furthermore, due to the fact that NO induction is huge (more than zzso obtained with the zzso zzso we might consider that any variation in zzso zzso and/or calcium concentration in zzso area of zzso zzso provokes locally significant quantitative difference of zzso synthesis in presence of zzso zzso
