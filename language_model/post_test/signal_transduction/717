Loss of zzso causes zzso zzso of downstream components of zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso and zzso normal nervous system development and zzso We tested the contribution of zzso to the abnormalities induced by zzso deletion in the zzso zzso deletion of zzso caused zzso Combined deletion of zzso and zzso rescued zzso but not migration defects of zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso different effects on the regulation of zzso zzso in zzso versus zzso Our results show zzso and zzso abnormalities in zzso zzso and demonstrate cell type specific differences in feedback regulation of the ubiquitous zzso zzso
