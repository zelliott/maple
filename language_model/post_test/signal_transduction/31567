When pancreatic tissue is injured after duct zzso zzso zzso is zzso Similar zzso changes occur when zzso pancreatic cells are isolated and zzso We demonstrate that under these experimental conditions the zzso zzso cells lose their differentiated zzso expression of the zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso is decreased or lost, whereas expression of the embryonic zzso factor zzso is zzso The receptors zzso and zzso members of the zzso family of zzso zzso and the target genes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso become strongly zzso We noted also reduced expression of zzso a zzso zzso that is normally highly expressed in zzso zzso zzso of zzso by its zzso zzso diminished the proliferation of cultured zzso zzso zzso Chemical zzso of zzso signaling resulted in increased proliferation and induction of the zzso regulator zzso This effect seems to be zzso and mainly zzso with decreased zzso and zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, we demonstrate that during zzso zzso the zzso zzso is activated zzso with changes in zzso factor expression of pancreatic zzso zzso In addition, we show that zzso signaling is implicated in the suppression of proliferation of these zzso zzso zzso The latter may be important in protection from zzso zzso
