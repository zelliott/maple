zzso zzso play a key role in the zzso of joint diseases such as zzso arthritis zzso Current therapies target mainly tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso as this has proven zzso However, a large number of patients do not respond to or become resistant to zzso zzso While the role of zzso in zzso is quite zzso the role of zzso also called zzso zzso is zzso In this study we investigated whether zzso and its zzso play a role in zzso in the inflammatory zzso 

An in zzso model of primary human zzso was used to study zzso inflammatory zzso 

zzso inflammation enhances zzso and zzso expression in primary human zzso accompanied by the zzso of inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso all known to be regulated by zzso In contrast, zzso similar to the natural zzso inhibitor zzso zzso or the zzso of zzso by using zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso and its zzso to the nucleus, and abolished the zzso and zzso effects of zzso This zzso least in part, the crucial role of zzso in zzso in cartilage, similar to that expected for zzso Finally, the zzso between zzso zzso and the responding zzso was significantly enhanced through a zzso inflammatory zzso 

These results suggest for the first time that zzso is involved in zzso inflammation in zzso during zzso parallel to zzso resulting in the zzso of zzso signaling and zzso of zzso zzso
