We propose the zzso of a protein zzso zzso zzso based on the recently delineated mechanism of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These bacterial zzso zzso zzso factors are injected into zzso cells and inhibit zzso by zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso they employ an unusual zzso reaction, removing the zzso from zzso and converting it into zzso (an zzso zzso zzso can also be produced by zzso and zzso zzso and zzso by zzso these zzso are found in the eye lens and in bacterial zzso We zzso that zzso might be a widespread regulatory zzso and we propose the use of zzso zzso as in zzso zzso zzso both zzso and to investigate zzso zzso zzso
