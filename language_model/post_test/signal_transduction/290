The zzso family of zzso zzso receptors and their zzso the zzso zzso in the regulation of a wide variety of biological functions under normal and pathological zzso During embryonic development, interactions between the zzso and receptors define tissue zzso guide zzso zzso and regulate zzso as well as bone zzso These molecules have also been shown to modify neural activity in the adult nervous system and influence tumor zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these diverse functions are not completely zzso In this study, we conducted a zzso zzso screen to identify molecules that physically interact with zzso receptors using the zzso domain of zzso as zzso This study identified zzso as a strong binding partner of zzso as zzso using both zzso fusion protein pull down and zzso zzso The interaction is zzso through binding of the zzso zzso domain to the zzso zzso at position zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The removal of the zzso domain or the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso We further demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso cell migration and process zzso and these zzso effects are partially alleviated by zzso zzso zzso that lack functional zzso or zzso zzso but not by the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso interacts with zzso to regulate cell migration and process zzso
