zzso zzso 2A zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that carries out multiple zzso Although numerous observations suggest that zzso plays a major role in zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso pathway, the precise mechanisms are zzso To clarify the role of zzso in growth factor zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso growth factor 1 zzso stimulation of the zzso zzso pathway, zzso virus 40 small zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso which zzso insulin zzso Small zzso zzso is known to specifically inhibit zzso by binding to the A zzso regulatory zzso interfering with the ability of zzso to bind to its cellular zzso zzso small zzso protein was zzso with zzso and inhibited cellular zzso activity but did not inhibit protein zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso IGF-1, and zzso stimulation also inhibited zzso zzso Growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activities were elevated in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso and its association with zzso were also elevated in zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso of insulin, zzso and IGF-1 receptors were not zzso Interestingly, we found that zzso associated with zzso in the zzso state and zzso in response to insulin and zzso and that this zzso was inhibited by zzso in zzso zzso In addition, we found that zzso associates with the zzso domain zzso zzso of zzso and that zzso of zzso 317 of zzso was required for zzso zzso We conclude zzso that zzso zzso regulates the zzso zzso zzso by binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that the zzso association is zzso by the zzso zzso domain but the interaction is independent of zzso zzso indicating a new molecular function for the zzso zzso zzso that growth factor zzso or zzso zzso causes zzso of the zzso complex, zzso zzso zzso and downstream zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso that this defines a new mechanism of zzso action to promote zzso
