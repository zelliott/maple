zzso growth factors zzso are identified in all zzso An zzso hybrid zzso has also been identified in zzso zzso However, whether this hybrid zzso functions as zzso zzso remains zzso Here we established a primary culture system of mouse muscle satellite cells as an in zzso model to investigate the effects of zzso zzso zzso on muscle cell zzso Like human zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to stimulate the proliferation of mouse muscle zzso Besides, it was able to bind to the cells and the partially zzso zzso receptors from mouse muscle zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso was capable of zzso zzso and zzso pathways by stimulating zzso of zzso and zzso This interaction of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso receptors and its induction of similar downstream signaling pathways add substantially to the hypothesis of the presence of zzso signaling in the common zzso of zzso
