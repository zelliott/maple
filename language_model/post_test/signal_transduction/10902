zzso zzso a zzso signaling zzso that regulates many cellular functions, is zzso from zzso and zzso by the action of zzso zzso Two such zzso have been identified, zzso and zzso To begin to investigate the zzso functions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso we generated mice deficient in zzso zzso zzso mice were viable, zzso and without any obvious zzso Total zzso activity in most zzso was zzso but not completely, reduced indicating the presence of multiple zzso zzso zzso levels in most zzso from the zzso mice were not markedly zzso In serum, however, there was a significant decrease in the zzso zzso Although zzso signaling regulates zzso trafficking, zzso distribution was unaffected in zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso mice showing that zzso is not required for the functional zzso of this zzso analogue zzso The results with these zzso zzso mice reveal that some key zzso processes that require zzso zzso zzso such as vascular development and proper zzso distribution, can occur in the absence of zzso
