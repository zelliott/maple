Previous reports debated the effects of differentiation on zzso zzso zzso zzso efficiency and zzso zzso zzso zzso This prompted us to investigate the efficiency of zzso zzso and zzso expression in human zzso stem cells zzso and their differentiated zzso Current results revealed high efficiency zzso of zzso zzso and a consistent level of zzso expression in zzso by the use of zzso carrying the enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter zzso Competition of zzso with blocking zzso zzso zzso resulted in a reduction in zzso efficiency, indicating the zzso involvement in zzso of zzso The cells were then induced to differentiate into bone, fat, or neural cells, and results demonstrated that the differentiation was accompanied with a consistent decline in zzso zzso and a zzso in zzso zzso zzso were infected with zzso and then induced into zzso and results demonstrated that zzso cells preserved differentiation zzso and still had zzso expression in a zzso of cells for 4 weeks and even in tested zzso zzso According to the present investigation, zzso zzso can serve as a zzso system, and gene transfer into zzso before differentiation can resolve the difficulties in zzso of their differentiated zzso
