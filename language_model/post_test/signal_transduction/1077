The therapy of zzso cell lung cancer zzso has reached a plateau in improving patient survival, with overall disappointing zzso Thus, clinical research for new treatment strategies is zzso Advances in the singling out molecular targets for zzso treatment has granted the development of several new biological zzso In the present paper we describe the main clinical data currently available on targeted agents in the treatment of zzso focusing on zzso growth factor zzso family zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vaccines and gene zzso Several targeted agents have been introduced into clinical trials in zzso mainly in advanced disease, with the first phase III study results being recently made zzso To date, few of these new agents can offer hope of a substantial impact on the natural history of zzso and negative results are more commonly reported than positive zzso Nevertheless, zzso advances have already been achieved in chemotherapy zzso advanced zzso patients, with zzso an zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso representing a further chance of tumor control and symptom zzso Moreover, important lessons can be learned from this first generation of clinical zzso
