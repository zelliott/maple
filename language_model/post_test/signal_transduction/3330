zzso we report that vascular zzso growth factor A zzso engages the zzso zzso by a previously unknown mechanism that involves three zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso of zzso family zzso zzso zzso engage the zzso zzso zzso zzso via its zzso domain to trigger zzso zzso at a pair of zzso motifs that promotes association with zzso and zzso of zzso Other zzso zzso pathways are independent of zzso zzso with zzso expression or function zzso zzso but not zzso migration of zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso mice respond poorly to zzso vascular zzso or zzso whereas other zzso induce a normal zzso These results zzso the mechanism by which zzso activates zzso and identify previously unappreciated potential therapeutic targets of zzso zzso
