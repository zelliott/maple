zzso zzso zzso zzso adapter zzso zzso zzso is an adapter protein that zzso recruitment of zzso to zzso and zzso signaling zzso We previously generated a library of zzso zzso zzso decoy peptides fused to the zzso segment of the zzso zzso zzso and examined each zzso for the ability to inhibit zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Vogel, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have now expanded this study to test zzso decoy zzso Five zzso zzso zzso (for zzso region zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso was confirmed at the protein zzso select peptides abolished the zzso zzso production measured in cell culture 24 h after a single zzso Two of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso also inhibited zzso production induced by a zzso zzso zzso however, a higher zzso concentration was required to achieve comparable zzso of zzso versus zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were examined for the ability to inhibit zzso zzso induction in zzso zzso with either zzso significantly reduced circulating zzso and zzso in mice following zzso zzso This study has identified novel zzso zzso peptides that block cellular signaling at low zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso peptides supports the view that structurally diverse regions mediate functional interactions of zzso zzso
