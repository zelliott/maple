The major zzso zzso buffer zzso zzso zzso is central to cell fate determination, and thus, associated zzso and regulatory pathways are exquisitely sensitive to a wide range of environmental zzso An imbalance of cellular zzso zzso has emerged as a zzso hallmark of a diverse range of human zzso zzso Despite the central importance of zzso in cellular zzso underlying genetic regulatory pathways remain poorly zzso This report describes the zzso and expression analysis of genes contributing to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso A core zzso zzso 19 genes contributing to the zzso of zzso and its use as both a zzso buffer and a zzso in phase II zzso as well as known zzso regulators were zzso These genes exhibit a high level of sequence conservation with corresponding human, zzso and mouse zzso and were expressed zzso in zzso of adult zzso The zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso were also responsive to the zzso zzso zzso The present evidence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso together with its zzso position as a zzso zzso and lifestyle as a filter zzso constantly exposed to natural marine toxins introduces this species as an important animal model for defining molecular mechanisms that potentially zzso genetic zzso to environmentally associated zzso
