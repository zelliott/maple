zzso zzso is a ubiquitous zzso zzso zzso pathogen causing zzso of zzso aerial zzso and zzso zzso To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of zzso a global approach based on analysis of expressed sequence tags zzso was zzso To get broad zzso coverage, two zzso zzso libraries were developed from zzso grown under high zzso virulent and low zzso zzso zzso A zzso assessment of gene diversity was made from the sequence analyses of the two zzso A total of zzso zzso clones was zzso that corresponded to 220 unique sequence sets or clusters zzso and 805 zzso making up a total of zzso unique genes identified from the two zzso zzso zzso From the total zzso 295 genes zzso exhibited strong similarities with genes in public databases and were zzso into 11 functional zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso have no apparent zzso in publicly available zzso zzso databases and are considered unique zzso We have identified several zzso with potential roles in zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso zzso and zzso drug resistance, zzso degradation, zzso and zzso zzso A zzso table has been formulated based on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Further analysis of zzso might provide insights into zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso AG 4 as well as roles of these genes in development, zzso colonization and ecological adaptation of this important zzso plant zzso
