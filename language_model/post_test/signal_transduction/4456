zzso protein zzso zzso regulates zzso cholesterol, and zzso metabolism in specialized zzso zzso such as muscle, liver, and zzso zzso Agents that activate zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso have beneficial effects on liver zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso growth arrest and zzso zzso zzso As zzso and zzso act in different ways to achieve their effects, our aim was to examine the effects of zzso zzso in zzso zzso with these two agents on zzso zzso We found that zzso levels were markedly zzso by both zzso and zzso in zzso zzso However, although zzso treatment induced cell death, cells treated with zzso did not differ from zzso zzso zzso zzso cell death was paralleled by loss of expression of the zzso decoy zzso zzso whereas zzso increased zzso zzso zzso of zzso into zzso also induced cell death, mimicking the effects of zzso whereas zzso of zzso partially rescued zzso zzso As zzso has previously been shown to promote cell survival through zzso zzso a reporter incorporating binding sites for a downstream target of this zzso was zzso into zzso and was zzso We conclude that although zzso and zzso both activate zzso in zzso zzso zzso rapidly induced cell death, whereas zzso cells remained zzso The finding that zzso increases zzso expression and activates zzso signaling provides a possible zzso explanation for this zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso may zzso zzso therapeutic zzso
