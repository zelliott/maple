In pressure or volume overload, zzso growth of the zzso is associated with zzso zzso a process in which cardiac zzso express smooth muscle zzso zzso The signaling mechanisms that mediate zzso zzso differentiation and zzso expression are not zzso We examined the role of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso expression in zzso using an in zzso model system that applies zzso zzso forces zzso zzso to zzso via zzso zzso zzso Force zzso induced zzso zzso at 10 minutes that was localized to force application sites and required intact zzso zzso Force application induced zzso of zzso zzso zzso minutes) and an early zzso of zzso (5 minutes) that was followed by prolonged zzso zzso These responses were blocked by zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso Force promoted zzso filament assembly at force application sites zzso zzso a process that required zzso zzso and zzso Force application induced nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso zzso but not zzso Nuclear zzso of zzso required zzso zzso and intact zzso zzso Force caused zzso increases of zzso promoter activity that were completely blocked by zzso of cells with zzso zzso or by zzso of zzso zzso or by zzso filament zzso These data indicate that mechanical forces mediate zzso assembly through the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso filament assembly promotes nuclear zzso of zzso and subsequent zzso of the zzso promoter to enhance zzso zzso
