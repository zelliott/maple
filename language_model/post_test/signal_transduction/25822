During zzso zzso and zzso the zzso axis of the dam must continually adapt to ensure the continual and healthy development of zzso The anterior zzso zzso which serves as the zzso interface between the brain and zzso zzso adaptations that contribute to regulation of the zzso zzso Growth factors and their receptors are potential candidates for zzso and zzso factors to participate in the functional and anatomical plasticity of the zzso We examined the involvement of the growth factor zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and its zzso zzso zzso rearranged during zzso zzso in the zzso functional and anatomical plasticity of the anterior zzso zzso We found that variations in both expression and zzso zzso of zzso during gestation and zzso are temporally correlated with changes in zzso zzso zzso We showed that zzso signaling could endorse two different functional roles depending on the zzso zzso At the end of zzso and after zzso zzso was zzso with markers of zzso We found that zzso could therefore act as a zzso dependence zzso capable of inducing zzso in the absence of zzso In addition, we identified the zzso cell as a probable source for zzso zzso and proposed zzso as a potential zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso During all stages zzso we showed that acute application of zzso to zzso slices was able to zzso both positively and zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso our results zzso zzso as a potent zzso factor able to influence zzso physiology during a period of high zzso
