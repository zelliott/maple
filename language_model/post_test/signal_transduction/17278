In zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the devastating rice blast disease, the zzso germ tube tip must sense and respond to a wide array of requisite cues from the host in order to switch from polarized to zzso growth, ultimately forming the zzso infection cell known as the zzso Although the role for zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling in zzso formation was first identified almost two decades ago, little is known about the zzso dynamics of the cascade and how the signal is transmitted through the zzso network during cell growth and zzso In this study, we demonstrate that the late zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso highly dynamic zzso network, scaffold active zzso zzso (a GAP for zzso zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso in the likely absence of zzso anchors during early zzso development in zzso zzso Loss of zzso component zzso and consequently the late zzso function caused a disruption of zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rescued the zzso formation defects associated with zzso deletion in zzso zzso We propose that zzso of key zzso signaling components on dynamic late zzso and/or zzso provides an effective molecular means to zzso and control the zzso zzso and rapid zzso zzso via zzso zzso of zzso signaling zzso changing cellular geometry during zzso development in zzso zzso
