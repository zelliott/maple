zzso receptors zzso are a large family of remarkably versatile membrane proteins that are attractive therapeutic targets because of their involvement in a vast range of normal zzso processes and pathological zzso Upon zzso zzso zzso of zzso mediate signaling to zzso but these zzso have yet to be effectively exploited as drug zzso zzso zzso peptides called zzso target specific zzso zzso of zzso and have recently emerged as effective zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso across the plasma zzso where zzso then specifically zzso signaling of their zzso zzso To date, zzso and related zzso have been shown to specifically zzso the activity of diverse zzso and other membrane zzso including zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso channels, and the zzso zzso This zzso describes recent advances made using zzso technology in targeting diverse zzso and the use of zzso in identifying potential novel drug zzso
