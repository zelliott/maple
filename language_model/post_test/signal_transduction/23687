Bed rest zzso significant loss of leg lean mass in older zzso zzso and tissue inflammation also zzso skeletal muscle loss, but it is unknown whether inflammation is associated to zzso muscle zzso in healthy older zzso We determined if short-term bed rest increases zzso zzso 4 zzso signaling and zzso markers in older adult skeletal muscle biopsy zzso Six healthy, older adults underwent seven consecutive days of bed zzso Muscle zzso zzso zzso were taken after an overnight fast before and at the end of bed zzso zzso zzso expression was measured before and during bed zzso zzso signaling and zzso zzso associated with zzso and zzso and zzso were measured in muscle biopsy samples using Western zzso analysis and zzso Participants lost zzso leg lean mass with bed zzso We found that after bed rest, muscle levels of zzso protein expression and zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso and 15 zzso expression were increased after bed rest zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso and zzso inflammatory zzso were elevated in serum samples following bed rest zzso zzso zzso We conclude that short-term bed rest in older adults modestly increased some zzso and zzso zzso in muscle samples while systemic changes in zzso zzso were mostly zzso zzso of zzso protein content suggests that bed rest in older adults increases the capacity to mount an zzso and perhaps unnecessary, inflammatory response in the presence of specific zzso zzso zzso during acute zzso
