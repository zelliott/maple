zzso cardiac zzso zzso coronary collateral formation and zzso zzso zzso can induce cellular zzso responses, such as synthesis of zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso Both reduce zzso effects to minimize injury or zzso To investigate the mechanism of zzso and proliferation of fetal heart under zzso zzso zzso situation, we used zzso zzso cell culture, and in zzso embryonic hearts as our study zzso zzso showed zzso induced not only the increase of zzso and zzso expression but also the zzso of their upstream regulatory zzso zzso and zzso The relationship between zzso and zzso was further studied by using zzso and zzso inhibitor of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, in the zzso cell culture under zzso We found that the two zzso not only blocked their own signal pathway, but also inhibited each zzso The observations revealed when fetal heart under zzso that zzso and zzso pathways maybe involve in cell proliferation and zzso to minimize injury or damage, whereas the complex zzso between the two pathways remains zzso
