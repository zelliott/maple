The zzso of zzso was investigated in primary cultures of zzso The two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso being more zzso than zzso Treatment of the zzso with 150 zzso zzso zzso an zzso of protein zzso C induced a transient increase in the level of zzso of zzso but not zzso This effect was zzso after 15 zzso of zzso treatment and was maintained for up to 3 zzso After 22 h of treatment with zzso which zzso protein zzso C, zzso zzso was returned to the zzso zzso Further addition of zzso to the zzso treated cells did not cause an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso to zzso indicated that while the addition of zzso induced the formation of zzso zzso zzso in some zzso in most zzso no major changes in the intermediate filament network were zzso zzso for zzso showed that zzso zzso were rapidly reorganized after the treatment and a loss of stress zzso were zzso We propose that zzso is an in zzso zzso for protein zzso C and that the specific zzso of zzso plays a role in protein zzso C signal zzso
