zzso mechanisms underlying zzso retinal dysfunction are not fully zzso The aim of the present study was to show the relationship of the zzso system zzso with the synaptic zzso protein zzso and zzso activity in the diabetic zzso 

zzso mice with zzso diabetes were treated with the zzso II type 1 zzso zzso blocker zzso or zzso and retinal function was analyzed by zzso zzso production of the zzso components and zzso of zzso zzso regulated zzso were examined by zzso zzso zzso and protein levels of zzso were measured by quantitative zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso levels were also evaluated using zzso zzso zzso zzso cells cultured with or without the zzso of zzso signaling or the zzso system zzso 

zzso of diabetes led to a significant increase in retinal production of zzso II and zzso together with zzso zzso in the downstream of zzso zzso blockade significantly reversed zzso zzso changes and reduction of zzso zzso but not zzso levels in the diabetic zzso In agreement with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso in zzso application of zzso II to zzso zzso cells caused the zzso degradation of zzso protein via zzso which proved to be induced by zzso zzso 

These data indicate the first molecular evidence of the zzso zzso degradation and zzso dysfunction in the diabetic zzso suggesting the possibility of the zzso blockade as a novel zzso treatment for diabetic zzso
