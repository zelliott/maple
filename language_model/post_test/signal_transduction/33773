zzso and zzso play an important role in many events in the nervous system, ranging from neural zzso to zzso As part of the zzso control of these zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso mediates the zzso of zzso or zzso with high affinity into zzso zzso This zzso represents a relatively recently characterized zzso pump that is highly expressed in nervous zzso but information on its involvement in neural maturation is currently zzso In this study, we have analyzed the expression and distribution of the zzso pump in mouse brain during zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso showed that zzso is particularly highly expressed at nearly constant levels during this entire period of development in cortex, zzso and zzso In spite of the apparently unchanged expression levels, functional zzso showed that zzso zzso activity increased with the stage of development in these zzso zzso studies pointed to zzso zzso in zzso stacks of the zzso and the initial part of primary zzso trunk in main zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the earliest zzso zzso This suggests a potential role in zzso signaling and in zzso zzso processes involved in zzso growth and in functional maturation of the mouse nervous zzso
