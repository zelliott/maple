zzso of zzso is essential for zzso zzso immune responses and rescuing B cells from zzso Many of the effects of zzso are believed to be achieved through altered gene zzso In addition to zzso a known zzso zzso zzso we identified a related zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso of a zzso inhibitor of zzso abolished zzso zzso of both the zzso and zzso genes and also eliminated the ability of zzso to rescue zzso cell zzso Within the upstream promoter region of zzso a potential zzso sequence was found to support zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, expression of zzso levels of zzso protected B cells from zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso Thus, our results suggest that zzso cell survival proceeds through zzso zzso of zzso family zzso
