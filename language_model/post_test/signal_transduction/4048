The zzso region of zzso a zzso death factor zzso shares a limited zzso with zzso an zzso protein in zzso zzso of either the zzso zzso region zzso or of zzso in zzso cells caused cell zzso The death process induced by zzso or zzso was inhibited by zzso or zzso suggesting that its death process is zzso by zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso specific zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, inhibited the zzso death of zzso zzso However, the cell death induced by zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso activity that zzso recognizes the zzso sequence gradually increased in the zzso fraction of the zzso cells, whereas the zzso zzso zzso activity recognizing the zzso sequence was observed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso characterization of the zzso indicated that there are at least three distinct zzso zzso in zzso cells, which are zzso activated by zzso and zzso The conservation of the zzso signaling zzso in zzso cells, which is distinct from that for zzso may indicate that cell death in zzso is controlled not only by the zzso suicide zzso but also by a zzso killer zzso
