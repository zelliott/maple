zzso checkpoints restrain the onset of zzso zzso when DNA is incompletely zzso or zzso These checkpoints are zzso between the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In both types of organisms, the zzso caffeine zzso the synthesis zzso checkpoint that couples zzso to completion of DNA S zzso The molecular target of caffeine was sought in zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso two protein zzso that enforce the zzso checkpoint triggered by zzso zzso did not inhibit these zzso in zzso but did inhibit zzso a zzso that regulates zzso and zzso In accordance with this finding, caffeine also overrode the zzso DNA damage checkpoint that requires zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso expressed at zzso zzso a finding that supports the hypothesis that zzso is involved in direct zzso of zzso
