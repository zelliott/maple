zzso injury is a central finding in pulmonary disease and is accompanied by disruption of zzso barrier function, leading to pulmonary zzso and zzso Injured zzso cells lose their properties and gain zzso zzso a zzso switch that contributes to lung zzso after zzso Here we studied bone zzso protein zzso zzso and, in particular, the role of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in injured lung zzso Increased zzso activity, reflected by zzso of the zzso zzso is detected after injury of lung zzso in zzso and in zzso Two members of the zzso family, zzso and zzso have opposing zzso zzso is zzso after zzso injury and causes zzso dysfunction and zzso zzso by the zzso zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso expression is decreased following injury, which in turn zzso zzso integrity, characterized by reduction of zzso and zzso leakage in zzso and in zzso High levels of zzso antagonized zzso zzso and prevented zzso decrease of zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso restores zzso zzso Supporting this notion, pharmacological zzso of zzso zzso by zzso prevented reduction of zzso and disruption of zzso barrier zzso zzso of excessive zzso zzso could be a new approach to restore zzso integrity and prevent disruption of zzso barrier function after lung zzso
