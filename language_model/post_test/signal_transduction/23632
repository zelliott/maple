This study examined the correlation of the expression of zzso zzso a novel member of zzso zzso family, with zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso B zzso pathways in psoriasis zzso skin zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected in the skin zzso of 38 psoriasis patients and 17 healthy control subjects by real-time quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and Western zzso The zzso expression levels were compared between the psoriasis group and the control zzso A correlation analysis between zzso proteins was performed in the psoriasis zzso zzso showed that the expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the psoriasis group were significantly higher than those in the control group zzso In the psoriasis group, the zzso zzso expression was positively correlated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression zzso A significant positive correlation was also found between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression zzso It was concluded that the increased zzso expression is correlated with zzso zzso and zzso pathways in psoriasis zzso skin zzso All the three factors may be jointly involved in the zzso and local inflammatory response of zzso
