We investigated the role of the zzso oxide zzso zzso in setting thresholds for failure and recovery during zzso stress of the swimming central pattern generator of immobilized zzso zzso zzso zzso We recorded swimming motor patterns induced by tail skin stimulation zzso (1 zzso current zzso or by bath application of 50 zzso zzso zzso rhythm frequency increased in a linear manner with increasing zzso In the presence of the NO donor zzso zzso recovery from zzso failure was greatly slowed, often taking longer than the duration of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso using zzso or zzso zzso decreased the duration of zzso swim episodes; zzso decreased the temperature threshold for zzso circuit zzso zzso decreased the temperature at which the circuit zzso and zzso increased the time taken to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso using the NO scavenger zzso the zzso oxide zzso zzso inhibitor zzso or the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso had the opposite zzso zzso rhythms were more resistant to zzso failure than zzso swim episodes, but the effects of zzso on the temperature sensitivity of swimming evoked by zzso were similar to those on zzso zzso suggesting that drug effects occur on central zzso networks rather than sensory zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso is involved in setting the threshold temperatures for zzso failure and subsequent recovery of zzso swimming in zzso and we suggest that this is part of a variable response to prevent zzso during zzso stress under different environmental zzso
