Low birth weight in humans is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular zzso zzso with heart failure have a reduced zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the zzso response to the zzso zzso zzso and to identify molecular deficiencies that may be zzso of cardiac failure in a zzso weight zzso model that develops insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in zzso zzso rats were fed a control or a zzso zzso diet throughout pregnancy and zzso The resting heart rate and blood pressure of the zzso male offspring of these zzso termed zzso and zzso groups, respectively, and their responses to zzso zzso infusion were monitored by zzso The protein expression of zzso signaling components was also measured by Western zzso zzso zzso heart rate was increased in LP offspring zzso although mean zzso pressure was comparable with zzso zzso effects of zzso were blunted in LP offspring with significant delays to zzso response zzso a shorter duration of response zzso and a delayed return to baseline zzso at the lower dose zzso zzso At the higher dose zzso zzso zzso zzso response was blunted zzso but quicker zzso In heart tissue of LP zzso zzso zzso expression was reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso and both zzso and zzso G protein levels remained zzso whereas zzso levels were higher zzso Finally, insulin zzso expression was reduced in LP offspring zzso LP offspring have reduced zzso responsiveness and attenuated zzso and insulin zzso suggesting that zzso zzso alters heart failure zzso
