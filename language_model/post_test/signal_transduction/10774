zzso a zzso 2 zzso has zzso and therapeutic activities toward lung cancer and other zzso zzso zzso can induce zzso in various cancer cell lines through a mechanism that is independent of its zzso 2 zzso activity but is otherwise largely zzso We investigated the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso 

All experiments were conducted in human zzso lung zzso zzso cell zzso results in zzso and zzso cells were zzso Cell survival was assessed with a zzso B zzso zzso was assessed by DNA fragmentation with an zzso zzso zzso by terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and by western zzso analysis of zzso zzso Death zzso gene and protein expression was detected by northern and western zzso analysis, zzso Gene zzso was achieved with small interfering zzso zzso zzso 

zzso treatment decreased cell survival, activated zzso zzso and increased DNA zzso all of which were zzso when zzso 8 expression was silenced with zzso 8 zzso zzso treatment induced the expression of death zzso particularly that of zzso zzso of a dominant negative zzso death domain zzso but not of zzso reduced the level of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso expression by zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso 8 zzso and zzso Combination treatment with zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso induced additional zzso For example, survival of zzso cells was decreased with 50 zzso zzso alone by zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso with TRAIL alone by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso but with their combination by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso a greater than additive zzso 

zzso appears to induce zzso in human zzso through the zzso death zzso zzso
