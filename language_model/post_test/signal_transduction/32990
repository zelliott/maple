The induction of immunity genes in zzso has been proposed to be dependent on zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso Here we provide genetic evidence that zzso is required for the induction of only a subset of zzso zzso zzso The results show that the presence of zzso without zzso is sufficient to mediate the induction of zzso and zzso We also demonstrate that zzso is a downstream component of the Toll signaling zzso in zzso the zzso zzso These results reveal that individual members of the zzso family in zzso have distinct roles in immunity and zzso
