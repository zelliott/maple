zzso zzso is a zzso factor involved in zzso cell zzso Along with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso belongs to the family of zzso binding proteins that are implicated in control of growth and differentiation of several cell lineages in inflammation and stress zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso binds DNA as a zzso with other zzso family members such as zzso zzso zzso and the zzso family protein zzso In this study, we define the consensus binding sites for zzso zzso and zzso zzso We show that the activated zzso zzso promotes interaction of the zzso zzso with its zzso DNA binding site via interaction with zzso zzso interaction is enhanced by zzso of zzso at zzso acid 75 and results in increased DNA binding compared with the zzso zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso We suggest that interaction of the activated zzso zzso and zzso may be important in selective zzso of a subset of zzso zzso
