zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso cell zzso molecules that regulate cell differentiation and tissue zzso zzso junction formation and subsequent zzso signaling is initiated by the assembly of zzso zzso clusters of zzso molecules on juxtaposed zzso However, the structural and zzso details of signaling cluster formation remain zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso in complex with its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso interface reveals a zzso specific zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso assemble into a zzso with a core zzso zzso each zzso zzso binding one zzso zzso zzso zzso that disrupt the zzso interface limit both zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso in primary zzso zzso Our data suggest a zzso zzso zzso mechanism for cell zzso and signaling by the zzso complex and provide structural insights into how the zzso family of zzso zzso
