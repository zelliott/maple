zzso zzso signaling is essential for zzso and zzso zzso In zzso feedback zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso is required to restrict zzso signaling during zzso By contrast, zzso zzso is zzso for early zzso patterning in zzso zzso to zzso are two additional zzso zzso that are induced by zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Although zzso functions zzso with zzso to restrict zzso signaling in the developing nervous system, a role for zzso remains zzso Data presented here define a novel role for zzso as a zzso localized zzso zzso zzso While zzso is zzso for normal zzso neural zzso combined removal of zzso and zzso antagonism produces a significant expansion of zzso zzso neural zzso zzso complete loss of zzso zzso and zzso zzso results in zzso zzso of zzso cell fates throughout the neural tube, reflecting zzso zzso zzso zzso Overall, these data reveal an essential role for zzso feedback zzso of zzso zzso signaling governed collectively by zzso zzso and zzso
