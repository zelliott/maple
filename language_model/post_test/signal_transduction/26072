We identified a zzso zzso zzso as an active compound isolated from the leaves of zzso zzso In the present study, the zzso effects and underlying mechanisms of zzso were examined using zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso To determine the effects of zzso in zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression were analyzed by zzso and zzso Nuclear zzso zzso zzso and its upstream signaling zzso were also investigated using a zzso reporter zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso zzso and zzso To verify the effects of zzso in zzso the zzso expression levels of zzso and zzso were evaluated in isolated mouse zzso zzso by quantitative real-time zzso and the production of tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were assessed in serum samples from mice using a zzso zzso zzso with zzso reduced zzso zzso and zzso zzso thereby zzso zzso oxide zzso and zzso zzso production, zzso In addition, an zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso was shown by the recovery of zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso degradation after blocking the transforming growth zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso signaling zzso In mouse models, zzso zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso and zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso inflammatory pathways through the zzso of zzso complex zzso Our findings demonstrating the zzso effects of zzso in zzso and in zzso will aid in understanding the pharmacology and mode of action of zzso
