The signaling zzso of zzso growth zzso zzso is known to regulate longevity as well as resistance to zzso stress in the zzso zzso zzso This regulatory process involves the activity of zzso a zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso in components of this zzso have been shown to extend the lifespan in organisms ranging from zzso to mice, zzso of zzso has been reported to promote proliferation and survival of zzso zzso Here we show that zzso activity increases along with cellular zzso and that zzso of zzso extends the lifespan of primary cultured human zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso promotes zzso arrest of cell growth via a zzso pathway, and zzso of zzso zzso factor zzso by zzso is essential for this growth arrest to zzso zzso influences zzso activity by regulating the level of zzso oxygen zzso These findings reveal a novel role of zzso in regulating the cellular lifespan and suggest that the mechanism of longevity is zzso in primary cultured human cells and that zzso zzso may be involved in vascular zzso
