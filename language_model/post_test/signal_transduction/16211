zzso underlying synergistic liver injury caused by alcohol and obesity are not zzso We have produced a mouse model of synergistic zzso by zzso the natural history of the zzso seen in patients for zzso zzso 

zzso obesity was induced in mice by zzso zzso in calories using zzso zzso of high fat zzso Alcohol zzso or high zzso was then zzso to determine its zzso 

zzso obesity plus alcohol intake causes synergistic zzso in an alcohol zzso zzso A heightened zzso is observed when a high alcohol dose zzso is used, resulting in plasma zzso reaching zzso severe zzso with zzso fibrosis, marked zzso zzso zzso a zzso induction of zzso and intensified zzso stress in the zzso zzso expression of genes for zzso zzso and metabolism are significantly zzso and zzso zzso level is zzso zzso zzso stress evident by elevated zzso zzso and zzso is accompanied by zzso Despite increased zzso zzso zzso their activities are decreased in a zzso zzso Neither increased zzso zzso nor zzso positive zzso are found, suggesting a shift of zzso to zzso Surprisingly, the zzso mice have increased plasma zzso and zzso zzso but zzso resistance is shown downstream of zzso 

zzso stress zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance, and zzso zzso and zzso stress zzso potential mechanisms for synergistic zzso caused by moderate obesity and zzso
