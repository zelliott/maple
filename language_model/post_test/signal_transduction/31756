zzso of circulating zzso growth factor 23 zzso are associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes and progression of zzso failure in chronic kidney disease zzso Efforts to identify gene products whose zzso is directly regulated by zzso stimulation of zzso growth factor receptors zzso complexes in the kidney is zzso by both systemic zzso in zzso zzso and vitamin D metabolism and intrinsic zzso caused by the underlying zzso pathology in zzso To identify zzso responsive genes in the kidney that might explain the association between zzso and adverse outcomes in zzso we performed comparative zzso wide analysis of gene expression profiles in the kidney of the zzso 4 alpha 3 zzso mice zzso model of progressive kidney disease with kidney expression profiles of zzso zzso and zzso transgenic mouse models of elevated zzso The different complement of potentially zzso factors in these models allowed us to identify genes that are directly targeted by zzso This analysis found that zzso an zzso hormone and zzso zzso was decreased by zzso We also identified additional zzso transcripts and zzso of networks associated with zzso damage and chronic zzso including zzso 2 zzso transforming growth factor beta zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso signaling zzso Finally, we found that zzso suppresses zzso zzso 2 zzso expression in the zzso thereby providing a zzso for zzso regulation of the zzso zzso These gene products provide a possible zzso links between elevated zzso and pathways responsible for zzso failure progression and cardiovascular zzso
