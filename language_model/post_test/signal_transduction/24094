Although protein zzso zzso zzso signaling has been implicated in the late phase of zzso zzso zzso it is unknown whether zzso signaling is necessary for the development of zzso oxide zzso zzso late zzso Thus conscious rabbits underwent a sequence of six zzso coronary zzso zzso zzso zzso cycles followed by a zzso recovery period of zzso for 3 consecutive days zzso 1, 2, and zzso On day 0 (24 h before the 6 zzso cycles on day 1), rabbits received no treatment zzso the NO donor zzso zzso zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso or zzso plus zzso zzso + zzso In control rabbits zzso zzso zzso the six zzso cycles on day 1 resulted in delayed functional recovery, indicating severe zzso zzso In rabbits zzso with zzso zzso zzso 5) on day 1, zzso stunning caused by the six zzso cycles on day 1 was markedly zzso with a significant reduction ( approximately zzso in the total deficit of wall zzso zzso compared with controls, indicating that zzso induced a late PC effect against zzso However, in rabbits zzso with zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso the total deficit of zzso was significantly greater than that in rabbits treated with zzso alone and was similar to that in controls, indicating that zzso prevented the development of zzso late zzso In rabbits zzso with zzso on day 0 zzso zzso zzso the total deficit of zzso was similar to that in controls, indicating that zzso does not affect zzso stunning in zzso We conclude that a zzso signaling mechanism is necessary for the development of NO zzso late PC against zzso stunning in conscious zzso
