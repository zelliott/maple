The zzso of zzso G proteins was investigated by measurement of the expression of zzso in the zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso representing stages of increasing zzso and compared with zzso zzso and zzso contained approximately equal amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso alpha zzso zzso was accompanied by zzso zzso of zzso for zzso alpha and disappearance of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the long form of zzso alpha protein zzso zzso and an increase in zzso zzso formation, and zzso zzso of zzso alpha zzso and zzso alpha protein and appearance of zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso and stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha protein was absent in the zzso despite weak expression of zzso alpha zzso in zzso and relatively high levels of zzso alpha zzso and zzso alpha protein in zzso These findings reveal major changes in G zzso signal zzso during zzso and indicate that zzso alpha couples the zzso zzso to zzso C zzso
