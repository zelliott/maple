The effect and possible mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine, zzso on the zzso zzso signaling zzso in drug-resistant human zzso leukemia zzso cells have been investigated in this current zzso 

zzso cells were treated by 20, 40, 80 zzso zzso followed by cell cycle analysis at zzso The zzso expression level of the zzso related zzso zzso and bad, were measured by zzso on cells treated with 80 zzso zzso at 12, 24 and zzso Western zzso was performed to detect the changes in the expression of the proteins related to zzso cell zzso and the signaling zzso before and after zzso treatment, including zzso zzso zzso zzso 3, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso peak of zzso cells appeared 24 h after 20 zzso zzso treatment, and the ratio increased as zzso concentration zzso Cell cycle analysis showed zzso zzso phase cells 24 h after zzso treatment compared to zzso in the control zzso zzso treated with 80 zzso zzso displayed a trend in decreasing of zzso zzso expression over zzso zzso level of the zzso and zzso proteins decreased significantly while that of the zzso zzso and Bad proteins gradually zzso No significant difference in zzso expression was observed between treated and the control zzso However, the expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso decreased significantly in a zzso zzso 

We conclude that zzso may induce zzso cell zzso through the zzso signaling zzso
