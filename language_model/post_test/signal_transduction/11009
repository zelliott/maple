Resistance to tuberculosis zzso is dependent on the induction of zzso zzso zzso T cells capable of expressing zzso Generation of these T cells is dependent upon zzso yet other zzso have also been implicated in this zzso One such zzso zzso zzso differentiation of zzso T cells toward an zzso zzso by zzso the zzso factor zzso and promoting expression of the zzso chain allowing T cells to respond to zzso We show that the components of zzso are induced during zzso and that the absence of zzso signaling results in an altered disease zzso In the absence of the zzso there is reduced bacterial burden and an increased zzso character to the zzso zzso Although the number of zzso zzso zzso cells is unaffected by the absence of the zzso there is a significant decrease in the level of zzso for zzso and zzso within the lungs of infected zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells in the lungs of zzso also produce less zzso protein per zzso The data show that expression of zzso during zzso is zzso to the control of bacteria and that although it does not affect the number of cells capable of producing zzso it does reduce the ability of zzso T cells to produce large amounts of zzso Because zzso is zzso to the survival of zzso T cells, we zzso that the reduced zzso within the zzso lung is responsible for the increased zzso of zzso within the zzso zzso
