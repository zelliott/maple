The protein zzso B zzso target of zzso zzso signaling zzso is thought to play a critical role in the regulation of protein synthesis and skeletal muscle zzso The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of voluntary wheel running on the zzso signaling zzso in muscles from aged mice zzso zzso The total levels of zzso were zzso higher in zzso muscles from aged mice subjected to wheel running compared to aged sedentary mice zzso zzso zzso on zzso was zzso higher in zzso muscles from aged mice subjected to wheel running compared to aged sedentary mice zzso The total abundance of zzso was 50% higher in zzso muscles from wheel running mice compared to aged controls zzso Three months of wheel running did not alter the total amount of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso as assessed by zzso incorporation into protein was significantly higher in zzso muscles from aged mice subjected to wheel running compared to aged sedentary mice zzso These findings indicate the zzso exercise training may zzso the age-related decline in protein zzso a process that appears to be due, in part, to increases in zzso and zzso
