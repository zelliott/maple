zzso zzso excess results in a zzso increase in the zzso number in zzso It is unknown whether this response occurs in zzso zzso including zzso a model for zzso and chemical zzso We investigated the response of zzso zzso to zzso excess and the underlying mechanisms by zzso transgenic zzso larvae in solutions of different zzso zzso The number of zzso rapidly increases after persistent, but not zzso exposure to zzso or a zzso zzso The response to zzso but not the zzso diet, required zzso target of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso signaling in zzso blocked the response to the zzso diet, but not to zzso zzso tracing and marker expression analyses indicated that the new zzso were not from zzso but arose through differentiation of zzso precursor zzso On the basis of transgenic zzso we identified two groups of newly formed zzso one with zzso promoter activity and the other with zzso promoter zzso Thus, zzso excess in zzso zzso a rapid increase in zzso though differentiation of two zzso of zzso precursor zzso This occurs through different mechanisms depending on the zzso type and likely involves zzso signaling between the differentiated zzso and the precursor zzso
