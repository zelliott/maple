zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso does not seek a partner for zzso Here, we focused on the zzso of putative zzso and zzso genes during sexual development in zzso zzso zzso of two zzso precursor genes zzso and zzso and their zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso were transcribed during sexual zzso The expression of these genes was controlled by the zzso zzso locus and a zzso zzso zzso but not in a zzso zzso zzso gene deletion and subsequent zzso generated zzso zzso strains lacking these putative zzso genes in various combinations (from single to quadruple zzso All zzso zzso deletion strains were similar to the zzso zzso in both zzso and female fertility and other zzso Sometimes, the deletions including zzso caused increased numbers of immature zzso Taken together, it is clear that these putative zzso play a zzso role in the sexual development of zzso zzso
