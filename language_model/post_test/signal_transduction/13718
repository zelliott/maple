zzso is one of the most basic biological zzso In zzso tens of species are involved in many zzso reactions with times scales of widely differing orders of zzso By the law of mass action, the process is zzso described with a large and stiff system of zzso zzso differential zzso The goal of this work is to simplify such systems of zzso with the zzso zzso equilibrium zzso zzso In doing so, we propose a general framework of the zzso method together with some conditions, under which the zzso method can be justified zzso The main condition is the principle of detailed balance for fast reactions as a whole and the framework provides some meaningful physical insights of the full chemical zzso With the justified method as a zzso we simplify the zzso zzso model due to zzso et zzso zzso under the empirical assumption that nine reactions zzso can be well regarded as relatively zzso This paper reports our zzso together with zzso results which confirm the reliability of both our simplified model and the empirical zzso
