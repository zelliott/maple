In gene network zzso from time series zzso data, dynamic models such as differential equations and dynamic zzso networks assume that the network structure is stable through all time points, while the real network might changes its structure depending on time, affection of some shocks and so zzso If the true network structure underlying the data changes at certain points, the fitting of the usual dynamic linear models fails to estimate the structure of gene network and we cannot obtain efficient information from zzso To solve this problem, we propose a dynamic linear model with zzso switching for zzso zzso gene network structure from time series gene expression zzso Using our proposed method, the network structure between genes and its change points are automatically zzso We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through the analysis of zzso zzso cell cycle time series zzso
