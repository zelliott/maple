Recent studies have revealed a new class of zzso zzso the zzso sensors, which are able to turn on or off cellular signal zzso pathways in response to environmental zzso One of these zzso is the zzso zzso from zzso coli zzso This protein is composed of an zzso zzso zzso domain and a zzso functional zzso zzso is an zzso formed from the names of the zzso period clock protein zzso zzso zzso hydrocarbon zzso nuclear zzso zzso and zzso single-minded protein zzso The zzso zzso in its zzso domain can act as a sensor of the cellular zzso state that regulates the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The crystal structures of its zzso zzso domain have helped clarify how the zzso zzso structural changes initiate zzso signal zzso Here, we review recent findings on the zzso relationships of zzso
