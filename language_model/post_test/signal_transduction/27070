Recently, a human zzso leukemia cell line, zzso was established from an zzso leukemia zzso zzso cells have the zzso features of zzso under normal culture conditions, and they can be induced to differentiate into zzso zzso cells but not into other lineage cells under several culture conditions and are therefore considered to be committed precursors of zzso Furthermore, zzso cells can also be induced to differentiate functionally to show zzso zzso influx and zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso cells show zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso and zzso on their cell zzso The zzso cells may provide new information on some aspects of the signal zzso mechanisms involved in the zzso differentiation and zzso of zzso
