Monitoring zzso acids as signal molecules in combination with a zzso acid synthesis marker and the zzso regulator zzso growth factor 19 zzso this study addresses significant zzso zzso The efficacy of the different pathways to regulate zzso acid synthesis through short zzso partner zzso dependent zzso zzso in liver, and zzso independent zzso via zzso is zzso zzso changes of the zzso acid profile during an oral zzso tolerance test zzso were investigated in 73 zzso 15 zzso acid species including zzso and zzso forms were zzso determined with zzso in serum samples collected at three time points during the zzso All zzso zzso acid species showed the same time course, a significant increase at 60 zzso after the zzso intake and an zzso at 120 zzso In contrast, a consistent decline of all zzso zzso acids was zzso zzso an early zzso acid synthesis marker, showed an inverse response with a significant decrease at 60 zzso which proves the efficient and rapid zzso of zzso via zzso zzso through zzso acid zzso zzso higher levels of zzso were observed 120 zzso after zzso intake and 60 zzso after zzso acid zzso
