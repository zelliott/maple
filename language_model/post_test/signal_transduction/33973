zzso A zzso radiation represents more than zzso of the zzso spectrum reaching Earth's zzso Exposure to zzso light, especially the UVA part, zzso the formation of zzso states of cellular zzso with subsequent generation of zzso oxygen species zzso leading to damages to membrane zzso proteins and zzso zzso Although zzso unlike zzso and zzso is poorly absorbed by DNA, it zzso cell cycle zzso especially during zzso In the present study, we examined the role of the DNA damage checkpoint response in zzso zzso of DNA zzso We provide evidence that UVA delays zzso in a dose dependent manner and that zzso zzso cells accumulate in zzso We show that upon UVA zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathways are zzso and that zzso zzso is zzso dependent while zzso zzso is zzso zzso To assess for a role of these pathways in zzso zzso of DNA zzso we investigated zzso cell cycle progression of zzso zzso zzso cells by flow zzso and zzso incorporation of zzso as a marker of DNA zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and deficient zzso We demonstrate that none of these pathways is required to delay DNA replication in response to zzso thus ruling out a role of the zzso zzso checkpoint response in this zzso On the contrary, scavenging of zzso zzso oxygen species zzso by the zzso zzso or depletion of vitamins during UVA exposure significantly restores DNA zzso We propose that zzso of DNA replication is due to impaired replication fork zzso rather as a consequence of zzso zzso damage to protein than to zzso
