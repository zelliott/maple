zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso and can suppress its zzso of T cell factor 4 zzso in prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso by zzso its binding to the zzso zzso coli gene product and subsequent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Higher zzso expression in primary zzso is correlated with disease zzso and this study found that zzso expression was markedly increased in zzso zzso zzso with this result, increased expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells strongly accelerated tumor growth in zzso in zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells enhanced zzso zzso activity, as assessed using zzso reporter zzso and increased expression of zzso zzso and zzso However, in contrast to results in cells with intact zzso and active zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso cells, which are zzso zzso did not increase zzso Instead, zzso expression markedly inhibited the zzso interaction with zzso and zzso zzso the ability of zzso to antagonize zzso binding and zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso can suppress zzso zzso that the zzso interaction can be regulated by zzso and that zzso of this interaction can enhance zzso signaling and contribute to aggressive biological behavior in zzso
