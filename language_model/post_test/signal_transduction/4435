zzso or inflammatory eye disease, is a common zzso manifestation of many systemic zzso diseases involving the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an effective therapy in several zzso diseases; yet, few studies have investigated the extent to which zzso zzso or zzso influences the onset and/or severity of zzso 

To seek possible links between arthritis and zzso zzso related to zzso zzso 

The eyes of zzso zzso mice were monitored zzso and by zzso zzso to determine if zzso developed along with the expected spontaneous arthritis in zzso and zzso zzso levels of zzso and its negative regulators zzso zzso zzso and single zzso zzso zzso in eye and joint zzso were zzso zzso in zzso induced by zzso injection of zzso zzso in mice lacking zzso or zzso were zzso 

zzso in zzso zzso to spontaneous arthritis, which is exacerbated by previous systemic zzso zzso The eye, however, does not develop inflammatory disease despite the progressive arthritis or zzso zzso zzso expression patterns for zzso and negative regulators of zzso activity were observed that appear to predict predisposition to inflammation in each location in zzso knockout zzso The eye is extremely sensitive to locally administered zzso and zzso zzso markedly zzso the resulting zzso 

This study demonstrates that zzso plays an important role in suppressing local responses in eyes injected with zzso and that there is zzso between zzso eyes and zzso in the extent to which zzso protects against spontaneous zzso
