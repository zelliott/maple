zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso is a common event in human tumor zzso zzso signaling has also been implicated in maintaining a variety of adult and embryonic stem cells by imposing a restraint to zzso To understand the effect of zzso signaling on the differentiation of zzso cells, we used mouse zzso zzso cells as a zzso The zzso cells can be differentiated into visceral zzso zzso resembling zzso zzso zzso zzso We performed comparative gene expression analysis on zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells and confirmed that markers of zzso and zzso zzso were induced upon zzso The induction of these markers by zzso acid was reduced in the presence of zzso although zzso alone did not change their zzso This suggests that zzso signaling inhibited the differentiation of zzso cells by altering gene zzso This zzso was also reflected in the zzso of the zzso cells as their zzso polarity was disrupted by inclusion of zzso during zzso These results support a model in which zzso zzso the expression of genes required for normal terminal differentiation of the stem zzso However, it follows that zzso cells must escape from zzso signaling to attain the differentiated zzso zzso we found that differentiated zzso cells no longer responded to zzso and that a blockade in zzso signaling occurred upstream of zzso zzso with this, zzso negative regulators, such as zzso and zzso were induced upon the differentiation of zzso zzso We propose that a similar system to produce zzso zzso regulates zzso of certain stem cell compartments in zzso
