zzso zzso receptors for the zzso zzso are known to zzso transforming growth zzso zzso cell zzso However, the interplay between zzso and zzso zzso regulated by zzso is not clearly zzso This study focuses on the zzso of the regulatory zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso at the zzso site of zzso by zzso was impaired in the zzso zzso However, the zzso were zzso zzso at the zzso region in a zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the expression of a zzso zzso that lacks the zzso sites in the zzso region, restored the zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso the zzso signals through the altered zzso of the zzso
