Cellular processes are governed by complex networks of interacting genes and zzso zzso molecular biologists attempt to describe these processes via mathematical models by writing zzso reaction zzso zzso are building increasingly larger and complex mathematical models to describe these cellular zzso making model evaluation a time consuming and difficult zzso The authors describe an zzso process for model evaluation and a software system that zzso this zzso The software is adaptable to many types of models and is freely available along with all needed data zzso The cell cycle control system for budding zzso is known in fine detail and constrained by more than 100 zzso observations in zzso zzso As an example, the authors apply their process to a model of cell cycle control in budding zzso containing dozens of regulatory equations and explaining nearly all of the known zzso zzso
