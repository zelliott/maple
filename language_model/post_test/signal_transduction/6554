zzso is a member of the zzso family of protein zzso of zzso reorganization and cell zzso In this report, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso serum response element zzso zzso through serum response zzso A zzso zzso lacking the zzso region did not induce zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was blocked by exposure of cells to zzso A, or zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso lies downstream of zzso Similar deletion of the zzso domain of zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso acts in relation to zzso as zzso acts in relation to zzso zzso zzso did not activate zzso
