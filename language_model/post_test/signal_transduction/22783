zzso provide critical signals that regulate both the number and differentiation of zzso In addition, zzso are attracted to and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is thought to be one of the many potential zzso zzso signals, however, the multiple roles of zzso have made experimental tests of these signals difficult in zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso migrate to zzso but fail to zzso around zzso This study shows that in the similar but larger zzso zzso zzso zzso is likely to mediate one step in the close interaction between zzso and zzso zzso beads attract zzso in the zzso and compete with zzso for their resident, zzso zzso In addition, bath applied zzso causes mature zzso zzso which normally zzso zzso zzso to round zzso zzso activates the product of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and probably interferes with the normal function of an zzso zzso zzso zzso It is proposed that insect zzso provide a critical zzso restricted zzso signal that zzso zzso to zzso zzso
