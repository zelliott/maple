A major aim of systems biology is the study of the zzso found within and between large biological data zzso Here we describe one systems biology method, in which the tools of network analysis and discrete dynamic zzso modeling are used to develop zzso models of cellular signaling in cases where detailed zzso and kinetic information regarding the propagation of the signal through the system is zzso This approach is also zzso to data sets derived from some other types of biological systems, such as zzso zzso regulation of gene expression during the control of zzso fate, or host defense responses following pathogen attack, and is equally zzso to plant and zzso zzso The method also allows prediction of how elimination of one or more individual signaling components will affect the ultimate outcome, thus allowing the researcher to model the effects of genetic knockout or pharmacological zzso The method also serves as a starting point from which more quantitative models can be developed as additional information becomes zzso
