It has been well established that zzso zzso a zzso zzso regulates the viability of zzso zzso However, the signaling zzso governed by the binding of zzso to the cell membrane is not zzso As a first step towards the zzso of zzso signaling events leading to a reduced viability of zzso zzso B cells, we tried to characterize the initial events induced by the binding of zzso to its zzso This characterization was performed in zzso cells, a zzso zzso cell line sensitive to zzso The results were as zzso zzso when zzso cell membrane zzso were affinity bound to immobilized zzso and zzso by competition, the zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in the zzso highlighting the role of zzso as a zzso of zzso zzso the zzso activity of cell zzso diminished after incubation with zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that the zzso zzso Lyn was zzso in cells that have been cultured in medium containing 700 zzso zzso and zzso that the ratio between two zzso of Lyn was modified during the treatment with zzso The regulation of Lyn therefore seems to be a key event in the action of zzso
