Muscle zzso contributes to morbidity and mortality in aging and chronic disease, emphasizing the need to gain understanding of the mechanisms involved in muscle zzso and zzso We hypothesized that the magnitude of muscle regrowth during recovery from zzso determines whether zzso zzso and zzso differentiation are required and that zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling differs between regrowth zzso To address this hypothesis we subjected mice to zzso suspension zzso to induce zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso muscle regrowth was complete after 14 days and involved an increase in zzso zzso expression that coincided with zzso zzso in both zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso of zzso were observed during zzso regrowth zzso Furthermore, zzso but not zzso regrowth involved muscle zzso based on a transient increase in expression of zzso zzso and zzso heavy zzso which are markers of zzso proliferation and zzso and a strong induction of muscle regulatory factor zzso zzso zzso in cultured muscle cells showed that zzso zzso expression is facilitated by zzso of zzso and selectively occurs in the zzso zzso This study suggests that induction of zzso expression and zzso zzso during recovery from muscle zzso is independent of the magnitude of muscle zzso Moreover, our data demonstrate for the first time that the zzso response characterized by zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso expression in recovering muscle is associated with the magnitude of regrowth and may be regulated by zzso of zzso
