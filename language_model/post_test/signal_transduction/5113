zzso zzso actions are readily learned despite the zzso gap between the earliest zzso action in the sequence and the reward zzso Fast zzso signaling is hypothesized to mediate this form of learning by reporting errors in reward zzso However, such a role for zzso release in voluntarily initiated action sequences remains to be zzso 

Using zzso zzso zzso we monitored zzso zzso zzso release, in real time, as rats performed a zzso sequence of lever presses to earn zzso zzso Before testing, rats received either 0 zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso or 10 zzso zzso 8) days of action sequence zzso 

For rats acquiring the action sequence task at test, zzso release was strongly zzso by zzso (but zzso zzso With learning, a significant zzso in zzso release preceded performance of the zzso action and subsequently came to zzso the zzso zzso This zzso zzso release response was also observed in rats previously trained on the action sequence task, and the zzso of this signal predicted the zzso with which rats completed the action zzso zzso the zzso response to contingent reward delivery was not observed in rats given extensive zzso zzso analysis confirmed that task performance was zzso 

These data suggest that zzso zzso zzso release mediates the influence that rewards exert over the performance of zzso zzso behavior and sheds light on how zzso signaling abnormalities may contribute to disorders of behavioral zzso
