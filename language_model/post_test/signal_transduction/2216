The zzso signal regulated zzso zzso cascade is a major zzso system by which cells zzso zzso signals into zzso zzso To obtain information about the role of zzso in retrograde zzso reaction, we investigated the changes of zzso 1 and zzso 2 with in zzso zzso and zzso study in the zzso motor nucleus of zzso zzso which shows degenerative changes, and the zzso nucleus, which shows zzso changes, of adult rats after zzso The expression of zzso and protein of zzso 1 increased between 7 and 28 days after zzso both in the zzso and zzso zzso however, there was no remarkable change in those of zzso zzso The increased expression of zzso 1 is common to both zzso zzso and degenerative zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso 1 is closely related with the retrograde zzso reaction but whether zzso are destined to survive or die depends on some other zzso
