In the present study we investigated the mechanisms responsible for and the biological consequences of the zzso zzso of the zzso growth zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso An zzso increase in the expression and zzso of the zzso was observed during the transition of growth states from exponential to zzso The increase in zzso expression is preceded by an increase in zzso zzso transcript and is associated with an increase in the zzso promoter zzso zzso of de zzso zzso by zzso D increased the stability of zzso zzso in zzso growing cells, thereby increasing the expression of zzso to a level similar to that seen in zzso zzso Increased zzso signaling zzso the growth factor independence of zzso zzso zzso cells through the zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso IGF-1 increased cell proliferation and activated zzso and zzso signaling zzso The resistance of cells to zzso by zzso signaling was zzso through zzso and zzso zzso zzso pathways and a yet unidentified zzso Thus, zzso regulation of zzso signaling is required for resistance to zzso and growth factor independence of zzso zzso zzso This likely protects cells from zzso conditions and allows cells to rapidly re-enter the cell cycle when conditions are zzso
