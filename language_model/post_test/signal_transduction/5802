zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein zzso zzso in response to insulin, IGF-1, zzso and other zzso zzso has an zzso zzso zzso domain (which zzso membrane zzso a zzso domain zzso associates with zzso insulin zzso or IGF-1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso that, when zzso bind signaling zzso The role of zzso in zzso signaling is zzso We previously reported that zzso and zzso zzso 2 associate independently of zzso zzso via zzso N zzso and that zzso zzso greatly enhances zzso zzso but not zzso zzso We now use zzso zzso zzso to study the influence of zzso on zzso zzso We zzso zzso cells with zzso only zzso or a zzso zzso zzso short hairpin zzso zzso zzso and compared representative zzso zzso confirmed more than zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso caused characteristic zzso zzso 2 and zzso zzso in both Control and zzso cells, but zzso zzso was dramatically reduced in zzso cells in zzso time course and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso collagen zzso zzso and zzso association in zzso cells were also markedly diminished compared with Control zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso in Control cells was largely zzso but the component isolated with plasma zzso was highly enriched in zzso raft zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso in the zzso fraction was particularly diminished compared with Control zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso contributes substantially to zzso zzso zzso in zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, our results are consistent with zzso residing upstream of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
