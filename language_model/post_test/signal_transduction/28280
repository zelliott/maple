During zzso development, the first cell lineage diversification event occurs in the zzso when the zzso zzso and the inner cell mass zzso become zzso Part of the TE zzso remains in contact with the ICM and differs from the mural TE zzso which is separated from the ICM by a cavity known as the zzso The presence of zzso connecting ICM cells with the distant mural TE cells through the zzso fluid was investigated in this zzso We describe two types of zzso cell projections found in freshly dissected and in zzso cultured expanding zzso abundant short zzso projecting into the zzso cavity that present a continuous undulating zzso and long, thin zzso zzso connecting the mural TE with the zzso zzso analyses revealed the presence of zzso structures moving along zzso zzso and dynamic zzso zzso These zzso together with zzso of the zzso and the zzso receptors to these cell zzso suggest that they display signal zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso are employed by zzso zzso cells to receive the required signals for cell division after they become distant to the zzso
