Cell zzso and migration are zzso complex processes that require tight zzso control of zzso zzso at defined zzso sites to zzso Decades of research have used zzso methods to identify numerous zzso pathways that are involved in the coordination of zzso membrane zzso and zzso that all contribute to zzso However, understanding the way in which these signals are controlled within discrete sites in individual cells undergoing migration is essential to enable a clearer understanding of how these pathways are integrated during zzso Recent advances in the generation of fluorescent protein zzso have enabled the development of zzso to zzso localized changes in protein zzso zzso or interactions in single cells using zzso Many of these zzso are based on the use of zzso resonance energy transfer that permits precise determination of interacting species based on the zzso or lifetime properties of the zzso zzso Here, we provide an overview of some of the recent studies that have developed such zzso and examples of how these zzso have been used to further our understanding of cell migration zzso
