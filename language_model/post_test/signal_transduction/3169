The zzso outer membrane protein zzso mediates a zzso entry mechanism controlled by zzso the zzso complex, and zzso zzso However, little is known about the early steps leading to zzso zzso and zzso zzso The use of pharmacological zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso induced more than zzso less invasion without affecting zzso Moreover, zzso zzso caused an increase in the association of zzso with at least one zzso zzso indicating that class I zzso zzso activity was zzso We also report that this zzso zzso activity is essential for zzso zzso However, zzso recruitment at the zzso entry site was independent of its zzso Using a pharmacological approach or zzso cells, we also demonstrated that zzso was zzso in response to zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso analysis and that all three zzso zzso were required during this zzso Overall, our results describe a signaling zzso involving zzso zzso class I zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso leading to zzso Zipper zzso The specificity of this signaling zzso with regard to that of the type 3 zzso system, which is the other invasion process of zzso is zzso
