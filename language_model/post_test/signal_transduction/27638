The failure of signal zzso in the zzso cell line was associated with the presence of an abnormal zzso zzso deleted of the zzso 7 zzso for an inactive zzso zzso Our study of the zzso zzso from various T cell lines and from peripheral blood zzso of healthy donors has revealed the presence of both complete and zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus the zzso zzso zzso transcript initially described in the zzso zzso cell line, arises from an alternative zzso event occurring in each cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso DNA sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso portion from both the zzso zzso and its parental zzso cell lines revealed as the only difference, the presence of a A to G zzso within the zzso zzso site of zzso 7 in the zzso cell line zzso To demonstrate the role of this point zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso by zzso zzso from the zzso and zzso cell zzso In zzso cells zzso with zzso from the zzso cell line both zzso transcripts (with and without zzso 7) were observed whereas only the zzso zzso zzso transcript was observed in zzso cells zzso with zzso from the zzso cell zzso Thus the zzso is per zzso responsible for the deletion of zzso 7 and the absence of complete zzso zzso in the zzso cell zzso zzso of a restriction site zzso in the zzso zzso site of zzso zzso 7 from zzso DNA allowed to confirm the presence of the zzso on both zzso in the zzso cell zzso
