zzso zzso zzso 2; zzso is an zzso whose expression increases during zzso zzso Here we show that zzso growth factor 1 zzso zzso of zzso notably increases zzso synthesis by zzso of the zzso zzso target of zzso zzso pathway, whereas the zzso effect zzso by zzso of the zzso regulated zzso 1/2 zzso zzso zzso contributed to zzso zzso zzso the differentiation zzso cell line, in which the forced zzso expression of zzso growth factor 1 stimulates a dramatic zzso was accompanied by a stronger zzso zzso Indeed, the zzso induced by zzso of a zzso activated form of zzso was able to induce high zzso activity in zzso cells, whereas the zzso of a zzso form of zzso prevented zzso formation, triggering zzso zzso zzso expression was strictly correlated with IGF-1 signaling also in C2 zzso zzso the zzso growth factor 1 binding protein 5 and therefore not responding to zzso produced zzso growth factor zzso Although zzso zzso exhibited stronger zzso we demonstrated that zzso zzso does not override the block of differentiation zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso did not modify the zzso pattern of zzso cells, suggesting that zzso might be the target of zzso zzso Taken together, our data demonstrate that zzso differentiation and zzso are driven, at least in part, by zzso zzso and further support the significant role of zzso zzso in zzso
