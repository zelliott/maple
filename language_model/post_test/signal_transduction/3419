Proper regulation of cellular functions relies upon a network of intricately interwoven signaling zzso in which multiple components must be tightly coordinated both zzso and zzso To better understand how this network operates within the cellular environment, it is important to define the parameters of various signaling activities and to reveal the characteristic activity structure of the signaling zzso This task calls for molecular tools capable of zzso tracking multiple activities in cellular time and space with high sensitivity and zzso Here, we present new zzso developed based on two zzso zzso zzso pairs consisting of zzso and zzso specifically zzso and zzso for parallel monitoring of zzso activity and zzso dynamics in living zzso These zzso provide zzso zzso in zzso experiments and display a comparable dynamic range to their zzso zzso zzso of signaling responses induced by a panel of zzso zzso using this zzso approach reveals distinct activity and kinetic patterns of zzso and zzso dynamics arising from differential signal zzso and zzso This technique is therefore useful for parallel monitoring of multiple signaling dynamics in single living cells and represents a promising approach towards a more precise characterization of the activity structure of the dynamic cellular signaling zzso
