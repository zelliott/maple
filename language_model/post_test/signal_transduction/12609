This review focuses on studies from the past year that have greatly advanced our understanding of molecular and cellular regulation of pancreatic zzso cell zzso 

Recent advances focus on signals dictating pancreatic development, zzso cell fate, pancreatic growth, and zzso zzso of zzso cells after zzso depends on expression of embryonic signals in mature zzso zzso In this setting, zzso cells can also zzso into zzso zzso With the forced induction of certain early and zzso zzso factors, zzso cells can also zzso into zzso There has also been an increased understanding of zzso zzso and the subsequent formation of pancreatic zzso zzso zzso Multiple proteins involved in zzso have been zzso including small zzso zzso zzso soluble zzso factor attachment zzso and zzso zzso 

These findings demonstrate the zzso potential of the zzso cell to mitigate zzso states such as zzso The ability of zzso cells to zzso into zzso could potentially provide a treatment for zzso Finally, the results might be helpful in preventing zzso transformation events arising from the zzso zzso zzso in zzso and computer modeling could expand our view of proteins zzso zzso cell zzso
