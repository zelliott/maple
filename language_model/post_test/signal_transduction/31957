zzso the zzso effects of the rosemary zzso zzso zzso acid zzso has attracted increasing zzso We explored the mechanism by which CA zzso the zzso effects of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso were zzso with CA for 12 h followed by treatment with 100 zzso zzso for 12 or 24 zzso Cell viability determined by the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso to 1 zzso CA zzso attenuated the cell death induced by zzso whereas the effect of 3-5 zzso CA was zzso CA at 1 zzso suppressed the zzso nuclear zzso zzso oxygen species generation, and zzso of zzso 3 and zzso zzso showed that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso was reduced in the presence of zzso zzso of cells with CA resulted in significant increases in the total zzso zzso level and the protein expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and modifier zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso attenuated the effect of CA on cell death and zzso Treatment with CA also led to an increase in nuclear factor zzso related factor 2 zzso zzso zzso response element zzso reporter activity, and DNA binding to the zzso zzso of zzso expression alleviated the reversal of zzso and zzso zzso by zzso These results suggest that the zzso of zzso zzso by CA is associated with the zzso synthesis of zzso which in turn zzso the zzso and zzso signaling zzso The CA compound may be a promising candidate for zzso in Parkinson's zzso
