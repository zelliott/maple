Cystic zzso zzso is the most common lethal inherited disorder and is caused by zzso in the gene zzso the zzso zzso regulator zzso The zzso lung expresses a profound zzso zzso that appears to be related to a zzso zzso of zzso zzso from airway zzso cells in response to microbial zzso Since overproduction of zzso in zzso contributes to massive zzso infiltrates of zzso identification of the pathways underlying zzso induction could provide novel drug targets for treatment of zzso inflammatory diseases such as zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso increases zzso production induced by a zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso in a human zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso A strong zzso was also observed in primary human zzso zzso zzso cells, but not in human zzso cell lines and primary zzso zzso despite the induction of nuclear zzso and zzso zzso during zzso or zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso appears to be the result of enhanced zzso or zzso zzso of zzso Taken together, these studies provide evidence that zzso is a critical factor in increasing zzso expression in zzso zzso airways via a zzso that regulates zzso zzso
