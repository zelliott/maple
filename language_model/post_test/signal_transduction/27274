Nerve growth factor zzso zzso outgrowth in the rat zzso tumor cell line recently has been shown to depend on the zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso et zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study we have analyzed whether or not function of the zzso zzso zzso is necessary for zzso zzso outgrowth in two zzso of primary zzso derived from the embryonic chick peripheral nervous system zzso Treatment of zzso zzso root zzso zzso sensory zzso zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso at zzso up to 100 zzso did not prevent zzso zzso zzso At this concentration zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso activity both were decreased by approximately zzso Essentially the same results were obtained with zzso sympathetic zzso zzso We conclude that, in contrast to the zzso tumor cell line, zzso zzso zzso activity is not necessary for zzso outgrowth of zzso sensory and sympathetic zzso derived from the chick zzso
