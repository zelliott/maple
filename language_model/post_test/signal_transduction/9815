zzso zzso requires the tight regulation of zzso zzso by liver, muscle and white or brown fat, and zzso production and release in the blood by zzso The major goal of maintaining zzso at zzso 5 zzso is to ensure a sufficient flux of zzso to the brain, which depends mostly on this zzso as a source of zzso zzso This zzso process is controlled by hormones, mainly zzso and insulin, and by zzso nervous activities that control the zzso state of liver, muscle and fat tissue but also the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso of the sympathetic or zzso branches of the zzso nervous systems are controlled by zzso or zzso zzso located at different anatomical sites, mainly in the zzso and the zzso zzso of these zzso by zzso or zzso represents a critical aspect of the control of zzso zzso and loss of zzso sensing by these cells as well as by pancreatic zzso is a hallmark of type 2 zzso In this article, aspects of the zzso zzso axis are zzso highlighting the importance of central zzso sensing in the control of zzso to zzso but also mentioning the role of the neural control in zzso mass and zzso Overall, the conclusions of these studies is that impaired zzso zzso such as associated with type 2 diabetes, but also defective zzso to zzso may be caused by initial defects in zzso zzso
