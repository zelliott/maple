zzso modifications zzso of zzso core zzso play roles in basic biological processes via altering zzso structure and creating target sites for proteins acting on zzso Several features make zzso a uniquely effective model for studying zzso zzso effect zzso zzso repression, dosage compensation and several other processes extensively studied by the powerful tools of zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso reveal information on the dynamic changes of zzso zzso and factors that zzso remove and recognize zzso Recent determination of the zzso distribution of more than 20 different zzso zzso types has resulted in a highly detailed view of zzso zzso This review samples from the wealth of data these analyses have provided together with data resulting from zzso studies on the distribution and role of specific zzso modifications and zzso As an example of the complex interactions among zzso we will also discuss zzso involving specific zzso and zzso zzso zzso
