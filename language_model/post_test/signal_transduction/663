zzso I zzso a highly zzso member of the zzso family of zzso proteins associates with zzso structures and is involved in cellular zzso and zzso Our previous studies have shown that zzso is an important negative regulator of wound zzso Here, we show that zzso affects zzso formation and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso formation and sparse arrangements of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed in zzso and zzso mice with their skin being significantly more fragile than zzso and zzso zzso zzso primary zzso showed increased zzso on zzso and collagen I than zzso and zzso primary zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were observed in zzso zzso wounds, which could contribute to the impaired wound zzso observed in these zzso zzso interacts with proteins directly linked to the zzso domain of zzso receptors suggesting that it may be a mechanical link between zzso zzso receptors and the zzso zzso driving zzso zzso Therefore zzso may regulate wound repair through its effect on zzso formation and zzso cellular zzso and zzso
