Changes in zzso zzso induced during infection result from the recognition of bacterial products as well as the action of bacterial zzso zzso We used the unprecedented opportunity provided by gene zzso to simultaneously study the expression of hundreds of genes during zzso zzso infection of zzso and to assess the contribution of the bacterial zzso factor, zzso in initiating the host responses to zzso We found that zzso zzso infection caused significant changes in the expression of numerous genes zzso zzso cell surface zzso signaling zzso and zzso zzso at 4 h zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Our results revealed changes in the expression of several genes that had not been previously implicated in the host responses to zzso zzso infection, as well as changes in the expression of several genes previously shown to be regulated by zzso zzso zzso An overlapping spectrum of genes was expressed in response to virulent zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso reinforcing the major role of this surface zzso in stimulating the early response of zzso to bacterial zzso The zzso gene expression profile was further altered by zzso with zzso indicating that host cell responses depend on the zzso state of the zzso
