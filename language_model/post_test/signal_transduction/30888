The zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso is critical to cell growth and zzso In zzso functional studies indicate that the candidate schizophrenia zzso gene zzso influences zzso signaling to promote zzso zzso The zzso gene has also been implicated in schizophrenia by association studies and decreased protein expression in the brains of schizophrenic zzso 

The association of zzso in the Irish Study of High zzso zzso Families zzso prompted our investigation of zzso for association with disease in this zzso Eight single zzso zzso spanning zzso were analyzed for association with schizophrenia across four definitions of affection and according to zzso zzso zzso of zzso Illness zzso symptom zzso We examined expression of zzso zzso zzso from zzso brain tissue of zzso zzso and control zzso 

No single marker showed significant association, but the risk zzso previously found zzso to Caucasian schizophrenic patients was significantly zzso in the zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso across all zzso symptom zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed association with schizophrenia toward the zzso end of zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso We found significantly decreased zzso levels in prefrontal zzso of schizophrenic individuals, consistent with reduced zzso protein levels reported in schizophrenic zzso 

The replication of association of zzso gene zzso in a further Caucasian family sample adds support for involvement of zzso signaling in zzso perhaps encompassing a broader clinical zzso that includes mood zzso We show that zzso signaling might be compromised in schizophrenic and bipolar patients via reduced zzso expression of specific zzso zzso
