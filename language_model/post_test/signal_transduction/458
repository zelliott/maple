In zzso zzso male and female external zzso develop from the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is maintained by the zzso zzso and it has been reported that zzso mediates this zzso To test directly whether zzso is required for external zzso development, we zzso removed zzso from the zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso is not necessary for zzso outgrowth or normal patterning of the external zzso In early zzso zzso we found no redundant zzso expression in the zzso zzso which contrasts with the situation in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso Analysis of zzso zzso activity showed that four putative targets are either absent from early zzso zzso or are not regulated by zzso We therefore examined the distribution of zzso protein and report that, although it is present in the zzso zzso is zzso in the zzso zzso Thus, zzso is zzso but the signaling zzso is not activated during normal zzso zzso A zzso survey of zzso revealed zzso expression in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso or alligators, indicating that zzso expression is neither a required nor a zzso feature of zzso external zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso expression is an early zzso of the zzso initiation signal rather than the signal zzso We propose that induction of external zzso involves an zzso interaction at the zzso zzso and suggest that the zzso zzso may be the source of the zzso initiation zzso
