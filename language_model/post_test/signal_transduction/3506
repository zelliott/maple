zzso of the zzso responses have been reported in diabetes zzso In this study, the roles of the zzso channel and zzso zzso zzso were evaluated by using the zzso channel opener zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso zzso in diabetic rat zzso 

Adult male zzso rats weighing zzso zzso were divided into diabetic and control zzso Diabetes was induced by a single zzso injection of zzso zzso 55 zzso 

zzso responses induced by zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso were significantly less in diabetic rings compared with control rings zzso zzso The decrease in the zzso effect of zzso was more in zzso rings compared to the zzso rings zzso zzso There were no significant differences between zzso intact and zzso rings in the presence of zzso zzso When two drugs were administered together, relaxation was significantly less than with zzso administration of each drug in the diabetic group zzso zzso zzso with N zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso an NO zzso zzso significantly decreased the zzso response to zzso and zzso zzso in both the control and diabetic groups zzso zzso 

These results suggest that the impaired zzso effects were further decreased depending on zzso channel activity but the effects of zzso zzso zzso on relaxation responses were not significantly changed in diabetes zzso
