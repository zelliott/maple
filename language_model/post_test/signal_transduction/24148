We have investigated the role of zzso zzso in zzso the zzso between energy metabolism and cell cycle progression in both zzso cultures and zzso continuous cultures of zzso zzso For the first time, a peak in zzso zzso was shown to zzso the observed breakdown of zzso and zzso during cell zzso zzso zzso in zzso cultures demonstrated that this peak can be associated with the cell cycle dynamics of zzso under conditions of zzso growth, which was found to differ significantly from that observed in zzso zzso zzso Our results support the notion that zzso plays a major role in zzso the integration of energy metabolism and cell cycle zzso both in the single cell and during cell zzso zzso in continuous culture, zzso Evidence is presented that the dynamic zzso of zzso zzso during the cell cycle is modulated depending on zzso zzso The implications of these findings regarding the role of zzso in regulating cell cycle progression and energy metabolism are zzso
