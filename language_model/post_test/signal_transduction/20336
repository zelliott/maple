The use of zzso zzso zzso has been proposed as a promising approach to increase the cell killing effect of DNA zzso drugs in zzso However, the molecular mechanism of their action remains zzso In the present article, we have assessed the effect of the zzso zzso inhibitor sodium zzso on the DNA damage response induced by the zzso agent zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso C zzso but did not impair the repair pathways required to remove zzso zzso zzso as neither the rate of zzso zzso repair nor the zzso zzso repair rate were zzso zzso zzso treatment zzso the zzso zzso checkpoint in zzso zzso cells and induced the zzso zzso However, sodium zzso treatment alone resulted in zzso of zzso oxygen species, zzso breaks in DNA, and zzso These results imply that the zzso of zzso oxygen zzso increase in DNA zzso burden may be the major mechanism by which sodium zzso enhances the zzso of zzso zzso
