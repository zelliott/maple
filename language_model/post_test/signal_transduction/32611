The role of localized instability of the zzso network in specifying zzso fate was examined with the use of rat zzso zzso in zzso During normal zzso development, zzso dynamics and instability polarized to a single growth cone before zzso zzso zzso global application of zzso drugs and of the zzso zzso toxin B to zzso cells produced zzso with multiple zzso Moreover, disruption of the zzso network in one individual growth cone induced its zzso to become the zzso Thus, local instability of the zzso network restricted to a single growth cone is a zzso signal specifying zzso zzso
