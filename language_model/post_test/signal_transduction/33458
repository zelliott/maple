Much current interest in chemical biology focuses on the zzso zzso of zzso which have emerged as targets for the development of novel zzso and zzso zzso membrane proteins are a group of important zzso that play pivotal roles in many cellular zzso Previous studies primarily focused on the zzso and/or zzso zzso of membrane zzso However, the importance of zzso regions in the regulation of protein complexes is beginning to zzso As such, a number of methods for designing and testing novel zzso peptides that recognize zzso targets and zzso cellular functions have been zzso This Review outlines current zzso for developing these zzso zzso that may provide useful tools to study a variety of biological phenomena in the zzso
