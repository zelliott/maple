Certain zzso zzso zzso generate signals that direct their own zzso zzso They also respond to signals from plants that initiate or zzso zzso leading to the establishment of a symbiotic zzso An objective of this review is to describe the mechanisms by which zzso zzso regulate their development and then to consider how plants may exploit zzso physiology to achieve stable zzso zzso that are capable of forming plant zzso can differentiate into zzso filaments called zzso and into specialized zzso cells called zzso Plant signals exert both positive and negative regulatory control on zzso zzso zzso differentiation is a highly regulated process, resulting in a regularly spaced pattern of zzso in the zzso The evidence is most consistent with the pattern arising in two zzso First, nitrogen limitation triggers a zzso spaced cluster of cells (perhaps at a critical stage of their cell zzso to initiate zzso zzso between an zzso zzso exported by the zzso cells and an zzso protein within them causes one cell within each cluster to fully zzso yielding a single mature zzso In zzso with plants, zzso zzso are increased 3- to zzso because, we zzso either differentiation is initiated at an increased number of sites or resolution of zzso clusters is zzso The physiology of zzso associated zzso raises the prospect that zzso differentiation proceeds independently of the nitrogen status of a cell and depends instead on signals produced by the plant zzso
