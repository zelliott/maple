In zzso analyses have identified different functional types of zzso channels in various plant zzso and zzso The zzso zzso contains approximately 70 genes for zzso channels, of which 57 might be zzso channels zzso zzso or poorly discriminating zzso Here, we describe the different families of zzso zzso zzso the zzso the zzso and zzso zzso channels zzso by the zzso zzso the zzso channels, the zzso zzso and the zzso channel zzso We also compare molecular data with the data obtained in zzso which should lead to a better understanding of the identity of these channels and provide clues about their roles in plant nutrition and cell zzso
