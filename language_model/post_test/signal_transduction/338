In the last few years, the role of zzso oxygen species as signaling molecules has emerged, and not only as zzso zzso Here, we analyzed how root zzso properties were modified by different hydrogen zzso zzso zzso applied zzso to the root zzso Two different experimental zzso were zzso zzso zzso plants growing in zzso or in potted zzso In both experimental zzso we found an increase of root zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso application for the first zzso Twenty zzso was the threshold concentration of zzso for observing an effect on L in the soil experiment, while in the zzso experiment, a positive effect on L was observed at zzso zzso zzso In the zzso experiment, a correlation between increased L and plasma membrane zzso amount and their root zzso was zzso These findings provide new insights to study how several environmental factors modify zzso
