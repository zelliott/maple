zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is an zzso involved in zzso derived growth factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso because it is able to bind and zzso the activated zzso zzso contains two zzso located in position 12 and 17, both inside the zzso zzso this is a unique feature of zzso among all protein zzso zzso zzso is oxidized and zzso both in zzso and in zzso by zzso zzso stress and by zzso generated zzso burst produced during zzso zzso and recovers its activity within 40 zzso The zzso of in zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso The additional zzso pocket zzso in position 17, retains an intriguing and peculiar role in the formation of a zzso zzso bond, which protects the zzso zzso from further and irreversible zzso The presence of an additional zzso near the zzso one, zzso to zzso the ability to rapidly recover its activity and finely regulate zzso zzso zzso during both zzso and zzso generated zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso of zzso is involved in zzso delivery of zzso signals, as the arrest of growth induced by cell zzso and differentiation are associated with a decrease in the zzso levels of zzso zzso The studies of the zzso state of zzso in zzso cells and in mature zzso demonstrate that the protein is reduced and activated in both these conditions, thus leading to the hypothesis that zzso is a zzso of growth zzso
