zzso a zzso generated at sites of vascular injury, signals cellular responses vital for zzso and zzso How zzso an zzso rather than a classical zzso effects graded and zzso responses in its target cells has been a long-standing zzso zzso activates its zzso by zzso off an zzso zzso to zzso a zzso zzso zzso We zzso a zzso zzso with an zzso zzso zzso to directly demonstrate zzso zzso zzso and to examine the zzso of zzso zzso on intact zzso The rate of zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso concentration over the zzso range, but low zzso zzso ultimately zzso and activated all zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso correlated precisely with cumulative zzso zzso These data strongly suggest that each zzso and activated zzso zzso produces a zzso of zzso zzso then shuts zzso Surprisingly, this shut off occurred despite the continued presence of zzso and zzso receptors on the cell surface and at a time when the cells were zzso to zzso but sensitive to zzso zzso suggesting that a novel shut off mechanism may have evolved to deal with the zzso zzso Unlike the case with classical zzso cells thus cannot detect differences in zzso zzso as differences in fractional occupancy but rather must sense different rates of zzso zzso Because each zzso zzso zzso generates a quantum of second messenger, the magnitude of the cell's response to zzso must be determined by the balance between rates of zzso zzso and second zzso zzso
