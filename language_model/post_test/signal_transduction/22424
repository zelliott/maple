zzso a potent zzso hormone released from the stomach, is important in regulating energy zzso zzso zzso levels are associated with eating disorders and zzso zzso However, factors involved in the regulation of zzso release remain zzso Here, we examined the involvement of zzso signaling in the control of zzso release from the zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso release zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso abolished the increased zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso release zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso In zzso zzso knockout mice, zzso inhibited zzso release, and the zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked this zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso increased zzso release in zzso and zzso zzso knockout mice but not in zzso zzso knockout zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the gastric nerve fibers were zzso zzso was also detected for zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the gastric zzso zzso of neural activities with zzso abolished the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso exerts predominantly a zzso zzso zzso zzso action on gastric zzso release, whereas an zzso zzso zzso action is also apparent when the zzso zzso effect was zzso
