zzso one of the most abundant zzso zzso forms long linear zzso zzso in zzso A novel technique to handle single zzso filaments in solution was developed that allows the study of zzso currents zzso along the surface of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso currents were observed about the zzso surface under both high zzso zzso zzso and low (1 zzso zzso zzso strength zzso The data are consistent with a dynamic behavior of the zzso cloud surrounding the zzso filaments that support zzso movements along their zzso axis upon electrical zzso zzso waves were highly zzso in nature and remained long after the electrical stimulation of the zzso filaments zzso In this report therefore, we demonstrate that zzso filaments can function as biological zzso zzso and can thus be zzso as zzso zzso transmission zzso This ability of zzso filaments to conduct electrical signals may have important implications in the zzso of zzso zzso
