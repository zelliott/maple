zzso zzso play diverse and important roles in bacterial zzso but their detection and zzso is often hampered by their limited abundance or lack of expression in the absence of suitable environmental zzso We describe here a sensitive zzso approach to detect zzso that are under the control of a zzso regulator and to zzso their recognition zzso Using zzso growth media or a zzso strain of zzso in which the zzso zzso regulatory system is zzso active, truncated forms of zzso zzso factor G, zzso factor Tu and zzso protein zzso proteins were zzso Two other global regulatory zzso and cells exposed to acid or to zzso stress failed to produce the truncated zzso indicating specific control of the zzso activity by the zzso zzso Our results suggest that at least two zzso are zzso To define the zzso zzso sites of one of the zzso peptides from each of the truncated proteins were identified by zzso mass zzso mass zzso and mapped onto the sequence of the intact zzso zzso of the regions around the cut site indicates that the zzso zzso a zzso zzso acid motif characteristic of the zzso zzso zzso The induction of such zzso in bacteria depleted of zzso zzso may contribute to the zzso resistance of zzso to zzso zzso zzso Additionally, our results suggest it would be prudent to keep the concentration of this zzso above zzso levels during bacterial sample preparation for zzso zzso
