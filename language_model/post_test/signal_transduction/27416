One way of establishing a zzso zzso in a developing zzso involves the localized synthesis of an inducing zzso followed by its diffusion into surrounding zzso The zzso effects of the zzso factor zzso provide support for this idea in zzso zzso The questions remain, however, of how zzso exerts its long-range effects, and whether long-range zzso is a property of all transforming growth factor beta zzso family zzso 

We compare the zzso ranges of zzso and two other zzso family members, zzso and zzso Unlike zzso zzso and zzso act over short zzso Furthermore, the effects of zzso active zzso receptors are strictly zzso These observations suggest that the long-range effects of zzso occur through protein diffusion and that zzso mechanisms are not initiated by any of these zzso family zzso zzso limiting the zzso range of zzso were addressed by studying zzso processing and zzso An zzso fusion protein signals over many cell zzso suggesting that regulated processing or zzso is one limiting zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso also extends the range of zzso suggesting that components of intact tissue restrict spread of the zzso 

The long-range effects of zzso are likely to occur through the diffusion of zzso zzso The short-range effects of zzso and zzso emphasize that long-range diffusion is not a general property of zzso zzso Finally, zzso ranges may be regulated by constraints on processing or zzso and by interactions with zzso components of embryonic zzso
