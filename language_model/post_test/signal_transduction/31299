It has long been zzso that futile cycles in cellular metabolism are involved in the regulation of zzso zzso Following the work of zzso and Crabtree, a quantitative theory was developed for this idea based on zzso thermodynamics and zzso control zzso It is shown that the zzso sensitivity of an zzso zzso concentration with respect to changes in zzso flux is governed by the effective equilibrium constant of the intermediate formation, and the equilibrium can be regulated by a futile zzso The direction of the shift in the effective equilibrium constant depends on the direction of operation of the futile zzso High zzso sensitivity zzso to zzso of an intermediate concentration to net flow through a zzso low zzso sensitivity zzso to zzso of concentration with respect to changes in zzso Both cases potentially play important roles in zzso zzso zzso cycles actively shift the effective equilibrium by zzso energy; the magnitude of changes in effective zzso and sensitivities is a function of the amount of energy used by a futile zzso This proposed mechanism for control by futile cycles works remarkably similar to kinetic zzso in zzso The sensitivity of the system is also intimately related to the rate of concentration fluctuations of intermediate zzso The possibility of different roles for the two major mechanisms within cellular zzso regulation, namely zzso chemical modifications via futile cycles and shifting equilibrium by zzso zzso are zzso
