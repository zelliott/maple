zzso plays a central, zzso role in chronic zzso zzso yet recent work suggests a predominantly protective function for this zzso factor group in some cell types of the zzso We zzso describe the conditional deletion of the zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso and determine its function in zzso control of zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso Mice lacking zzso in zzso and zzso zzso were born in expected zzso ratios, and zzso zzso differentiated zzso zzso zzso disease and death occurred with low zzso in zzso lacking zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly diminished in zzso zzso and zzso challenge revealed elevated zzso and zzso DNA binding activity as compared with zzso zzso of zzso resulted in diminished expression of zzso zzso zzso 4, zzso zzso 5, zzso and zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso rates of zzso zzso and proliferation were zzso Mice lacking zzso zzso were sensitive to zzso sodium zzso zzso Although experimental colitis enhanced proliferation in cells lacking zzso sustained zzso cell zzso precluded zzso healing and decreased animal zzso We conclude that zzso of zzso is required for zzso regulation of cell death and division in zzso zzso as well as for protection from development of zzso acute inflammation of the zzso
