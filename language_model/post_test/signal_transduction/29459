This study evaluated the zzso coupled to the zzso stimulation of the zzso zzso in zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso transport system activity was zzso as the initial rate of zzso recovery after an alkaline load zzso zzso in immortalized zzso zzso zzso zzso cells from spontaneously zzso rat zzso and their zzso control zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso increased zzso zzso activity with zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells, zzso These effects were abolished by zzso but not by zzso zzso increased zzso zzso activity in zzso and zzso cells zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso zzso activity in zzso and zzso cells was inhibited by protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso was identical in zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells generated more zzso than zzso zzso In zzso cells, the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso reduced their increased ability to generate zzso and abolished their hypersensitivity to zzso but failed to affect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation of zzso exchange activity was significantly higher in zzso than in zzso zzso 

zzso between zzso and zzso cells on their sensitivity to zzso stimulation did not correlate with the abundance of zzso and zzso and may be related to the increased generation of zzso which may amplify the response downstream of zzso zzso
