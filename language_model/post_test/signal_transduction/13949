zzso receptors zzso are the largest group of plasma membrane receptors in nature and are activated by a variety of different zzso The biological outcome of zzso stimulation is complex, as a plethora of signaling pathways are activated upon zzso These complexity and diversity of zzso signaling make it difficult to manipulate the signaling zzso of a specific zzso by natural zzso To reduce the complexity in experimental settings, specific pharmacological zzso that zzso activate one signaling zzso have been zzso In addition, zzso designer receptors that are unresponsive to zzso zzso but can be activated by otherwise zzso zzso compounds have been zzso These receptors have been termed designer receptors exclusively activated by designer zzso The lack of zzso activity of these designer receptors allows their use for in zzso and in zzso studies of zzso signal zzso The analysis of recently generated transgenic mice showed that the expression of zzso designer receptors represents a powerful zzso tool to investigate zzso signaling and zzso
