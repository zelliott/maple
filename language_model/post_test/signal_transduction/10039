zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that is induced by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in human zzso In the absence of zzso treatment of human peripheral blood zzso cells with zzso zzso factor and zzso resulted in zzso acid zzso zzso zzso cells that are positive for zzso zzso zzso and a number of other zzso zzso including nuclear factor of activated zzso cells, zzso zzso 1 zzso Although zzso was strongly induced by zzso and was observed in the nucleus, zzso did not permit the formation of zzso zzso although these cells had the typical zzso zzso zzso of zzso Despite a similar appearance to zzso zzso treatment was required in order for zzso zzso cells to develop bone zzso zzso The lack of bone zzso was correlated with a zzso in expression of certain genes related to bone zzso such as zzso K and zzso Furthermore, zzso blocked the zzso formation of zzso zzso cells as well as blocking zzso bone zzso activity, indicating that zzso acts at two stages of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in mature zzso did not prevent bone zzso activity, suggesting zzso is involved in cell fusion events and not bone zzso We propose that the zzso zzso zzso cells represent an arrested stage in zzso zzso after zzso induction and cellular fusion but prior to the development of bone zzso zzso
