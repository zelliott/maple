zzso zzso are major regulators of signal zzso pathways and play key roles in processes including zzso zzso cell cycle zzso cell survival and gene zzso whose deregulation may lead to zzso A growing number of in zzso and in zzso studies using zzso cell lines, primary tumors and animal cancer models strongly suggest that altered zzso zzso signaling plays an important role in the initiation as well as in the progression of zzso zzso zzso one of the deadliest human zzso in the zzso These zzso can occur at the level of the zzso themselves or of one of their regulators or zzso The participation into the zzso process can occur either through the zzso of one of these components which presents an zzso activity as illustrated with zzso and C or through the zzso of the expression of a component presenting tumor zzso activity as for zzso or the zzso zzso zzso these observations reflect the zzso and the complexity of liver zzso Recently, pharmacological approaches targeting zzso zzso signaling have been used in zzso models with relative success but remain to be validated in more zzso relevant zzso zzso therapeutic approaches targeting zzso zzso signaling may provide a novel alternative for zzso zzso
