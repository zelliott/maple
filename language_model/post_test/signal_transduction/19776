In plants, the zzso systems zzso play important roles in regulating diverse biological zzso including responses to environmental stress zzso Within the soybean zzso the zzso consist of at least 21 zzso zzso 13 authentic and zzso and 18 zzso 15 zzso 3 zzso and 11 zzso regulator zzso zzso and zzso analyses of soybean zzso members with their zzso and rice counterparts revealed similar architecture of their zzso We identified a large number of closely zzso soybean zzso zzso which likely resulted from zzso zzso Additionally, we zzso zzso expression profiles of those zzso zzso whose data are available from public zzso To predict the putative regulatory functions of soybean zzso members, with special emphasis on zzso functions, we performed comparative analyses from all the zzso members of zzso zzso and rice and coupled these data with zzso of known zzso zzso zzso in the promoter region of each soybean zzso zzso Our study provides insights into the architecture and a solid foundation for further functional characterization of soybean zzso zzso In addition, we provide a new resource for studying the conservation and divergence among the zzso within plant species and/or between plants and other zzso
