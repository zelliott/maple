We previously reported evidence of zzso induction of zzso beta zzso in the rat zzso The present in zzso studies using northern zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso to 1 zzso zzso zzso caused a marked induction of zzso beta zzso in zzso but not in zzso This induction was remarkably suppressed by zzso of cells with the zzso zzso zzso These phenomena were confirmed by in zzso zzso with zzso zzso beta zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso (5 zzso zzso and 5 zzso zzso zzso markedly induced zzso beta zzso in zzso The zzso level of zzso in zzso was elevated in a zzso manner when they were treated with zzso and this zzso was completely blocked by zzso The induction of zzso beta zzso by either zzso or zzso was strongly inhibited by a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso These results, taken together, suggest that zzso zzso primarily induce zzso beta zzso by stimulation of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso presumably participate in a signal zzso mechanism involved in the induction of zzso beta zzso via zzso
