zzso zzso status has been found in many types of cancer zzso Recent studies have shown that the zzso product of zzso zzso zzso generated zzso oxygen species zzso within cancer zzso The aim of this study was thus to evaluate the signal zzso zzso and the role of zzso in zzso zzso 

Blood specimens were obtained from the drainage vein of the tumor during operation in 76 patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were measured using the zzso zzso zzso zzso test and serum zzso levels were examined by a highly sensitive zzso zzso 

There was no significant correlation between serum levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels were elevated in proportion to tumor invasion and had a significant positive correlation with tumor size zzso zzso zzso However, they did not increase in patients with liver zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso are independent of zzso signaling zzso and are associated with increased tumor invasion, but not liver zzso in patients with zzso zzso From this point of view, new strategies related to zzso may provide improved therapeutic results as well as a preventative effect on zzso of the zzso
