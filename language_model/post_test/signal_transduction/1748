Cell zzso contain zzso and cholesterol, which cluster together in distinct zzso called zzso The zzso leaflet of these peculiar membrane zzso contains zzso zzso while the inner leaflet contains proteins implicated in zzso such as the zzso protein zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso of zzso We present here an approach to study the zzso composition of zzso and its change upon zzso zzso Our method is based on zzso zzso of zzso zzso with different precursors of zzso zzso including zzso and fatty acids with different lengths and degrees of zzso as well as zzso polar head zzso The results obtained indicate that zzso zzso isolated by the use of zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso extraction in the cold, besides zzso and cholesterol, contain zzso all classes of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso shows that zzso zzso are zzso zzso with saturated fatty acids while the rest of the plasma membrane incorporates mostly zzso zzso fatty zzso To see whether the raft composition as measured by zzso zzso of zzso is involved in zzso zzso we investigated the production of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso production occurs within zzso confirming previous demonstration of protein zzso C zzso into membrane zzso Our data demonstrate that raft disorganization by zzso zzso both zzso zzso production and changes in zzso zzso zzso These lines of evidence support the conclusion that the major events in zzso zzso occur within or due to zzso zzso
