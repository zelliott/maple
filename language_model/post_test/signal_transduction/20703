zzso The effects of zzso zzso on the mechanical tension and on the electrical zzso of zzso and smooth muscle cells were studied in intact zzso coronary artery zzso zzso zzso of strips with zzso zzso zzso induced mechanical zzso leading to an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mechanical zzso were correlated with fluctuations of the membrane potential of zzso cells, which were identified by zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso The zzso cell membrane potential fluctuations appeared as action zzso or smaller zzso slow waves, and were synchronized with electrical membrane potential fluctuations of the underlying coronary smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso in smooth muscle cells were not affected by removal of the zzso and depended on the presence of calcium in the external zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first description of action zzso fluctuations in the zzso It is concluded that the zzso were generated in the smooth muscle and that they zzso to the zzso The question of the mode of propagation of the signal is zzso
