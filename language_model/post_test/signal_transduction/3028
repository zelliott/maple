zzso is a zzso zzso involved in the development of a variety of zzso including zzso zzso type 2 zzso a zzso inherited zzso disease, is also caused by loss of zzso zzso patients suffer from multiple genetically zzso zzso zzso are most frequent among zzso Using our in zzso model for human zzso we found that zzso cells display enhanced proliferation because of the zzso of zzso growth factor zzso and zzso increased zzso zzso because of the zzso of zzso and decreased zzso zzso underlying zzso zzso proliferation and zzso zzso are not zzso Here, we investigated zzso growth zzso zzso zzso which is expressed and released from central nervous system zzso and strongly zzso in zzso at the zzso zzso zzso acts via zzso and zzso zzso which are strongly zzso and zzso activated in zzso Using short hairpin zzso zzso small zzso and zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso cells, in contrast to zzso cells, release zzso that activates the zzso pathway, via zzso zzso zzso zzso proliferation and zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso to the nucleus and zzso triggers zzso zzso Further, we observed zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells leading to increased activity of zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso has a crucial role in zzso zzso and therefore represents an important therapeutic target in the treatment of zzso zzso
