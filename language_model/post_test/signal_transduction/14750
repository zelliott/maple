Large amounts of protein and domain interaction data are being produced by experimental zzso techniques and zzso zzso To gain insight into the value of the provided data, we used our new similarity measure based on the Gene zzso zzso to evaluate the molecular functions and biological processes of interacting proteins or zzso The applied measure particularly addresses the frequent zzso of proteins or zzso with multiple GO zzso 

Using our similarity measure, we compare predicted zzso and human zzso interactions with zzso derived zzso The results show that our similarity measure is of significant benefit in quality assessment and confidence ranking of domain and protein zzso We also derive useful confidence score thresholds for dividing domain interaction predictions into zzso of low and high zzso 

zzso data are available at zzso zzso
