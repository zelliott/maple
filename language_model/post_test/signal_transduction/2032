zzso is the process responsible for restoring an intact zzso following zzso zzso A change in the activity of zzso is required for zzso to occur, and this is likely to be regulated by the altered expression of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso The injury itself provides a stimulus for zzso factor zzso either directly due to mechanical stress, or via zzso mechanisms such as the release of growth factors from damaged zzso Members of the zzso zzso family, in particular zzso and zzso have been the most widely studied zzso zzso zzso The signal zzso pathways linking cellular injury to zzso zzso stimulation appear to involve an increase in zzso zzso and zzso of zzso protein zzso Given that a number of genes involved in the zzso of wounds are regulated by zzso zzso a distinct role for this zzso factor in zzso is beginning to zzso This article reviews the evidence for zzso zzso involvement in zzso with particular focus on the zzso of this zzso factor in response to zzso the second zzso pathways involved, and the zzso of downstream genes that have the capacity to regulate zzso zzso
