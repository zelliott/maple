We recently reported that zzso a zzso zzso in zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and simultaneously zzso the production of zzso zzso oxide zzso through zzso NO zzso zzso zzso The same results were observed in the present study with not only zzso derivatives of zzso particularly the zzso of zzso zzso zzso but also with a synthetic zzso (a zzso in both leukemia zzso lines and zzso chronic zzso leukemia zzso patients' zzso Moreover, zzso another zzso already known for its zzso properties in zzso cells, was also found to zzso both zzso expression and NO zzso Thus, zzso of the NO zzso during zzso of leukemia zzso appears a common mechanism for several compounds belonging to two distinct families of zzso the zzso and zzso zzso
