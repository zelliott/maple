Since the cloning in 1997 of zzso the human zzso of the zzso gene of zzso zzso most studies have focused on its role in cancer progression and have provided significant zzso to link its increased expression to a decrease in tumor zzso zzso resides on a zzso Desert zzso on zzso zzso and is highly zzso in zzso The function of the zzso zzso protein is still very elusive although, several zzso from lower organisms indicate that it plays a major role in protein degradation using the zzso zzso zzso has a very complex structure made up of zzso zzso it consists of 21 zzso featuring several alternative transcripts zzso for putative protein zzso This structural complexity ensures protein flexibility and zzso indeed the protein was found in different zzso compartments and may turn on a particular transcript in response to specific zzso The overall architecture of zzso guarantees an exquisite regulation in the expression of the zzso
