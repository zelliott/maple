zzso grow by zzso nutrients using a complex network of zzso zzso During this process new biological material is produced along with energy used for maintaining cellular zzso Because the zzso network is highly zzso these tasks can be accomplished using a wide variety of unique reaction zzso However, evolutionary pressures under zzso growth conditions likely select organisms that zzso highly efficient zzso Using zzso analysis, we demonstrate that the metabolism of the zzso zzso coli contains four unique pathways that most efficiently convert zzso and oxygen into new cells and maintenance energy under any level of oxygen zzso zzso regulatory patterns and experimental findings suggest growing cells use these highly efficient zzso It is predicted that five knockout zzso generate a strain that supports growth using only the most efficient reaction zzso The analysis approach should be generally useful for predicting zzso capabilities and efficient network designs based on only zzso zzso
