Elementary modes zzso analysis has been well zzso The existing zzso for assigning weights to zzso cannot be directly applied for large-scale zzso networks, since the tremendous number of modes would make the zzso a time-consuming or even an impossible zzso zzso developing more efficient methods to deal with large set of zzso is zzso 

We develop a method to evaluate the performance of employing a subset of the elementary modes to reconstruct a real flux distribution by using the relative error between the real flux zzso and the reconstructed one as an zzso We have found a power function relationship between the decrease of relative error and the increase of the number of the selecting zzso and a zzso relationship between the increases of the number of zzso weighted zzso and that of the number of the selecting zzso Our discoveries show that it is possible to reconstruct a given flux distribution by a selected subset of zzso from a large zzso network and zzso they help us identify the zzso zzso to represent the cellular metabolism for such a zzso
