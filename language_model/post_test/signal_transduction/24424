We have previously examined the zzso of 28 commercially available compounds, reported to be relatively selective zzso of particular zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and Cohen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we have extended this analysis to a further 14 zzso Of these, zzso SP zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to inhibit a number of protein zzso and conclusions drawn from their use in zzso zzso are likely to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso were more specific, but still inhibited two or more protein zzso with similar zzso Our results suggest that the combined use of zzso and zzso may be useful for identifying zzso and zzso roles of zzso protein zzso whereas the combined use of zzso and zzso may be useful for identifying zzso and zzso roles of zzso zzso zzso zzso The combined use of zzso zzso and either zzso or zzso may be useful for identifying zzso of zzso family zzso zzso zzso one of the main zzso constituents of tea, inhibited two of the 28 protein zzso in the panel, zzso zzso and regulated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
