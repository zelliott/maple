zzso smoking is an important risk factor for zzso zzso The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of zzso a major component of cigarette smoke, on zzso zzso production and cellular zzso via zzso zzso receptors zzso in human zzso zzso cells zzso 

zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso in three different zzso lines zzso 4, zzso and zzso was assessed using reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso were zzso by zzso nicotine in the presence or absence of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production was then examined using real-time zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso 4 cell line was also evaluated by Western zzso 

zzso expressed several zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso of zzso from zzso that were cultured in the presence of zzso or zzso zzso zzso and also induced the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso calcium zzso reduced the zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso was decreased by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor or zzso calcium zzso 

These findings indicate that nicotine increases zzso production in zzso zzso cells via zzso zzso following zzso zzso after zzso zzso
