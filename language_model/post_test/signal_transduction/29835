Mechanical stimulation is known to zzso cell physiology in a variety of different zzso zzso zzso cells are permanently exposed to mechanical stimulation generated by zzso applied zzso The present in zzso study demonstrated mechanical pressure as a zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Mechanical pressure applied by zzso weights zzso led to a rapid zzso of zzso zzso between 5 and zzso Furthermore, zzso of the small heat shock protein 27 zzso was shown in response to mechanical zzso zzso of zzso function by using specific zzso blocked the zzso zzso of zzso In order to identify upstream regulators of zzso a contribution of zzso and protein zzso C zzso in zzso was zzso We could demonstrate that zzso of zzso or zzso suppressed the zzso zzso of zzso These findings suggest mechanical pressure as a new type of zzso stimulus for the zzso zzso with implications to zzso zzso zzso
