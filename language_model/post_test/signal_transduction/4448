In addition to the zzso status of zzso the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso might function as bona fide zzso of zzso zzso sensitivity for most zzso zzso 

zzso small hairpin zzso were employed to specifically reduce zzso or zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to monitor the impact of zzso and zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein expression levels were assessed by quantitative zzso in parental zzso cells and in pooled populations of zzso cells adapted to grow in the presence of zzso A zzso platform was used to measure the relative level of zzso of 42 distinct zzso zzso zzso before and after the acquisition of resistance to zzso 

zzso gene zzso of either zzso was found to notably reduce the expression of the other zzso zzso zzso cells with normal expression levels of zzso exhibited significantly increased growth zzso in response to zzso compared with derivatives that are engineered to produce minimal zzso The parental zzso cells acutely treated with zzso exhibited reduced zzso expression levels of zzso zzso populations of zzso zzso cells expressed significantly lower levels of zzso and were insensitive to the zzso effects of zzso zzso screen identified a remarkable zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells, which gained sensitivity to the zzso and zzso effects of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso The zzso parental cells acutely treated with zzso rapidly activated zzso and their zzso exposure to zzso and zzso resulted in synergistic zzso 

zzso of zzso expression may explain the tight zzso of zzso and zzso as well as their tendency to be more highly expressed than other zzso zzso to determine zzso zzso The positive selection for zzso zzso cells exhibiting zzso zzso may have an important role in the emergence of zzso zzso As zzso of zzso activity rapidly replaces the loss of zzso zzso in terms of cell proliferation and survival, combinations of zzso and zzso drugs may be a valuable strategy to enhance the efficacy of single zzso while preventing or delaying acquired resistance to zzso
