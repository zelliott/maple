The zzso related zzso zzso a member of zzso zzso zzso zzso was recently reported to function as a potent tumor zzso in several cancer zzso However, the expression level and functional significance of zzso in human zzso zzso which is characterized by high migration and invasion potential, have never been zzso We reported here that zzso reduced cell migration and invasion via zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso The zzso and protein levels of zzso were significantly zzso in human primary zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso inhibited migration and invasion of zzso cells and zzso of the zzso zzso 2 zzso an index of migration and zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso inhibited zzso of zzso and zzso which play important role in cell migration and zzso Finally, the effects of zzso on cell migration and invasion and zzso zzso were abolished by zzso a zzso specific zzso In zzso these results clearly indicate that zzso may play a protective role against the progression of zzso by suppressing cell migration and invasion, suggesting that zzso needs to be further studied in its detail mechanism and clinical zzso
