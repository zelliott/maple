zzso zzso insulin like growth factors I and II zzso I, zzso zzso insulin and zzso growth factor zzso induce a zzso to zzso increase of zzso zzso binding sites at the cell surface of human skin zzso The increase is completed within zzso zzso is dose and temperature dependent, zzso and transient even in the presence of the zzso It is due to a zzso of zzso zzso II receptors from internal zzso to the cell surface, while the affinity of the receptors is not zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso I, zzso II or zzso stimulate the zzso of the zzso to the cell surface in an additive manner, while combinations of the growth factors result in a zzso stimulation of zzso The zzso is not dependent on zzso calcium and appears also to be independent of changes of free zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso toxin or zzso toxin increases the number of cell surface receptors zzso and zzso zzso Neither of the toxins affects the zzso of zzso zzso II receptors induced by the growth factors, while both toxins abolish the zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso These results suggest a multiple regulation of the cell surface expression of zzso zzso II receptors by zzso and zzso proteins sensitive to zzso toxin and zzso toxin and by stimulation of zzso zzso II, zzso I and zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
