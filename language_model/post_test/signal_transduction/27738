The zzso of zzso zzso zzso with release of zzso and zzso in mature zzso cells and the zzso zzso of this activity by zzso such as zzso zzso factor zzso are central to the inflammatory zzso Yet, there are few data concerning zzso activity and its regulation by growth factors in primary zzso zzso We therefore analyzed the zzso activity of mobilized human zzso zzso zzso stem cells by zzso of the zzso release of zzso The zzso activity of zzso cells zzso with calcium zzso zzso was of similar magnitude to that of mature zzso and zzso zzso of zzso cells with stem cell factor zzso before zzso resulted in primed zzso activity, whereas zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis factor alpha had no significant zzso When zzso cells were induced to zzso zzso activity remained responsive to zzso for several days, but after 8 days, at which stage zzso and functional evidence of maturation was zzso zzso of zzso by zzso could no longer be zzso whereas responses to zzso and zzso had zzso The further metabolism of zzso acid to zzso by zzso cells was not detected by either zzso zzso zzso zzso or differential zzso zzso zzso the rapid but transient zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, and we used the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which at 30 zzso blocks zzso zzso in zzso cells, to investigate whether zzso zzso of zzso release was zzso by this zzso zzso zzso only partially inhibited zzso zzso activity primed by zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso and possibly a further signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (5 zzso a dual inhibitor of i and zzso zzso completely inhibited zzso release without affecting zzso zzso demonstrating the lack of cellular zzso These data provide the first evidence that primitive zzso cells have the capacity to release zzso which is regulated by an early acting zzso growth factor important for the growth and survival of these zzso
