The series of events leading to zzso zzso following zzso recognition has been extensively zzso Although the exact mechanisms of zzso binding and transmission of this zzso interaction into a productive zzso signaling sequence remains incomplete, it has been known for many years that the zzso zzso zzso motifs zzso of the zzso zzso zzso complex are required for initiation of this signaling cascade because of the recruitment and zzso of multiple protein zzso zzso signaling zzso and adapter zzso It however remains unclear why the zzso complex requires 10 zzso while many other zzso immune zzso such as zzso receptors zzso and the B cell zzso zzso contain far fewer zzso We have recently demonstrated that various parameters of T cell development and zzso are influenced by the number, as well as location and type, of zzso within the zzso complex and hence propose that the zzso is capable of zzso zzso that zzso the initiation and orchestration of diverse zzso zzso While many of the underlying mechanisms remain hypothetical, this review intends to zzso what we have learned from conventional zzso analyses regarding initiation and diversification of zzso zzso with more recent evidence from molecular and fluorescent microscopic zzso to propose a broader purpose for the zzso zzso Rather than simply signal zzso individual zzso may also be responsible for the differential recruitment of signaling and regulatory molecules which ultimately affects zzso development, zzso and zzso
