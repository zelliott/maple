The expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso is controlled by the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso which is activated by zzso zzso leading to zzso induction of target zzso Here, we show that a second level of zzso control exists in zzso which is tightly linked to the zzso factor zzso signaling zzso In transgenic mice, zzso expression of zzso (and other zzso zzso is zzso by the expression of zzso activated zzso in the absence of zzso compounds but zzso after knockout of zzso These effects were further analyzed in zzso and the zzso role of zzso was ascribed to a zzso site within the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso signaling acted zzso with zzso zzso via zzso sites on the DNA during the induction of zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso enhanced the zzso potential of zzso zzso at its zzso sites without altering the total amount of zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a physical interaction between zzso and zzso Furthermore, the present results suggest that zzso induction of the zzso by zzso does not play a major role in zzso regulation of zzso expression and that zzso of zzso signaling by zzso zzso as recently observed in the zzso does not occur in mouse zzso In conclusion, signaling through zzso activates zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso induction by zzso zzso through enhancement of the zzso potential of the zzso
