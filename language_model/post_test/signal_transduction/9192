The zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso surface of the plasma membrane through dual zzso of its zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso Here, the zzso zzso signal is found to consist of three zzso 1) a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that includes the zzso zzso zzso 2) the zzso zzso domain zzso and mapping between these two zzso and 3) a zzso poorly zzso zzso zzso The zzso which contains the zzso zzso as well as an important zzso zzso likely serves as an zzso recognition element, because zzso zzso disrupt zzso within a zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso contribution appears to be complex with roles for both zzso activity zzso zzso zzso and structure zzso zzso recognition zzso zzso and zzso zzso are strongly zzso suggesting that, like the zzso the zzso may also participate at the zzso recognition zzso The long, zzso domain, which is located between the zzso and zzso is predicted to be zzso zzso and may function as a flexible, zzso zzso allowing a coupled interaction of the zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso signals may prove to be a general feature of this large class of zzso zzso These soluble proteins have no clear means of zzso zzso and thus may require active capture out of the zzso for zzso by their zzso zzso
