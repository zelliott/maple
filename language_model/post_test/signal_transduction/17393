Human zzso zzso E6 proteins of high-risk alpha types target a select group of zzso zzso zzso proteins by using a zzso zzso motif zzso an interaction that can be zzso regulated by zzso of the E6 zzso by protein zzso A zzso Here, we have zzso the zzso zzso recognition motif that partially zzso with the E6 zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and compared the effect of this zzso on the zzso life cycle in primary zzso with the zzso zzso and with a second zzso zzso that lacks the E6 zzso zzso Loss of zzso recognition of E6 was associated with increased growth of the zzso cells relative to cells carrying the zzso zzso and upon stratification, a more zzso zzso with an increase in the number of zzso competent cells in the upper zzso zzso while the opposite was seen with the zzso zzso Moreover, the growth of zzso zzso cells was sensitive to changes in zzso activity, and these changes were associated with increased zzso of the E6 zzso In marked contrast to zzso zzso the zzso zzso exhibited no deleterious effects on viral zzso amplification or expression of late zzso Our data suggest that the E6 zzso function is zzso regulated by zzso in the zzso life zzso We speculate that zzso of protein zzso signaling pathways could lead to changes in E6 zzso function, which in turn could have a bearing on tumor promotion and zzso
