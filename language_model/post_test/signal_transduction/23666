Recently, a cohort of zzso including zzso was reported to be zzso during zzso induction by zzso zzso zzso It remains unclear how changes in zzso expression collaborate with bone zzso factors to activate the biological pathways that regulate the differentiation of bone zzso stem cells zzso Here the effects of zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso differentiation of zzso were investigated using mimics and zzso of zzso small interfering zzso for zzso of zzso and plasmids for zzso of zzso Our results showed that zzso expression decreased progressively in zzso cultures during zzso zzso of zzso dramatically increased the alkaline zzso activity and zzso in zzso zzso Additionally, zzso diminished the levels of the zzso protein without significantly affecting zzso zzso levels, and zzso directly zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso significantly reduced expression of the zzso zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso Furthermore, the high expression of zzso in zzso cultured in the proliferation medium zzso zzso protein levels, which may contribute to the maintenance of zzso in an zzso zzso In conclusion, our results suggest that a zzso zzso and zzso regulatory mechanism may play an important role in inducing zzso zzso zzso The results of this study provide us with a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern the zzso zzso
