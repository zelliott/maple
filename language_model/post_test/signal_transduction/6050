zzso zzso is a zzso that is expressed and zzso by numerous human zzso zzso functions in cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suppression, zzso zzso prevention of zzso and zzso growth of tumor cells by regulating zzso interactions and cellular signaling through binding with zzso and zzso zzso While zzso expression of zzso exists in several cell types, induced expression has been detected in zzso zzso cells, bone cells, zzso and tumor cells in zzso processes such as zzso zzso bone zzso and tumor zzso Recently, substantial evidence has linked zzso with the regulation of zzso spread by tumor zzso However, the molecular mechanisms that define the role of zzso in tumor zzso are incompletely zzso zzso regulators that contribute to the induction of zzso expression have received significant attention as potential zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The following review will discuss the molecular structure of zzso the evidence for its functional role in tumor cell zzso the downstream signals that activate invasive mechanisms, and the recent reports concerning regulation of zzso zzso
