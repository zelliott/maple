In zzso cell zzso syndrome zzso patients, zzso of a zzso patched zzso which encodes a putative signal zzso of sonic zzso protein zzso were found and are thought to be one of the major causes of zzso The zzso signaling zzso is an important zzso pathway, and zzso protein zzso is a zzso component serving as a zzso for the zzso zzso Another zzso zzso zzso zzso forms a complex with zzso and regulates this signaling zzso Recent transgenic studies have strengthened the importance of the zzso signaling system in the zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso In this study, we examined the expression patterns of zzso for zzso and zzso in two different zzso zzso and normal zzso We found that the expressions of zzso and zzso zzso were enhanced in the tumor nests of the zzso zzso especially at the advancing portions, but were under the zzso level in the superficial zzso cases zzso indicating that zzso and zzso zzso expressions might be associated with zzso tumor progression and divide the zzso zzso types into two zzso superficial and zzso zzso In addition, no obvious signals for zzso and zzso zzso were detected in the normal human zzso zzso or zzso zzso indicating that the abnormal proliferation of zzso zzso cells caused by zzso zzso and/or other genetic changes, which also cause zzso and zzso zzso might result in zzso tumor zzso
