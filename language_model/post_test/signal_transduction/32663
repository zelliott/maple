We have examined the potential roles of zzso zzso regulation and of multiple zzso elements in control of the directed migration of cultured zzso zzso cells zzso zzso were found to migrate in response to zzso growth factor zzso or to a lesser extent to basic zzso growth factor zzso in a zzso zzso This response was inhibited by zzso of zzso zzso by using zzso zzso migration was not evoked by the neurotransmitter zzso zzso or zzso which elevate zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso did not affect zzso migration to zzso Within growth zzso leading edges of migratory zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found to be zzso with zzso and zzso zzso was prominent in zzso extending beyond the leading zzso zzso was distributed throughout zzso processes and cell zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso by using zzso B or zzso respectively, altered zzso zzso and markedly impaired zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso which prevents zzso zzso zzso greatly inhibited the zzso response at zzso that did not disrupt cell zzso These results indicate that growth factors stimulate zzso migration by zzso pathways which include zzso zzso regulation, and characterize the distribution of multiple zzso elements involved in the generation of directed zzso zzso
