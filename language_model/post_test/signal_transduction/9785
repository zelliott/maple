The prion diseases occur following the conversion of the cellular prion protein zzso into a zzso zzso zzso In this study a cell painting technique was used to examine the role of the zzso zzso anchor attached to zzso in prion zzso The introduction of zzso to infected zzso cells increased the cholesterol content of cell zzso increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso In contrast, zzso with a zzso zzso anchor did not alter the amount of cholesterol in cell zzso was not found within zzso zzso and did not activate zzso Although zzso zzso remains within cells for longer than native zzso it was not converted to zzso Moreover, the presence of zzso zzso displaced zzso from zzso zzso zzso reducing the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso of the zzso anchor attached to zzso zzso the local membrane zzso that control some cell signaling zzso the trafficking of zzso and zzso zzso In addition, such observations raise the possibility that the pharmacological modification of zzso anchors might constitute a novel therapeutic approach to prion zzso
