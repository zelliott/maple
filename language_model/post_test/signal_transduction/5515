zzso and the zzso zzso complex activate the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso at stalled replication zzso zzso is recruited to stalled zzso through its binding partner, zzso protein zzso however, it is unclear how zzso and zzso are recruited so that they may join zzso and initiate zzso In this study, we use zzso zzso egg extracts to determine the requirements for zzso zzso We show that zzso is required for the recruitment of both zzso and DNA zzso zzso to sites of replication zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso is also directly required for zzso zzso Our study identifies an assembly pathway, which is controlled by zzso and includes zzso that mediates the loading of the zzso complex onto stalled replication zzso These findings clarify early events in the assembly of checkpoint signaling complexes on DNA and identify zzso as a critical sensor of replication zzso
