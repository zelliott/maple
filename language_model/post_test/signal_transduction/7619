We previously reported that zzso growth factor 1 zzso protects cochlear hair cells against zzso through zzso of the zzso and zzso pathways in supporting zzso In this study, we found that IGF-1 zzso the expression levels of zzso and zzso as measured using zzso zzso analysis and zzso Using zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso we reveal that both pathways are involved in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the time window of zzso and zzso zzso was limited to within zzso after IGF-1 treatment, indicating that downstream gene expression was tightly controlled by zzso
