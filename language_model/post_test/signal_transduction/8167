We examined the effect of zzso drugs, zzso and zzso on the expression of zzso zzso and gamma chains and zzso of the gamma chains in rat zzso leukemia zzso zzso The cells were cultured for 24 h with zzso treatment in the presence of zzso or zzso at the concentration of zzso zzso The zzso zzso expression was determined by northern zzso zzso The protein level of zzso expressed on the plasma membrane was examined following zzso treatment by zzso with zzso light chain, followed by western zzso analysis with zzso chain of zzso zzso and zzso had no effect on the zzso beta and gamma zzso zzso Although the amount of gamma chain assembled into zzso zzso was not changed by treatment with zzso nor zzso zzso levels of gamma chains of zzso zzso were inhibited by zzso The zzso effect of zzso on the zzso expression of zzso protein is not due to their zzso of zzso and protein zzso but due to zzso zzso of the gamma zzso which is important for initiation of zzso signaling cascade zzso by zzso zzso
