zzso is a scaffolding protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the plasma zzso In addition to regulating cholesterol zzso zzso has the ability to bind a diverse array of cell signaling molecules and regulate cell signal zzso in zzso Currently, there is little known about the role of zzso in stem zzso It has been reported that the zzso zzso mouse has an expanded population of cells expressing stem cell markers in the gut, zzso zzso and brain, suggestive of a role for zzso in stem cell zzso The zzso zzso mouse also has increased bone mass and an increased bone formation rate, and its bone zzso zzso stem cells zzso have enhanced zzso zzso However, the role of zzso in human zzso zzso differentiation remains zzso In this study, we have characterized the expression of zzso in human bone zzso derived zzso We show that zzso protein is enriched in density zzso zzso plasma zzso consisting of zzso zzso diameter zzso zzso and is distributed in a zzso pattern by zzso zzso zzso of zzso increases in zzso induced to undergo zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso expression enhances zzso proliferation and zzso zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso normally acts to regulate the differentiation and renewal of zzso and increased zzso expression during zzso osteogenesis likely acts as a negative feedback to stabilize the cell zzso
