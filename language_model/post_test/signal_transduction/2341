We conducted zzso and zzso labeling experiments to determine directly whether zzso of zzso in zzso is zzso and if zzso is zzso The rates of turnover of zzso protein and associated zzso groups were zzso using cultured zzso zzso zzso and the zzso cell line zzso The zzso of zzso bound to zzso was approximately 5 zzso whereas the zzso of the zzso zzso was greater than 50 zzso zzso and zzso labeling experiments were carried out in the presence of various zzso of cellular signaling zzso Our data indicate that dynamic zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso are zzso and are not regulated by G protein zzso or other signals that control growth cone zzso
