zzso zzso zzso regulates gene zzso through the nuclear vitamin D zzso zzso and zzso rapid cellular responses via an unknown zzso Here we report that zzso zzso a rapid increase in synthesis of zzso protein and its transport to the zzso These results are similarly obtained in zzso leukemia cell lines, and in blast cells from blood of patients diagnosed with acute zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our results suggest that stability of zzso zzso is zzso and zzso and that zzso of zzso leads to its increased translation and nuclear zzso The zzso localized in the cell nucleus is not exported back to the zzso by zzso zzso We also show that the zzso portion of zzso in leukemia cells is localized in the vicinity of the plasma zzso close to the zzso zzso
