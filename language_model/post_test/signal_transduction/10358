Head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso represents the sixth most frequent type of cancer zzso However, the molecular genetic zzso underlying its zzso behavior and progression are little zzso We showed previously that zzso directly activates the expression of the DNA zzso break repair gene zzso and zzso zzso contributes to zzso Here, we investigate the role of zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso analysis of zzso expression was done in 81 locally advanced zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis were used to confirm zzso zzso Human zzso cancer cell lines zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso short interference zzso to repress zzso zzso zzso were generated by stable zzso Soft zzso zzso zzso was used to determine the transformation zzso Western zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso zzso were done to evaluate the signaling pathways that were zzso 

zzso zzso was identified in zzso of advanced zzso zzso It was an independent marker of poor zzso zzso expression levels correlated with the transformation activity of zzso clones and also correlated with the zzso levels of zzso and its downstream target zzso target of zzso zzso zzso activity was increased in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also correlated with increased zzso zzso levels in tumor zzso 

Increased zzso expression is a significant zzso marker of advanced zzso and the underlying mechanism may involve the zzso of the zzso zzso
