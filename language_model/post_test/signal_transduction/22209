zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso has been shown to activate zzso and zzso zzso family through the zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we found that zzso rapidly activated a zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, we demonstrated the functional involvement of zzso in zzso zzso degradation and zzso zzso since a zzso zzso zzso effectively inhibited this signaling zzso Furthermore, zzso failed to induce zzso degradation and zzso zzso in zzso zzso expressing zzso compared with zzso zzso expressing zzso In addition, the introduction of zzso zzso but not zzso dead zzso zzso zzso restored the zzso efficient zzso of zzso in zzso zzso expressing zzso resulting in the induction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was unaffected by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, these data demonstrate that zzso plays an important role in regulating zzso zzso zzso
