Despite significant efforts toward understanding the molecular basis of zzso communication, the mechanisms by which local energetic and zzso changes zzso diffuse from zzso sites to zzso regions across the zzso structure of zzso proteins remain to be zzso Recent experimental and theoretical evidence supports the view that zzso communication is facilitated by the intrinsic ability of the zzso to undergo collective changes in structure, triggered by zzso zzso Two groups of studies recently proved to provide insights into such zzso zzso zzso elastic network models that permit us to zzso the cooperative changes in zzso that are most readily accessible near native state conditions, and zzso approaches that zzso the most efficient pathways of signal transmission favored by the overall zzso Using a combination of these two approaches, we zzso by way of application to the bacterial zzso complex zzso how the most cooperative modes of motion play a role in zzso the propagation of zzso zzso A functional zzso between the global dynamics sampled under equilibrium conditions and the signal zzso pathways inherently favored by network zzso appears to control zzso zzso
