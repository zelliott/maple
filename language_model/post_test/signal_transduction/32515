zzso The zzso effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso was studied in the isolated guinea pig zzso in the presence of different compounds which alter zzso levels of zzso zzso and of the G proteins blocker zzso zzso zzso The action of zzso zzso on zzso zzso was not modified either by zzso and zzso (which increase zzso zzso or by zzso and zzso blue (which increase and decrease, respectively zzso zzso zzso Drugs affecting zzso zzso levels were also ineffective against the zzso effect of the alpha 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso toxin significantly reduced the maximum zzso induced by zzso zzso and zzso without influencing the effect of low zzso of the above zzso zzso it shifted to the right in a parallel way the zzso effect of zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso of zzso transmission in the guinea pig zzso is not linked to zzso zzso zzso zzso the signal zzso mechanism activated by zzso zzso involves zzso toxin both sensitive and insensitive G zzso
