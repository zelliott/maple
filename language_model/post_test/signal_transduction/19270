A major question in zzso tissue engineering is how much of the zzso of native zzso needs to be reproduced for effective tissue zzso zzso supplied to cells in zzso scaffolds in zzso is initially dependent upon diffusion through the scaffold and cell zzso Low zzso zzso enhances specific cell zzso but where zzso is critically low zzso zzso cell survival becomes zzso We measured real-time zzso in zzso scaffolds and introduced zzso architecture to zzso increase delivery of zzso to cells and switch off the hypoxic zzso zzso zzso zzso gives adequate zzso and can be used to control cell generated zzso zzso
