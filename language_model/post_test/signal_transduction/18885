zzso zzso is the founding member of a novel family of inflammatory zzso Although produced by T cells, zzso activates genes and signals typical of innate immune zzso such as tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso Most zzso target genes characterized to date are zzso or zzso zzso Our recent zzso studies identified an acute phase response zzso zzso 2, as a novel zzso zzso Here we describe a detailed analysis of the zzso zzso We find that, unlike zzso or zzso gene target zzso zzso is regulated primarily at the level of zzso rather than zzso stability and that zzso between zzso and zzso occurs at the level of the zzso zzso Two key zzso factor binding sites zzso were identified, corresponding to zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso of either site eliminated zzso promoter activity in response to zzso These findings were zzso similar to the zzso promoter, where zzso regulation of both zzso and zzso is zzso To determine whether joint use of zzso and zzso is common to all zzso target zzso we performed a zzso analysis on 18 well documented zzso target promoters to assess statistical enrichment of specific zzso Indeed, zzso and zzso sites were zzso in these zzso as were zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, these promoters fell into three zzso zzso based on zzso location and zzso Analysis of zzso target gene regulation is key for understanding this important zzso zzso and also contributes to an understanding of upstream signaling mechanisms used by zzso either alone or in concert with zzso
