In adult zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso with many zzso zzso to stimulate the proliferation of zzso zzso In zzso development, the zzso signaling zzso is important in the formation of some derivatives of zzso zzso However, the function of zzso in the zzso of the embryonic zzso lineage has remained zzso Here we address the role of zzso in the zzso of the zzso lineage in the zzso zzso We report that zzso injection of embryonic zzso zzso zzso at as little as 10 zzso at the zzso stage suppresses zzso blood island zzso formation, whereas expression of the dominant negative form of the zzso zzso in the lateral zzso where zzso no blood tissue is formed, results in a dramatic expansion of the zzso Similar results were observed in isolated zzso marginal zones and animal zzso Bone zzso zzso zzso is known to induce zzso in the zzso zzso zzso we examined how the zzso and zzso signaling pathways might interact in the decision of zzso zzso to form zzso We observed that zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso regulating expression of the zzso downstream zzso zzso and zzso zzso which stimulates zzso is suppressed by zzso zzso which we demonstrate to inhibit blood development, is enhanced by zzso Additionally, zzso and zzso zzso regulate zzso of each zzso Thus, zzso zzso two zzso factors which have opposing effects on blood zzso The zzso and zzso signaling pathways interact to regulate the zzso of the zzso zzso
