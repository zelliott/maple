Mothers against zzso or zzso proteins are essential components of zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways that are regulated by zzso Recently, it was demonstrated that zzso interacts zzso with and is a direct zzso of the transforming growth zzso zzso type I zzso zzso zzso sites on zzso were localized to a zzso zzso containing three zzso zzso at positions zzso zzso and zzso In this report, we show that zzso specifically zzso zzso on zzso 465 and zzso zzso zzso is not a site of zzso but is important for efficient zzso of zzso zzso at both sites is required to mediate association of zzso with zzso in zzso cells, while in zzso zzso interacts directly with zzso and does not require zzso zzso of either zzso zzso 465 or zzso prevents zzso of zzso from activated zzso and blocks zzso signaling and zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso of zzso on zzso 465 and zzso is required in zzso cells to permit association with zzso and to zzso zzso zzso
