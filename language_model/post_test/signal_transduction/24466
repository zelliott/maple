zzso and zzso zzso are two distinct populations of free cholesterol, zzso zzso cell surface zzso They differ in stability, shape, and the presence or absence of zzso zzso in zzso or zzso proteins zzso in zzso zzso In primary cells, zzso and zzso support the assembly of different signaling complexes, though signal zzso from both is strongly dependent on the presence of zzso It was initially thought that zzso promoted the formation of inactive reservoirs of signaling zzso Recent data supports the concept of a more dynamic role for zzso in zzso and probably, also zzso zzso It is more likely that the zzso content of these zzso is actively modulated as protein complexes are formed and, following signal zzso zzso In transformed cell lines with few zzso little zzso and a preponderance of zzso complexes normally assembled on zzso may function in zzso albeit with altered zzso However, zzso and zzso zzso appear not to be zzso The presence of zzso pools of zzso in recycling zzso zzso the zzso network zzso and in mobile zzso complexes is now zzso A role in the zzso of zzso by cells ascribed to zzso now seems more likely to be zzso by cell surface zzso
