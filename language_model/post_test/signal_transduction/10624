The aim of this study is to investigate whether there are any abnormalities in the in zzso expression of zzso acid receptors zzso zzso and zzso and zzso X receptors zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cell zzso 

zzso of zzso receptors in paired specimens of zzso zzso zzso zzso 10) and adjacent normal zzso zzso zzso 10) from 10 patients with zzso cell zzso was studied zzso by using zzso zzso zzso 

In eight of the 10 normal tissue samples, all six receptors were zzso In the other two samples, all receptors were expressed except zzso (one zzso or zzso zzso zzso Five zzso zzso lacked zzso zzso expression was lower in zzso than in normal zzso in eight of 10 zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso of nine of 10 zzso zzso expression was at least as high in zzso as in normal tissue in eight of 10 zzso Two zzso lacked zzso three zzso had lower zzso expression than paired normal zzso four had the same zzso zzso and one had higher zzso zzso zzso expression was strong in all normal zzso and zzso zzso Ten zzso lacked zzso and all 10 zzso lacked zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso expression might be related to the development of zzso cell zzso Additional studies are required to establish whether the defects in zzso expression in zzso cell zzso might affect the potential response of this zzso to treatment with zzso
