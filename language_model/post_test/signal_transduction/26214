It has been demonstrated that growth factors produced by breast cancer cells stimulate zzso expression in both breast cancer and adjacent zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, whether these growth factors affect zzso activity by other mechanisms still remain zzso In the current study, zzso and zzso zzso zzso breast zzso cells were used to explore the mechanisms of zzso regulation of zzso activity by growth factor zzso Our study reveals that zzso and zzso zzso suppressed zzso activity in zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso This is due to enhanced zzso zzso as compensation after the zzso zzso has been zzso IGF-1 treatment increased zzso activity in both breast cancer cell zzso In addition, zzso cells zzso zzso deprived zzso zzso which have enhanced zzso activity, show higher zzso activity compared to parental zzso cells, but the zzso protein level remains the zzso These results suggest that zzso activity could be enhanced by growth factor signaling pathways via zzso zzso
