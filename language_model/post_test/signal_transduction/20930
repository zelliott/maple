In zzso zzso there are a large number of genes zzso zzso putative zzso zzso which, together with a zzso zzso gene zzso belong to a zzso of zzso zzso zzso We have performed a systematic analysis of the zzso and zzso genes and their function in zzso zzso zzso zzso was below the detection level in the zzso zzso strain growing on zzso zzso of the kinetic parameters of individual zzso zzso proteins zzso expressed in the zzso zzso background revealed zzso and zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as moderately low in affinity zzso about 10 zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso 1-2 zzso However, zzso zzso in cells grown on low zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso component zzso zzso 60 zzso Furthermore, we investigated the involvement of zzso transport in zzso zzso zzso repression of zzso zzso and zzso was not dependent on a specific zzso but, instead, the strength of the repression signal was dependent on the level of zzso the properties of the individual zzso and the kind of sugar zzso The strength of the zzso repression signal correlated with the zzso consumption rates in the different zzso indicating that zzso transport limits the provision of a triggering signal rather then being directly involved in the triggering zzso
