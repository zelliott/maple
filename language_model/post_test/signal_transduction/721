zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso mediates zzso and zzso stress zzso zzso in a zzso zzso However, the underlying mechanism has not been zzso In this study, we show that zzso is localized in both zzso and zzso of zzso cells zzso where it binds to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso domain of zzso are critical for binding of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso at zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso of zzso at zzso specifically increased zzso zzso without effects on zzso zzso We further show that a zzso inhibitor zzso completely blocks zzso induced zzso zzso Bid zzso and zzso zzso zzso but only partially zzso zzso c release and zzso death, suggesting that zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso pathways in zzso zzso expression of a zzso active zzso strongly zzso zzso zzso without zzso zzso Bid zzso and zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso mediates a zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso To determine the role of zzso in regulation of zzso zzso activity, we show that zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso without effects on zzso zzso zzso Moreover, specific zzso of zzso in zzso increases zzso zzso c release and cell death without increase in zzso zzso Bid zzso and zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso in zzso and zzso mediate distinct zzso pathways induced by zzso and zzso and zzso zzso inhibit zzso zzso
