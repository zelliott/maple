zzso growth cones zzso steer in response to zzso cues using mechanisms that include local protein zzso This zzso form of gene regulation occurs with spatial precision and depends on zzso zzso zzso Recent zzso studies have shown unexpectedly complex and zzso changing zzso zzso in growing zzso and zzso zzso targeting of some transcripts seems to be highly selective and involves sequence diversity in zzso regions generated by zzso and/or zzso zzso New evidence reports direct zzso of a guidance zzso to the protein synthesis machinery and other findings demonstrate that some guidance cues can repress zzso The recent findings shed further light on the exquisitely regulated process that enables distant cellular compartments to respond to local zzso
