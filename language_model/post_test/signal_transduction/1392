zzso recovery and zzso change after spinal zzso injury in the zzso mice and the zzso mice were zzso 

To investigate the role of the zzso zzso zzso system as a signal zzso zzso leading to zzso after spinal zzso zzso 

zzso zzso observed after spinal zzso injury has recently gained widespread interest as a cause of collateral damage after the initial zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso in the zzso brain or spinal zzso was zzso Recently, the zzso of zzso after spinal zzso injury was also zzso However, the influence of zzso zzso on the extent of the secondary spinal zzso injury has not yet been zzso 

We investigated zzso zzso after spinal zzso injury and examined the behavioral changes and the zzso changes after spinal zzso injury using zzso zzso mice, which were zzso zzso mice, and zzso zzso mice, which were zzso zzso zzso 

zzso recovery after spinal zzso injury in zzso mice was superior to that observed in zzso zzso In addition, the damaged area in zzso mice was significantly smaller than that seen in zzso zzso Further, the frequency of zzso cells in the injured spinal zzso of zzso mice was significantly less than that in zzso zzso 

We demonstrated the appearance of zzso zzso in the spinal zzso after spinal zzso zzso In addition, we zzso for the first time that zzso zzso following spinal zzso injury played an important role in the spinal zzso damage and the ultimate zzso zzso
