Our current understanding of cellular networks is rather zzso We over look important but so far unknown genes and mechanisms in the zzso Moreover, we often only have a partial account of the molecular interactions and modifications of the known zzso When analyzing the cell, we look through narrow windows leaving potentially important events in blind zzso Network reconstruction is naturally confined to what we have zzso Little is known on how the incompleteness of our observations confounds our interpretation of the available zzso Here we ask which features of a network can be zzso by incomplete observations and which zzso In the context of zzso effects models, we show that in the presence of missing observations or hidden factors a reliable reconstruction of the full network is not zzso Nevertheless, we can show that certain characteristics of signaling networks like the existence of zzso between certain branches of the network can be zzso in a zzso zzso We derive a test for zzso such zzso characteristics of signaling zzso Next, we introduce a new data structure to represent partially reconstructed signaling zzso Finally, we evaluate our method both on simulated data and in the context of a study on early stem cell differentiation in zzso
