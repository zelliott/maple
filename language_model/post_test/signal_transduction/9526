zzso has been implicated in the zzso of type 1 zzso When administered early in life, zzso zzso and increases diabetes in zzso zzso However, when administered late, zzso decreases diabetes zzso and delays zzso zzso zzso mice were fully protected from diabetes and only showed mild zzso To further dissect how zzso zzso affects type 1 diabetes, these mice were crossed to zzso zzso highly zzso zzso transgenic zzso zzso mice and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mice were protected from diabetes and had significantly less zzso compared with wild type zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso mice rejected zzso zzso zzso as efficiently as control zzso confirming that zzso signaling is not directly required for zzso cell zzso zzso zzso analysis showed a significant increase in the number of zzso T regulatory cells in zzso zzso zzso T regulatory cells were functionally better at suppressing zzso cells than were wild type T regulatory cells both in zzso and in zzso This study suggests that blocking zzso signaling may be beneficial in increasing the function of T regulatory cells and suppression of type 1 zzso
