Breast cancer cell lines that express the nuclear zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso can be prompted to undergo growth arrest and differentiation when treated with synthetic zzso gamma zzso To evaluate the therapeutic potential of increased zzso gamma signaling in zzso we generated transgenic mice that express a zzso active form of zzso gamma in zzso zzso These mice are indistinguishable from their zzso zzso However, when bred to a transgenic strain prone to zzso zzso cancer, zzso animals develop tumors with greatly accelerated zzso Surprisingly, in spite of their more zzso nature, zzso tumors are more zzso and zzso The molecular basis of this zzso effect may be an increase in zzso zzso as zzso zzso of zzso gamma zzso zzso function in an in zzso model of this zzso These results suggest that once an initiating event has taken place, increased zzso gamma signaling serves as a tumor promoter in the zzso zzso
