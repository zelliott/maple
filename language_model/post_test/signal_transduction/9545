The zzso protein zzso regulates zzso zzso migration in the embryonic brain, promotes zzso outgrowth in the developing zzso zzso and strengthens synaptic transmission in the adult zzso zzso zzso mice expressing reduced levels of zzso are zzso normal but exhibit behavioral and zzso zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso spine density is reduced in the developing zzso of these zzso In this study, we investigated the consequence of zzso zzso on zzso formation in adult zzso zzso mice using imaging and zzso zzso Using a zzso colony that expresses yellow fluorescent protein in selected zzso we analyzed spine density in zzso area zzso by zzso zzso and found modest abnormalities in zzso zzso zzso However, zzso analysis of synaptic composition revealed specific zzso defects in scaffolding zzso neurotransmitter zzso and signaling zzso Using whole brain zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso we found that the defects were localized to the zzso compartment of zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso were found specifically in the zzso density fraction obtained from these zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso zzso and zzso interact with each other at the zzso Finally, we show that levels of zzso are reduced in conditional zzso knock out mice, demonstrating that the zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso expression at the zzso in zzso These studies may provide insights into the zzso of cognitive disorders associated with deficiencies in zzso signaling and zzso zzso
