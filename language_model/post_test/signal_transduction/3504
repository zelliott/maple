zzso is located within zzso region zzso which is one of the three most commonly amplified regions in head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso zzso is lost in zzso cells, but zzso is commonly zzso in primary zzso Here we address possible reasons why zzso is positively selected for in primary zzso We find that zzso enhances the zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso to the plasma zzso zzso zzso signaling and resulting in enhanced proliferation in zzso zzso of zzso results in decreased zzso zzso levels and decreased zzso of zzso and zzso However, when cells are at high density and adherent to each other, analogous to conditions in a solid zzso zzso does not zzso any growth advantage, either in zzso conditions or following zzso zzso This could indicate why zzso might be lost in zzso but preserved in early primary zzso This is supported by an zzso zzso showing that zzso cells display a less zzso more zzso zzso on top of a collagen zzso Furthermore, zzso tumors expressing zzso initially grow more zzso but later show less proliferation and more zzso zzso positively zzso zzso signaling at low cell zzso to promote proliferation and, therefore, may be beneficial for the early stages of primary zzso tumor zzso However, at high cell zzso zzso impacts zzso on zzso signaling and this suggests why it zzso zzso
