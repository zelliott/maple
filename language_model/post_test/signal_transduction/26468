zzso motor zzso zzso during zzso zzso junction dismantling at zzso In this study, we describe the motor zzso zzso as opposed to zzso based on the early disappearance of zzso and the continuing presence of zzso By blocking cell dynamics with a zzso form of zzso we show that zzso have a key role in this zzso zzso we show the presence of peripheral zzso cells close to the zzso junction that zzso before the motor zzso We show also that in muscle, expression of zzso zzso the steroid hormone zzso required for zzso zzso is under the control of the zzso orphan nuclear zzso zzso but not the zzso signaling zzso In the motor zzso zzso of zzso expression by the two parallel pathways zzso signaling and nuclear zzso triggers zzso zzso We propose that a signal from a zzso family zzso is produced by the dismantling muscle zzso zzso and received by the motor zzso zzso zzso resulting in motor zzso zzso The requirement of the two pathways in the motor zzso provides a molecular explanation for the zzso role of the zzso degradation on motor zzso zzso This mechanism zzso the zzso of the two processes and prevents motor zzso pruning before zzso zzso
