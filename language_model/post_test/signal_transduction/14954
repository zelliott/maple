The insulin zzso is a zzso composed of two zzso half zzso zzso zzso studies have identified key zzso important for insulin binding in the zzso domain zzso acids zzso and zzso region zzso acids zzso of the alpha zzso However, it has not been shown whether insulin interacts with these two sites within the same alpha chain or whether it zzso a site from each alpha zzso in the zzso to achieve high affinity zzso Here we have tested the zzso binding mechanism by analyzing truncated insulin zzso zzso zzso that contain complementary zzso in each alpha zzso zzso containing zzso zzso or zzso zzso were fused with zzso or zzso zzso at the C zzso and were expressed separately by transient zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were expressed in the medium but insulin binding activity was not zzso However, after zzso with zzso or zzso hybrid zzso were obtained with a marked increase in insulin binding zzso Competitive displacement zzso revealed that the hybrid zzso receptors bound insulin with the same affinity as wild type and also displayed zzso zzso zzso In addition, when hybrid zzso zzso was zzso zzso with zzso and reduced, zzso zzso was zzso only with zzso demonstrating that insulin was bound zzso These results demonstrate that a single insulin zzso can contact both alpha zzso in the insulin zzso zzso during high affinity binding and this property may be an important feature for zzso zzso
