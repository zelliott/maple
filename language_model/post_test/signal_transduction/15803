zzso zzso interacting with zzso are zzso zzso zzso with diverse cellular zzso The molecular pathways employed by zzso proteins to exert their cellular effects remain largely zzso Via an unbiased zzso approach, we identify zzso as a binding partner of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are known to mediate zzso downstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in mice zzso the mice to cancer as a result of compromised zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at their zzso zzso thereby zzso full zzso zzso activity and zzso However, if and how this key zzso event is regulated are zzso Here we show that zzso interacts with the zzso motif of zzso and that zzso or zzso of zzso reduces or zzso zzso zzso zzso or activity, zzso Surprisingly, zzso is a zzso but not an zzso or zzso zzso Rather, zzso competes with zzso for zzso binding and thereby zzso zzso zzso zzso In line with this zzso effect, zzso or zzso of zzso zzso or zzso respectively, zzso zzso signaling induced by zzso zzso Our findings unveil a previously unknown biological role for zzso in zzso and define a novel negative regulatory mechanism of zzso zzso
