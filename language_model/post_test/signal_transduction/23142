zzso zzso are short zzso zzso that orchestrate complex zzso regulatory networks essential to the regulation of gene zzso Through zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso act primarily to silence gene expression through either degradation or inhibited translation of target zzso In this way, zzso can act to fine-tune the zzso regulation of gene zzso but they may also play distinct roles in the zzso zzso and function of specific cell zzso zzso regulatory networks may be particularly important for signaling molecules such as vitamin D that exert zzso effects on zzso throughout the zzso The active form of vitamin D, zzso D zzso functions as a steroid hormone that, when bound to its nuclear vitamin D zzso is able to regulate target gene zzso However, recent studies have also implicated zzso in zzso regulation of genes most notably as a zzso of zzso zzso The current review details our understanding of vitamin D and zzso with specific emphasis on the implications of this interaction for biological responses to vitamin D in one of its classical target zzso zzso zzso
