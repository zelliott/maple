On zzso the cellular slime mold zzso zzso zzso a program of development leading to formation of zzso zzso The initial cell zzso requires zzso to zzso zzso zzso and relay of the zzso signal by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and it has been shown previously that the Ras protein zzso is involved in both zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene resulted in delayed zzso and a partial zzso of early gene zzso suggesting that zzso also has a role in early zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso were reduced in the zzso cells, but the effect on zzso was more zzso When the responses of zzso cells to zzso were compared with the responses of zzso and zzso zzso zzso generated in otherwise zzso backgrounds, these studies revealed that signal zzso through zzso is more important in zzso and early gene zzso but that signal zzso through zzso is more important in zzso zzso Because the loss of either of the two Ras proteins alone did not result in a total loss of signal output down either of the branches of the zzso zzso pathway, there appears to be some overlap of zzso
