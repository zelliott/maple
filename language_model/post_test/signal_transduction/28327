zzso cells undergo major changes in structure and function to meet the demand for increased insulin zzso during pregnancy, but the nature of the hormonal interactions and signaling events is incompletely zzso Here, we used the zzso zzso zzso line treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a synthetic zzso all elevated during late pregnancy, to study their effects on mechanisms of insulin zzso zzso alone or combined with zzso and zzso inhibited insulin zzso in response to 16 zzso zzso zzso However, in the zzso state (3 zzso zzso the insulin levels in response to zzso treatment were zzso and the three hormones together maintained higher insulin zzso There were no changes of protein levels of zzso or zzso zzso but zzso or zzso treatment increased zzso activity, whereas zzso had an zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso was also reduced by zzso alone or combined with zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso may inhibit zzso steps in the zzso zzso zzso treatment increased the concentration of zzso zzso in response to 16 zzso zzso suggesting a role for zzso in zzso of insulin zzso whereas zzso alone or combined with zzso and zzso reduced zzso levels by increasing zzso zzso zzso These data provide evidence that zzso and to a lesser extent zzso which increase in early pregnancy, enhance zzso and zzso insulin zzso in part by increasing zzso activity and amplifying zzso zzso zzso which increases throughout zzso zzso only zzso insulin zzso under high zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso activity and increasing zzso activity to reduce zzso zzso These adaptations in the zzso may play an important role in maintaining the zzso zzso of pregnancy while limiting the capacity of zzso and zzso to promote zzso insulin zzso during late zzso
