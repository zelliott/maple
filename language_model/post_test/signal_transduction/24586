The production of zzso acid zzso which is involved in zzso zzso by zzso growth factor zzso is most directly accomplished by the action of zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso treatment of intact zzso cells rapidly activates a zzso zzso as measured in zzso extracts by the release of zzso AA from zzso added zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso resulted in an enhanced zzso and no change in zzso The zzso activity was zzso in a single peak at zzso zzso from a zzso Q zzso column, and migrated with an approximate molecular mass of 70 zzso on a zzso 12 zzso zzso The zzso zzso activity zzso with the zzso zzso activity upon gel zzso and persisted after partial zzso which indicates that the zzso is due to a stable modification of the zzso The zzso zzso is zzso with zzso activity at zzso zzso of zzso has a pH optimum at 9, associates with the particulate cell fraction in a zzso fashion, and is selective for zzso at the zzso zzso These data demonstrate the zzso zzso of a zzso which is similar to a recently cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso thus providing a link between zzso zzso zzso zzso and AA zzso
