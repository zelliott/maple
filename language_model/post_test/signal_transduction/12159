zzso zzso are employed by zzso signal zzso family proteins to mediate responses to specific signals or stimuli in zzso and zzso The zzso proteins constitute a novel signaling system in which four zzso proteins zzso a zzso zzso a zzso like zzso and two response regulators function together to regulate progression through the elaborate zzso program of zzso zzso A combination of in zzso zzso analyses of zzso deletions and zzso point zzso in each gene as well as in zzso zzso and zzso analyses of zzso proteins indicate that the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and donates a zzso group to the single domain response regulator, zzso to repress progression through the zzso zzso To relieve this zzso repression, zzso instead zzso zzso a dual receiver response regulator zzso Surprisingly, zzso transfers the zzso group to the zzso zzso protein zzso which itself appears to be incapable of zzso zzso of zzso may render zzso accessible to zzso where it removes the zzso group from zzso which is otherwise an unusually stable zzso These analyses reveal a novel zzso signaling mechanism that has probably arisen to temporally coordinate signals controlling the zzso program in zzso zzso The zzso signaling system provides an important example of how the inherent plasticity and zzso of the basic zzso signaling zzso comprise a highly adaptable framework well suited to expansion into complex signaling zzso
