zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso can be zzso into zzso divergent groups by their differential sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso specifically use either zzso zzso zzso zzso to couple to specific zzso zzso stimulation of zzso C, however, is zzso toxin sensitive in some systems and zzso toxin insensitive in zzso We studied the zzso of receptors to zzso C by expressing receptors from both systems into a single cell, the zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors from liver and zzso zzso receptors from brain were expressed in zzso by zzso injection of zzso Both receptors zzso a zzso zzso current which can also be evoked by zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation of zzso C was measured as the evoked zzso zzso zzso The liver zzso zzso which is known to stimulate zzso C in a zzso zzso manner zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 29, zzso was found to stimulate zzso C through a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso from brain zzso zzso C through a zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso stimulation of zzso C were attenuated by the zzso injection of excess zzso beta gamma zzso Neither zzso toxin treatment nor zzso injection of beta gamma zzso affected any steps subsequent to zzso zzso zzso From these data we conclude that both the zzso zzso and zzso pathways for zzso zzso to zzso C are zzso by zzso zzso We also find that there is a lack of zzso zzso of receptors to zzso in stimulation of zzso C which can be influenced by the membrane zzso
