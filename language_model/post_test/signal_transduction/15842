In response to zzso zzso cardiac zzso undergo zzso growth or zzso Multiple zzso pathways have been implicated in these responses and among them, zzso such as zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso However, the distinction between zzso pathways originally believed to be specific for either zzso zzso or cell survival is zzso The existing data, coming from different experimental systems, often are zzso In this study, we sought to compare aspects of zzso zzso activated by diverse stimuli in a single experimental system, adult rat cardiac zzso Furthermore, we assessed the role of these stimuli in zzso a particular cell zzso zzso whether they promote zzso cell survival or zzso The results demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso is the most potent zzso of zzso and zzso activated zzso zzso although its effect on zzso zzso is relatively zzso The zzso concentration of zzso activates strongly both zzso and zzso zzso zzso growth zzso has a minimal effect on zzso of zzso but it is a potent zzso of zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso or zzso stimuli operate through the same zzso pathways with different time course and zzso of zzso zzso Thus, to determine the effect of different stimuli on cell fate, it is important to assess zzso pathways as a network and not as a single zzso
