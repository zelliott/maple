Recently, the European Food Safety Authority approved a claim concerning the benefits of olive oil zzso for the protection of LDL from zzso zzso could exert health benefits not only by scavenging free zzso but also by modulating gene zzso 

We assessed whether olive oil zzso could zzso the human in zzso expressions of zzso genes in which LDL zzso is zzso 

In a randomized, zzso controlled trial, 18 healthy European volunteers daily received 25 zzso olive oil with a low zzso content zzso zzso zzso or a high zzso content zzso zzso zzso in intervention periods of 3 zzso separated by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso LDL zzso and zzso zzso protein 1 and the expression of zzso genes in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso oxidized LDL zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso decreased after the zzso intervention compared with after the zzso zzso zzso linear zzso analyses showed 1) a significant decrease in zzso zzso and zzso gene expression with the decrease of LDL zzso and 2) a significant decrease in zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso gene expression with increasing zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso 

In addition to reducing LDL zzso the intake of zzso olive oil reduces zzso gene zzso its downstream products, and related genes involved in zzso and inflammatory processes in zzso in zzso These findings provide evidence that zzso olive oil can act through molecular mechanisms to provide cardiovascular health zzso This trial was registered at zzso as zzso
