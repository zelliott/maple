zzso immune responses are initiated by pattern recognition zzso which recognize specific structures of zzso Among them, zzso receptors zzso are capable of sensing organisms ranging from viruses to bacteria, zzso and zzso and play major roles in innate zzso zzso zzso controls complex gene expression networks that regulate the magnitude and duration of the immune zzso zzso a bulk degradation system that delivers zzso constituents in the zzso controls degradation of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and invading zzso We recently generated zzso mice lacking zzso an zzso gene that is implicated in Crohn's disease, and thereby examined its role in zzso inflammatory zzso zzso was indispensable for the formation of zzso and suppression of zzso zzso zzso production, suggesting that it is responsible for the control of zzso inflammatory zzso Because zzso zzso have been identified and zzso signaling pathways zzso we are now looking at the zzso phase of zzso zzso We are starting to generate knockout zzso mice of the genes that are induced in response to zzso zzso but whose functions are zzso Among them, we recently identified a novel zzso zzso zzso a zzso involved in zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso mice lacking this gene developed spontaneous zzso diseases accompanied by zzso and zzso This review describes the zzso of our different zzso mice models and the role of various molecules in zzso zzso
