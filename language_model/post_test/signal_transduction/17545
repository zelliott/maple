zzso withdrawal from either growing or zzso zzso zzso zzso causes a loss of zzso zzso and focal zzso within 30 zzso zzso that are growing survive serum zzso whereas the great majority of zzso zzso cells die during a period of up to 5 h from serum zzso During this time an approximately constant fraction of the zzso cell population dies per unit zzso The population zzso is zzso zzso during this zzso zzso of an appropriate cell growth factor or second zzso zzso at the time of serum withdrawal or within 2 h after serum withdrawal protects a similar fraction of viable zzso These findings suggest a model according to which withdrawal of serum zzso growth zzso zzso the death process in cells of the population with zzso that approximate zzso zzso We zzso that appropriate growth factors or second zzso zzso block the initiating event that starts the cell death zzso
