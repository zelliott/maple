The zzso family of receptors zzso is an ancient pattern recognition zzso family, zzso from insects to zzso We have identified in zzso zzso zzso 19 putative zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso a fish specific zzso type group and three putative zzso zzso One zzso is very close to zzso zzso 6 and 10 and seems to be their common zzso However, in contrast to the zzso zzso zzso we found two receptors zzso to zzso showing that lack of zzso is not general for zzso In addition, we identified two members close to zzso zzso and five members close to zzso and goldfish zzso a zzso group which now has only been found in zzso By zzso we showed that all zzso are widely expressed in adult zzso but also at different stages of zzso All these zzso contain very zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso able to interact with zzso of adapter zzso We demonstrate here that zzso containing adapters zzso and zzso are present in zzso showing that zzso adapter molecules are highly zzso in zzso
