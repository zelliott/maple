zzso experiments over the last few decades have identified many regulatory proteins critical for DNA zzso The dynamics of their zzso activities shape the differential expression of the genes they zzso Here we describe a simple method, based on the zzso zzso to measure the activities of two zzso factors zzso and zzso This technique can effectively monitor dynamics of zzso events in a population of cells and be zzso for zzso screening and promoter analysis, making it ideal for zzso applications such as mathematical zzso
