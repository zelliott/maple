zzso are zzso zzso that are released by normal and zzso zzso Previous studies have focused on the interaction between zzso zzso and the immune system, as a consequence of immune suppression or zzso However, the effects of zzso zzso on zzso cells themselves have not been well zzso 

To investigate the effects of gastric cancer zzso on zzso cell proliferation and the possible zzso 

By serial zzso and zzso zzso zzso we isolated and zzso the zzso from gastric cancer zzso cells, then viewed them by electron zzso Cell proliferation was measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso by Western zzso 

zzso zzso promoted the proliferation of zzso and zzso zzso The increase in proliferation induced by zzso was accompanied by zzso of zzso and zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso or zzso protein zzso inhibitor partially reversed the zzso effect of zzso Moreover, the zzso increase in activity of zzso and zzso protein zzso coincided with decreased expression of the zzso zzso zzso family of zzso zzso 

zzso cancer zzso promoted zzso cell zzso at least in part, by zzso of zzso and zzso protein zzso protein zzso zzso The decreased expression of zzso zzso zzso proteins might have contributed to the zzso of zzso and zzso protein zzso
