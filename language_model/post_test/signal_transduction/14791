Aging is associated with an zzso of the immune response called zzso It is now well accepted that all parts of the immune system, the zzso as well as the zzso undergo zzso However, the zzso immune response and especially T cell functions are the most affected by zzso Aging is associated with profound changes in zzso zzso however, the functional changes within these zzso are more important to zzso Indeed, T cells present functional modifications resulting in a decreased zzso expansion and zzso zzso zzso So there should be an zzso in the zzso process of T cells with aging involving the T cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso The zzso in membrane zzso composition and function can underline this altered zzso of T cells with aging and then contribute to human zzso The experimental data in favor of this hypothesis will be zzso
