Memory is a ubiquitous phenomenon in biological systems, yet the mechanisms responsible for memory, and how to manipulate it at the zzso level, remain poorly zzso zzso to transient zzso biological systems can exhibit short early responses and/or prolonged (or zzso late zzso Experimental evidence suggests that early responses zzso zzso involve zzso modification of existing proteins and/or their zzso zzso whereas late responses zzso zzso depend on new protein zzso Although this provides an intuitive explanation at the basic molecular level, it does little to clarify the important dynamics that actually maintain memory at the systems zzso In this study, we use mathematical modeling to study zzso mechanisms of biological zzso We first examined the response of four fundamental motifs zzso zzso and zzso to external zzso Because motifs do not exist in isolation within the cell, we then combined these motifs to form signaling zzso to understand how they zzso biological zzso These zzso and different combinations zzso displayed distinct behavior in response to external zzso The principles described in this study have important implications for experimental approaches to identify the mechanisms for biological memory and for the development of therapeutic strategies to zzso signaling network responses in the setting of human zzso
