zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that regulates protein zzso zzso mice develop an zzso disease zzso characterized by itchy skin and zzso zzso The role of zzso in the regulation of zzso function has not been zzso We report that zzso bone zzso and zzso cells formed more zzso than cells from zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and was associated with increased expression of the zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells rescued increased zzso zzso increased zzso zzso which can be blocked by a zzso zzso The zzso zzso promoter contains zzso binding zzso zzso of zzso zzso increased zzso zzso and zzso promoted the binding of zzso onto the zzso binding sites in the zzso zzso zzso zzso precursors had prolonged zzso zzso zzso and delayed zzso zzso factor 6 zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Adult zzso mice had normal bone volume, but they had significantly increased zzso zzso and bone zzso Thus, zzso is a new zzso target gene that is induced during zzso zzso interacts with the zzso zzso and is required for zzso of zzso thus limiting zzso zzso zzso
