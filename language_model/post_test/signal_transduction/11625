zzso zzso larvae have a similar zzso zzso nervous system as zzso The induction of brain formation from zzso zzso cells requires signals from the zzso zzso zzso However, little is known about the mechanism underlying the development of the zzso peripheral nervous system due to the lack of a suitable molecular zzso zzso an zzso zzso is specifically expressed in zzso sensory zzso zzso that mainly constitute the entire peripheral nervous system of the zzso young zzso Here, we address the role of cell interactions in the zzso of zzso using zzso with an zzso zzso Animal half zzso and zzso zzso did not give rise to any zzso zzso indicating that differentiation of zzso requires signals from vegetal zzso Cell isolation experiments showed that zzso zzso induce zzso zzso from zzso cells but not from zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso induce zzso zzso both from zzso cells and zzso zzso This is in sharp contrast to the zzso of brain cells which is not affected by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, basic zzso growth factor zzso induced zzso from the zzso cells and zzso cells in the absence of vegetal zzso Their competence to form zzso was lost between the zzso stage and the zzso zzso Our results suggested that the zzso of the zzso cells and zzso cells into zzso is controlled by distinct inducing signals from the anterior and zzso vegetal zzso zzso in the trunk appear to be derived from the zzso zzso aligning on the edge of zzso neural region where zzso zzso of zzso is zzso These findings highlight the close similarity of zzso zzso development with that of zzso zzso and neural zzso
