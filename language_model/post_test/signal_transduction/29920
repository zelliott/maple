Evidence that human zzso mast cells are susceptible to infection with zzso strains of zzso and that circulating zzso zzso cells with a similar zzso zzso have been isolated from AIDS patients has led to speculation that mast cells may serve as a potential zzso for infectious zzso In this study, zzso mast cells, developed in zzso from zzso zzso blood stem cells, were zzso infected with the zzso strain zzso after 28 days in culture as they reached their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were readily zzso by day 7 zzso zzso peaked at 2-3 zzso zzso as mature zzso zzso zzso mast cells emerged, and then steadily declined to below zzso limits by 10 zzso zzso at which point integrated zzso zzso DNA was confirmed by zzso zzso in ( approximately zzso zzso zzso infected mast zzso zzso by zzso for zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso or zzso significantly enhanced viral replication in a zzso and zzso manner in both zzso zzso and zzso infected mature mast cells, without promoting zzso zzso cellular zzso or zzso of zzso zzso zzso production in infected mast zzso zzso dilution analysis of zzso zzso zzso infected mature mast cells indicated that one in four was capable of establishing productive infections in zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that mast cells may serve both as a viral zzso and as a model for studying mechanisms of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
