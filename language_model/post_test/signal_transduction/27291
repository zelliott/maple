Human pancreatic zzso zzso the zzso growth factor zzso zzso and all 5 known zzso of the zzso family, including zzso transforming growth zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso growth factor zzso The aim of the present study was to confirm the presence of zzso zzso zzso in a human pancreatic cancer cell line and to explore the possibility that interrupting zzso zzso by introducing a truncated zzso abrogates pancreatic cancer cell zzso The zzso growth of zzso human pancreatic cancer cells, previously shown to express zzso was inhibited by specific anti zzso zzso zzso cells were then either zzso with an expression zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso or infected with the same zzso zzso using a zzso zzso Multiple zzso and infected clones zzso the truncated zzso and zzso zzso as revealed by Northern zzso analysis and zzso In these zzso there was a marked zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso There was also a significant decrease in colony formation in soft zzso by comparison with control cells and a significant increase in the effect of the zzso effect of the zzso agent zzso in these zzso Our observations indicate that dominant negative zzso of zzso may have therapeutic potential in pancreatic zzso
