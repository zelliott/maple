zzso is an inflammatory state characterized by an augment in circulating inflammatory zzso zzso may zzso the synthesis of these factors by white zzso tissue decreasing insulin zzso We have examined the effect of chronic central administration of zzso on circulating levels of zzso and the possible relationship with zzso expression and protein content as well as with zzso and insulin signaling in subcutaneous and visceral zzso zzso In addition, we analyzed the possible correlation between circulating levels of zzso and peripheral insulin zzso We studied 18 male zzso rats divided into controls zzso those treated zzso for 14 days with a daily dose of 12 zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso group zzso that received the same food amount consumed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and insulin were measured by zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso by real time zzso and serum and zzso tissue levels of these zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were increased in L and zzso was decreased in zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels correlate positively with zzso index and zzso with serum zzso levels during an zzso insulin tolerance zzso In zzso an increase in zzso levels of zzso was found in both zzso zzso and zzso only in visceral zzso zzso of zzso signaling was increased and insulin signaling decreased in subcutaneous fat of zzso In conclusion, zzso mediates the production of inflammatory zzso by zzso tissue independent of its effects on food zzso decreasing insulin zzso
