zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso along the zzso zzso Although zzso is expressed in inflamed and zzso zzso cells of the zzso its role in colon zzso is not well zzso We used genetic and zzso approaches to manipulate zzso activity in mice with zzso cancer and human colon cancer cell zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice were exposed to zzso and zzso sodium zzso to induce colitis and zzso Colitis severity was assessed by zzso of disease activity, zzso levels, and zzso zzso In zzso experiments were conducted using zzso 116 and zzso human colon cancer zzso zzso zzso and small interfering zzso were used to inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to simulate zzso zzso 

zzso mice given zzso zzso of zzso and zzso mice had lower tumor burdens and reduced proliferation in the zzso zzso after administration of zzso sodium zzso and zzso than control zzso These reductions also were observed in zzso zzso mice compared with zzso mice (which lack mature zzso zzso In human colon cancer cells, blockade of zzso activity reduced nuclear and activated zzso zzso of its target genes zzso D1 and zzso and, ultimately, zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid led to zzso of zzso and proliferation of human colon cancer cells, and increased tumor growth in zzso 

zzso which zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso in mice, independent of its ability to limit zzso immune zzso The zzso zzso survival advantage provided by zzso to colon zzso cells indicate its potential as a therapeutic zzso
