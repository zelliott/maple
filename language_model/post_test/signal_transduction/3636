zzso zzso related proteins zzso are a family of proteins that zzso zzso zzso which in turn regulates multiple aspects of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, it is not known which zzso signaling branch and what aspects of zzso zzso zzso development are regulated by zzso Here, we show that zzso and zzso activate the zzso zzso in zzso zzso In the developing zzso zzso and zzso are expressed at low levels, and zzso or zzso mice had no zzso zzso However, compound zzso zzso revealed a zzso zzso similar to that previously described for zzso zzso This included an zzso zzso of the zzso a lateral expansion of the zzso domain and zzso lineage markers zzso and zzso as well as an zzso of zzso precursors in the zzso In zzso experiments showed that, while very high zzso of zzso had a negative effect on cell survival, zzso zzso of zzso or zzso promoted the zzso differentiation of zzso derived from primary zzso cultures or mouse embryonic stem cells zzso mimicking the effects of zzso We thus conclude that the main function of zzso and zzso is to enhance zzso signaling in zzso cells and to regulate zzso functions in zzso zzso Moreover, we suggest that zzso zzso of zzso may be used to enhance the zzso differentiation of zzso and improve their therapeutic zzso
