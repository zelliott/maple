Cellular responses to zzso of G zzso receptors are rapidly zzso zzso of signal zzso include zzso removal from the zzso fluid and zzso zzso zzso and zzso Cell surface zzso degrade zzso in the zzso fluid and thereby terminate their biological zzso G protein zzso zzso and second zzso zzso zzso zzso permit interaction with zzso and thus zzso receptors from G proteins to mediate zzso zzso zzso zzso contributes to zzso by depleting the cell surface of zzso zzso while recycling of zzso receptors mediates zzso of cellular zzso zzso zzso is a form of zzso that occurs during zzso long-term exposure of cells to zzso zzso zzso is characterized by the depletion of the cellular zzso content due to zzso in the rate of zzso degradation and zzso These regulatory mechanisms are important, for they govern the ability of cells to respond to zzso
