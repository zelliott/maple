Following zzso zzso zzso T cells have the potential to differentiate into a number of specialized zzso cell zzso To date, much progress has been made in defining the basic molecular mechanisms that regulate initial helper zzso differentiation zzso Emerging research in the field is now uncovering more complexity in the series of events that control helper zzso commitment decisions than was previously zzso During the commitment process, helper T cells need to integrate both signals derived from the zzso zzso and from the surrounding zzso These external signals are then translated into internal changes in gene expression potential to ultimately define the functional characteristics of the zzso In this review, this topic will be discussed from the perspective of zzso helper zzso and zzso type 1 zzso cell zzso The focus will be on examining how the zzso environment is perceived by signaling through signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso family proteins to initiate fate zzso The activities of zzso proteins are then in turn translated into changes in the molecular balance between zzso zzso 6 zzso and zzso expressed in T cells zzso the helper zzso zzso zzso factors that regulate zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso the knowledge of the molecular pathways that regulate zzso and zzso commitment have provided insight into the relationship between these two specialized helper zzso zzso and the potential for flexibility in their gene zzso
