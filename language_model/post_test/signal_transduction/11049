Networks have been used to model many real-world phenomena to better understand the phenomena and to guide experiments in order to predict their zzso Since incorrect models lead to incorrect predictions, it is vital to have as accurate a model as zzso As a result, new techniques and models for analyzing and modeling real-world networks have recently been zzso 

One example of large and complex networks involves zzso interaction zzso zzso We analyze zzso networks of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso using a newly introduced measure of local network structure as well as the zzso used measures of global network zzso We examine the fit of four different network models, including zzso zzso and geometric random network models, to these zzso networks with respect to the measures of local and global network zzso We demonstrate that the currently accepted zzso model of zzso networks fails to fit the data in several respects and show that a random geometric model provides a much more accurate model of the zzso zzso We zzso that only the noise in these networks is zzso 

We systematically evaluate how zzso network models fit the zzso zzso We show that the structure of zzso networks is better modeled by a geometric random graph than by a zzso zzso
