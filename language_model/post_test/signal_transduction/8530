zzso II zzso zzso is a crucial contributor to inflammatory processes involved in development and progression of zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso signaling responsible for the initiation of inflammation also zzso in zzso of zzso The protective effect of zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso on zzso may be due to their impact on vascular zzso plaque instability and zzso However, mechanisms underlying the zzso effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso vascular inflammation and the zzso signaling zzso involved in vascular smooth muscle cells zzso remain zzso The present study demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso generation of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso but enhanced production of zzso molecules like zzso and zzso both in zzso and in zzso Meanwhile, treatment of zzso with the zzso inhibitor or zzso zzso showed that the zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso inflammatory responses in zzso were dependent on zzso Furthermore, zzso depressed zzso zzso inflammatory responses in zzso by intervening the downstream zzso molecules of the zzso signaling pathway, including zzso zzso protein 10 zzso protein zzso C zzso and nuclear factor zzso zzso Thus, these findings provide the evidence for beneficial effects of zzso zzso zzso to zzso vascular inflammation induced by zzso zzso More importantly, zzso action of zzso via interfering with the zzso signaling zzso zzso works in concert to protect against zzso
