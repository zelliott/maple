zzso and zzso growth factor zzso are well-known stimuli of zzso zzso zzso and zzso stimulates zzso of zzso zzso zzso signaling to promote survival in colon zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso induction and cell survival signaling downstream of zzso are zzso by zzso zzso zzso treatment was more zzso to zzso mouse colon zzso zzso cells than zzso zzso young adult mouse colon zzso zzso cells or zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso protein and zzso expression in zzso cells, but blockade of zzso zzso activity or expression inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was reduced and absent in zzso and zzso zzso zzso knockout zzso cells, respectively, but was restored upon expression of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso of zzso zzso zzso family zzso and zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso Finally, zzso injection increased zzso expression in colon zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso and zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso of zzso through a zzso and/or an zzso mechanism stimulates zzso expression to promote cell zzso This highlights an zzso cell signaling zzso and response that may be significant in zzso zzso
