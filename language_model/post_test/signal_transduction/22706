zzso zzso signaling determines the number of cells that migrate zzso to form the zzso primary branch during zzso zzso We report that zzso signaling is also required for the differentiation of one of three different cell types in the zzso zzso the fusion zzso In Mad zzso zzso or in zzso expressing dominant negative zzso of the two type I zzso receptors in the trachea the number of cells expressing fusion zzso marker genes is reduced and fusion of the zzso branches is zzso zzso expression of zzso or the activated form of the zzso zzso zzso in all zzso cells zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso expression of fusion gene markers in all zzso zzso Among the fusion marker genes that are activated in the trachea in response to zzso zzso signaling is zzso In conditional zzso loss of function zzso additional zzso cells adopt the fusion cell fate and zzso expression of an activated form of the zzso zzso in fusion cells results in suppression of fusion cell markers and disruption of the branch zzso The number of cells that express the fusion cell markers in response to zzso zzso signaling is increased in zzso zzso suggesting that the two signaling pathways have opposing effects in the selection of the fusion cells in the zzso zzso
