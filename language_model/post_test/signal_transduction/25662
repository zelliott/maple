zzso zzso injury requires both zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso through zzso differentiation primary response gene zzso zzso and complement zzso As a common zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signals through zzso and zzso the complement zzso zzso accelerating factor zzso zzso Since zzso zzso injury is complement dependent, we hypothesized that zzso infection may alter zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso and subsequently decreased complement zzso in response to zzso without altering zzso damage in zzso zzso zzso induced similar levels of zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, during infection, zzso zzso zzso was significantly attenuated in zzso zzso Likewise, zzso zzso damage, complement component 3 deposition and zzso zzso production were attenuated in zzso zzso but zzso zzso While infection attenuated zzso zzso production in zzso zzso mice, there was no further decrease in zzso zzso These data indicate distinct roles for zzso and zzso in zzso inflammation and suggest that zzso zzso infections, such as zzso alter the use of the zzso proteins to induce zzso
