The gamma chain of the zzso zzso zzso is an indispensable zzso for zzso binding and zzso signal zzso A zzso zzso to the gamma chain, zzso inhibited zzso binding to the functional zzso receptors and also inhibited zzso cell growth and the zzso binding of zzso to the zzso mouse T cell zzso Another zzso zzso zzso which reacted with the gamma chain zzso with zzso also zzso the gamma chain when zzso with zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso gamma chain is functionally involved in the zzso zzso zzso
