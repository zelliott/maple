We report that zzso has an zzso function through zzso zzso signaling in the zzso mode, which is somewhat additive to the effects of zzso zzso mouse embryonic zzso zzso cells were resistant to the zzso effects of zzso while loss of zzso accelerated zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was zzso at the same frequency in zzso zzso irrespective of zzso status, suggesting that zzso resides in a zzso separate from zzso Loss of zzso further zzso resistance to zzso in zzso zzso Mice with zzso zzso exhibited exacerbated zzso in the absence of zzso The combined loss of these proteins promoted more severe spontaneous zzso Thus, zzso zzso signals through zzso and zzso must zzso to activate zzso suggesting that the zzso of zzso and zzso significantly contribute to zzso Our results, therefore, establish that zzso and zzso are effective key initiators of zzso in zzso cells, particularly when zzso
