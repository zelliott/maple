External load plays a critical role in determining muscle mass and its zzso in cardiac zzso zzso zzso have the ability to sense mechanical stretch and convert it into zzso growth signals, which lead to zzso Mechanical stretch of cardiac zzso in zzso causes zzso of multiple second zzso systems that are very similar to growth zzso cell signaling zzso zzso of zzso rat cardiac zzso stimulates a rapid zzso of zzso II which, together with other growth factors, mediates zzso zzso responses in zzso In this review, various cell signaling mechanisms initiated by mechanical stress on cardiac zzso are summarized with emphasis on potential zzso mechanisms and the relationship between mechanical loading and the cardiac zzso zzso
