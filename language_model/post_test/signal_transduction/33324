Various pesticides and transition metals induce zzso deterioration of biological zzso zzso zzso C zzso may mediate these zzso However, no information is available regarding whether these zzso can zzso zzso which is a critical event signaling the increase in zzso zzso and cell zzso Female zzso rats were treated zzso with two zzso zzso doses of selected pesticides and transition metal zzso at 0 and 21 zzso and killed at 24 zzso zzso activities were measured in liver and brain zzso zzso zzso cells were incubated for 24 h with 50, 100 or 200 zzso zzso of these zzso while zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of cadmium zzso zzso and sodium zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso were observed in the zzso and brain zzso zzso by all zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso increases in zzso activity in the zzso and brain zzso zzso were observed, zzso In the zzso zzso the greatest increases in activities were observed with zzso zzso zzso and zzso while zzso and zzso exerted the greatest increases in the brain zzso In cultured zzso cells, the greatest zzso of zzso was observed primarily with zzso zzso of the zzso The maximum effects were induced by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results clearly indicate that pesticides as well as zzso and zzso zzso can zzso a vital component of the cell signaling pathway, namely zzso zzso zzso may be a target of free zzso and zzso stress, leading to altered cell proliferation and zzso
