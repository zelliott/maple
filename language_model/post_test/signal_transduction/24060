The adapter protein zzso has previously been shown to be involved in recruiting the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the insulin zzso the zzso growth factor zzso and the zzso zzso leading to increased degradation of the receptors and zzso of zzso Here we zzso by use of immobilized synthetic zzso corresponding to various zzso zzso zzso in the zzso for stem-cell factor zzso that zzso zzso associates with zzso zzso and zzso zzso has previously been identified as the binding site of the zzso family of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the protein zzso zzso zzso We have recently demonstrated that zzso is an zzso site involved in binding the adapter proteins zzso and zzso We could further demonstrate that the critical zzso for binding of zzso is the presence of either a zzso or an zzso zzso in the position zzso to the zzso zzso This allowed us to design zzso that selectively failed to associate with zzso while still zzso with zzso family members, zzso and zzso zzso
