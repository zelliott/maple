zzso zzso and its zzso zzso play an important role in zzso growth and zzso and zzso of these molecules is strongly correlated with poor prognosis in a variety of zzso zzso zzso the excessive zzso of this system as well as the proliferation of the zzso vascular zzso cell would be expected to prevent zzso zzso and halt zzso zzso The zzso terminal zzso zzso of zzso has been confirmed effective to inhibit the zzso migration and zzso of cancer cells via interrupting the interaction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso isolated from the Chinese herb zzso zzso Hook F that has shown zzso activities in various cancer cell zzso However, its therapeutic application is limited by its toxicity in normal zzso and complications caused in zzso In this study, we attempted to investigate the synergistic zzso activity of zzso and zzso in various solid zzso zzso 

Using in zzso and in zzso experiments, we investigated the combined effect of zzso and zzso at a low dosage on cell zzso cell zzso cell cycle distribution, cell migration, zzso zzso zzso zzso growth and zzso 

Our data showed that the sensitivity of a combined therapy using zzso and zzso was higher than that of zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity, zzso of zzso cell cycle arrest, and zzso of zzso zzso zzso contributed to the synergistic effects of this combination zzso Furthermore, using a mouse zzso model, we demonstrated that the combined treatment completely suppressed zzso growth by zzso zzso as compared with zzso or zzso treatment zzso 

Our study suggests that lower concentration of zzso and zzso used in combination may produce a synergistic zzso efficacy that warrants further investigation for its potential clinical zzso
