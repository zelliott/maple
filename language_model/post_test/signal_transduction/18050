zzso an zzso zzso zzso is a potent respiratory zzso We have previously observed that zzso administered ex zzso to isolated airways alters subsequent airway responsiveness to zzso zzso in terms of both mechanical activity of rings and calcium signaling in isolated zzso In the present study, we have examined the mechanisms by which zzso alters zzso zzso In freshly isolated rat zzso smooth muscle cells, zzso to zzso increased the zzso zzso frequency in response to zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that acts via the zzso of a zzso different from the zzso zzso We then studied zzso zzso in cell signaling with special attention to the steps downstream of membrane zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso of cells with zzso (20 zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso the effect of zzso exposure on zzso zzso response, zzso increased the zzso of the first zzso rise and the zzso frequency in response to zzso and 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, in zzso smooth muscle, zzso to zzso significantly increased zzso zzso zzso up to 34 zzso zzso above zzso tissue zzso Finally, in zzso zzso cells, injection of zzso zzso zzso induced a zzso zzso rise followed, for high zzso zzso by zzso zzso a calcium response whose pattern was similar to that induced by zzso Exposure to zzso did not alter the zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the effect of zzso exposure on zzso responses in airway smooth muscle is not restricted to zzso of the zzso zzso and is due to an enhancement in zzso zzso zzso Since zzso does not modify zzso zzso channel sensitivity, we conclude that zzso zzso in calcium signaling can be ascribed to its sole effect on zzso zzso
