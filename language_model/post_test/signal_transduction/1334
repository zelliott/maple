zzso in zzso cell structure and function among vascular beds has been recognized for zzso However, recent findings have resolved that zzso cells possess a functional memory based upon where they are in a blood vessel or based upon where they are isolated from within the blood zzso zzso memory has been identified using integrated in zzso and in zzso zzso and, most recently, through molecular profiling zzso Memory is attributed to the zzso modification of zzso that occurs in response to zzso zzso interaction during vascular zzso In the zzso zzso signal zzso is required for proper large blood vessel formation and function, whereas vascular zzso cell growth factor zzso is required for many of the processes of early vascular development including zzso and large vessel zzso Both zzso and zzso are expressed in the developing zzso and their roles in pulmonary vascular development likely parallel those in the systemic zzso Thus, integrated molecular profiling and transgenic technology provide new tools to investigate the interplay between zzso and environmental zzso of cell zzso that controls zzso cell behavior, and will aid in our understanding of the molecular signals required for normal and abnormal lung vascular development and zzso
