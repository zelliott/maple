zzso and zzso zzso regulate survival, zzso migration, and proliferation of neural zzso zzso Although several zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been zzso most of the genes targeted by these two pathways are still largely zzso We focused our study on zzso B zzso as a novel target gene of the zzso and zzso zzso based on previous data obtained using a zzso zzso strain zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso and cellular studies of zzso were performed in the zzso zzso cells, an in zzso model for studying neural zzso cell development, along with a mouse zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso has been performed via zzso 

zzso and zzso cooperated in inducing zzso differentiation resulting in zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso expression was zzso in mouse zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and presenting a severe zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso expression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso evoked zzso expression via zzso zzso in zzso zzso A zzso zzso element in zzso promoter resulted in a reduced zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduced zzso protein zzso 

zzso is a novel downstream target of the zzso pathways with a role in zzso survival and zzso as indicated by its effect on zzso zzso Our data provide a conceptual framework to investigate and establish the role of zzso gene in severe gut zzso
