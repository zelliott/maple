To determine whether sodium zzso zzso a major zzso fatty acid produced in the human gut by bacterial zzso of dietary zzso enhances transforming growth factor zzso signaling and zzso its tumor zzso activity in the zzso 

The molecular mechanisms by which dietary fiber decreases the risk of colon zzso are poorly zzso zzso is an important tumor zzso in the gut and has many similar zzso activities as zzso zzso we hypothesized that the zzso effects of zzso are zzso in part by enhancing zzso signaling and its tumor zzso function in the zzso 

The effects of zzso on zzso expression in rat zzso zzso zzso cells and 6 human colon cancer cell lines were zzso The effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene expression were also examined in zzso zzso Finally, the effects of zzso and zzso on zzso growth were examined in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso induced zzso in zzso cells and in 4 human colon cancer cell zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso growth of zzso zzso zzso 

These results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling and its tumor zzso activity in gut zzso zzso Our data reveal a novel molecular mechanism that may explain in part the beneficial effects of dietary fiber in decreasing the risk of colon zzso
