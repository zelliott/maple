Recent studies have shown the zzso and zzso families of signaling proteins to be associated with tumor zzso growth, and zzso However, these pathways remain unexplored in zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe a novel zzso zzso array to examine the expression of 26 and 20 genes in the zzso and zzso zzso respectively, in six matched zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values were zzso to zzso zzso zzso Gene expression in matched frozen and zzso zzso demonstrated significant zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso However, comparison of amplified and unamplified zzso from frozen zzso zzso revealed an altered molecular profile in amplified zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso was not zzso The expression of Desert zzso zzso Indian zzso zzso zzso interacting protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso were zzso with no zzso expression in normal zzso zzso In addition, several genes were significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso array provides an effective zzso technique for examining gene expression in zzso isolated from either zzso or archival zzso zzso and can identify zzso zzso possibly leading to novel zzso
