A dominant molecular explanation for neural induction is the zzso zzso which proposes that the zzso is zzso towards a neural fate, but is normally inhibited by zzso zzso Although there is strong evidence zzso this in zzso data from other organisms suggest more complexity, including an involvement of zzso and zzso of zzso However, it is generally believed that these additional signals also act by zzso zzso We have investigated whether zzso zzso is necessary and/or sufficient for neural zzso In the zzso zzso of zzso in the prospective neural plate zzso the expression of definitive neural markers zzso and late zzso but does not affect the early expression of zzso suggesting that zzso zzso is required only as a late step during neural zzso zzso of zzso zzso by the potent zzso zzso either alone or together with a zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso in competent zzso is not sufficient to induce expression of zzso directly, even in combination with zzso zzso zzso or zzso and/or zzso of zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso zzso is not sufficient for neural induction in the chick zzso To test this in zzso zzso zzso was injected into the A4 zzso (which reliably contributes to zzso but not to neural plate or its zzso at the zzso zzso expression of neural markers zzso and zzso is not zzso We propose that neural induction involves additional zzso events that remain to be zzso
