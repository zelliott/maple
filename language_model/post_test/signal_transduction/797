The zzso family of zzso factors plays a pivotal role in regulation of diverse biological zzso including immune responses, cell growth, and zzso zzso of zzso is zzso by both zzso and zzso signaling zzso Although the zzso zzso has been extensively zzso the mechanism zzso the zzso zzso is still poorly zzso Recent studies have identified the zzso zzso zzso as a key component of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso however, how the signaling function of zzso is regulated remains zzso We report here that one important mechanism of zzso regulation is through its dynamic interaction with the tumor necrosis factor zzso factor 3 zzso zzso physically associates with zzso via a specific sequence motif located in the zzso region of zzso this molecular interaction appears to target zzso for degradation by the zzso Interestingly, induction of zzso zzso signaling by zzso signals involves degradation of zzso and the zzso enhancement of zzso zzso These results suggest that induction of zzso zzso signaling may involve the rescue of zzso from zzso negative zzso
