The zzso zzso factor plays a pivotal role in both, the zzso and zzso actions of zzso zzso acquires the ability to bind DNA by becoming zzso on zzso However, to effectively stimulate gene transcription, it must also be zzso on zzso We show that engagement of T cell zzso zzso zzso complex in either zzso cells or peripheral blood zzso stimulates zzso of zzso but not zzso of zzso This process does not require the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso of T cells with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso completely zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso whereas zzso to zzso and zzso zzso had no zzso zzso of zzso of zzso in T cells is not restricted to zzso but also results when cells are zzso via the zzso zzso zzso The combination of zzso and zzso did not augment zzso of zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso activity in response to zzso was enhanced with zzso zzso whereas zzso alone had little zzso These findings suggest that zzso is a signaling zzso in zzso signaling and may play a role in T cell zzso
