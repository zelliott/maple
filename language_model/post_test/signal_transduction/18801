The zzso forms a complex interface between the mother and fetus during development that is designed for efficient zzso zzso A large surface area is created by extensive branching zzso of the zzso zzso to create a zzso network, called the labyrinth in zzso These zzso are subsequently zzso with an elaborate zzso zzso zzso begins with selection of a subset of zzso cells in the zzso layer of the zzso that express the zzso zzso zzso These cells leave the cell cycle and undergo cell shape changes that initiate a process of zzso to create primary zzso into which fetal blood vessels zzso Much less is known about the regulation of subsequent events in zzso certainly compared with other zzso However, over 60 different mouse zzso have defects during later labyrinth zzso Some of these zzso genes zzso components of signaling pathways such as the zzso growth factor and zzso pathways that play zzso zzso roles in other zzso zzso These zzso represent a still largely untapped resource as most of them have not been studied in detail in relation to zzso zzso
