In zzso the first zzso h after partial zzso zzso are characterized by an zzso reaction, after which liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the iron hormone zzso which blocks iron zzso and may compromise iron zzso in the growing zzso The expressions of zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso gene expression during the late phase of liver zzso are zzso 

To characterize the expression pattern of zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso regulation during liver zzso 

zzso were subjected to zzso or sham zzso Liver zzso number of zzso zzso and serum levels of iron and zzso were zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2, zzso zzso metal zzso 1, zzso and zzso were determined with zzso at different time zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso were determined with western zzso 

During the zzso response, zzso release induced zzso protein and zzso zzso whereas zzso levels of proteins in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2) zzso The zzso levels of proteins involved in cellular iron zzso were increased and cellular iron export zzso During liver zzso zzso h after zzso gene expressions in the zzso zzso were continuously suppressed and zzso zzso levels declined zzso days after zzso 

zzso gene expression zzso during the zzso response, but a sustained zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso regulation gradually reduces zzso gene expression until zzso is complete, thereby promoting iron zzso to the zzso zzso
