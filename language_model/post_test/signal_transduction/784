zzso growth zzso zzso plays a zzso role in several human zzso including zzso diseases and zzso zzso signaling is zzso through its interaction with three types of cell surface zzso zzso zzso and zzso The soluble zzso of zzso and zzso bind to zzso making them attractive candidates to zzso zzso and inhibit its zzso To zzso the activity of the zzso we studied the effect of artificially zzso them upon their zzso of binding to zzso using an optical zzso and studied their zzso zzso using an in zzso signaling zzso We fused the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso to de zzso designed zzso zzso strands and demonstrated that the zzso strands within the fusion proteins were capable of promoting the zzso of the zzso zzso Our results indicate that coiled zzso zzso of the zzso stabilized their interaction with zzso as compared with the zzso zzso Also, in contrast to the zzso zzso which did not block zzso the coiled zzso zzso were characterized by zzso zzso in the low zzso zzso
