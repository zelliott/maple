The aim was to investigate the possible interactions of the two peripheral hormones, zzso and zzso that regulate the energy balance in opposite zzso 

zzso zzso zzso diabetic fatty zzso and lean control rats were treated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 18 days, and the effects on body weight, food intake and body composition were zzso The level of expression of anabolic and zzso zzso and their receptors in the zzso area were zzso by in zzso zzso 

zzso treatment induced zzso and zzso zzso total fat mass and gain in body zzso in lean control rats, while these parameters were not increased in zzso zzso Treatment with zzso of lean control rats increased zzso zzso expression of the anabolic zzso Y zzso zzso and decreased zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso rats, the expression of zzso zzso was not affected by treatment with zzso whereas zzso zzso expression was increased in the zzso zzso zzso 

This shows that zzso zzso and zzso in lean control rats are correlated with increased zzso zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso zzso The elimination of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso rats may be due to lack of zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, we suggest that zzso zzso exert their zzso and zzso effects via zzso mechanisms that are dependent on intact zzso zzso
