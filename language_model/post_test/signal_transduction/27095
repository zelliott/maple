The presence of zzso receptors on T cells suggests the potential for modulating T cell function upon binding of an appropriate zzso zzso highly zzso human T cells we assessed the zzso capacity of T cells upon stimulation with immobilized zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso response of T cells and their zzso zzso or zzso zzso to zzso zzso was inhibited in a zzso manner by zzso In parallel experiments, various zzso of zzso zzso zzso were added to zzso zzso T cells and their zzso Similar zzso effects were observed with the important exception that zzso was considerably more zzso than zzso The results also showed that zzso was a much more effective inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso 2 synthesis by T cells than was zzso Because both the zzso and zzso receptors are linked to zzso zzso the magnitude and zzso of zzso zzso in T cells and their zzso were determined after stimulation with zzso or zzso The results show that zzso induced a greater and more sustained zzso of zzso than zzso Moreover, these differences could not be ascribed to differential zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the degree of zzso of zzso zzso T cell proliferation by zzso or zzso with the level of zzso of zzso in these zzso T cells indicate that, on an zzso basis, zzso zzso by zzso is more zzso than that induced by zzso These results suggest that qualitative differences in zzso zzso in T cells have an important role in the subsequent zzso of zzso zzso T cell zzso
