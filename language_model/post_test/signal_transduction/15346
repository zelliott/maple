The effects of zzso stem cells zzso on proliferation and cell fate determination of neural stem cells zzso have been zzso zzso were zzso with zzso or zzso cells using an in zzso zzso zzso After 4 days, zzso zzso showed that the number of cells positive for the cell proliferation zzso zzso in zzso in zzso was greater than in zzso zzso In some experiments, the zzso of zzso and zzso cells were removed to induce zzso zzso Seven days after initiating zzso the levels of the zzso marker, zzso were higher in zzso in zzso zzso group, and those of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso were lower, compared with zzso cells zzso zzso These were confirmed by zzso The role of the zzso signaling zzso analyzed with the specific zzso zzso and by examining the expression of zzso genes using zzso showed that after zzso with zzso for zzso zzso expressed much higher levels of zzso zzso and zzso than did zzso zzso with zzso zzso Treatment with zzso decreased zzso zzso and zzso expression in zzso and increased zzso zzso The data indicate that the interactions between zzso and zzso promote zzso proliferation and are involved in specifying zzso fate, zzso in part by zzso zzso
