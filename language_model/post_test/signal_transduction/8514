zzso adhesive signaling is a hallmark of zzso isolated from the scars of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in adhesive zzso The aim of the present study was to examine the role of zzso zzso in a mouse model of skin zzso using mice bearing a zzso deletion of zzso zzso 

zzso sclerosis was induced by subcutaneous injection of zzso Control groups were treated with zzso zzso zzso Mice bearing a zzso deletion of zzso zzso and control mice were zzso zzso zzso collagen production, and the number of zzso muscle zzso cells were zzso The quantity of the zzso zzso acid zzso was also zzso 

zzso treatment induced marked zzso zzso and zzso in control zzso zzso the deletion of zzso zzso resulted in resistance to zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso by zzso is required for zzso zzso of zzso zzso may be a viable method to alleviate the development of zzso zzso
