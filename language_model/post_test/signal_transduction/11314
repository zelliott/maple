During zzso zzso the zzso zzso into neural zzso and also into zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso in the brain and the retinal zzso zzso in the zzso The molecular mechanisms that pattern neural and zzso zzso within the zzso remain zzso We report that zzso is normally expressed in the zzso region of the zzso zzso that is destined to become the neural zzso suggesting a role in neural patterning in the zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in the zzso region of the zzso zzso extends neural differentiation into the zzso retinal zzso zzso resulting in a duplicate neural zzso in transgenic zzso zzso expression of zzso active Ras is also sufficient to convert the retinal zzso zzso to neural zzso suggesting that zzso signaling may be involved in neural differentiation in the immature zzso zzso The original and the duplicate neural zzso differentiate and zzso with zzso polarity in the absence of an zzso suggesting that the program of zzso differentiation in the zzso is autonomously zzso In mouse zzso lacking zzso the retinal zzso zzso extends into the zzso neural zzso indicating a role of zzso in defining the boundary of the neural zzso
