The expression of genes zzso zzso and/or phase 2 detoxifying zzso can be enhanced in response to various environmental zzso The main zzso factor involved in this response is nuclear factor zzso zzso factor 2 zzso zzso activity is zzso regulated by the protein zzso 1 zzso While the roles of zzso and phase 2 genes in zzso of zzso have been well zzso only few studies have dealt with their role in skin zzso zzso human zzso zzso and zzso zzso were treated by chemical zzso of the zzso zzso or by small interfering zzso zzso used to knock down zzso zzso The above treatments resulted in significant stimulation of zzso zzso 1) gene zzso zzso zzso gene was also induced but interestingly increased zzso zzso the zzso heavy zzso zzso was mainly zzso in zzso whereas the zzso zzso the modifier, light zzso zzso was mostly induced in zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) gene induction was relatively strong in zzso but generally absent in zzso except when the cells were subjected to zzso doses of the above zzso Exposure to solar zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso or to UVA alone zzso zzso confirmed this trend, but interestingly, at doses where cell growth reduction was comparable, UVA was generally more efficient than solar zzso in inducing phase 2 zzso When zzso directed against zzso were used, a strong zzso of zzso expression was observed in both, zzso and zzso whereas reduction of zzso expression was mainly detected in zzso To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing phase 2 gene zzso in NHK and zzso The results hereby presented should contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in skin adaptation to environmental zzso
