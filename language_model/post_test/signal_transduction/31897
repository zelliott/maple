The zzso zzso factor controls diverse biological zzso According to the classical model, zzso is retained in the zzso of resting cells via binding to zzso zzso proteins and zzso into the nucleus upon their zzso zzso Here we reveal that zzso a known tumor zzso and inhibitor of growth factor zzso zzso spatial regulator of zzso zzso expression is regulated by the zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor and zzso and zzso specifically zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by these zzso Like zzso zzso sequesters zzso in the zzso of resting zzso However, contrary to zzso zzso continues to zzso zzso nuclear entry upon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso markedly enhances zzso zzso nuclear zzso and zzso zzso This study establishes zzso as a feedback zzso of zzso zzso and highlights its potential to regulate the zzso between zzso zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso
