The central role of zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling in allowing cancer cells to bypass normal zzso controls has led to the development of zzso zzso A challenge in targeting zzso relates to the diverse actions of the zzso zzso in numerous cell zzso Recent findings in mice deficient in zzso activity in the heart, demonstrate the critical role of this zzso in protecting the heart against pathological zzso Mice deficient in zzso displayed accelerated heart failure in response to zzso or zzso zzso These results help explain the association of zzso in cancer patients given zzso zzso zzso and raise concerns for the use of zzso zzso in cancer patients with cardiovascular risk zzso Interestingly, an inhibitor of the zzso target of zzso (a downstream zzso of zzso did not have adverse effects on the zzso A more complete understanding of the complex arms and interactions of the zzso zzso will hopefully lead to the development of zzso agents without cardiac zzso
