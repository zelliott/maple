The tumor zzso has been largely studied as a dynamic system orchestrated by inflammatory cells, including cancer cells, zzso as well as the zzso zzso It is useful to describe and predict the zzso characteristics of zzso Furthermore, a better understanding of its interplay with the various aspects of the tumor cells may be zzso for the discovery of novel molecular zzso Liver cancer is considered a model of the relation occurring between the tumor zzso and tumor zzso The chronic inflammatory status of the liver, sustained by the infection of zzso zzso as well as the production of zzso and growth factors within the zzso lead to an intricate zzso The identification of novel molecular therapeutic targets may improve the outcome of patients with liver cancer as it remains the third leading cause of cancer death zzso In the present study, the tumor zzso in zzso zzso zzso was explored by a review of the zzso Studies on zzso virus infections and the zzso chronic inflammatory status were zzso In this context, zzso and/or zzso molecular mechanisms have been hypothesized as being responsible for liver cancer zzso The zzso among zzso zzso zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso growth factors and several proteins is also described together with the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Finally, the rationale for targeting zzso interface is summarized in the context of new therapeutic zzso
