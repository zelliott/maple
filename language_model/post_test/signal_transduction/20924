Members of the inhibitor of zzso zzso gene family prevent programmed cell death induced by multiple signals in diverse organisms, suggesting that they act at a zzso step in the zzso zzso To investigate the molecular mechanism of zzso function, we expressed zzso zzso the zzso viral zzso from zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus, by using novel zzso zzso and zzso zzso insect cell zzso zzso zzso blocked both zzso and zzso zzso zzso With or without zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso with cellular zzso and the zzso suggesting a zzso site of zzso To identify the zzso at which zzso blocks zzso we monitored the effect of zzso expression on in zzso zzso of the insect zzso death zzso zzso zzso prevented in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and blocked zzso activity upon viral infection or zzso zzso However, unlike the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso failed to affect activated zzso as determined by in zzso zzso zzso These findings provide the first zzso evidence that zzso blocks zzso of the host zzso or zzso its activity by a mechanism distinct from zzso Moreover, as suggested by the capacity of zzso to block zzso induced by diverse signals, including virus infection and zzso radiation, zzso functions at a central point at or upstream from steps involving the death zzso
