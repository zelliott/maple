zzso signaling regulation plays an important role in triggering and/or maintaining zzso zzso zzso Little is known about the relationship of the zzso receptors zzso and zzso receptors zzso in left atrium to chronic zzso In this study, we investigated the expression and function of zzso zzso and zzso in a chronic dog model of zzso zzso was induced in 6 dogs by rapid right zzso pacing for 24 weeks, and a sham procedure was performed in 5 dogs zzso zzso The intact left zzso zzso were used to examine the expression and function of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and were zzso by caffeine, zzso to release zzso through zzso zzso zzso We also assessed the molecular components of left zzso tissue underlying the amount of zzso zzso and zzso determined by zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso In the chronic zzso group, the zzso released through zzso is not altered, but the zzso released through zzso increased zzso zzso distributed in zzso of zzso cellular zzso its expression significantly decreased in zzso group compared to zzso zzso distributed in zzso zzso distributed not only in zzso cellular zzso but also in nuclear envelope and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso expression significantly increased in chronic zzso group compared to zzso These results indicated that in a chronic dog model of zzso the expression and function of zzso zzso on the contrary, the expression and function of zzso zzso zzso and zzso may be the major zzso which regulate zzso or even zzso zzso signal zzso
