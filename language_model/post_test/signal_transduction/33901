zzso is a zzso process, where it is believed that the transformation of normal cells into zzso cells needs a succession of genetic and zzso changes, such as point zzso zzso zzso and changes in gene expression zzso All these modifications are supposed to zzso a selective advantage and to generate highly zzso cancer zzso Until recently, the same selection procedure of rare cells in the zzso mass was believed to be necessary for the zzso zzso Using gene expression zzso several recent publications report that a gene expression signature could discriminate between primary zzso with high zzso zzso and poor clinical outcome, and primary zzso that are not going to zzso Analysis of the biological pathways associated with zzso potential points to cell zzso zzso cell cycle regulation, initiation of DNA zzso and DNA zzso zzso human primary zzso melanoma and various biological zzso we have shown that the zzso of DNA repair zzso particularly those involved in zzso break repair and surveillance of the DNA replication zzso is associated with zzso and poor patient survival zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Alonso, zzso zzso zzso zzso Romero, zzso Robert, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Lenoir, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso van den zzso zzso zzso Gene expression profiling of primary zzso melanoma and clinical outcome, zzso zzso Cancer zzso 98 zzso zzso These results, also found by zzso other types of human zzso such as breast or zzso zzso would clearly explain the high resistance of zzso towards zzso and zzso Our hypothesis is that genetic instability is absolutely necessary to go from normal cells to zzso cells, but one needs some type of genetic stabilization, which can be obtained by zzso specific DNA repair zzso in order to produce primary zzso cells that are genetically stable enough to be able to invade and give rise to distant zzso
