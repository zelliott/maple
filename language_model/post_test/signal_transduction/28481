zzso zzso cells were zzso transformed to grow in response to zzso zzso zzso or zzso in which the hormone binding domain of the zzso zzso zzso was linked to the zzso truncated zzso zzso zzso When these cells were deprived of zzso or zzso for 24 zzso they exited the cell cycle and underwent zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso cells, were readily induced to re-enter the cell cycle after addition of zzso or zzso zzso zzso but not zzso cells, expressed activated forms of zzso and zzso after zzso or zzso zzso zzso or zzso alone did not induce zzso cells to re-enter the cell cycle, whereas cell cycle entry was observed upon their zzso zzso was prevented in zzso cells when they were cultured in the presence of zzso or zzso whereas they underwent zzso in their zzso zzso by itself did not prevent zzso however, upon zzso or zzso zzso and addition of insulin, more than an additive effect was observed in both lines indicating that these zzso ways zzso to prevent zzso zzso zzso differ in their abilities to control zzso and cell cycle progression and zzso requires zzso pathways for full zzso and zzso zzso
