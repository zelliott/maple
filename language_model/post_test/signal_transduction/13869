zzso zzso and zzso pathways play a fundamental role in zzso zzso and classical genetic zzso zzso these pathways are well zzso We hypothesized that gene zzso of negative zzso of these signaling pathways might be an important alternative genetic background for zzso zzso 

By examining gene expression patterns of negative zzso of zzso zzso we attempted to identify potential tumor zzso zzso We then analyzed the zzso and zzso patterns of the identified gene in 101 zzso tumors and tested its functions in zzso and in zzso to establish the tumor zzso role in zzso zzso 

Among 13 negative zzso of the zzso zzso screened, zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was frequently zzso in zzso zzso which was coupled to its zzso in zzso cancer zzso We also, for the first time, identified the presence of zzso zzso with a prevalence of zzso zzso zzso 2 of zzso in zzso zzso cancer zzso and zzso zzso zzso 5 of 30) in zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso displayed zzso and zzso and zzso zzso activities, which were all impaired by the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were mutually exclusive and collectively found in zero of 20 benign zzso tumors, zzso zzso zzso 1 of 31) of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 13 of zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso 10 of 30) of zzso A rate of zzso zzso zzso 5 of 24) of tumors carrying zzso zzso or zzso at high levels zzso vs zzso zzso zzso 34 of zzso of tumors carrying no zzso zzso or zzso at low levels zzso zzso zzso any of the classical zzso zzso P zzso zzso Fisher exact zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes in the zzso and zzso zzso revealing a largely mutually exclusive zzso 

We identified zzso as a major tumor zzso gene that is frequently zzso by zzso and zzso providing a new alternative genetic background for zzso cancer, particularly zzso and zzso
