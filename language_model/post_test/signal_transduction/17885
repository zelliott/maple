zzso analysis shows that zzso zzso a zzso zzso factor, has both negative and positive zzso zzso regulation is expected from a factor that has a zzso zzso domain but zzso is harder to zzso We used zzso a form of zzso that had its zzso domain replaced by the zzso domain of zzso to show that zzso activates targets using two parallel routes, by zzso a zzso and by being a bona fide zzso We identified the intermediate zzso activity as being zzso by sloppy paired 1 and 2 and showed that bona fide zzso is dramatically enhanced by zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a zzso zzso factor and the recruitment of additional zzso presumably specifies which function prevails on an individual zzso zzso zzso is a zzso thought to be required for zzso by zzso zzso However, in zzso zzso zzso is required for repression (as well as zzso by zzso This is consistent with in zzso results showing that zzso is involved in recognition of positive and negative zzso Moreover, we provide genetic evidence that, in abdominal zzso zzso and zzso two zzso proteins not previously thought to participate in the zzso zzso are also involved in the repression of target genes by zzso We suggest that, like zzso zzso and zzso could help zzso recognize target genes or activate the expression of factors that do zzso
