zzso chains modify a major subset of the zzso but detection of zzso signaling dynamics and zzso is limited due to a lack of appropriate zzso Here, we employ zzso domain zzso fluorescent sensors to monitor linear and zzso chains in zzso and in zzso We zzso the zzso in zzso and zzso zzso for detection of linear zzso and zzso zzso motif zzso and zzso zzso zinc finger zzso zzso to detect zzso zzso Linear and zzso sensors decorated the zzso coat surrounding zzso zzso during bacterial zzso whereas zzso sensors selectively monitored zzso zzso and DNA damage responses in fixed and living zzso In addition, linear and zzso sensors could be used to monitor zzso signaling zzso as demonstrated by their ability to zzso interfere with zzso and zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso could serve as prototypes to track and trace other chain types and zzso signals in zzso
