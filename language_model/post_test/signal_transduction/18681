We analyze a simple linear triggering model of the zzso zzso zzso within the framework of zzso theory, in which zzso enter the queue upon full zzso and exit by zzso We fit our model to four zzso characterized threshold zzso criteria and analyze their specificity and zzso the initial calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso formation, and zzso zzso zzso characteristics improve as the time window for detection increases, zzso for time periods on the zzso of zzso thus, the calcium spike (30 zzso has low specificity but a sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso while the zzso threshold (1 zzso can distinguish zzso with a zzso variation in the complex zzso However, a zzso analysis shows that these properties are zzso when the queue parameters are subject to zzso example, under zzso in the zzso number in the zzso interface and population variation in the cellular zzso A time integration of the queue over a period of hours is shown to be able to control zzso noise efficiently for realistic zzso values when integrated over sufficiently long time periods zzso the discrimination characteristics being determined by the zzso signal cascade zzso (a kinetic zzso zzso zzso through a combination of thresholds and signal integration, a T cell can be responsive to low zzso density and specific to zzso zzso We suggest that multiple threshold mechanisms are employed to establish the conditions for efficient signal integration, zzso coordinate the formation of a stable contact zzso
