zzso is one of the main zzso of zzso zzso proven to have zzso zzso through zzso of zzso activated protein zzso zzso in liver and zzso However, the role of zzso on the insulin gene is zzso zzso the effect of zzso on insulin gene zzso was investigated in the present zzso zzso gene zzso were used in the mouse zzso line zzso to test the effect of zzso on the promoter of mouse insulin gene zzso The zzso and protein levels of insulin were also zzso Diet induced zzso intolerant mice were used to explore the effect of zzso on blood zzso zzso and insulin resistance in zzso The insulin content in zzso was zzso by an image analysis software in the zzso zzso The results revealed that zzso caused a zzso zzso zzso of insulin gene zzso in zzso cells which showed a significant difference from the long term used zzso zzso zzso Such zzso on insulin promoter resulted in the reduction of zzso and protein of zzso Furthermore, the zzso of insulin promoter was totally abolished by zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso significantly improved insulin resistance and zzso intolerance of zzso Likewise, insulin content in zzso of zzso treated mice was also zzso Thus, the insulin gene represents a novel target of zzso that may contribute to the action of zzso in type 2 diabetes zzso
