Although the role of zzso T cells in tissue inflammation and organ injury resulting from zzso and zzso injury zzso has been well zzso it remains unclear how zzso T cells are activated and function in the absence of a specific zzso zzso We used a zzso liver warm zzso model to determine first whether de zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso was required and then what its functional mechanism zzso The critical role of zzso T cells in liver immune zzso against zzso and zzso zzso was confirmed in zzso knockout mice and zzso depleted zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso of zzso T cell zzso without target cell depletion failed to protect zzso against zzso and this suggested that T cells function in liver zzso without zzso de zzso zzso To dissect the T cell functional zzso we found that zzso zzso but not zzso gamma zzso zzso inhibited local immune zzso and protected zzso from zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso restored liver zzso in otherwise protected zzso zzso Finally, zzso cell sorting analysis of liver zzso T cells revealed the selective zzso of zzso cells, which zzso expressed a higher level of zzso in comparison with their peripheral zzso zzso triggered a significant liver increase in zzso expression but not zzso zzso and zzso responded to zzso zzso 4 and type I zzso stimulation to zzso zzso zzso 

These novel findings provide evidence that zzso T cells function in liver zzso via zzso without de zzso zzso zzso and innate zzso zzso zzso may trigger the engagement of zzso to facilitate tissue inflammation and zzso
