The zzso zzso protein zzso signals from zzso receptors to the Ras zzso of cell zzso by providing binding sites for the recruitment to the zzso compartment of the zzso zzso exchange zzso The need for zzso in this process is however unclear since zzso can be recruited directly to zzso containing membrane receptors through its zzso zzso Evidence from studies in zzso indicates that zzso is zzso and is involved in the integration of independent signals to the Ras zzso Furthermore, zzso may be a key control point at which signaling can be modulated both by interfering signals and by feedback zzso Here we review recent literature to support these functions for zzso
