A model is developed to study the in zzso intermediate filament organization in terms of zzso between four different structural zzso soluble zzso zzso short, and long zzso An analysis is conducted, showing that the system has a unique, globally zzso stable zzso By means of sensitivity analysis, the influence of parameters on the system is zzso It is shown that, in agreement with biological zzso zzso modifications of intermediate filament proteins resulting in filament zzso are the main regulators of the intermediate filament zzso A high zzso zzso of filaments zzso the intermediate filament zzso in zzso
