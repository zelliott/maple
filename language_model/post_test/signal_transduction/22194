The zzso precursor protein zzso has been mainly studied in its role in the production of zzso zzso peptides zzso because zzso deposition is a hallmark of Alzheimer's zzso Although several studies suggest zzso has zzso functions, it is still zzso We previously reported that zzso increased zzso differentiation of neural zzso cells zzso In the current study, zzso transplanted into zzso transgenic mice primarily differentiated into zzso zzso In zzso treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso cells in zzso and over expression of zzso caused most zzso to differentiate into zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso also zzso increased expression levels of zzso in zzso cells along with the generation of zzso zzso domain zzso and expression of zzso and zzso of split 1 zzso Treatment with zzso inhibitor suppressed the generation of zzso and reduced zzso and zzso zzso Treatment with the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso was enough to induce up regulation of zzso and zzso expressions, and application of 22 zzso zzso recognizing zzso zzso suppressed these changes by zzso These results indicate zzso zzso zzso differentiation of zzso through zzso zzso
