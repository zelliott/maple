Among its varied functions, zzso signaling is involved in peripheral T cells zzso The zzso and polarization of zzso T cells toward a zzso lineage are essential steps in the zzso of multiple sclerosis and its animal model, experimental zzso zzso zzso of all four zzso receptors with a zzso inhibitor was shown to block zzso polarization and to zzso the symptoms of experimental zzso zzso In this study, we have examined the role of individual zzso receptors in zzso zzso production, and zzso potential of zzso T zzso zzso induction of zzso and zzso transcripts were noted in zzso T cells upon zzso zzso However, using zzso inhibitor and zzso blocking distinct zzso zzso we have found that selective zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso responses of zzso T zzso Moreover, zzso zzso in T cells correlated with the zzso expression of protein zzso zzso a zzso with important regulatory function within mature T zzso Thus, selective zzso of the zzso zzso may have important effects on peripheral T cell responses and may offer a new attractive target in treating zzso diseases, including multiple zzso
