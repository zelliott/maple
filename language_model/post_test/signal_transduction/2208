In this study we investigated the hypothesis that zzso could play a role in the zzso of the hypoxic stimulus in the carotid body zzso by being a regulator of the zzso zzso zzso C zzso We addressed this question by comparing the zzso activity in the absence and presence of zzso in zzso of zzso dissected from zzso cats that were zzso in zzso to the contrasting conditions of zzso zzso approximately 90 zzso and zzso zzso approximately 20 zzso The tissue of a nearby superior cervical zzso zzso was used as a zzso The zzso was the source of zzso zzso activity was zzso by measuring the formation of radioactive zzso zzso from zzso used as an zzso zzso zzso was added to the zzso mixture at the zzso of zzso zzso and 1 zzso chosen on the basis of test trials on zzso dependence of zzso zzso We found that zzso increased appreciably the zzso activity over its zzso zzso of zzso level in the zzso carotid zzso The zzso effect of zzso was zzso in the hypoxic carotid body, the lower zzso concentration having a stronger zzso Such zzso changes were absent in the zzso These findings suggest a regulatory role for zzso in the zzso hypoxic signal zzso in the carotid zzso
