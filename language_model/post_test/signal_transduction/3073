zzso zzso cells zzso undergo zzso zzso zzso to participate in liver zzso and identification of molecular targets for this cell fate regulation is essential for development of zzso therapeutic zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for differentiation of zzso and its zzso repression zzso zzso zzso The herbal prescription zzso zzso prevents liver fibrosis, but its active ingredients and molecular mechanisms are zzso Here we demonstrate zzso prevents and reverses zzso zzso by way of zzso zzso of zzso involving reductions in zzso expression and its recruitment to zzso promoter, suppressed expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso reduction of zzso at the 3' zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso mass zzso zzso and nuclear magnetic resonance zzso analyses identify zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso as active zzso zzso and BC suppress the expression and signaling by zzso zzso which are implicated in the aforementioned zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment in mice with existing zzso liver zzso zzso zzso zzso and progression of liver zzso 

These results demonstrate a therapeutic potential of zzso and its active component zzso and BC for liver zzso by way of zzso zzso zzso by suppression of zzso zzso signaling in zzso
