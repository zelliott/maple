The present study aimed to investigate the responses of zzso with different zzso weights zzso to dietary zzso zzso A total of 192 zzso Arbor zzso broiler zzso with different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were allocated to a 2 zzso zzso zzso arrangement with six replicates of eight zzso Control starter zzso and zzso zzso diets contained zzso and zzso Met, zzso zzso values for a zzso treatment were zzso and zzso Light zzso had poorer zzso growth performance and breast muscle weight and lower zzso zzso growth zzso zzso concentration and zzso level in breast muscle than heavy zzso when both were fed the control zzso zzso diets improved performance and promoted breast muscle growth and zzso concentration in light zzso zzso Increased zzso and target of zzso zzso zzso levels as well as decreased zzso protein 1 zzso zzso and zzso box O 4 zzso zzso levels were induced by zzso diets in light zzso zzso In conclusion, the Met requirement of zzso might depend on their zzso and Met levels used in the control diets in the present study were adequate for heavy zzso but inadequate for light zzso resulting in poorer performance and breast muscle growth, which were improved by increasing dietary Met supply presumably through zzso in zzso synthesis and gene expression of the zzso and zzso zzso
