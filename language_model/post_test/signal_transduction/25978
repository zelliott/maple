zzso are very invasive brain tumors with poor prognosis and therefore any attempt to limit tumor cell dissemination in the brain is expected to improve zzso zzso The recent zzso of zzso as additional zzso for zzso and zzso has raised key issues on its interaction with the zzso axis as a mechanism to zzso zzso cell zzso In this work we investigated protein and zzso expression of the two zzso zzso and zzso together with their receptors zzso and zzso in human zzso specimens and cell lines by zzso flow zzso and quantitative real-time zzso The main purpose of this study was to find out whether and at what extent zzso and zzso are zzso expressed in zzso zzso In human zzso specimens the levels of zzso and zzso zzso were significantly higher in zzso compared to zzso controls or low grade zzso whilst no difference was found for zzso and zzso zzso zzso In cell lines, flow zzso and zzso experiments showed zzso was mainly expressed irrespective of its membrane or zzso zzso In contrast, a zzso zzso zzso together with a negligible membrane expression of zzso was found in all cells zzso In in zzso experiments zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso showed complete zzso of zzso zzso Our findings, in agreement with previous data, suggest that in human zzso cells the prevalent zzso zzso of zzso might zzso the functionality of zzso either acting as a scavenger for these zzso or interfering with the signaling pathways activated by the stimulation of zzso
