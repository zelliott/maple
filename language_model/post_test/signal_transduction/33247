zzso cell zzso causes zzso of zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to the binding of zzso proteins including zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Since zzso is a key regulator of the Ras signal zzso pathway, one plausible hypothesis has been that zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to zzso of the Ras cascade and ultimately to zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso Thus, in this scenario zzso would serve as an upstream regulator of zzso zzso zzso However, in this report we present several lines of evidence showing that zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso is independent of zzso First, a zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso affecting the putative zzso binding site supports zzso of zzso zzso in adhering zzso but not zzso zzso of zzso Second, zzso zzso to zzso expressed fragments of zzso demonstrates that robust zzso of zzso zzso can zzso zzso zzso of zzso Finally, we have used zzso the zzso zzso domain of zzso as a dominant negative inhibitor of zzso zzso and of zzso zzso of focal zzso Using zzso infection, we demonstrate that levels of zzso expression sufficient to completely block zzso zzso zzso were without effect on zzso zzso of zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso zzso of zzso zzso is independent of zzso and indicate the probable existence of at least two distinct zzso signaling pathways in zzso
