The objective of this study was to determine the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the development of heart failure, by investigating zzso zzso D1 zzso signaling in zzso in cardiac zzso Using a zzso mouse expressing a truncated version of zzso zzso to disruption of the zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso interaction with zzso zzso we studied two mouse models of pathological zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso infusion and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pressure zzso Our results indicate that zzso mice exhibit an accelerated progression to cardiac dysfunction in response to zzso treatment and zzso zzso mice display attenuated zzso cardiac zzso increased collagen deposition and zzso compared to zzso zzso control zzso zzso reduced levels of zzso zzso are observed in zzso mice compared to zzso mice, resulting in diminished zzso of zzso zzso 5 zzso and decreased zzso gene zzso This is consistent with a reduced zzso zzso zzso leading to progression of heart failure in zzso zzso Overall, our data demonstrates a critical in zzso role for zzso signaling in the development of zzso zzso to enhance cardiac performance in response to zzso pressure overload and zzso stimulation by zzso zzso
