It is known that certain type I membrane molecules zzso receptors type 1 and 2) belonging to the regulators of complement zzso zzso family are involved in the regulation of B zzso zzso In contrast, only zzso RCA molecules zzso have been described to be involved in T zzso zzso In this study, we describe a novel function for the mouse RCA type I membrane protein zzso as a zzso zzso in zzso T cell zzso This is shown by increased zzso proliferation of zzso zzso T zzso in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso and zzso favors zzso rather than zzso zzso in these zzso zzso signaling was also observed regardless of additional zzso protein zzso C, or zzso zzso Analysis of zzso intermediaries shows that zzso zzso enhances certain zzso signals, producing increased early zzso zzso of many zzso and enhanced zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso These data fit well with the association of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso found in T cell zzso The zzso recognized by the zzso zzso interferes with the protective role of zzso on zzso zzso The relationship between protective function and zzso by zzso is zzso Our results support a zzso role for zzso in T cells and suggest new links between the natural and zzso immune zzso
