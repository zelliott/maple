The zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso protein 1 zzso also known as zzso protein 3 zzso has been identified as a scaffold protein for zzso zzso protein zzso signal zzso pathways and as a cargo adapter in the conventional zzso transport zzso Furthermore, a functional relationship between zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso signaling has been established zzso In this study, we first demonstrated that the zzso light chain is required for the targeting and zzso of zzso to the tips of zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, to understand whether zzso signaling is involved in zzso zzso trafficking, we established stable zzso cell lines that expressed zzso zzso or its zzso lacking the zzso domain zzso zzso studies of the cell lines indicated that the zzso zzso was localized to the growth cones of zzso zzso cells in a similar manner to zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the proper zzso zzso of zzso along zzso probably does not require zzso zzso
