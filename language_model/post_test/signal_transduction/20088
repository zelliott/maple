zzso zzso signaling is involved in the zzso of liver zzso It has been previously shown that zzso zzso zzso can reduce liver zzso in zzso However, zzso is not stable in zzso which limits its clinical zzso This study compares the zzso potential of two known zzso antagonists, zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso is a synthetic zzso presently in clinical cancer trials and has been reported to be safe and zzso These drugs attenuated early liver zzso in common zzso duct zzso rats, improved liver function, and prevented zzso zzso cell zzso zzso thereby suppressing zzso to zzso transition zzso While both zzso and zzso increased the number of zzso cell nuclear zzso positive liver cells in zzso only zzso increased zzso expression in zzso in rat zzso suggesting that while zzso and zzso effectively zzso early liver fibrosis, their zzso effects may be zzso through different modes of zzso Thus, zzso has the potential to serve as a new therapeutic agent for treating early liver zzso
