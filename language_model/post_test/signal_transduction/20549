The DNA duplex is an exquisite zzso array that stores genetic information to zzso proteins and regulate zzso Its unique structure also zzso chemical function that allows it also to mediate charge transport zzso We have zzso diverse platforms to probe DNA CT, using zzso zzso and even genetic zzso These studies have established powerful features of DNA CT zzso DNA CT can occur over long molecular distances as long as the bases are well zzso The zzso in base stacking that arise with single base zzso DNA zzso and the binding of some proteins that zzso the DNA all inhibit DNA zzso zzso single zzso studies of DNA CT show that ground state CT can occur over 34 zzso if the duplex is well zzso one single base mismatch zzso zzso The DNA duplex is an effective sensor for the integrity of the base pair zzso Moreover, the efficiency of DNA CT is what one would expect for a stack of zzso zzso equivalent to the stack of DNA base pairs and independent of the zzso zzso Since DNA CT offers a means to carry out zzso chemistry from a distance, we have considered how this chemistry might be used for long range biological zzso We have taken advantage of our chemical zzso and platforms to characterize DNA CT in the context of the zzso CT can occur over long zzso perhaps funneling damage to particular sites and insulating others from zzso zzso zzso zzso factors that activate the zzso to respond to zzso stress can also be activated from a distance through DNA zzso Numerous proteins maintain the integrity of the zzso and an increasing number of them contain zzso clusters that do not appear to carry out either structural or zzso zzso Using zzso methods, we find that DNA binding shifts the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso them towards zzso at zzso zzso We have proposed a model that describes how repair proteins may zzso DNA CT to efficiently search the zzso for zzso zzso many of these proteins occur in low copy numbers within the cell, and thus a zzso mechanism does not provide a sufficient explanation of how they find and repair zzso before the cell zzso Using atomic force zzso and genetic zzso we show that repair proteins zzso at DNA CT can zzso in the vicinity of DNA zzso and can cooperate in finding zzso within the zzso zzso proteins defective in DNA CT cannot zzso in the vicinity of zzso and do not assist other proteins involved in repair within the zzso zzso such genetic defects are associated with disease in human protein zzso As we continue to unravel this chemistry and discover more proteins with zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso we are learning more regarding opportunities for long range signaling and zzso and more examples of DNA CT chemistry that may provide critical functions within the zzso
