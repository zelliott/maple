zzso regulation of zzso signaling is essential for controlling cell zzso and zzso In zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling is critical for suppressing the zzso of zzso B zzso however, the mechanism underlying the negative regulation of signaling remains zzso Using genetically manipulated mouse models and total internal reflection zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso syndrome protein zzso which is zzso with zzso in all immune cells, is a critical negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso zzso gene deletion causes enhanced and prolonged zzso signaling and elevated levels of zzso in the mouse zzso The increased signaling in zzso knockout B cells is concurrent with increased zzso of zzso at the zzso surface, enhanced zzso spreading on the zzso zzso delayed zzso contraction, zzso in the merger of signaling active zzso zzso into signaling inactive central zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso zzso is activated first, followed by zzso in mouse and human primary B zzso The zzso of zzso is suppressed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and is restored by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso Our results reveal a new mechanism for the negative regulation of zzso signaling and broadly suggest an zzso mechanism for signaling zzso
