zzso is an zzso zzso protein that plays a key role in cell migration and tumor zzso zzso is an induced zzso of zzso that plays an important role in zzso suppression of zzso zzso and zzso of colon zzso We report frequent zzso of zzso and zzso at the invasive front of zzso lung zzso We investigated the expression of zzso and zzso zzso in 102 cases of zzso lung zzso zzso dimension, 2 zzso or zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in 97 zzso and 82 zzso cases, zzso Both were zzso localized in cancer cells at the zzso zzso although zzso tended to show a diffuse zzso pattern in some zzso A comparison of their zzso patterns revealed a striking similarity in their distribution in 24 cases, and a partial overlap between their zzso in another 20 zzso Moreover, an overall correlation was found between the expression levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso To gain insight into the mechanisms that regulate the expression of these zzso we additionally studied their expression in 58 cases of stage I lung zzso in which zzso status was determined by zzso zzso chain zzso strand zzso zzso analysis, and direct zzso The results showed that tumors with zzso zzso tended to express more zzso than those with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Also, tumors that zzso zzso had higher levels of zzso and zzso than those without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Further zzso analysis showed that tumors that zzso both zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso had higher levels of zzso and zzso than those without zzso zzso of these proteins zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso To see whether zzso signaling is involved in zzso and zzso zzso we further conducted in zzso analyses using six lung zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Western zzso analyses showed that zzso zzso levels, and to a lesser extent zzso zzso zzso levels, correlated with the expression levels of zzso and the zzso form of zzso zzso The addition of transforming growth zzso increased both zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso and zzso with different zzso the induction of zzso occurred earlier than that of zzso zzso Finally, the migration of zzso cells was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and a selective zzso inhibitor zzso In contrast, the migration of zzso cells was inhibited by zzso but much less effectively by zzso These results suggest that zzso mechanisms may exist that increase the expression of zzso and zzso at the invasive front of lung zzso and that zzso signaling could be one of the zzso Further investigations are warranted concerning the role of zzso and zzso in cancer cell invasion and the significance of zzso and zzso signaling in the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso
