An zzso to zzso exchange at zzso acid position 280 zzso in the third zzso loop of the human zzso zzso zzso was first identified in a patient suffering from zzso syndrome and later reported as a risk factor for zzso Here, we have compared the pharmacological and zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso expressed in zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso was created by overlapping extension zzso zzso zzso expression and affinity were assessed by zzso zzso binding to cell zzso and zzso function by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and stimulation of zzso zzso in intact cells, as well as stimulation of zzso binding to cell zzso 

Both receptors were expressed at similar levels with no significant differences in their affinities for zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso the zzso zzso was significantly more zzso to inhibit zzso zzso zzso and to stimulate zzso zzso with no difference in zzso zzso The zzso zzso was also more zzso to stimulate zzso zzso but this difference was not zzso The inverse zzso zzso was more zzso at zzso zzso to reduce zzso binding but, for both zzso failed to enhance zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso reduces the zzso efficacy of the human zzso zzso This effect may be relevant to the zzso of disorders associated with the zzso
