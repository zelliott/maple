It is recognized that zzso promotes zzso by zzso multiple transporting systems in the zzso zzso In contrast, less is known about the molecular targets of zzso actions on zzso transport in the cortical collecting duct zzso zzso cells in the zzso are exposed to zzso which is zzso locally or zzso from sympathetic nerve zzso zzso zzso channels in the zzso zzso zzso are critical for zzso recycling and controlling zzso membrane potential to establish the driving force for zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso and zzso are highly expressed in the mouse kidney zzso and are localized to the zzso membrane of the zzso Using zzso zzso in freshly isolated zzso we detected highly abundant zzso and scarce zzso single channel zzso most likely representing zzso and zzso channels, zzso zzso zzso decreased the open probability of both channels, with a relatively greater action on the zzso zzso This effect was zzso by zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso blockade abolished the zzso of zzso zzso channels by zzso zzso zzso significantly decreased the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced an acute zzso of zzso membrane potential, as directly monitored using zzso mode in isolated zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso channels in zzso cells via stimulation of zzso receptors and subsequently zzso This leads to zzso of the zzso membrane and a decreased driving force for zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
