zzso zzso zzso zzso changes that may lead to zzso cell death in the zzso However, the mechanism of zzso zzso cell death remains zzso The zzso zzso protein 2 zzso is expressed in selected regions of the brain and is emerged as an zzso zzso zzso in many neurological zzso We evaluated the zzso role of zzso against zzso zzso zzso cell death under experimental status zzso 

In zzso rats, zzso acid zzso was zzso unilaterally into the zzso zzso zzso to induce prolonged bilateral seizure zzso zzso protein level, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso c between zzso and zzso and expression of zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso were examined in the zzso zzso zzso following zzso status zzso The effects of zzso zzso into zzso area of a zzso zzso zzso or a zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso production, oxidized protein level, zzso respiratory chain zzso activities, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and DNA fragmentation in bilateral zzso zzso were zzso 

Increased oxidized proteins and zzso or zzso zzso of zzso or zzso c in the zzso zzso zzso was observed zzso h after experimental status zzso zzso of zzso and zzso increased zzso h after zzso status zzso zzso with zzso increased zzso zzso reduced protein zzso zzso overproduction and dysfunction of zzso Complex I, hindered the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and reduced DNA fragmentation in the zzso zzso zzso with zzso produced opposite zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which decreased overproduction of zzso oxygen species, improved zzso Complex I dysfunction, inhibited zzso zzso of zzso and prevented zzso release of zzso c by stabilizing the zzso zzso potential, leading to zzso of zzso zzso cell death in the zzso following status zzso
