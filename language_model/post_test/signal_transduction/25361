Although only zzso new cases of chronic zzso leukemia zzso were seen in the United States in 2009, this zzso continues to make scientific headlines zzso Advances in understanding the molecular zzso coupled with exciting developments in both drug design and development, targeting the initiating zzso zzso have kept zzso in the scientific limelight for more than a zzso Indeed, zzso a zzso inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has quickly become the therapeutic standard for newly diagnosed chronic zzso zzso zzso Yet, nearly one-third of patients will still have an inferior response to zzso either failing to respond to primary therapy or demonstrating progression after an initial zzso zzso efforts geared toward understanding the molecular mechanisms of zzso resistance have yielded valuable insights into the cellular biology of drug trafficking, zzso structure and function, and the rational design of novel small zzso zzso zzso Indeed, new classes of zzso zzso have recently been investigated in zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso inhibitor resistance and the molecular rationale for the development of second and now third generation therapies for patients with zzso will be keys to further disease control over the next 10 zzso
