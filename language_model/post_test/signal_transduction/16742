Plants have four zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso appears zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso NO synthesis is zzso by zzso nitrate zzso or a root plasma membrane zzso or occurs zzso zzso oxide zzso both zzso and zzso zzso However, there is no evidence of reaction with zzso and zzso reactions are unlikely except during zzso The only proven direct targets of NO in plants are zzso and one metal zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso in some species but may stimulate these zzso in zzso Plants also have the NO response zzso involving zzso zzso and release of calcium from internal zzso Other known targets include zzso and zzso electron zzso zzso oxide suppresses Fenton chemistry by interacting with zzso zzso preventing generation of zzso zzso zzso of NO in plant development, response to zzso and zzso zzso iron zzso and regulation of zzso and photosynthesis may all be ascribed to interaction with one of these zzso zzso oxide function in zzso acid zzso of zzso closure requires nitrate zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso likely functions to produce sufficient NO to inhibit zzso electron zzso allowing zzso zzso zzso oxide is produced during the hypersensitive response outside cells undergoing programmed cell death immediately prior to loss of plasma membrane zzso A plasma membrane zzso signal likely activates zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso within the zzso and signals neighboring cells via hydrogen zzso zzso induction of salicylic acid zzso Response to wounding appears to involve the same zzso and direct zzso
