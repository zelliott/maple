zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is a blinding zzso disease characterized by the loss of zzso zzso cells zzso pathological zzso surface zzso and tissue recruitment of immune zzso Using the zzso regulator zzso mouse as a model for zzso syndrome zzso zzso we identified zzso T zzso as the main immune zzso driving zzso and uncovered a zzso role for zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso family enriched in zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso and zzso zzso Here, we used adoptive transfer of zzso zzso T cells to dissect the mechanism zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso T cells zzso transferred from both zzso knockout zzso and zzso zzso type 1 zzso double zzso donors zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso recipients with functional zzso but not zzso recipients lacking zzso In the zzso zzso zzso was primarily zzso to zzso zzso surrounded by zzso T zzso In the eye, zzso was expressed on local zzso zzso and zzso cells, but not on resident zzso cells or zzso immune zzso In both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was only observed in the presence of zzso resident zzso Moreover, persistent zzso of zzso signaling led to chronic zzso inflammation by retaining zzso T cells in the local zzso Following zzso zzso of zzso T cells, we observed zzso hallmarks in local zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso throughout the zzso surface zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso cells significantly correlated with reduced tear zzso while zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso predicted the development of zzso zzso zzso data in this study indicated a central role for zzso in orchestrating a functional interplay between immune cells and resident cells of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso
