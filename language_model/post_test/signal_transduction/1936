The heart is the first organ to form and function during zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso which specifically zzso bone zzso protein zzso and zzso we examined the role played by zzso during the initial zzso in chick cultured zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso medium from zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso inhibited the expression of zzso proteins (such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and so zzso was zzso in cultured stage 4 zzso zzso however, it did not inhibit the expression of smooth muscle zzso (the first zzso of zzso expressed during zzso In cultured stage 5 zzso ME, zzso did not inhibit either the formation of zzso components or the expression of zzso myosin, but it did inhibit the formation of zzso Although zzso was required to induce expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in cultured stage 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso smooth muscle zzso was expressed without the addition of zzso Interestingly, in cultured stage 6 zzso zzso zzso induced the expressions of zzso zzso and zzso but not of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso function lies upstream of the initial formation of zzso components and zzso separately in a zzso manner, and zzso at least two signaling pathways are involved in the initial cardiac zzso one is an unknown zzso responsible for the expression of smooth muscle zzso the other is zzso zzso which is involved in the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
