zzso signals located at the 3' end of zzso genes drive zzso and zzso at the same end of zzso Although these sequences are expected only at the 3' end of zzso we found that strong zzso signals are also predicted within the zzso untranslated regions zzso of many zzso zzso zzso Most of these zzso zzso signals have little influence on the processing of the zzso zzso but they are very active when placed at the 3' end of reporter zzso In investigating these unexpected zzso we discovered that both these novel zzso signals and standard zzso signals become functionally silent when they are positioned close to zzso start sites in either zzso or human zzso This indicates that the stage when the zzso signal emerges from the zzso II zzso zzso zzso complex determines whether a putative zzso signal is recognized as zzso The data suggest that this zzso which probably prevents cryptic zzso signals from causing premature zzso zzso depends on low zzso zzso of the zzso domain of Pol II and inefficient recruitment of processing zzso
