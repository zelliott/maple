zzso syndrome zzso is a human zzso disorder associated with zzso mental zzso motor zzso and zzso In most cases, AS is caused by the deletion of the maternal copy of zzso zzso which encodes the zzso zzso zzso zzso also termed zzso A mouse model of AS has been generated and these mice exhibit many of the observed neurological zzso in zzso Because of clinical and zzso similarities between AS and zzso we examined AS model mice for zzso in the zzso pathway, which has been implicated in the zzso of zzso We focused our studies on the zzso one of the major brain zzso impaired in AS zzso 

We determined the expression of zzso 1 and zzso receptors in AS mice and zzso zzso zzso zzso weeks) and studied the effects of zzso zzso on long-term zzso in zzso area zzso zzso 1 and on zzso contextual fear zzso 

We observed enhanced zzso signaling in the zzso of AS model mice and found that zzso zzso could reverse deficits in long-term zzso a cellular zzso for learning and zzso In addition, we found that an zzso inhibitor enhanced long-term contextual fear memory in AS model zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso signaling is involved in synaptic plasticity and memory zzso in AS model mice, suggesting that zzso zzso have therapeutic potential for the treatment of zzso
