zzso inflammation zzso by zzso plasma cell zzso of zzso zzso is a zzso hallmark of zzso colitis zzso however, whether its function is zzso or protective remains zzso 

To explore the contribution of zzso zzso plasma cells to UC zzso 

We isolated zzso zzso zzso cells zzso from zzso zzso of UC patients and zzso the characteristics of zzso plasma cells zzso profiles of differentiation molecules and zzso zzso We investigated the involvement of zzso complex zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso in zzso inflammation by examining the zzso production by zzso in response to zzso zzso 

zzso plasma cells that were markedly increased in number in the inflamed zzso of UC patients showed a distinct expression profile zzso zzso compared with zzso plasma cells zzso zzso In zzso zzso stimulation activated zzso zzso zzso that were increased in number in the inflamed zzso of UC patients via zzso and zzso and induced the extensive production of zzso zzso such as zzso necrosis factor zzso and zzso zzso comparable to the effect of zzso bacteria zzso zzso with zzso and zzso bacteria increased zzso and zzso production more than stimulation with the latter zzso Furthermore, zzso notably zzso the expression of zzso whereas zzso bacteria specifically induced zzso 

zzso these results demonstrate a novel aspect of UC zzso in which unique zzso plasma cells zzso the inflamed zzso via zzso and critically influence UC zzso by zzso zzso inflammation through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso
