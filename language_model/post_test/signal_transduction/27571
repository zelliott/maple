A major goal of gene therapy is to improve target specificity by delivering zzso through alternative cellular zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso delivery through basic zzso growth factor zzso receptors enhances both cellular zzso and in zzso zzso We now present studies addressing the cellular pathways and mechanisms underlying these zzso Cellular receptors for zzso are not required for zzso by zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso can antagonize zzso zzso in contrast to their obligatory role in zzso zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso zzso which are zzso on potential tumor targets, are required for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however, are not a zzso in marked contrast to their obligatory role in zzso zzso zzso By comparing zzso expression and zzso binding with zzso zzso we also demonstrate that zzso zzso enhances zzso by mechanisms other than increasing the number of targeted zzso Rather, the use of alternative targeting zzso supports the conclusion that specific zzso interactions and zzso events serve to enhance zzso zzso Together, these studies highlight the unique delivery and zzso pathways used by zzso zzso and help define the basis for their enhanced in zzso zzso
