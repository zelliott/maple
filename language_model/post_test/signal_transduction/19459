zzso a functional zzso of tomato zzso zzso regulates both zzso resistance and zzso resistance in zzso To investigate the molecular function of zzso in defense responses, we searched for components interacting with zzso using a zzso zzso zzso One of the interacting proteins is a zzso zzso that directly zzso zzso zzso This protein belongs to the zzso zzso family and is highly similar to zzso which is induced in response to a wide range of zzso oxygen species zzso stimuli in zzso Thus, it was designated zzso zzso was zzso zzso in response to zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso transgenic lines and the zzso zzso were highly sensitive to zzso treatment, indicating that zzso and zzso are involved in zzso signaling in opposing zzso zzso is specifically expressed at infection sites where zzso are produced after zzso with a blast zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso enhanced zzso resistance to the blast zzso indicating that zzso positively regulates disease zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and a point zzso of zzso enhanced disease zzso to a bacterial pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso of zzso by zzso is essential for zzso resistance to zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso positively regulates defense responses through the zzso of zzso causing the release from an zzso zzso of the zzso
