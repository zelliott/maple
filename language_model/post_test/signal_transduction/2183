zzso characterization of the mechanisms of skeletal muscle fatigue is still an area of active zzso One emerging theory concerns a role for the zzso oxygen species zzso produced primarily as a consequence of elevated rates of zzso zzso It has been theorized that the long-lasting effects of zzso fatigue zzso can be attributed to disruption of some stage of the zzso contraction zzso zzso zzso Recent evidence suggests that zzso likely zzso one or more proteins directly associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso release zzso Given the potential of zzso to damage zzso proteins during subsequent bouts of muscle zzso the capacity of zzso zzso pathways may be zzso by the synthesis of zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso collectively function to maintain cellular protein zzso during stressful zzso zzso The goal of this article is to illustrate how recent findings suggest a dual role of zzso generated during muscle zzso
