zzso To examine the correlation between zzso response and zzso release induced by hypoxic zzso we studied carotid bodies excised from zzso zzso zzso The carotid bodies with their carotid zzso nerves were zzso in zzso with modified zzso solution zzso zzso at zzso degrees zzso zzso with 20 or zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso channel was monitored zzso The frequency of zzso zzso zzso was recorded from the whole carotid zzso zzso zzso zzso consisting of zzso measured by high-speed zzso through zzso carbon zzso placed on the carotid body zzso zzso stimulation was induced by zzso injections of zzso by zzso with zzso zzso saline zzso zzso to zzso zzso or by flow zzso zzso Low doses of zzso increased zzso but had no measurable effect on CA zzso while larger doses produced fast increases in zzso preceding delayed and prolonged increases in CA zzso zzso injections of zzso still increasing zzso gave reduced CA zzso zzso Switching to hypoxic zzso for zzso zzso produced large and fast zzso increases, but delayed and prolonged zzso of CA zzso zzso Administration of three to four zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso CA concentration by up to 35 zzso initially decreased zzso after which hypoxic stimulation resulted in enhanced and faster CA zzso without changing the speed and intensity of zzso zzso zzso zzso interruptions induced fast increases in zzso and delayed increases in CA zzso zzso flow interruptions produced similar increases in zzso but progressively attenuated CA zzso zzso Our results suggest that CA zzso is not essential for zzso zzso zzso in the cat carotid zzso They also suggest the presence of two pools of zzso zzso in the carotid body, one of slow turnover and release, and another of recently incorporated zzso and fast release, both pools being rapidly depleted by repeated stimulation of the carotid zzso
