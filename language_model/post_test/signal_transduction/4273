zzso Clarke's column zzso of the zzso zzso tract zzso were recorded zzso in zzso cats during weak sustained zzso of zzso zzso zzso produced by direct electrical stimulation of the zzso zzso Of 145 zzso zzso 77 zzso were contraction sensitive suggesting that information about weak contraction of a limited number of muscles is widely distributed among zzso zzso Four types of effects were observed in individual zzso during zzso zzso zzso In the first group of 11 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the effect was zzso zzso throughout the duration of zzso These responses were ascribed to actions of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso In a second group of 15 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso quickly declining zzso zzso were recorded during sustained zzso zzso By zzso with previous observations of zzso effects in zzso the decline of zzso might be explained by zzso zzso zzso of group I zzso in Clarke's zzso zzso zzso zzso resembling those previously observed in zzso and zzso zzso were recorded in zzso of zzso zzso zzso This appears in keeping with the fact that zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso project zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso might therefore cause parallel reductions of zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso In a final group of 13 zzso mixed zzso and zzso effects were observed during zzso zzso Such zzso zzso might monitor the zzso of zzso zzso by integration of information about input to and output from these zzso zzso The zzso patterns of zzso responses to zzso zzso suggest complex processing of information on ankle zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso of contraction onset is observed in many zzso zzso while others carry messages about duration and strength of zzso
