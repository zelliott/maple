Sonic zzso is involved in eye field separation along the zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso continues to be important in defining aspects of the zzso axis as the zzso zzso and zzso cup zzso We show that two other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso related to the mouse Indian zzso and Desert zzso respectively, are strongly expressed in the central retinal zzso zzso but excluded from the peripheral zzso zzso surrounding the zzso marginal zzso By contrast, downstream components of the zzso zzso pathway, zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in this narrow peripheral zzso We show that this zone contains cells that are in the zzso zzso This equivalent region in the adult zzso eye, the pigmented zzso zzso has been identified as a zone in which retinal stem cells zzso These data, combined with double zzso and the use of other retinal zzso zzso zzso show that the retinal zzso zzso of zzso zzso has a zzso distinct peripheral to central zzso In addition, zzso zzso and zzso are also expressed in the neural zzso in the most peripheral region of the zzso marginal zone, where retinal stem cells are found in zzso suggesting that they are good markers for retinal stem zzso To test the role of the zzso zzso at different stages of zzso we activated the zzso by injecting a zzso form of zzso or blocking it by treating zzso with zzso zzso injected or treated at early stages display clear zzso defects in the zzso Interestingly, the main zzso of zzso treated with zzso at late stages is a severe zzso in zzso zzso This study thus provides new insights into the role of zzso zzso in the formation of the zzso axis of the eye and the differentiation of retinal zzso zzso
