Adult zzso stem cells zzso are an attractive cell source for cartilage tissue zzso In zzso zzso of zzso has been explored as a means to enhance zzso zzso cartilage zzso However, there remain challenges to control and prevent the premature progression of zzso zzso to the zzso This study investigated the zzso effect of transforming growth factor zzso and zzso signaling zzso during zzso zzso differentiation and evaluated the influence of these zzso conditions to subsequent zzso development of the zzso zzso were differentiated in zzso medium that contained either zzso alone, zzso with transient zzso zzso or zzso with continuous zzso zzso After in zzso zzso the zzso were transplanted into zzso zzso Both zzso protocols resulted in the enhancement of zzso differentiation of zzso Compared with zzso zzso transient zzso of zzso with zzso zzso resulted in heightened zzso and formed highly ossified zzso with zzso zzso tissue in zzso The continuous zzso of the 2 signaling zzso however, resulted in zzso of progression to zzso marked by the suppression of type X zzso zzso and alkaline zzso zzso and did not result in ossified tissue in zzso zzso of the continuous zzso samples zzso significantly more zzso zzso protein zzso and expressed zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso with zzso can yield cartilage of different zzso represents a potential zzso zzso protocol before clinical zzso and has potential applications for the engineering of cartilage zzso
