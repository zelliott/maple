The zzso gene product, zzso displays a potent transforming effect when zzso in zzso zzso zzso In addition, it possesses zzso high levels of zzso zzso activity in the absence of zzso added zzso In this study, we demonstrate that its zzso domain exerts an enhancing effect on zzso zzso and transforming zzso A premature termination zzso of the zzso zzso lacking the entire zzso domain zzso delta zzso showed a zzso reduction in transforming ability and a lowered in zzso zzso activity for zzso zzso When the zzso domain of zzso was zzso for its analogous region in the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso it zzso zzso properties to the zzso including transforming ability in the absence of zzso growth factor, elevated zzso zzso activity in zzso and in zzso and zzso ability to zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso bearing an zzso zzso domain zzso zzso showed reduced transforming and zzso activity with respect to the zzso zzso and was only slightly more efficient than the zzso delta zzso zzso Thus, we conclude that the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso exert different regulatory effects on zzso zzso function and biological zzso The up regulation of zzso zzso activity exerted by its zzso domain can explain, at least in part, its zzso level of zzso zzso
