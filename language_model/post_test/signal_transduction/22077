The zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso 4 has been reported in various human zzso but it has not been studied in pancreatic zzso zzso zzso or its precursor zzso pancreatic zzso zzso zzso Moreover, there is controversy as to whether zzso has a zzso role in zzso or other zzso zzso the expression and roles of zzso in pancreatic cancer were zzso zzso zzso was performed using an zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso and protein were investigated in zzso cell lines by zzso and Western zzso zzso Changes were analyzed in cell zzso zzso migration, invasion and attachment in zzso cell lines with or without the stimulation of zzso by zzso as a known specific zzso The changes in zzso levels associated with transformation and zzso as a result of zzso administration were also zzso zzso was expressed in 39 of 53 zzso cases zzso and its expression tended to be related to longer overall survival zzso Moreover, it was frequently expressed in high-grade zzso zzso zzso of 11 zzso zzso whereas it was hardly expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso of 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation of zzso cells resulted in significantly increased cell zzso to zzso and zzso zzso and decreased cell migration zzso The results of zzso array analysis indicated that this was a result of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, cell zzso or proliferation in zzso cells was not zzso We showed that zzso expression is markedly increased in high-grade zzso and zzso compared with that in normal and zzso zzso and that zzso stimulation by zzso of zzso cells contributes to tumor suppression by increasing cell zzso to zzso zzso
