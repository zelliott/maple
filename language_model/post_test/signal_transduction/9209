zzso zzso zzso zzso expression occurs on both T cells and B cells in human lupus patients, which is suggested to enhance B cell zzso signaling and play a role in disease zzso zzso mice expressing zzso by their B cells zzso have an expanded zzso B cell pool and produce zzso zzso zzso deficient zzso mice also produce zzso and importantly, their B cells are zzso following zzso stimulation ex zzso Combining these 2 genetic zzso in zzso mice was thereby predicted to intensify zzso signaling and zzso disease due to zzso B cell expansion and/or zzso 

zzso mice were assessed for their zzso immune responses and for changes in their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice were not zzso but instead generated minimal zzso responses against both self and foreign zzso This paucity in zzso zzso switching occurred despite an expanded zzso B cell pool, higher serum zzso levels, and zzso ex zzso B cell zzso zzso zzso responses in zzso mice were explained by a zzso expansion of functional, mature zzso regulatory zzso B cells zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in wild type mice, zzso and an zzso expansion of B10 cells combined with their ex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in wild type mice, zzso that represented zzso of all zzso B zzso 

These results demonstrate for the first time that the zzso B10 B cell subset has the capacity to suppress zzso zzso immune responses against both foreign and self zzso zzso therapeutic agents that drive regulatory B10 cell expansion in zzso may inhibit zzso zzso zzso production in zzso
