zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso B zzso together constitute a regulatory system that controls cell function via the generation of zzso zzso zzso In this report we have examined the role of zzso signaling in the regulation of zzso and zzso activity in the zzso rat zzso zzso cell zzso As had been observed earlier with zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso induced a significant reduction in zzso zzso generation that was first apparent after 6 h of zzso The zzso effect of zzso on zzso was dose dependent, with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with either of two protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso and zzso failed to curtail the zzso reduction in zzso activity, suggesting that the zzso zzso leading to zzso of zzso is zzso zzso Whereas either a zzso or a zzso treatment with the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to alter zzso levels of zzso zzso a zzso exposure to the calcium zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso to about one-third of zzso zzso of zzso cells with the zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso completely zzso the zzso reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso showed no effect of zzso on zzso transcript at 3 and 6 zzso but indicated a zzso reduction in transcript by zzso at 24 zzso In contrast, real-time zzso indicated a zzso increase in zzso transcript at 3 zzso reaching zzso above control at 6 h in cells treated with zzso In addition, zzso zzso of zzso cells with a specific zzso for zzso showed the presence of zzso zzso that was zzso by incubation with either zzso or zzso These results suggested that zzso signaling regulates the zzso zzso system in rat zzso cells by increasing zzso zzso and reducing zzso zzso This latter action of zzso appears to be both zzso independent and calcium dependent, and provides support for a dominant role for calcium in the regulation of zzso in the rat zzso
