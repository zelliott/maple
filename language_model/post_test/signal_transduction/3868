Mechanical stresses are important environmental cues for both normal cellular functions and zzso changes in conditions such as cardiac zzso and zzso There is increasing evidence that zzso processes in response to mechanical stresses share many common features with processes in cell zzso such as an increase in zzso zzso of proteins in the focal zzso zzso Recent findings suggest that zzso may function as zzso in zzso
