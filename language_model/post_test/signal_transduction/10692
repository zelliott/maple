zzso oxide zzso is extremely toxic to zzso zzso but its molecular targets are zzso Here, we identify a zzso protein sensor zzso that displays zzso affinity for zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain reveals a previously zzso fold and a zzso placed zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the domain architecture of a zzso zzso cloned from zzso zzso indicates that NO signaling through zzso zzso zzso arose before the origin of zzso zzso Our findings have broad implications for understanding bacterial responses to zzso as well as for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso
