In zzso plants, symbiotic nitrogen zzso fixation performances and N environmental conditions are linked because zzso zzso development and functioning are greatly influenced by the amount of available N zzso We demonstrate here that N supply also controls, zzso the competence of zzso plants to perform the zzso zzso zzso zzso plants zzso for 10 d in zzso conditions, and then transferred to low N before the zzso zzso zzso had reduced zzso This zzso was maintained for at least 6 d and a complete zzso of the symbiotic competence was observed only after 9 zzso The zzso analysis of the change of the symbiotic zzso was zzso by zzso The zzso expressed genes identified are mostly involved in zzso zzso However, the zzso response also includes genes belonging to other functional categories such as zzso stress response and zzso zzso Some of these genes show a molecular identity and a regulation profile, that suggest a role as possible molecular links between the zzso plant response and the zzso zzso zzso
