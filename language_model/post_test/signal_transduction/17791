zzso acid zzso zzso growth and zzso differentiation of zzso mouse melanoma zzso These effects are accompanied by a large increase in zzso zzso and protein levels and surprisingly an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To further investigate the zzso zzso activity we established clones of zzso cells zzso expressing an zzso reporter zzso Treatment of these clones with zzso zzso increased zzso activity which peaked at 2-4 h and returned to baseline level by 24 zzso In contrast, zzso treatment resulted in a slow increase in zzso activity that reached a maximum level at 48 h and was maintained for the duration of the zzso We tested the importance of the zzso zzso activity by establishing clones which zzso express a dominant negative zzso gene zzso and have greatly diminished zzso zzso Growth rates of zzso zzso expressing cells were similar to zzso zzso and clones not expressing zzso However, clones expressing the zzso zzso had a markedly decreased sensitivity to zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Treatment of zzso zzso cells for 48 h with zzso increased zzso production by two to zzso but this effect was completely lost in the zzso zzso The ability of zzso to induce zzso and zzso expression was retained in zzso zzso suggesting that zzso was not interfering with zzso zzso zzso zzso We tested whether the zzso zzso activity might be zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, which was not additive to that induced by zzso This finding raises the possibility that this zzso zzso may be a target of zzso zzso Our observations suggest that zzso zzso activity induced by zzso likely plays an important role in the biological changes zzso by this zzso in zzso melanoma zzso
