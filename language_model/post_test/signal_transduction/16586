zzso zzso receptors zzso constitute a large family of cell surface zzso Their primary function is to transmit zzso stimuli to zzso zzso It is estimated that the human zzso contains more than 1000 genes that code for proteins of the zzso zzso These receptors also comprise the most important class of therapeutic drug zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso zzso was initially envisioned as involving zzso to the zzso zzso zzso However, recent developments in the field suggest that such a simplistic model cannot be sustained any zzso The emerging view is that a wide range of accessory proteins are involved in the regulation of every aspect of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins are implicated in the regulation of several aspects of zzso biology, including zzso targeting to the respective sites of action, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In some cases zzso zzso activity zzso zzso they may contribute to the zzso structure and form a part of the zzso zzso zzso These findings have contributed to new concepts of cellular organization in which modular zzso interactions provide a network through which zzso pathways are assembled and zzso
