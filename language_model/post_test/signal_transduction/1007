Class switch zzso zzso is a zzso process that occurs in peripheral zzso zzso and is thought of as an important factor constructing the memory zzso We have recently shown that zzso normally occurs during bone zzso zzso development, and these zzso B cells are zzso selected by zzso zzso This novel zzso of B cell development may generate a primary repertoire driven by zzso zzso the nature of which is yet zzso To study this zzso repertoire we used mice lacking zzso tail zzso ( zzso zzso where B cell development is limited by their ability to undergo zzso We already showed that lack of zzso signaling zzso development of a significant population of zzso B cells and production of high zzso of zzso serum zzso in zzso zzso mice deficient in zzso ( zzso zzso thereby providing a mouse model allowing the assessment of zzso zzso Using a tissue array and zzso display zzso library we report here that zzso repertoire in zzso zzso mice is zzso bearing zzso zzso This is supported by analysis of the zzso zzso in peripheral B cells from zzso zzso mice, which revealed a zzso restricted zzso In contrast, zzso zzso B cells that are grown in zzso zzso cultures zzso a wide zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso is an important regulator in the generation and selection of an zzso zzso repertoire in zzso
