The molecular basis for the adverse biological effects of zzso zzso zzso a pervasive environmental zzso is largely zzso zzso is a zzso for the zzso aromatic hydrocarbon zzso zzso which mediates the zzso induction of the zzso zzso genes in the zzso family of zzso zzso Previous studies have suggested that the zzso may carry out important functions in the cell in addition to zzso zzso We present gene expression profiles of smooth muscle cells from wild type and zzso mice that show significant changes in the zzso levels of the transforming growth zzso zzso gene and genes involved in the zzso and processing of zzso The zzso expression profiles support a hypothesis that in the wild type, the zzso zzso zzso gene expression and affects the gene expression of several zzso and processing zzso We also observed that zzso levels increased for zzso zzso and zzso genes in zzso smooth muscle cells exposed to zzso These data are consistent with a hypothesis that zzso stimulates the zzso signaling zzso in the absence of the zzso to activate the zzso zzso The above results provide a possible explanation for some of the multiple biological effects of zzso and the zzso role played by the zzso in the absence of environmental zzso
