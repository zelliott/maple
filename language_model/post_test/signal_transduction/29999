zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso signaling pathways have been implicated in the control of skeletal zzso However, although zzso is recognized as a potent zzso of zzso zzso the role of zzso remains zzso Here, we show that zzso is activated only in zzso zzso whereas zzso activity is present both in proliferation and differentiation zzso zzso zzso was found to be dependent on zzso activity during zzso being zzso an zzso of zzso thus providing a novel mechanism for the zzso effect of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells induced the activity of zzso in a dual way: first, by reducing zzso levels and inducing zzso binding activity and, second, by zzso the zzso activity of zzso Finally, we show that zzso zzso expression is induced in zzso zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso reduced, whereas its zzso increased, the extent of zzso zzso moreover, addition of zzso was able to rescue significantly the negative effect of zzso zzso on this zzso This study provides the first evidence of a zzso between zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways during zzso with zzso being one of the zzso of this zzso zzso
