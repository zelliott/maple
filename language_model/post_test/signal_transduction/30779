The zzso protein zzso I zzso signaling zzso plays an important role in spinal zzso zzso However, downstream targets of zzso in this context have not been identified to zzso Using a zzso zzso screen, we isolated zzso protein 2 zzso as a novel zzso zzso in the spinal zzso zzso is expressed in zzso I and II of the mouse spinal zzso and is zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, the majority of zzso zzso zzso root zzso zzso zzso express zzso and zzso zzso is zzso in a zzso manner, and its expression increases in the spinal zzso and in zzso after noxious stimulation of a zzso To zzso the functional role of zzso in zzso we analyzed mice with a targeted deletion of zzso zzso zzso mice demonstrate normal behavioral responses to acute zzso and after zzso injury of the zzso zzso but increased zzso behavior in models of inflammatory zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso increases the zzso behavior in zzso but not in zzso mice, indicating that the presence of zzso is important for zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso is a new downstream zzso of zzso spinal zzso processing and point to an zzso role of zzso in the generation of inflammatory zzso
