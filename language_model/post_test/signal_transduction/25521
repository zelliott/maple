zzso zzso zzso stem cells zzso are maintained by zzso signaling and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Upon division, zzso signaling is zzso and Nos is zzso in one daughter cell, causing it to switch to a zzso zzso zzso However, downstream zzso of zzso remain unknown, and how zzso lose their responsiveness to zzso is zzso Here, we identify Brain zzso zzso as a potent differentiation factor and target of zzso zzso zzso is excluded from zzso by zzso but functions with zzso in zzso to zzso repress distinct targets, including the Mad and zzso zzso zzso of both targets simultaneously lowers cellular responsiveness to zzso zzso forcing the cell to become zzso to the zzso zzso zzso modeling zzso zzso of cell fate in the zzso system, revealing how zzso of zzso number can arise from zzso zzso zzso zzso regulation to zzso zzso
