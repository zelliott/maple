Ras proteins control a variety of critical cellular zzso and zzso zzso in zzso genes (and other members of signaling networks regulated by zzso are common in human zzso Ras proteins are zzso zzso zzso proteins that cycle between active zzso and inactive zzso zzso zzso bound zzso zzso Ras zzso typically alter zzso acids zzso zzso or zzso These zzso Ras proteins display impaired zzso activity and are resistant to zzso zzso proteins zzso We and others recently discovered novel zzso zzso zzso in individuals diagnosed with Noonan or zzso zzso syndrome, two clinically overlapping disorders characterized by short zzso distinct facial anomalies, heart zzso and other zzso zzso We found that the zzso zzso proteins zzso by zzso zzso have less pronounced zzso defects than known Ras zzso which likely explains why these zzso are tolerated in the zzso Together with the recent findings of zzso in other members of the Ras signaling cascade in zzso syndrome and in Costello syndrome, another clinically related disorder, it is now clear that zzso features are common zzso consequences of systemic deregulation of the Ras zzso The discovery of zzso zzso in this group of related genetic disorders underscores the pivotal role of the degree and duration of Ras zzso in cell fate decisions during embryonic development and zzso
