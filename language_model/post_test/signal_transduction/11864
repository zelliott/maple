Soy peptides consumption has been associated with beneficial effects in type 2 diabetes zzso However, the zzso zzso responsible for these effects, and their mechanisms of action, have not been identified zzso In this study, we have isolated soybean peptides by zzso with an zzso membrane zzso at 50 zzso zzso and tested them for their capacity to improve zzso zzso in zzso muscle zzso We observed that these zzso were able to significantly enhance zzso zzso in the presence of zzso The reported zzso would be due to the low molecular weight peptides zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we observed that an enhancement of zzso zzso was correlated to the zzso of the zzso zzso well known for its capacity to increase zzso zzso in muscle zzso To our knowledge, this is the first time that zzso peptides with zzso zzso activity have been isolated from a complex soy zzso and that the implication of zzso in it is zzso
