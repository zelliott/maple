Earlier studies have revealed beneficial effects of zzso therapy in animals with zzso heart failure zzso due to zzso zzso Because heart failure is also associated with attenuated response to zzso we examined the effects of zzso zzso zzso (a zzso zzso therapy on the zzso zzso signal zzso in the failing zzso 

Heart failure in rats was induced by zzso the coronary artery and 3 weeks later the animals were treated with or without 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso for 5 zzso The animals were assessed for their left zzso function and zzso responses to zzso Crude zzso were isolated from the remote, zzso zzso left zzso and examined for changes in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Animals with heart failure exhibited depressions in zzso function, positive zzso response to zzso zzso zzso density and zzso zzso zzso these changes were also attenuated by zzso zzso The stimulation of zzso activities with zzso zzso zzso zzso and sodium zzso was decreased in the failing hearts and these changes were also prevented by zzso zzso 

The results indicate that zzso therapy with zzso not only zzso the defects in heart function but also prevents changes in the zzso signal zzso in zzso due to zzso zzso
