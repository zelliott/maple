We hypothesized that zzso bypass zzso a selective zzso of the coronary zzso zzso cell signal zzso which could be explained by a state of depletion and/or decreased activity of zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to assess the effects of zzso bypass and zzso on the zzso function of zzso coronary arteries in a zzso model of zzso zzso 

zzso underwent 90 zzso of zzso bypass alone zzso or in association with a brief zzso arrest with (N zzso 6) or without (N zzso 5) in zzso zzso administration, followed by a zzso period following weaning from zzso bypass and were compared to a control group (N zzso zzso zzso relaxations of zzso coronary artery rings were studied using standard organ chamber experiments in the presence or absence of in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso bypass caused a statistically significant reduction of zzso relaxations to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso coronary zzso In zzso and in zzso zzso supplementation improved zzso relaxations to zzso and zzso which were left unchanged by zzso zzso zzso bypass was associated with a decrease in zzso oxide availability zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso stress zzso zzso zzso which were both restored by in zzso zzso administration zzso zzso zzso 

Treatment with zzso improves the zzso dysfunction of zzso zzso coronary zzso restores zzso oxide availability and reduces the zzso stress associated with zzso zzso
