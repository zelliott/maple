The human zzso genes constitute the most frequently zzso zzso in human zzso and the critical role of zzso Ras protein function in zzso is well zzso zzso considerable effort has been devoted to the development of zzso zzso for cancer zzso An important facet of zzso targeted cancer drug discovery is the validation of a zzso mechanism of action, as well as the identification of potential zzso zzso This chapter describes the use of the zzso zzso zzso zzso for simple, inexpensive zzso analysis of candidate zzso targeted zzso of zzso activated zzso with a focus on the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso This protein zzso cascade is well zzso from worms to humans and is well established as a critical player in the signaling events leading to zzso formation in zzso zzso Excess activity results in the development of a zzso zzso zzso whose zzso by test compounds can be characterized genetically as to the specific step of the zzso that is zzso In addition, zzso activities can also be identified and characterized further using different strains of zzso zzso This chapter presents zzso analyses using the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso to block the zzso zzso caused by the zzso activated Ras zzso zzso zzso zzso It also provides a detailed description of protocols and zzso that will enable researchers to analyze zzso and zzso effects of other candidate zzso zzso using this zzso
