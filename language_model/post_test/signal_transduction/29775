The expression of zzso genes associated with zzso is controlled by several zzso zzso factors, including zzso and zzso zzso growth zzso zzso has been shown to inhibit zzso yet the molecular mechanisms underlying such zzso are not zzso In the present study, zzso was shown to inhibit zzso and zzso expression and zzso formation in zzso zzso cultured in differentiation medium in a cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso an zzso for zzso zzso restored the capacity of these cells to differentiate in the presence of zzso or when cultured in growth medium at low zzso conditions that hinder muscle zzso Moreover, zzso a zzso agent, enhanced the zzso of zzso exerted by zzso an effect that could be restored by zzso agent zzso both of which have been shown to affect zzso interaction and regulate zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso zzso at least in part, via zzso pathway, and provide evidence that zzso pharmacological agents zzso and zzso can be used as a means to zzso zzso without affecting cell zzso
