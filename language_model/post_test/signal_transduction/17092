The fetal and zzso environments are important zzso of disease risk in adult zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether maternal green tea extract zzso intake during zzso affects the expression and activity of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in the zzso of male offspring of zzso zzso during zzso 

zzso zzso rats were fed control zzso or zzso diets zzso during zzso Following delivery, zzso received a control or zzso control diet during zzso as zzso C on control diet zzso LP on control diet zzso LP on zzso zzso control diet zzso or LP on zzso zzso control diet zzso Some of the male zzso from each dam were sacrificed at week 3, and the remaining male zzso were fed a standard diet and sacrificed at week zzso Blood chemistry and expression levels of zzso zzso target of zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso of the male offspring were zzso 

The level of zzso zzso in the zzso group at week 3 was higher than that in the zzso zzso At week 30, the protein levels of total and zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso groups were lower than those in the zzso zzso The protein levels of zzso and zzso at week 30 in the zzso and zzso groups were lower than those in the zzso zzso 

zzso intake during zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression in the zzso of the adult male offspring of zzso fed a zzso diet and may induce long-term zzso in the expressions of these proteins in the zzso
