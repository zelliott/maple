Majority of cancer cells zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso resistance to zzso zzso allowing zzso to escape from host immune zzso We addressed the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of zzso zzso expression in response to zzso zzso Using promoter zzso in zzso zzso the region between 202 and 320 zzso from the zzso start site is responsible for zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiment using zzso revealed that zzso regulatory zzso zzso is primarily responsible for the zzso zzso expression as well as for the zzso zzso zzso in a human lung cancer cell line zzso Additionally, zzso a zzso activated zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso greatly abolished the responsiveness of zzso cells to zzso by reducing the zzso zzso Our findings support a critical role of zzso in the regulation of zzso and zzso expression of zzso in cancer zzso
