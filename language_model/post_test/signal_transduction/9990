zzso signaling is used to specify cell types during animal zzso A high level specifies one cell type, whereas a low level specifies the alternate zzso The zzso of zzso signaling is the zzso zzso zzso Upon its release from the plasma membrane in response to Delta binding the zzso zzso domain, the zzso zzso domain combines with the zzso factor zzso of zzso and promotes the expression of target zzso Using a panel of zzso made against different zzso and zzso regions of zzso we show that cell types and zzso with low levels of zzso signaling are enriched for zzso molecules detected only by the zzso domain zzso This enrichment often follows enrichment for zzso molecules detected only by zzso made against the zzso of zzso binding zzso zzso molecules lacking most of the zzso domain or containing only the zzso of zzso binding region are produced during zzso Such molecules are known to suppress zzso zzso possibly by taking away Delta or zzso of zzso from the full-length zzso Thus, it is possible that zzso zzso molecules are produced in the normal course of tissue differentiation in zzso as part of an zzso zzso
