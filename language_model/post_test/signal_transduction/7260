zzso zzso and zzso induce cellular zzso however, optimal zzso of zzso zzso T cells requires direct inflammatory signaling by signal 3 zzso such as zzso or type I zzso Although in zzso studies suggest that zzso I zzso may enhance T cell survival or early zzso the mechanisms underlying optimal zzso of zzso T cells in zzso are zzso In particular, it is unclear if disparate signal 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso by the same mechanism and how these inflammatory zzso which are zzso produced early after infection, affect T cell zzso many days later at the peak of the immune zzso Here, we show that transient exposure of zzso T cells to zzso or type I zzso does not promote survival or zzso an early zzso advantage in zzso but rather sustains surface expression of zzso the zzso zzso zzso This zzso division of zzso T cells in response to zzso zzso through zzso of the zzso zzso and expression of zzso a positive regulator of cell cycle progression zzso Thus, signal 3 zzso use a common zzso to zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso through a temporally orchestrated sequence of zzso signals that sustain division rather than zzso
