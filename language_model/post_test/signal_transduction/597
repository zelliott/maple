zzso is a member of the zzso family of small zzso that not only regulates signaling pathways involved in cell zzso and migration but also regulates gene zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso zzso is regulated by zzso zzso zzso of active zzso zzso into zzso zzso cells led to increased expression of a zzso zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by the zzso inhibitor zzso decreased reporter zzso Moreover, zzso lost its typical zzso to nuclear dots upon zzso of zzso and became predominantly soluble in a zzso cell zzso zzso signaling also regulated the expression of zzso zzso zzso including the zzso precursor zzso and the cell zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, these effects were not zzso by the alternative zzso zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso zzso does not involve formation of a stable zzso complex and is independent of zzso zzso oxygen species production or zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso mediates zzso downstream of zzso and can directly zzso zzso Together, these data provide substantial evidence that zzso signaling zzso the zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells and reveal a novel zzso that links zzso signaling to the regulation of gene zzso
