The complete mechanism of labor induction in zzso zzso remains zzso Although important roles for the fetus and zzso in triggering labor have been proposed, no gene has been shown to be required in the zzso for labor zzso Here we show that zzso an zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso center zzso family, is essential in the zzso for labor in zzso zzso was specifically expressed in the zzso layer, a zzso region of the zzso and zzso disruption caused zzso overgrowth of the zzso Due to preferential zzso of the zzso derived X zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited a similar zzso to that in zzso zzso when the zzso zzso was zzso zzso However, the zzso was weaker than in zzso zzso due to leaky zzso expression from the zzso X zzso Crossing of zzso females to zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso transfer of zzso fetuses to zzso zzso revealed that pregnant mice exhibit a severe zzso in delivery when all zzso are zzso In addition, zzso was not expressed in female zzso zzso such as the zzso and zzso as well as the fetal zzso and zzso zzso in pregnant zzso zzso and zzso levels in the maternal circulation and zzso which control the timing of labor, were unaffected upon zzso zzso We thus provide evidence for a novel zzso zzso signal that depends on the X zzso and possibly arises from the zzso
