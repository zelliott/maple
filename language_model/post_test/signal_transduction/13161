The three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are critical regulators of zzso zzso by controlling the balance between the burning and storage of long chain fatty zzso Whereas zzso and zzso have been studied zzso the function of zzso remains the most zzso zzso in zzso experiments, zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso activity of zzso and zzso This zzso is zzso in part, by binding of zzso to a zzso zzso response element and the association of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and class I zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso target gene expression in zzso cells, whereas a zzso zzso that does not interact with the zzso zzso loses its ability to repress the induction of zzso target zzso Similarly, stable expression of zzso in zzso cells leads to zzso of zzso target gene expression and zzso zzso Given the widespread expression of zzso and the restricted pattern for zzso and zzso these results suggest a role for zzso as a gateway zzso whose relative levels of expression can be used to zzso zzso and zzso zzso
