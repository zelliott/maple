The early response genes zzso the zzso and zzso B zzso factors are induced by environmental stress and thought to zzso responses to injury processes through the induction of target zzso Exposure to heat and zzso radiation zzso has been shown to affect zzso machinery involved in zzso and zzso B zzso Furthermore, regulation of the zzso pathways leading to the zzso of these zzso factors has been linked to changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso The hypothesis is proposed that exposure to zzso stress and/or zzso might alter zzso processes zzso upon cellular zzso state and thereby modify the activity of zzso zzso factors such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso shift zzso zzso demonstrated that heat zzso zzso zzso activity but inhibited zzso zzso of zzso zzso A time course showed that zzso of the zzso complex occurs between 4 and 5 h following zzso stress, and zzso of zzso zzso B zzso also occurs during this time zzso Using a zzso fluorescent probe zzso zzso zzso a shift to zzso less zzso dye zzso was observed in zzso cells zzso h zzso shock zzso degrees C, 15 zzso relative to cells held at 37 degrees zzso This was followed by a shift to greater dye zzso between 4 and 12 h after treatment (about zzso that returned to control levels by 24 h zzso These results show changes in zzso activity closely paralleled apparent zzso changes in the zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results provide zzso evidence for disruption of zzso zzso zzso pathways by heat shock and support the hypothesis that this mechanism might play a role in zzso zzso in radiation zzso
