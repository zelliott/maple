zzso zzso in the mouse gut zzso occurs until the closure of the zzso duct zzso 9 zzso zzso producing anterior neural tube defects zzso The anterior part of the primitive zzso designated as the primary signaling center for anterior zzso expresses several zzso factors of importance for head zzso Here, we studied the expression levels of some of these zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and cell death induced after single cadmium administration to zzso on days 7, 8 and 9 zzso Stage specific zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and an zzso of zzso were zzso No effect was seen in zzso expression zzso Cell death was increased in the zzso of the zzso neural zzso and in areas where neural crest cells zzso but not in the gut zzso It is proposed that zzso zzso is due to interference with zzso signals from the zzso to the adjacent zzso
