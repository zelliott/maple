To investigate the effect of zzso on the migration of zzso breast cancer cell line zzso zzso 

zzso was used in zzso of 0 zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso 10 zzso and 20 zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso were analyzed by Western zzso The capability of migration was measured by scratch test and zzso chamber zzso zzso zzso skeleton ) zzso and polarization were evaluated by zzso zzso 

Comparing with the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso effectively inhibited the zzso of zzso and its downstream key zzso and the effect displayed an obvious zzso zzso At 24 hours after wound zzso the cell migration distance of each group with 0, zzso 1, 10, 20 zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At zzso hours after zzso chamber zzso the cell count of each group with 0, zzso 1, 10, 20 zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso could significantly prolong the zzso time and decrease the zzso cell count zzso zzso zzso and significantly inhibit the zzso formation, cell skeleton zzso and changes of the zzso zzso 

zzso can reduce the migration capacity of zzso breast cancer cells through zzso zzso of zzso pathway, suppressing the cell skeleton zzso zzso and changes of its zzso
