To identify expression of zzso signaling proteins and its zzso in human zzso cells which were obtained by zzso aspiration and to compare the differences of this protein expression between the normal and poor zzso zzso 

47 patients who applied to the assisted zzso treatments with various zzso problems were included to the zzso Controlled zzso zzso was performed by using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels were measured by using zzso zzso zzso method for each zzso After zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso cells obtained from the zzso were cultured for zzso and zzso were performed for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso score zzso were applied to all of the zzso The association between zzso and its zzso protein expressions and the zzso quality and zzso rates were zzso 

zzso differences were observed between the mean values of age, zzso and zzso in the 2 groups, respectively zzso However, the mean female zzso duration and total zzso dose did not differ significantly between normal and poor zzso zzso All the patients zzso cells expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso There was a significant difference zzso only for zzso between the 2 groups and a positive correlation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso expressions were zzso Furthermore, no correlations were observed between the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mature zzso number; zzso rates, and zzso quality percentage in both of the zzso 

zzso zzso proteins can be an indicator for understanding the zzso response in zzso zzso
