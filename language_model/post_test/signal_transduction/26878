zzso fusion protein activates zzso zzso resulting in the proliferation of leukemia cells, especially chronic zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso zzso effectively targets zzso zzso zzso but development of resistance to IM occurs with varying zzso 

zzso of the common regulatory zzso upstream of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso cells is important for developing novel zzso against zzso 

This study demonstrated that IM zzso inhibited the viability and zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso cells expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso level of major zzso signaling zzso including sonic zzso zzso patched zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso zzso into nucleus was evident in these two cell lines, suggesting that both zzso and zzso cells possess activated and major components of the zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso by interference zzso was accompanied by zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso suppression of zzso expression was restored by the zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso cells not only increased zzso and zzso zzso but also zzso zzso zzso zzso a known zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso and inhibited the viability of zzso zzso 

zzso signaling may regulate zzso expression in human chronic zzso leukemia zzso Novel compounds zzso both zzso signaling and zzso zzso such as zzso may have potential to be effective agents against zzso independent of IM zzso
