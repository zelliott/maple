zzso zzso is an zzso agent that specifically targets zzso and arrests cells at the zzso phase of the cell zzso In addition to zzso arrest, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso has been demonstrated to be involved in the process leading to zzso In an attempt to explore what genes are zzso regulated by the activated zzso signaling zzso upon zzso treatment, we used zzso zzso to zzso the changes of gene expression in human zzso cancer cells that were treated with zzso and/or the zzso inhibitor zzso Among 20 genes that were specifically regulated by the zzso zzso pathway, zzso zzso was shown to elicit function through the zzso signaling zzso in an zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso we identified that zzso of eight tested zzso cancer lines zzso zzso levels of zzso which could be further zzso zzso fold by 1 zzso zzso zzso on regulatory pathways for zzso indicated that zzso when zzso cancer cells were treated with zzso at low but clinically achievable zzso zzso by 1 zzso in this zzso the zzso signaling zzso was the major zzso of zzso gene regulation and zzso at zzso high zzso zzso by 50 zzso zzso exerted zzso effects, most likely through the zzso zzso 4 signaling zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso zzso functional zzso expression in human zzso cancer cells through multiple signaling zzso
