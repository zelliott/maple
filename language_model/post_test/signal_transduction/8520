Liver X receptors zzso have previously been implicated in the regulation of inflammation and have, in general, been ascribed an zzso zzso This study was therefore undertaken to explore the zzso mechanisms of zzso in zzso and in zzso in an experimental inflammatory arthritis zzso 

Male zzso mice were zzso with type II collagen and treated from an early or established stage of arthritis with 2 different zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso or vehicle zzso The mice were monitored for zzso inflammation and cartilage degradation by scoring for clinical signs of arthritis, zzso examination of the zzso and analysis of serum zzso and zzso zzso In zzso primary human zzso and T cells were cultured in the presence of zzso or zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso were measured by multiplex zzso 

zzso to expectations, zzso zzso with the use of 2 zzso specific molecular entities led to substantial zzso of zzso inflammation and cartilage destruction in this zzso zzso arthritis zzso This was associated ex zzso with elevated zzso zzso with enhanced zzso and zzso cellular responses, and with elevated zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso in concert with zzso promoted zzso and zzso release from human zzso and similar effects were observed in a T zzso zzso model that closely zzso the pathways that drive zzso zzso zzso 

Since zzso are present in zzso arthritis zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso pathways could exacerbate the chronic inflammatory response typical of zzso
