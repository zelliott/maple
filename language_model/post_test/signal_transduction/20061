zzso signaling zzso differentiation of zzso cells in the zzso and zzso In a number of cases, the observed zzso occurred with zzso zzso in zzso cells, prior to the initiation of zzso zzso It has not been established how direct zzso of zzso in zzso precursor cells affects their subsequent cell zzso Using conditional zzso of zzso in cells expressing zzso or zzso we examined the effects of zzso in both zzso on cell fate of early zzso precursors and maturing zzso cells, zzso zzso did not zzso the differentiation of a limited number of zzso cells in either organ when activated in zzso precursor zzso In addition, in the zzso most zzso cells adopted a duct but not zzso cell zzso whereas in zzso zzso cells, zzso favored zzso and zzso cell zzso while selecting against zzso and zzso cell zzso A small fraction of zzso cells in the zzso retain plasticity to respond to zzso giving rise to zzso zzso as well as cells with no zzso pancreatic lineage markers that appear to have limited zzso features of both zzso and duct zzso These results suggest that zzso directly regulates cell fate decisions in zzso early zzso precursor zzso Some maturing zzso zzso cells in the zzso switch to the duct lineage in response to zzso indicating previously unappreciated plasticity at such a late stage of zzso zzso
