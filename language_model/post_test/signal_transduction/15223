The zzso functions of zzso acid zzso acid zzso family of proteins of zzso tuberculosis are not well zzso In this study, we demonstrate that one of the zzso zzso zzso can stimulate zzso to zzso zzso known to favor a zzso type zzso The zzso zzso was found to specifically interact with the zzso leading to an early and sustained zzso of zzso zzso which is critical for zzso zzso In zzso zzso analyses and zzso experiments indicate that zzso specifically interacts with the zzso rich repeat 11 approximately 15 domain of zzso and the site of interaction is different from that of a synthetic zzso zzso known to activate predominantly zzso zzso When zzso zzso zzso were infected with a zzso zzso tuberculosis strain lacking the zzso produced poorer levels of zzso as compared with those infected with the zzso zzso In contrast, an zzso zzso strain zzso the zzso induced higher levels of zzso in infected zzso Our data indicate that the zzso protein may trigger an zzso response by inducing zzso zzso
