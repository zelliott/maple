zzso is an important hormone in plant growth, development and responses to environmental zzso The zzso zzso is initiated by the induction of zzso zzso which is under tight regulation at both zzso and zzso levels by zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso is the zzso zzso that zzso the committing step of zzso zzso Recently, we found that zzso and zzso two zzso of the zzso zzso family, are zzso of a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso leads to the zzso of zzso proteins and the induction of zzso In this report, we demonstrate that zzso zzso protein is rapidly zzso by the zzso zzso zzso The degradation machinery targets the zzso zzso domain of zzso which is sufficient to zzso instability to green fluorescent protein and zzso zzso zzso of zzso introduces negative charges to the zzso of zzso which reduces the turnover of zzso by the degradation zzso zzso with this, other nearby zzso zzso charged zzso acid zzso are essential for zzso stability zzso zzso degradation and zzso are two important zzso modifications of zzso This research reveals an intricate interplay between these two important processes in controlling the levels of cellular zzso activity, and thus zzso zzso The zzso nature of both processes ensures a rapid response of zzso zzso which is zzso within minutes after plants are exposed to zzso
