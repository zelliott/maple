zzso zzso is a nuclear protein involved in the promotion of flowering by long days, in light input to the zzso clock, and in zzso zzso under continuous red light but not zzso light zzso Here, we report that in zzso zzso zzso different zzso of zzso have defects in the zzso and zzso responses to hourly zzso of zzso a treatment perceived by zzso A zzso This zzso is rescued by zzso of zzso The zzso response of seed zzso was also reduced in zzso Since the zzso clock zzso many light responses, we investigated whether these zzso zzso were due to zzso in the zzso system or light signaling per zzso In experiments where zzso zzso were given to zzso seeds or zzso at different times of the day, zzso showed reduced seed zzso zzso zzso and activity of a zzso reporter fused to the promoter of a zzso zzso protein zzso however, rhythmic sensitivity was normal in these zzso We conclude that while zzso does not affect the zzso responses of zzso it does affect zzso zzso responses via mechanisms that do not obviously involve its zzso zzso
