To describe a network model of a cooperative genetic landscape in zzso and to evaluate its clinical zzso 

zzso zzso profiles and clinical profiles of zzso patients with zzso zzso tumors in an initial discovery set collected between 2001 and 2004 and 456 tumors in validation sets made public between 2006 and zzso from multiple academic centers in the United States and The Cancer Genome zzso Pilot Project zzso 

Identification of genes with zzso genetic zzso correlated gene dosage and gene zzso and multiple functional zzso association between those genes and patient zzso 

zzso select for a zzso genetic zzso consistent pattern of zzso zzso involves altered regions zzso on zzso zzso 7, zzso zzso 10, zzso zzso zzso 20, and zzso zzso zzso zzso A network model shows that these territories harbor genes with putative zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the most interactive of these genes in zzso is associated with zzso patient zzso A zzso risk scoring model based on 7 landscape genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is associated with the duration of overall survival in 189 zzso samples from zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso comparing 3 survival zzso for patients with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Groups of patients with 0 to 2 zzso zzso and 5 to 7 zzso zzso zzso genes experienced zzso and zzso deaths per 100 zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso Cox zzso model P zzso zzso zzso These associations with survival are validated using gene expression data in 3 independent zzso studies, zzso 76 zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso vs zzso deaths per 100 zzso for high risk vs low zzso Cox model HR, zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and 70 zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso vs zzso deaths per 100 zzso for high risk vs low zzso HR, zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso high-grade zzso and 191 zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso vs zzso deaths per 100 zzso for high risk vs low zzso HR, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of multiple networking genes by zzso zzso aberrations in zzso zzso critical signaling pathways through zzso cooperative zzso These zzso which are likely due to zzso selection of a distinct genetic landscape during zzso are associated with patient zzso
