In cultures of the zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso effects of four zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) and zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso production of zzso oxide zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso were zzso zzso 1, 2 and 3 at zzso inhibited the production with almost the same zzso zzso 4 showed no zzso zzso zzso 1, 2 and 3 at zzso inhibited the zzso expression of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso zzso To clarify the mechanism involved, effects of compounds 1, 2 and 3 on the zzso of nuclear factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso Both the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were blocked by compounds 1, 2 and 3 at zzso Moreover, the three compounds at such zzso inhibited the zzso zzso degradation and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These findings suggest that the zzso of the zzso production of NO and zzso by the zzso derivatives is due to the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso
