Mouse zzso containing two zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling and potentially zzso lupus zzso We found that only zzso of zzso binds zzso DNA zzso while zzso forms a zzso Crystal structures of zzso revealed that zzso is bound on face opposite the site used in zzso and zzso The structure of zzso revealed a zzso of zzso the face analogous to the zzso zzso binding site being a zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging showed that zzso is zzso linked to zzso in zzso and zzso provided enhanced zzso for zzso Surprisingly, zzso of zzso interacts with the zzso zzso zzso We propose that this results in a spatial separation of the zzso zzso zzso and indeed zzso prevented the zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein containing zzso recruitment domain zzso and zzso zzso zzso We zzso that while zzso was zzso selected to limit zzso inflammation in some mouse zzso the same mechanism contributes to increased zzso production and lupus zzso
