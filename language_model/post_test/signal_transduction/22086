zzso zzso is found in a number of animal zzso but the molecular mechanisms that pattern these zzso remain poorly zzso A hallmark of zzso development is the production of tiers of cells, called zzso that share distinct zzso zzso Many zzso have been discovered that are zzso into particular zzso raising the possibility that such zzso could be involved in establishing zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso is zzso into the second and third zzso then zzso in nearly all lineages except for the zzso cells of the third quartet, zzso and zzso Previously published zzso studies, extended here, show that zzso and zzso make zzso symmetrical contributions to the zzso head zzso and zzso zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso has only mild effects on development, but zzso both cells zzso development of the esophagus and several other zzso zzso of zzso with a zzso zzso zzso causes a very similar set of zzso as zzso of zzso and zzso showing that translation of this transcript is required for normal development of zzso and zzso These results show that a zzso zzso is necessary for the cells that inherit it in a zzso zzso Given that zzso are zzso zzso in nearly all the early zzso in this zzso these results suggest that the zzso is extensively patterned by zzso zzso Our experiments also uncovered two previously unappreciated zzso events during zzso zzso First, we found that the zzso can regulate to develop normal esophagus after deletion of either zzso or zzso Second, we found that the zzso or zzso lineages are required for normal development of the zzso zzso which arise from the fourth order zzso
