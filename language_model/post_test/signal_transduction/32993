zzso coli zzso was grown in zzso zzso zzso cultures, either in the presence of an electron zzso zzso zzso or zzso or fully zzso The zzso zzso ratio depended on the nature of the electron zzso zzso the ratio was zzso and it decreased progressively with increasing zzso potential of the electron zzso Similarly, decreasing the dissolved oxygen tension resulted in an increased zzso zzso As zzso zzso is a major switch point between zzso and respiratory behavior, the zzso through the different zzso zzso were zzso Although zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso it was zzso that the in zzso activity of the zzso occurred at low dissolved oxygen tensions zzso zzso zzso A simultaneous flux from zzso through both zzso and the zzso zzso complex zzso was zzso In zzso cultures with zzso or nitrate as an electron zzso a significant flux through the zzso was calculated on the basis of the zzso balance, the measured products, and the known zzso This result calls into question the common assumption that the complex cannot be active under these zzso In zzso activity zzso of zzso showed that the cellular content of the zzso varied with the internal zzso state and revealed an activity for dissolved oxygen tension of below zzso Whereas Western blots showed that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso did not vary to a large extent under the conditions tested, the zzso zzso zzso zzso amount followed the trend that was found for the in zzso zzso zzso From this it is concluded that regulation of the zzso is exerted at the zzso zzso zzso We propose that the external zzso state zzso as the zzso zzso of those terminal zzso with which the cell has sufficient capacity to zzso is reflected by the internal zzso zzso The latter may subsequently govern both the expression and the activity of the two zzso zzso
