zzso signaling promotes fibrosis, but the development of therapeutic interventions involving this zzso will require the identification and ultimate targeting of downstream zzso zzso In this study, using a zzso zzso and real-time zzso zzso mice had reduced expression of zzso along with the development of progressive zzso zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso knockout mice had increased expression of zzso along with the absence of zzso zzso in the same model of zzso In cultured zzso and zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by binding to the promoter of zzso Furthermore, zzso acted as a downstream inhibitor and therapeutic zzso for zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso but zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso I and III by zzso zzso zzso zzso gene delivery of zzso either before or after established zzso zzso blocked progressive zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso is a downstream inhibitor of zzso zzso and may have therapeutic potential for diseases involving zzso
