As a result of searching recently available chicken zzso expressed sequence tag databases, a new zzso zzso Factor zzso Super Family zzso member with similarity to the zzso zzso zzso decoy zzso zzso has been zzso However, by comparison with the zzso there exist at least two zzso zzso of zzso one of which includes an zzso death domain zzso characteristic of death zzso and the other with a truncated zzso domain of a zzso (named zzso These two zzso zzso of zzso display differential patterns of zzso expression across various zzso zzso with the highest levels observed within zzso zzso More specifically, zzso is most highly expressed in zzso zzso zzso cells in the zzso whereas zzso zzso is found at highest levels in zzso zzso zzso zzso culture experiments with zzso cells determined that expression of zzso zzso was decreased by protein zzso A signaling and enhanced by transforming growth factor zzso alpha zzso Interestingly, zzso and signaling via protein zzso C also enhanced levels of zzso expression but only in zzso zzso cells from zzso zzso Based on patterns of zzso expression and its zzso regulation, we predict that zzso zzso represents a zzso of zzso cell survival and/or zzso Finally, the characterization of these zzso zzso is of considerable interest from an evolutionary perspective in that they provide additional evidence to support a continuing divergence of zzso members throughout zzso zzso
