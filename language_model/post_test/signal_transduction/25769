Occupational exposure to metals such as zzso and zzso represents a risk factor for respiratory health and can cause zzso zzso However, the way they act may be zzso We show here that the two metals have a divergent effect on peripheral T zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell death in zzso but not in T zzso which instead respond by producing zzso gamma zzso conversely, zzso zzso zzso in T zzso but not in zzso Interestingly, both metals induce zzso zzso but with a dramatic different zzso This is because the effect of zzso in zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso activity of zzso zzso the zzso of nuclear factor zzso and the zzso danger signaling zzso leading to the production of zzso zzso However, zzso zzso do not fully differentiate into zzso or zzso cells, as zzso by the lack of expression of zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the expression of zzso II zzso as well as the capability of capturing and presenting the zzso decreased with zzso In conclusion, zzso keeps zzso in a partially zzso zzso state that can contribute to some of the zzso associated with the exposure to this zzso
