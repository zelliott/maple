zzso zzso is a strict zzso zzso mainly responsible for zzso disease in oral zzso zzso zzso gene zzso of this zzso was cloned and its zzso protein zzso was produced in zzso zzso Based on the zzso acid sequence of zzso that is a zzso protein of zzso zzso putative zzso zzso acid sequence was deduced in the data base of zzso sequences of zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was amplified with zzso zzso zzso DNA as a template and cloned into zzso coli zzso zzso Then zzso was transferred into zzso expression zzso to make zzso for production of zzso This protein was produced and zzso by zzso affinity column zzso zzso zzso was also produced in Sprague zzso zzso Using zzso analysis with this zzso it was confirmed that the zzso produced in zzso coli was identical to that of donor zzso Furthermore, by zzso analysis it was revealed that the zzso was originated from zzso zzso By zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence analysis it was found that zzso was able to bind to zzso zzso which was reported to be a secondary zzso in zzso zzso zzso these results imply that zzso zzso produces putative zzso and this protein might play a potential role in signaling zzso in oral zzso zzso
