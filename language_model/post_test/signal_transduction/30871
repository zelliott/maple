zzso acids zzso reduce zzso of the zzso after zzso injury to zzso and dog hearts mainly by opening zzso and zzso zzso zzso Other zzso for the action of zzso have been proposed, although no definitive zzso or mechanism has yet been zzso Using cultured cells from two zzso species, immortalized zzso from a mouse zzso lineage zzso and primary zzso derived from zzso rat hearts, we observed that zzso with zzso (1 zzso of zzso zzso or zzso attenuated zzso after exposure to zzso and zzso zzso zzso also preserved the functional beating of zzso zzso in culture after exposure to zzso We demonstrated that zzso increased the activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In fact, zzso zzso with zzso and exposed to zzso exhibited zzso changes in at least five downstream zzso of zzso protein zzso B zzso zzso death promoter, zzso and zzso activities, and the expression of the zzso inhibitor of zzso compared with zzso zzso The zzso zzso is one of the strongest zzso zzso signaling zzso Our studies show that zzso regulate multiple molecular zzso of this zzso zzso the targets of action of zzso protection will promote the development of these fatty acids as therapeutic agents against cardiac zzso
