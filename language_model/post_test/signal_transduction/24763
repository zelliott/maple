We have previously reported that zzso zzso resulted in an increase in zzso D activity in zzso zzso cells zzso Han et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In an attempt to explore the zzso downstream factor contributing to the zzso of zzso D, we have investigated the possible involvement of a small zzso zzso protein Ras in signaling events that were triggered by zzso zzso Upon zzso expression of dominant negative zzso of Ras zzso an increase in zzso D activity by zzso zzso zzso was zzso Also, the zzso downstream signaling events triggered by zzso zzso such as the zzso of zzso zzso C, the increase in zzso level, and the zzso of protein zzso C to membrane fraction were all reduced by zzso zzso When parallel experiments were performed with zzso a Ras zzso zzso almost identical zzso effects on zzso downstream signaling were zzso These data suggest that Ras zzso is essential in zzso zzso D zzso signal induced by zzso zzso and is located at zzso zzso C upstream in zzso signaling zzso
