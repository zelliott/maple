zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso has been associated with both cell proliferation and zzso zzso activated forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been previously shown capable of inducing differentiation or proliferation in zzso zzso To specifically examine the role of zzso zzso in zzso growth and development, we activated the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso of zzso activated zzso or zzso zzso into a human zzso cell line, zzso by zzso The zzso zzso clones that expressed zzso activated zzso or zzso showed zzso changes of zzso zzso cells also showed expression of mature zzso cell surface zzso The zzso zzso zzso was also activated by treatment of the zzso cells with a zzso that activates zzso The treatment of zzso cells with stem cell factor zzso ) caused zzso zzso zzso and induced differentiation by the expression of mature zzso cell surface zzso The effects of the zzso treatment were inhibited by zzso with a specific inhibitor of the zzso zzso pathway, zzso In this report, we conclude that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was both necessary and sufficient to induce differentiation in this zzso cell zzso
