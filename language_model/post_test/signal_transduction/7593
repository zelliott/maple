zzso regulate innate immunity to maintain zzso zzso and play pathological roles in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso promotes cellular zzso zzso survival, and wound closure in several cell zzso However, the impact of zzso in zzso remains zzso This study was to investigate whether zzso zzso in zzso regulates zzso production and zzso zzso We found that zzso was activated in zzso zzso in mice with zzso zzso sodium zzso colitis and in patients with zzso zzso zzso acute colitis was zzso and recovery from colitis was promoted in zzso mice with zzso zzso deletion of zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso treatment increased zzso and zzso levels during the acute phase of zzso and increased zzso but reduced zzso levels during the recovery phase in zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso abolished these effects of zzso zzso deletion on zzso colitis in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso activity enhanced zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, induction of zzso production by zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, in response to zzso plus zzso correlated with decreased zzso zzso Thus, although selective deletion of zzso in zzso leads to increases in both zzso and zzso zzso in response to inflammatory zzso the increase in the zzso level plays a role in suppressing zzso zzso production, resulting in protection of mice from zzso zzso These results reveal an integrated response of zzso regulated by zzso in zzso inflammatory zzso
