zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso zzso channels, induced zzso in a zzso and zzso manner in zzso human zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso which was significantly inhibited by zzso release zzso zzso and zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso and the zzso release zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso also increased zzso zzso zzso which was significantly blocked by zzso zzso channel zzso zzso and zzso These zzso also significantly inhibited both zzso zzso release and zzso induced by zzso The expression of zzso protein in the cells was confirmed by Western zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso induced zzso through zzso of zzso zzso channels and zzso zzso release and that this protein may be a good target for treatment of human zzso
