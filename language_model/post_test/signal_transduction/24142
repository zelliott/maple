The zzso zzso zzso zzso is used widely as an zzso taste stimulus and a potent flavor zzso as it zzso increases the zzso taste zzso by zzso zzso zzso mechanisms for zzso and its zzso with zzso are largely zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso imaging, we examined responses to zzso zzso and a mixture of zzso and zzso in zzso cells of rat zzso zzso Our zzso results showed that zzso zzso responses that are similar to those of zzso zzso an outward zzso an inward zzso or a zzso zzso Our zzso imaging results showed that applications of zzso zzso and the mixture increased zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, both zzso and zzso imaging showed that some taste cells can respond to zzso and zzso zzso indicating that zzso and zzso likely activate different zzso zzso application of zzso and zzso resulted in synergistic responses in a subset of zzso both response intensity and number of responding cells were zzso Most responses to zzso as well as the zzso between zzso and zzso were suppressed by zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Together, our results suggest that zzso zzso and zzso pathways are involved in zzso taste zzso for zzso and its synergistic responses with zzso
