zzso zzso regulate zzso development via zzso chemical, and electrical interactions with associated zzso The goal of this study was to identify and characterize zzso zzso zzso channels in zzso rat zzso zzso With the use of the whole cell arrangement of the zzso technique, three types of zzso outward zzso currents were measured in the cultured zzso The majority of cells expressed a transient outward zzso current zzso that activated at zzso positive to zzso zzso and partially zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by the zzso agent zzso zzso zzso and zzso (1 zzso but was unaffected by zzso zzso zzso and 1 zzso A smaller number of cells expressed one of two types of zzso zzso zzso zzso currents zzso fast zzso and zzso slow zzso that were strongly blocked by zzso Application of zzso zzso zzso to stimulate protein zzso C zzso inhibited zzso but had no effect on zzso and zzso zzso analysis revealed the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso Finally, zzso of the cells with zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus zzso cardiac zzso express at least three different zzso channels that may contribute to zzso signaling in these zzso
