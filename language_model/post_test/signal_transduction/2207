zzso To investigate synaptic mechanisms zzso zzso zzso in the carotid body, we developed zzso of zzso type 1 cell clusters and zzso zzso zzso zzso from 7- to zzso rat zzso and tested for functional connectivity in zzso zzso medium at approximately 35 degrees zzso zzso When cultured without type 1 cells, zzso were almost always zzso zzso zzso zzso and unresponsive to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso patch, zzso recordings of membrane potential or zzso zzso in contrast, many zzso zzso out of zzso that were juxtaposed to type 1 cell clusters in zzso displayed spontaneous activity, zzso spikes and zzso zzso zzso that resembled synaptic zzso zzso Additional tests suggested that de zzso chemical zzso developed between zzso and type 1 cell clusters in zzso For example: zzso the spontaneous activity was zzso suppressed by substituting low zzso zzso in the bath; zzso zzso had variable zzso and persisted following action potential blockade with zzso (1 zzso zzso the zzso distribution between successive spontaneous events appeared zzso and zzso the frequency of spontaneous zzso was diminished zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting contributions from the spontaneous release of zzso zzso Many complexes of zzso zzso and type 1 clusters were zzso functional, since exposure to zzso caused a zzso zzso and/or increased spike discharge in approximately zzso of such zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso spike discharge persisted in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso blocker zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however, this discharge was zzso inhibited by zzso zzso zzso suggesting that it was zzso at least in part, by zzso acting through zzso zzso zzso The zzso spike discharge and frequency of spontaneous zzso in zzso zzso were zzso suppressed when the buffer was switched from zzso to zzso (10 zzso at pH zzso further, zzso zzso that displayed spontaneous activity and/or zzso responses in zzso were encountered more frequently in zzso zzso or zzso zzso than in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that functional chemical zzso can develop de zzso in cultures of carotid body type 1 cells and zzso and that zzso is probably an important zzso neurotransmitter zzso from type 1 cells during hypoxic zzso in the rat carotid zzso
