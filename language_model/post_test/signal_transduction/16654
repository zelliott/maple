zzso oxygen species are toxic to cells but they may also have active roles in zzso zzso zzso To study the role of zzso oxygen species in growth factor depletion induced zzso of human primary zzso T cells, we used a synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso formed during zzso zzso of primary zzso T cells was characterized by generation of zzso zzso plasma membrane zzso zzso loss of zzso membrane potential, zzso of zzso 3, zzso of zzso as well as DNA zzso The zzso of zzso zzso did not influence plasma membrane zzso zzso or zzso zzso and only marginally inhibited the loss of zzso membrane potential and the formation of DNA strand zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso 3 activity and almost completely inhibited the zzso decrease in total cellular DNA content as measured by zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso oxygen zzso induce signals leading to efficient DNA degradation after the initial formation of DNA strand zzso Thus, zzso oxygen zzso have active roles in signaling that lead to the zzso zzso
