zzso zzso have been suggested to play a role in the zzso of tissue zzso and zzso We therefore assessed the zzso and zzso effects of zzso zzso factor zzso We show that zzso elicits a signaling response in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso because zzso with a zzso zzso zzso but not a zzso zzso zzso abolished zzso signal zzso and zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso The zzso cellular effects of zzso led to zzso zzso migration, and differentiation into zzso as demonstrated by the expression of zzso muscle zzso and zzso followed by the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as the expression of the zzso proteins transforming growth zzso and zzso To assess the relevance of zzso proliferation and cell migration, we examined the effect of zzso in a wound scratch zzso Indeed, zzso facilitated wound healing in a zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, these results support the notion that, beyond its role in zzso zzso zzso zzso might play a role in the progression of tissue zzso and zzso
