The zzso zzso zzso form a family of zzso that zzso the conversion of zzso zzso to zzso acid zzso both powerful second zzso in the zzso zzso is expressed in brain, peripheral T cells and zzso and has been shown to zzso to the nuclear zzso upon zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that high level expression of zzso is induced following a signal transmitted through the zzso and the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso contributes to survival in zzso zzso zzso zzso as pharmacological zzso of zzso activity results in death of this cell population both in cell suspension and zzso zzso zzso promotes survival in these zzso through a zzso zzso A consequence of zzso of zzso is the specific zzso of zzso whereas in transgenic mice that zzso zzso death induced by the inhibitor is partially zzso Thus we report a novel activity of zzso in survival of zzso immediately after entry into the zzso stage in zzso
