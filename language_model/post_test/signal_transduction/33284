We have studied the nuclear transport of zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso system in order to establish the transport requirements for zzso zzso to the zzso Using zzso cells and zzso calf zzso zzso we show that the zzso nuclear transport in zzso cells requires the addition of zzso zzso Furthermore, it can be blocked by energy depletion and by chilling or by addition of wheat germ zzso or by zzso zzso zzso Thus, the import of zzso zzso follows the criteria established for nuclear import zzso by nuclear zzso signals zzso The distribution of basic zzso acids in average zzso zzso however, does not allow the assignment of a specific element as a classical zzso
