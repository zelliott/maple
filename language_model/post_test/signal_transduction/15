zzso basic zzso zzso factors zzso control many aspects of zzso such as zzso fate determination, and zzso We have previously shown that the zzso cell surface zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso pathways via a direct association with two zzso zzso zzso and zzso to regulate activities of zzso zzso factors and zzso zzso We report here that zzso uses similar regulatory mechanisms to promote zzso zzso zzso of zzso a scaffold protein for zzso and zzso a regulator of zzso is increased during differentiation of zzso neural precursor cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso These molecules regulate zzso and zzso activities, which increase in a zzso manner during zzso differentiation of zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, enhancement or reduction of zzso and zzso activities enhances or zzso respectively, zzso differentiation of these cell zzso zzso and zzso activities also promote zzso of zzso and zzso suggesting that one way they promote zzso is via regulation of neural zzso factor zzso These results imply that a zzso zzso signaling mechanism initiated by zzso regulates the activities of zzso zzso factors and therefore functions as a key regulator of differentiation of several different cell zzso
