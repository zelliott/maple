zzso zzso cells lacking zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit sensitivity to zzso agents such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso Cell cycle analysis by flow zzso revealed a zzso block in zzso cells when treated with zzso zzso or zzso Further investigation revealed that the levels of zzso zzso on zzso which plays an essential role in the regulation of the zzso checkpoint, were higher in synchronized and zzso cells lacking zzso in response to zzso Use of a zzso zzso protected zzso from the zzso zzso In wild type cells, zzso induced a loss of the zzso zzso the zzso that zzso zzso zzso with resumption of the cell zzso In the zzso cells, however, the levels of zzso remained at sustained high levels in response to zzso zzso deletion of zzso in an zzso background overcame the zzso block in response to zzso The double zzso zzso also overcame the growth zzso on zzso Taken together, these findings zzso zzso as an upstream regulator of zzso levels and stability and zzso zzso in effect signaling recovery from the effects of zzso stress and allowing zzso zzso
