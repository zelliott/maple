The zzso genetic network plays a key role in the zzso patterning of the zzso at zzso and zzso stages of development of the neural zzso In the zzso it controls development of the entire zzso respiratory zzso network, including the zzso the zzso respiratory group zzso and the zzso complex zzso zzso of zzso eliminates the zzso activity, thereby causing life-threatening zzso zzso alternating with zzso at low zzso Another respiratory zzso the complete absence of breathing, is induced when zzso synchronization fails to develop in the zzso The present paper summarizes data on a third type of respiratory deficits induced by altering zzso function at zzso zzso zzso of zzso the most zzso expressed zzso gene in the zzso zzso embryonic development of the zzso and alters zzso zzso shaping without affecting respiratory frequency and zzso The same result is obtained by the zzso zzso zzso the number of zzso zzso zzso by eliminating zzso and by altering zzso development of the zzso with zzso acid administration at embryonic day zzso In addition, zzso treated with zzso acid provide a mouse model for zzso episodic breathing, widely reported in zzso zzso young girls with zzso syndrome, patients with zzso syndrome and adults with zzso zzso We conclude that specific respiratory deficits in zzso are zzso to zzso segments of the zzso suggesting that the adult respiratory zzso network is functionally organized according to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso
