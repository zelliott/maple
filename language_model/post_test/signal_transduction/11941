To explore whether the signal pathways of zzso zzso zzso and zzso can realize coordinated regulation on the zzso and proliferation of zzso zzso 

Male zzso mice were randomly divided into control and asthma zzso Then the zzso model of asthma was established by the method of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso were isolated by magnetic activated cell zzso zzso and then activated with zzso zzso (10 zzso and zzso zzso zzso for 6 zzso Those cells were then divided into Group zzso without any zzso Group B: treatment with zzso inhibitor zzso Group zzso treatment with zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso Group zzso treatment with zzso inhibitor and zzso zzso The protein and zzso levels of zzso A, zzso D1 and zzso of zzso zzso were assessed by flow zzso and reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso 

The results of flow zzso showed that the purity of zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso and the survival rate zzso zzso zzso The protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso A and zzso D1 in zzso zzso of asthma group were significantly higher than those of the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso The protein and zzso levels zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso of asthma group were significantly lower than those of control group zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and P zzso zzso The protein and zzso levels of zzso D1 in groups A, B, C and zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso groups B, C and D decreased markedly compared with group A (all P zzso zzso while group D decreased significantly compared with groups B and C (all P zzso zzso The protein levels of zzso in groups A, B, C and D were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso group B was significantly higher than that of group A zzso zzso zzso while group D was significantly higher than those of groups A, B and C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Meanwhile zzso zzso levels in each group were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso groups B, C and D were much higher than that of group A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while group D was significantly higher than those of groups B and C zzso zzso zzso zzso The protein and zzso levels of zzso showed no statistical significance among different experimental groups (all P zzso zzso 

The signal pathways of zzso and zzso may zzso zzso the expression of positive regulatory factor zzso and zzso the expression of negative regulatory factor zzso of zzso zzso
