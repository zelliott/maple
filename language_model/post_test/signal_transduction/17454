zzso drug therapy activates both molecular cell death and zzso zzso Here we show that even zzso zzso of zzso drugs, such as zzso and zzso induce the expression of zzso protein 5 zzso which is both necessary and sufficient for the subsequent induction of zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso to the nucleus, where it physically interacts with zzso in response to zzso agents both in zzso and in zzso zzso obtained from patients who had undergone zzso and/or zzso As a consequence, elements of the zzso passenger complex are displaced during zzso resulting in zzso zzso and segregation zzso zzso zzso of zzso does not prevent zzso zzso catastrophe, but shifts the balance to an early zzso cell zzso Our data suggest a dual role for zzso in response to drug-induced DNA damage, where it acts in two zzso pathways in two distinct cellular zzso the zzso and the zzso
