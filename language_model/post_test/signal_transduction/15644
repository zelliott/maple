The linear nature of zzso zzso zzso protection of their physical ends, the zzso because the zzso machinery can zzso the ends as zzso DNA zzso Thus, protection is crucial for avoiding an zzso zzso response that could have catastrophic ramifications for the integrity and stability of the linear zzso In this Commentary, we attempt to define what is currently understood by the term zzso zzso zzso the defining boundaries of zzso protection is important now more than ever, as it is becoming increasingly evident that, although unwanted DNA repair at zzso must be avoided at all costs, the molecular players involved in recognition, signaling and repair of DNA damage might also serve to protect zzso
