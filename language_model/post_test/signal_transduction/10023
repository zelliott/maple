zzso zzso have been implicated in the death of pancreatic beta cells leading to type 1 zzso zzso cells are an zzso cell line derived from mice expressing the zzso large T zzso These cells are a useful tool in analysis of beta cell zzso zzso cells are highly susceptible to zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso are not susceptible to cell death induced by zzso alone; however, they are killed by zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso We examined signal zzso in zzso cells in response to zzso to determine the mechanism for zzso zzso We found that zzso cells are defective in the zzso of nuclear zzso zzso as a result of functionally deficient zzso activity, because zzso of zzso protected zzso cells from zzso zzso also did not induce zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Together, these defects prevent expression of zzso genes in zzso cells and make them susceptible to zzso To determine whether similar defects in primary beta cells would induce the same effect, we examined zzso zzso in zzso isolated from mice deficient in zzso zzso These zzso were as susceptible as zzso zzso to zzso and zzso cell zzso In contrast to zzso zzso cell death was not prevented by zzso of zzso oxide in zzso zzso zzso zzso has been proposed as a mechanism for protection of beta cells from zzso cell death in zzso Our results suggest that this would make beta cells equally or more sensitive to zzso
