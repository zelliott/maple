We have examined the roles played by the zzso neural zzso protein zzso zzso in eye zzso zzso expression was observed in the zzso of all zzso cells zzso Although a zzso zzso zzso resulted in only weak abnormalities in zzso zzso we found that the zzso eye zzso was significantly enhanced in a seven in zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to be involved in the degradation of the zzso zzso zzso leading to the zzso of the zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso also functions to regulate zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed significantly high zzso expression of zzso and failure in the determination of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Other zzso cells also failed to differentiate with abnormalities occurring late in the differentiation zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso function zzso to zzso zzso in developing zzso zzso
