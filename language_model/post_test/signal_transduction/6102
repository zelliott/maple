zzso plays essential roles in both zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso but what precisely controls zzso targeting to zzso adhesive complexes, or zzso factor zzso complexes is less well zzso We show that during zzso zzso a form of zzso is generated that binds zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso form is zzso and is regulated by the zzso zzso of zzso which selectively competes zzso binding through an zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso reverses the zzso binding zzso suggesting another potential layer of zzso In contrast, the main zzso form of zzso is a zzso zzso indicating that there is a distinct molecular form of zzso that can interact with both the zzso and zzso We propose that participation of zzso in zzso or zzso signaling is dictated by the regulation of distinct molecular forms of zzso with different binding properties, rather than simple competition between zzso and zzso for a single zzso zzso This model explains how cells can control whether zzso is used independently in cell zzso and nuclear zzso or competitively so that the two processes are coordinated and zzso
