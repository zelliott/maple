B1 cells differ in many ways from conventional B cells, most prominently in the production of natural zzso which is vitally important for protection against zzso B1 cells have also been implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso It has been impossible to accurately study B1 cells during health and illness because the nature of human B1 cells has not been successfully zzso This has produced controversy regarding the existence of human B1 zzso Here, we determined the zzso of human B1 cells by testing zzso B cell zzso for three fundamental B1 cell functions based on mouse zzso spontaneous zzso zzso efficient T cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso We found that a small population of zzso cells present in both zzso zzso and adult peripheral blood fulfilled these criteria and expressed a skewed B cell zzso zzso These B cells express little or no surface zzso and zzso both of which are markedly zzso after zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso B zzso This work identifies human B1 cells as zzso We determined that the proportion of B1 cells declines with age, which may contribute to disease zzso Identification of human B1 cells provides a foundation for future studies on the nature and role of these cells in human zzso
