The metal zzso plant zzso zzso is protected from disease by the zzso of high zzso of metals in its aerial zzso which are toxic to many zzso As these metals can lead to the production of damaging zzso oxygen species zzso metal zzso plants have developed highly effective zzso tolerance mechanisms, which might zzso zzso zzso We therefore investigated whether metal zzso alters zzso zzso via zzso in this zzso We studied the effect of zinc zzso zzso by zzso on zzso zzso production, salicylic acid zzso and downstream zzso responses, such as zzso deposition and zzso zzso gene zzso to the bacterial pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso caused increased zzso production in zzso but zzso with zzso did not elicit the defensive zzso burst typical of most zzso zzso dependent on zzso through zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso were also modified or absent in zzso whereas salicylic acid production in response to infection was zzso These observations suggest that metal zzso is incompatible with zzso zzso through zzso and that, as metal zzso became effective as a form of zzso zzso normal zzso responses became progressively zzso from zzso zzso in zzso
