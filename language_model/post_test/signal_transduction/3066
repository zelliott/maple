zzso refers to the zzso distribution of different cellular components within a cell and is central to many cell zzso In zzso polarity regulates the zzso migration, and zzso function of zzso zzso zzso during an immune zzso The regulation of zzso cell division by polarity proteins may also dictate zzso zzso and memory differentiation following zzso zzso Small zzso along with their associated polarity and zzso zzso are critical for zzso the polarity changes necessary for zzso zzso and function, and in turn, are regulated by zzso exchange factors zzso and zzso zzso proteins zzso For example, a novel zzso zzso of zzso 8 zzso was recently identified as a regulator of immune cell function and zzso in zzso have been detected in patients with severe combined zzso Both B and zzso from zzso zzso mice form defective zzso zzso and have abnormal functions, in addition to impaired immune memory zzso This paper will discuss the interplay between polarity proteins and zzso and their role in zzso zzso
