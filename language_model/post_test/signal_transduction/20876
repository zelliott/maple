Studies on zzso human zzso indicated that any two of three distinct factors must be present for marked zzso of dense or zzso constituents to zzso These factors are zzso zzso of protein zzso C zzso and zzso of an unidentified zzso protein zzso Thus, in the absence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso acted zzso to promote zzso whereas in the presence of zzso either zzso of zzso or addition of zzso was zzso In all cases, zzso correlated with the zzso of zzso D zzso as detected by the formation of zzso acid zzso in the absence of ethanol or of zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso did not correlate with zzso C zzso activity or with the zzso of zzso zzso both of which required zzso and were inhibited by zzso zzso Ethanol partially inhibited zzso in the absence of zzso zzso a known inhibitor of zzso zzso in zzso cells, caused parallel inhibitions of zzso and zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso activity, as indicated by zzso zzso apparently by stimulating the formation of PA in the absence of zzso as well as of zzso in the presence of zzso PA and stable zzso including zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso and other proteins in zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that PA formed by zzso of zzso may mediate zzso from zzso zzso by zzso and independent zzso However, in intact zzso zzso by zzso zzso accounted for only zzso of the total PA formed and can only play a major role in zzso if this PA fraction is distinct from that formed by the combined actions of zzso and zzso zzso
