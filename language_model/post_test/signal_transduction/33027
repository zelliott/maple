zzso zzso acts as both a growth and survival factor for many zzso zzso zzso treatment of responsive cells leads to the rapid and transient zzso of Class zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso and zzso of zzso Each of these molecules has been implicated in zzso signaling in a wide range of zzso Using regulated expression of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, we have specifically investigated the role of class zzso zzso in zzso zzso The major functional consequence of zzso expression in these cells is a highly zzso dramatic reduction in zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduces zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of BAD dramatically, to levels seen in zzso zzso Despite these zzso the levels of zzso observed in the same cells are very low and do not account for the reduction in zzso proliferation we zzso These results show that zzso zzso both zzso activity and BAD zzso without significantly affecting levels of zzso suggesting that there are targets other than zzso and BAD that can transmit survival signals in these zzso Our data indicate that the prime target for zzso action in zzso signaling is at the level of regulation of zzso
