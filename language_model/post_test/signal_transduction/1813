zzso zzso is accompanied by assembly of an zzso zzso that reduces oxygen to form a number of zzso zzso These oxygen zzso can eradicate invading zzso regulate the function of other immune zzso cells, and cause damage to zzso zzso zzso It is generally assumed that the zzso zzso is activated exclusively in the plasma zzso In zzso this assumption does not fit with the zzso zzso of the membrane component of the zzso which is stored in zzso zzso It has now become increasingly evident that zzso are also produced in an zzso compartment that we identify as the specific zzso zzso is stored in another zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso in the processing of the zzso zzso We suggest that zzso zzso is accompanied by fusion between zzso and specific zzso allowing these zzso reactions to take zzso The presented data suggest a requisite role for zzso zzso zzso their function as microbial killing zzso Signaling capabilities of the zzso affecting for example, the state of protein zzso regulation of zzso factors, and induction of zzso are zzso
