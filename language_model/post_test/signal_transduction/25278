zzso zzso zzso zzso therapy can be used to induce transplantation tolerance in zzso zzso Such tolerance is often associated with dominant regulation, zzso by zzso cells, and characterized by infectious tolerance and linked zzso zzso the mechanisms by which zzso regulatory cells function may improve the manner in which current zzso are applied and may lead to the development of new zzso zzso zzso zzso has been characterized as an important mechanism of peripheral zzso and we here examine whether it has any role in zzso zzso zzso dominant zzso 

zzso to transplanted skin and bone zzso mismatched for multiple minor zzso zzso was induced in zzso zzso and control mice using zzso and zzso zzso zzso To test for linked suppression, animals were transplanted with a second zzso tolerated and third party zzso The ability of zzso from tolerant animals to suppress graft rejection was assessed by transfer into partially zzso zzso 

zzso zzso therapy rendered zzso zzso mice tolerant of minor disparate skin and bone zzso zzso from these and control tolerant animals when transferred into partially zzso zzso zzso or control recipients, induced zzso suppression of graft zzso Additionally, tolerant zzso zzso mice accepted zzso bearing tolerated and third party zzso 

Signal zzso through the zzso zzso plays no essential role in the induction of tolerance using zzso and zzso zzso zzso or its maintenance by active zzso
