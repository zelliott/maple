zzso T cell zzso is positively zzso and zzso zzso regulated by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso A central question is how the balance between these two opposing forces is controlled as T cells zzso We have previously shown that zzso signaling is absolutely required to prime zzso zzso T cells to differentiate into zzso that provide help for zzso centers and zzso zzso zzso In this study, we show that the requirement for zzso signaling is transient and zzso zzso T cells do not require zzso signals to sustain their zzso The zzso independence of zzso T cells within zzso centers suggested that a key function for zzso under these circumstances might be to provide negative regulatory signals via the zzso zzso zzso By examining zzso center responses in mice where the ability to signal through T cell zzso was compromised, we provide data that supports a critical role for zzso in zzso T cell help for zzso center B zzso
