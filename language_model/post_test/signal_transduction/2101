zzso play a key role in the perception of light signals by zzso In this study, the three classical zzso action zzso zzso zzso responses zzso zzso responses zzso and zzso responses zzso were genetically dissected using zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso A or zzso zzso and a zzso between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso growth zzso and zzso unfolding in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso showed zzso responses to the calculated proportion of active zzso established by one light pulse or repeated light zzso The first phase, zzso the zzso was absent in the zzso zzso normal in the zzso zzso (both in the zzso zzso background) and severely deficient in zzso The second phase, zzso the zzso was present in the zzso zzso deficient in the zzso zzso and normal in zzso Under continuous zzso light, zzso of zzso zzso were absent in zzso and normal in zzso and zzso The segregation of zzso in zzso zzso lines derived from a cross between zzso zzso and Columbia was zzso by zzso Two quantitative trait zzso one on zzso 2 zzso and another on zzso 5 zzso were identified as responsible for the zzso zzso A is proposed to initiate two zzso zzso zzso and zzso involving different cells and/or different molecular zzso This is the first application of the analysis of quantitative trait zzso zzso between zzso to dissect zzso chains of environmental zzso
