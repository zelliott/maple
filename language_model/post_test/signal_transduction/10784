zzso movements are critical for establishing the three principal germ layers and the basic architecture of zzso zzso Although the individual molecules and pathways involved are not clearly zzso zzso zzso signals are known to participate in zzso zzso including zzso cell polarity and directed cell zzso Here we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso first identified in association with zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso In addition, depletion of zzso results in increased expression of the zzso zzso which contributes to the zzso zzso zzso as it is significantly rescued by zzso zzso We further demonstrate that zzso is a direct gene target of zzso and that zzso association zzso zzso repression in zzso Our results indicate that zzso and zzso are essential components of a new zzso gene regulatory zzso that controls zzso zzso
