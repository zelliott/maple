There is a body of literature that describes the geometry and the physics of zzso using either zzso models or partial differential equations and elasticity and zzso zzso zzso there is a paucity of models focusing on the regulation of the network of proteins that control the formation of different zzso zzso Using a combination of zzso and zzso experiments together with a system of ordinary differential zzso we focused on a small number of zzso interacting molecules involved in zzso zzso zzso the zzso remodeler zzso whose capping and bundling activities are a function of its zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which exert zzso functions in controlling filament zzso The model emphasizes the essential role of complexes that contain the membrane zzso protein zzso in the process of zzso zzso This model accurately accounted for all zzso including a seemingly paradoxical result zzso genetic removal of zzso reduced zzso in zzso but increased them in zzso zzso and generated quantitative predictions, which were zzso zzso The model further permitted us to explain how zzso are generated in different cellular zzso depending on the dynamic interaction established by zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso thus revealing an unexpected plasticity of the signaling network that zzso the zzso activities of its components in the formation of zzso
