zzso crest cells zzso are a unique population of zzso cells that migrate along defined pathways throughout the zzso and give rise to many diverse cell types including zzso cells, zzso cartilage and the peripheral nervous system zzso zzso migration of zzso results in a wide variety of zzso birth defects including zzso zzso The zzso zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso have been identified as key components in the regulation of cell migration in a variety of zzso Here we describe a novel role for the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the development and migration of zzso zzso zzso We find that loss of zzso but not zzso results in zzso zzso migration defects in the zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of either zzso or zzso causes zzso zzso migration and results in zzso zzso zzso We propose a model in which zzso signaling from the zzso arch zzso and zzso stalk to zzso expressing zzso is important for both the proper zzso of the zzso into zzso arches and the subsequent patterning and zzso of the neural crest derived zzso
