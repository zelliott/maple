It is now generally considered that early zzso from zzso zzso that induce zzso is initiated through the formation of zzso complexes consisting of the zzso zzso zzso and a number of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso However, since much of this work has been performed on zzso zzso cell lines expressing zzso zzso zzso we examined the nature of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso complex formation in the human breast cancer cell line, zzso This cell line has an zzso native zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso and its growth in culture is zzso related to the zzso zzso Our results indicate that in zzso cells, both the zzso and zzso are zzso on zzso zzso and can be zzso This occurs at both high and low zzso zzso regardless of the zzso zzso The molecular association is correlated with a significant increase in total zzso zzso formed in response to the growth factor zzso In contrast, however, there is no evidence that GAP is either zzso on zzso zzso or forms a complex with the activated zzso in zzso zzso zzso These observations suggest that as a model for growth factor action, the formation of zzso protein zzso complexes may demonstrate considerable diversity depending upon both cell type and zzso
