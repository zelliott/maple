The RON zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in the majority of pancreatic zzso yet its role in pancreatic cancer cell biology remains to be zzso Recent work in childhood zzso identified RON as a zzso of resistance to zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso To better understand RON function in pancreatic cancer cells, we sought to identify novel RON zzso Using zzso protein identification analysis, zzso was identified and confirmed to interact with RON in pancreatic cancer cell zzso IGF-1 zzso rapid zzso of zzso but RON signaling did not activate zzso indicating zzso signaling between these zzso We next demonstrate that IGF-1 zzso pancreatic cancer cell migration that is RON dependent, as zzso of RON signaling by either zzso RON zzso or by a RON zzso inhibitor zzso IGF-1 induced wound closure in a scratch zzso In pancreatic cancer cells, unlike childhood zzso zzso rather than zzso is activated in response to IGF-1, in a zzso zzso The current study defines a novel interaction between RON and zzso and taken together, these two studies demonstrate that RON is an important zzso of zzso signaling and that this finding is consistent in both human zzso and zzso zzso These findings demand additional investigation to determine if zzso independent RON zzso is associated with resistance to zzso therapies in zzso and to identify suitable zzso of activated RON zzso
