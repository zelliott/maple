zzso zzso are zzso acid regulators of many human zzso and are associated with many zzso zzso zzso expression levels have been used in profiling studies, but some evidence suggests that expression levels do not fully capture zzso regulatory zzso In this study we integrate multiple gene expression zzso to determine zzso activity patterns associated with cancer zzso and zzso pathways in zzso tumors - a very zzso class of zzso 

Using a zzso method, we identified zzso activated zzso between 77 normal tissue specimens and 135 zzso and we validated many of these findings with zzso interrogation of an independent, zzso cohort of 18 zzso We also showed that zzso activity is zzso correlated with zzso expression zzso Using next-generation zzso sequencing we identified potential base sequence zzso which may explain differential zzso We then analyzed zzso activity changes related to the zzso and found 21 zzso that switch from silenced to activated status in parallel with zzso zzso zzso nearly half of these 21 zzso were predicted to regulate integral parts of the zzso processing machinery, and our gene expression analysis revealed significant reductions of these transcripts in zzso zzso These results suggest an association between zzso signaling and zzso processing in which zzso may zzso their own zzso 

Our study represents the first gene zzso investigation of zzso regulatory activity in human zzso and our findings indicate that zzso activity patterns derived from integrated zzso data are zzso and biologically zzso in zzso We identified an association between zzso signaling and zzso processing, and demonstrated sequence zzso as plausible causes for differential zzso zzso Finally, our study highlights the value of systems level zzso zzso assessment with zzso zzso data, and the zzso of zzso zzso for validation of novel zzso
