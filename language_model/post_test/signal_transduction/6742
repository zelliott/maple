zzso response element binding protein zzso is a zzso factor crucial for late phase long-term zzso zzso induction and zzso Upon multiple high frequency stimulation zzso large zzso influx activates zzso zzso This, in turn, activates zzso which by itself or through zzso zzso can activate zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso activates multiple genes essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso IV zzso is also activated by calcium and can directly activate zzso We have shown previously that zzso zzso zzso and reduces the zzso protein levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in area zzso of the zzso In the present study, levels of these signaling molecules were determined in area zzso during the induction and maintenance zzso of zzso Standard zzso was used to evoke zzso in the zzso area of zzso zzso treated zzso and sham control zzso adult zzso zzso zzso treatment reversed zzso zzso zzso Five minutes after zzso western zzso showed an increase in the levels of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso control, and zzso treated zzso animals, but not in zzso zzso The protein levels of total zzso total zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not altered in all groups five minutes after zzso Four hours after zzso the levels of zzso and zzso zzso remained unchanged in zzso animals, while they were elevated in zzso control, and zzso treated zzso zzso We conclude that respective zzso zzso of essential zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso is correlated with restoration of normal zzso induction and maintenance in the zzso area of zzso zzso zzso
