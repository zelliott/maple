We report that knocking down the expression of zzso zzso zzso type II zzso in human zzso cells, like zzso of zzso resulted in enhanced zzso zzso and zzso growth and enhanced overall zzso In zzso experiments, zzso of zzso resulted in reduced tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with no effect on zzso zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso may cooperate in zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso resulted in cellular zzso Finally, we found loss of zzso zzso at the zzso locus in a majority of zzso breast zzso as well as in a significant fraction of zzso zzso which correlated with lower overall patient survival, suggesting that zzso is a tumor zzso
