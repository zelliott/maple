zzso of the zzso zzso of T zzso with its zzso zzso can lead either to cell zzso or to a state of profound zzso zzso Although subtle changes in the nature of the zzso or of the zzso cell have been shown to affect the outcome of T cell zzso zzso the mechanism by which the same zzso can induce alternative cellular responses is not completely zzso A model for explaining both positive zzso proliferation and zzso zzso and negative zzso zzso signaling of T zzso is described zzso This model relies on the zzso properties of the zzso zzso associated with the T cell zzso One of its basic assumptions is that the zzso activity of these zzso zzso remains above background level after zzso removal and is responsible for cellular zzso Using a simple zzso zzso we show how the timing of the binding and zzso zzso events can affect the properties of zzso signaling and determine the type of cellular zzso The present approach zzso into a common framework a large body of experimental observations and allows zzso of conditions leading to cellular zzso or to zzso
