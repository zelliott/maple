zzso zzso activates a diverse array of functional responses in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes are zzso consisting of two zzso zzso chains and two zzso zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso domain of zzso activates zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These zzso then zzso specific zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso domain of the zzso zzso Once zzso these zzso zzso (and their zzso zzso zzso serve as temporary zzso sites for the zzso zzso factor, zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso binds to these sites via its zzso zzso zzso 2) domain, and is, in turn, zzso by the zzso zzso It then zzso and zzso to the nucleus where it binds with high affinity to zzso elements zzso in the promoters of various zzso zzso One of these zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a member of a newly identified family of genes that inhibit zzso zzso Moreover, the ability of zzso to induce de zzso synthesis of zzso in zzso zzso with its ability to inhibit expression of many genes in these cells, including zzso zzso such as tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso Thus, the ability of zzso to inhibit gene expression in zzso is associated with its ability to rapidly induce synthesis of zzso
