Cold exposure and zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment induce the production of beige cells, which express brown zzso zzso zzso in white zzso tissue zzso It remains unclear whether the beige cells, which have different gene expression patterns from BA, express zzso fatty acid zzso zzso zzso Here we found that 5 day cold exposure and zzso treatment of zzso but not zzso treatment of primary zzso of zzso mice, increased zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso proteins are induced in beige cells in a different zzso from zzso
