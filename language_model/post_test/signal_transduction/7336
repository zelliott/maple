zzso zzso are benign tumors that develop from smooth muscle cells zzso The zzso oxygen species zzso have been shown to be involved in the signaling pathways that stimulate proliferation of a variety of cell zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which is zzso in various zzso In the present study, we investigated the expressions of zzso and its related molecules in zzso zzso and matched adjacent zzso Our results showed the expression of zzso was increased in zzso compared with the matched adjacent zzso by quantitative zzso and western zzso zzso expression was increased in zzso compared with zzso by western zzso The zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso D1 were increased in zzso compared with the adjacent zzso The zzso level of zzso zzso zzso in zzso was not altered when compared with the matched adjacent zzso These results suggest that zzso and some of its related molecules are associated with the zzso of zzso zzso The identification of zzso signaling pathways leading to cell proliferation points to another potential therapeutic target for treatment and/or prevention of zzso zzso
