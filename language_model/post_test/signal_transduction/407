zzso zzso signal zzso by cell surface receptors requires information about the precise order of relevant modifications on the early zzso zzso Here we introduce the B cell line zzso and its genetically engineered zzso as a model system to determine and functionally characterize zzso protein modifications in zzso This is accomplished by a customized strategy that combines mass zzso analyses of protein modifications with subsequent zzso zzso When applied to the B cell zzso zzso zzso zzso this approach uncovered a differential and highly dynamic engagement of numerous newly identified zzso zzso Some of them serve as zzso zzso in resting cells and undergo rapid zzso upon zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso can be early and zzso or early and zzso or zzso zzso zzso of conspicuous zzso at zzso 170 in zzso revealed a zzso checkpoint for some but not all possible B cell zzso Our data show that zzso zzso acts upstream for signal initiation and also downstream during selective processing of the zzso zzso Such a phenomenon defines a zzso signal zzso
