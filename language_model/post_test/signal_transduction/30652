Development of a complex process network by maturing zzso is a critical but currently poorly characterized step toward zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and especially its zzso domain are able to promote this zzso zzso In particular, the single zzso zzso motif located within zzso zzso domain was found to stimulate the outgrowth of higher order branches but not process zzso This motif was also observed to be critical for the zzso effect of zzso zzso domain on the reorganization of focal zzso located at the leading edge of zzso zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso promotes zzso process network formation and expansion via the cooperative action of multiple functional sites located within the zzso domain and more specifically, a novel signaling zzso zzso by the single zzso zzso motif and regulating the correlated events of process outgrowth and focal zzso zzso
