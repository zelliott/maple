To investigate the effect of zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso zzso cell growth in zzso and in zzso 

zzso gene was transferred into zzso cells, and zzso zzso zzso clones were zzso zzso and zzso growth capacity in zzso were detected by zzso zzso and colony formation zzso in soft zzso zzso zzso was used to analyze cell cycle and zzso The invasion ability was measured by zzso invasion zzso zzso of signal molecules in zzso growth factor zzso protein zzso zzso signal zzso were determined by Western zzso zzso growth in zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso in nude zzso 

zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited slower growth and reduced the capacity of zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduced cell invasion capacity and promoted cell zzso The activities of zzso signal zzso were also inhibited significantly by zzso of zzso in addition, zzso of zzso in zzso cells reduced tumor formation in zzso 

The zzso may act as a candidate tumor zzso gene in human zzso zzso and this effect may be related with the zzso of zzso signal zzso
