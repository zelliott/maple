zzso and rays are highly sensitive to chemical stimuli in their natural environment but several hypotheses predict that zzso zzso with their expanded head and enlarged zzso zzso have particularly acute zzso zzso We used the zzso zzso technique to compare the relative response of the zzso zzso shark zzso zzso zzso zzso to 20 zzso zzso acids and determine the sensitivity for 6 zzso zzso At zzso zzso zzso evoked the greatest zzso response which was approximately twice as large as that of zzso The weakest response was obtained for zzso followed by zzso acid and zzso The zzso zzso showed adaptation to sequential zzso and recovery was related to the zzso time zzso zzso zzso response thresholds were in the zzso range for both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso range for zzso and zzso These thresholds from zzso to zzso M for the zzso zzso shark are comparable or lower than those reported for other zzso and zzso zzso Future work should focus on zzso and more complex compounds to test for competition and zzso for different classes of peripheral zzso and their responses to molecules found in biologically relevant zzso
