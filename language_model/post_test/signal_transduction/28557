While it is thought that advanced zzso end products zzso act by stimulating transforming growth factor zzso to mediate diabetic injury, we report that zzso can activate zzso zzso zzso and mediate diabetic zzso directly and independently of zzso zzso activate zzso in zzso and vascular cells at 5 zzso zzso over zzso zzso before zzso synthesis at 24 h and occurs in zzso zzso I and II zzso zzso This is zzso by zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso In addition, zzso also activate zzso at 24 h via the classic zzso zzso A substantial zzso of zzso zzso zzso and collagen synthesis by zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso suggests that the zzso signaling zzso zzso is a key mechanism in diabetic zzso Prevention of zzso zzso zzso and collagen synthesis by zzso of zzso indicates that zzso signaling may play a critical role in diabetic zzso This is further supported by the findings that zzso of zzso in human diabetic zzso and zzso is associated with local deposition of zzso and zzso of zzso Thus, zzso act by zzso zzso signaling to mediate diabetic complications via both zzso and zzso zzso shedding new light on the zzso of diabetic organ zzso
