Recent evidence indicates that zzso zzso zzso 2 and 4 are involved in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso but the exact mechanisms of their actions have not been zzso We explored the therapeutic potential of blocking zzso in mice with established zzso zzso was generated by a single zzso injection of zzso (10 zzso Two weeks later, the mice were treated with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso activity not only reduced zzso but also attenuated zzso cardiac dysfunction by zzso and inhibited zzso zzso To determine the differential effects of blocking zzso and zzso in chronic zzso mice were injected with zzso zzso zzso once a week for 8 weeks, followed by treatment with zzso or zzso zzso zzso for 40 zzso zzso zzso activity blunted cardiac dysfunction by zzso and inhibited cardiac fibrosis, which was associated with a significant suppression of zzso zzso The underlying mechanism involved interrupting the interaction of zzso with its zzso zzso resulting in zzso of inflammation and zzso In contrast, blocking zzso exacerbated cardiac dysfunction and zzso by amplifying inflammation and suppressing zzso Our studies demonstrate that zzso and zzso play distinct roles in the progression of zzso zzso zzso activity is crucial for the resolution of inflammation and cardiac fibrosis, while blocking zzso activity has therapeutic potential for the treatment of zzso
