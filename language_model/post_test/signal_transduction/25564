The first zzso of zzso contains common single zzso zzso associated with body weight and zzso in zzso In an effort to identify the molecular basis for this association, we discovered that zzso and zzso (a zzso gene located in close proximity to the zzso start site of zzso are regulated by zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso factor, zzso This regulation occurs via a single zzso regulatory site zzso in the zzso within the zzso zzso region associated with zzso in zzso Single zzso zzso zzso zzso in this regulatory zzso affects binding affinities of zzso and zzso zzso analysis revealed that binding of zzso to this site zzso zzso whereas binding of zzso increases zzso activity from the zzso as well as zzso minimal zzso zzso expression of zzso or zzso affects zzso zzso zzso b trafficking and zzso signaling in zzso mouse zzso or zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso clusters in the vicinity of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice treated with zzso but not in zzso mice, suggesting a potentially important role of the zzso in zzso signaling that is, in part, regulated by zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso with decreased nuclear zzso activity of a zzso zzso zzso that has been shown to cleave full-length zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso b zzso in the vicinity of the zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with increased zzso signaling as reflected in protein levels of zzso zzso zzso Association of the zzso locus with zzso in humans may reflect functional consequences of zzso zzso at zzso The zzso zzso zzso shows reduced affinity for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to the zzso 1) decreased zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2) reduced zzso trafficking to the zzso and, as a consequence, 3) a diminished cellular response to zzso
