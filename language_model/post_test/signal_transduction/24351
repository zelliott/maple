The class II zzso zzso zzso and zzso directly bind to and repress zzso zzso factors of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family thereby zzso skeletal zzso During muscle zzso repression of gene zzso by zzso complexes is relieved due to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso proteins and zzso are also highly expressed in the nervous system and have been implicated in zzso survival and zzso Here we investigated the possibility that the zzso zzso of zzso and thus their ability to repress target zzso is controlled by synaptic activity in zzso We found that, in cultured zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso is dynamic and zzso zzso electrical activity was sufficient for nuclear export of zzso but not of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso was induced following stimulation of calcium flux through synaptic zzso receptors or zzso calcium zzso zzso bath application zzso synaptic and zzso zzso zzso antagonized nuclear zzso zzso zzso shuttling of both zzso was partially blocked by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso with zzso nuclear export being more sensitive to zzso zzso zzso than that of zzso Thus, the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso is specified by zzso zzso differences in the zzso thresholds for zzso and zzso nuclear export provides a mechanism for zzso gene zzso
