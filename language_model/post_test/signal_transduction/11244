zzso zzso body disease zzso is a degenerative disease of the nervous system, involving the brain zzso zzso zzso and cerebral cortex, associated with abnormal zzso zzso and widespread formation of zzso bodies and zzso zzso zzso presents as pure forms zzso or in association with zzso disease zzso in the common forms zzso Several neurotransmitter abnormalities have been reported including those of the zzso and zzso zzso system, and central zzso zzso and zzso zzso The present work examines zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and signaling in the frontal zzso of zzso and zzso cases in comparison with zzso zzso zzso zzso specific binding to group I and II zzso and abnormal zzso levels have been found in zzso This is associated with reduced expression levels of zzso C zzso zzso the zzso of group I zzso following protein G zzso upon zzso zzso Additional modification in the zzso of zzso and reduced zzso activity in pure and common zzso further demonstrates for the first time abnormal zzso signaling in the cerebral zzso in zzso In order to look for a possible link between abnormal zzso signaling and zzso zzso in zzso zzso studies have shown zzso binding in controls and decreased zzso binding in zzso This is accompanied by a shift in the distribution of zzso but not of zzso in zzso when compared with zzso Together, these results support the concept that abnormal zzso in zzso produces functional effects on cortical zzso zzso which are associated with reduced zzso zzso and, therefore, that zzso are putative pharmacological targets in zzso Finally, these results emphasize the emergence of a functional zzso that has to be explored for a better understanding of the effects of abnormal protein interactions in degenerative diseases of the nervous zzso
