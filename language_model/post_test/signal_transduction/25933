Although aging is well established as an important risk factor for zzso zzso the mechanism of age-related zzso valve zzso is yet zzso Here, we investigated this mechanism in tissue and cellular levels using middle-aged zzso zzso valve specimens were obtained by zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso male zzso zzso In the aged rats, the main risk factors for zzso zzso in plasma were still in the normal zzso however, their number of zzso specimens was significantly increased in comparison with the young zzso zzso valve zzso cells zzso obtained from zzso of zzso valve specimens were cultured for 14 days after reaching zzso zzso zzso the expressions of zzso zzso that is, zzso alkaline zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity in zzso from aged rats were enhanced in comparison with those from young zzso However, neither typical zzso inducing zzso zzso zzso and high concentration of zzso nor tumor necrosis zzso (an inflammatory zzso accelerated the spontaneous zzso of zzso from aged zzso These results suggest that zzso valve zzso zzso with age partly through an zzso of the zzso zzso
