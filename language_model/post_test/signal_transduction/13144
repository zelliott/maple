zzso are highly plastic cells that participate in inflammatory and injury responses within the zzso and that can migrate extensively after zzso Because zzso and their zzso zzso zzso form a large part of the zzso zzso we undertook to study the adhesive interactions between zzso and these zzso in zzso In contrast to zzso precursor cells, zzso formed only weak interactions with zzso and their zzso On specific zzso zzso the zzso zzso strongly to zzso zzso and plastic but only zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso was increased significantly by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but was decreased by zzso with the zzso effect being dominant over the other zzso zzso cell sorting zzso analysis and zzso showed that zzso zzso express the zzso zzso a well characterized zzso zzso and that zzso expression levels did not change after zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso zzso to zzso is zzso entirely by the zzso zzso strongly suggesting that the zzso regulation of zzso to zzso is zzso by changes in the zzso state of zzso Analysis of signaling pathways revealed that zzso of zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso In light of the evidence that zzso expression is zzso after zzso injury, the findings suggest that zzso regulation of zzso zzso to zzso may play a fundamental role in determining the extent of zzso zzso into and retention at the site of zzso
