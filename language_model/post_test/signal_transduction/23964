The role of zzso in zzso signaling and its functional relevance in adult rat heart has been the subject of considerable zzso zzso we investigated the zzso pathways in both adult zzso and in the intact hearts of zzso rats with respect to protein zzso A (at zzso the key event in zzso of relaxation time, and zzso zzso II (at zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and cellular zzso responses were studied in parallel on the same zzso rat zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used to discriminate the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso stimulation zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso in both adult zzso and in adult hearts of zzso The zzso zzso of relaxation time in the heart zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso action on both zzso and zzso signaling zzso by reducing the zzso status of zzso Only zzso stimulation produced significant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso and zzso of zzso zzso 

Our findings clearly show that zzso signaling is coupled to zzso zzso and zzso of relaxation time in the adult rat zzso
