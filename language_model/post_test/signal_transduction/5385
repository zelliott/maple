The objectives of this work were to update and zzso recent experimental works on zzso mainly focus on its zzso effects and the zzso 

The literature was reviewed using zzso database, and some of the recent findings from our laboratory were zzso 

zzso is a recently discovered tissue zzso with a high affinity for oxygen and is widely and specifically expressed in zzso of zzso central and peripheral nervous zzso zzso in the past several years have advanced our knowledge on the functions and mechanisms of zzso but many issues remain zzso Emerging reports have shown that zzso of zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso or zzso damage in cultured zzso and in cerebral zzso animal zzso zzso findings suggest several possible zzso roles and mechanisms including zzso binding and oxygen zzso zzso of cell signaling pathways and maintenance of zzso zzso 

Emerging experimental works suggest that zzso is zzso against zzso zzso probably via zzso binding and oxygen zzso zzso of cell signaling pathways and maintenance of zzso zzso
