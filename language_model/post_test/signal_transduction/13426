zzso acids exert zzso effects on proteins involved in control of zzso translation in animal cells through the target of zzso zzso signaling zzso Here we use zzso of zzso zzso to investigate mechanisms by which zzso acids are zzso in animal zzso Small ( approximately zzso but zzso relevant increases in zzso but not zzso total zzso acid concentration (or zzso or zzso but not Ala, zzso or zzso zzso resulted in increased zzso of zzso and its zzso zzso protein zzso This response was inhibited by zzso demonstrating that the effects require the zzso zzso zzso of active zzso acids zzso for zzso acids with lower zzso zzso were zzso to changes in external zzso acid concentration unless surface zzso of the cell to zzso acids was increased by zzso of the System L zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso when System zzso zzso were incubated in zzso zzso zzso supporting zzso zzso of the putative zzso acid zzso In contrast to lower zzso such as zzso which possess an zzso zzso acid zzso our findings provide the first direct evidence for an zzso location for the putative zzso acid sensor in animal cells that signals increased zzso acid availability to zzso
