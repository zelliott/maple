Patients with zzso cell lung cancer zzso who have zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso derive clinical benefit from treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso namely zzso and zzso However, these patients eventually develop resistance to zzso Despite the fact that this acquired resistance may be the result of a secondary zzso in the zzso zzso such as zzso or amplification of the zzso zzso there are other mechanisms which need to be zzso zzso zzso are a class of small zzso zzso that play pivotal roles in zzso tumor progression and zzso In this study, we zzso successfully established a zzso resistant cell zzso by exposing normal zzso cells (an zzso cell line with a zzso zzso deletion of zzso zzso to increasing zzso of zzso Then, we found that zzso was significantly zzso in zzso zzso We also showed that zzso and zzso were zzso expressed in zzso zzso of zzso altered the expression of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso to zzso Taken together, zzso may regulate the acquired resistance to zzso in zzso via zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso may thus reverse the acquired resistance to zzso zzso
