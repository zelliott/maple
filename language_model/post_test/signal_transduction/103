zzso zzso are important regulators of zzso signaling and, consequently, important regulators of many zzso and zzso zzso Research over the last zzso years has clearly demonstrated that individual zzso zzso can be connected with disparate cellular zzso indicating the presence of a sophisticated regulatory network for zzso and zzso acid signaling through the regulation of individual zzso zzso This review presents the progress on the characterization of a primarily zzso zzso zzso and examines current data on the primary structure, regulation and potential cellular functions of this zzso
