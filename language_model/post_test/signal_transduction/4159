The zzso factors zzso and zzso bind zzso and zzso promoter zzso respectively, and are essential for the cell cycle progression of zzso zzso through the control of zzso zzso gene zzso We isolated a gene zzso zzso Response regulator in zzso able to activate either zzso or zzso promoter elements on a reporter zzso which, when zzso can bypass the normally essential requirement for zzso and zzso by the stimulation of zzso and zzso zzso In the case of zzso at least, this expression depends upon the zzso and zzso promoter zzso In zzso zzso the disruption of zzso has no apparent zzso but under conditions where the activities of zzso and zzso are reduced, zzso becomes zzso Our data imply the existence of a third zzso affecting zzso zzso zzso is the same gene as zzso which has significant sequence zzso to the receiver zzso found in response regulator proteins from the bacterial zzso signal zzso zzso zzso is thought to affect cell wall structure, and when highly zzso we find that zzso is lethal perhaps because of zzso in cell wall zzso The zzso is partially rescued by genes from the protein zzso C pathway, but genetic data imply that zzso and protein zzso C are not in the same zzso Our results suggest that zzso can influence the expression of zzso and zzso gene expression in budding zzso perhaps including genes involved in cell wall zzso via a zzso signal zzso zzso which activates zzso in response to an unidentified zzso
