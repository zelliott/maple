zzso zzso the major active component of marijuana, has a beneficial effect on the cardiovascular system during stress conditions, but the zzso mechanism is still zzso The present study was designed to investigate the central zzso and the peripheral zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso and possible function in the zzso of zzso from zzso zzso of zzso that were grown in zzso with zzso - 10 zzso zzso for 24 h prevented zzso zzso zzso zzso leakage and preserved the zzso distribution of zzso zzso The zzso for the zzso (10 zzso but not zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso abolished the protective effect of zzso In agreement with these results using zzso it was shown that zzso cardiac cells express zzso but not zzso zzso zzso of NO in the signal zzso zzso activated by zzso through zzso was zzso It was found that zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso production by induction of NO zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso prevented the zzso provided by zzso Taken together, our findings suggest that zzso protects cardiac cells against zzso via zzso zzso zzso by induction of NO zzso An NO mechanism occurs also in the classical zzso process; therefore, zzso probably zzso the zzso to hypoxic zzso
