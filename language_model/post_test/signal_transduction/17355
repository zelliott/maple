Aging is associated with a gradual decline in skeletal muscle mass and strength leading to increased risk for functional zzso Although zzso rates of protein synthesis and degradation are largely unaffected with age, the sensitivity of older muscle cells to the anabolic actions of essential zzso acids appears to zzso The major zzso through which essential zzso acids induce anabolic responses involves the zzso target of zzso zzso Complex 1, a signaling zzso that is especially sensitive to regulation by the zzso chain zzso acid zzso Recent evidence suggests that muscle of older individuals require increasing zzso of zzso to maintain robust anabolic responses through the zzso zzso While the exact mechanisms for the age-related zzso in nutritional signaling through the zzso zzso remain zzso there is increasing evidence that decreased sensitivity to insulin action, reductions in zzso function, and increased zzso stress may be underlying factors in this decrease in anabolic zzso zzso adequate nutrition, including sources of high quality zzso and promoting regular physical activity will remain among the frontline defenses against the onset of zzso in older zzso
