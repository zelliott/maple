Despite numerous recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso zzso zzso and degradation in response to growth factor zzso relatively little is known about zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation zzso In a screen for proteins that might regulate the trafficking or zzso of the zzso zzso we have identified a zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso protein that interacts with the zzso tail of the zzso in an zzso zzso We have named this protein zzso for zzso zzso degradation zzso Northern zzso reveals ubiquitous distribution of zzso in human adult zzso but message is particularly prominent in heart, brain, and skeletal zzso zzso interacts specifically with the zzso receptors zzso and zzso and not with zzso growth factor zzso or zzso When zzso in zzso cells, zzso mediates the zzso of zzso from the cell surface to zzso compartments and zzso the suppression of zzso and zzso zzso levels but not zzso growth factor zzso or zzso zzso A putative zzso form of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso breast tumor zzso Our observations suggest that zzso may act to regulate zzso cell surface zzso zzso levels, thereby influencing the efficiency of zzso zzso
