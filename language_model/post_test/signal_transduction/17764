zzso plasticity has a central role in nearly all models of learning and zzso Besides experiments documenting changes in synaptic function during learning, most of the evidence supporting a role for synaptic plasticity in memory comes from zzso that either enhance or zzso synaptic zzso In the last decade, mouse zzso zzso outs and zzso have provided compelling evidence that the molecular mechanisms responsible for the induction and stability of synaptic changes have a critical role in the acquisition and storage of zzso Here, I will review this literature, with a special focus on studies of zzso learning and zzso
