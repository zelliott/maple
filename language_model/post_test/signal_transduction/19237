Resident tissue zzso zzso continually survey the zzso ingesting zzso and presenting them on their surface for recognition by T zzso Because these zzso can be either host zzso or zzso zzso must be able to distinguish whether a particular zzso should provoke an immune response or be zzso However, the mechanisms that determine whether zzso promote or inhibit T cell zzso are not well zzso To investigate this, we first determined the mechanism by which zzso resident zzso zzso suppress in zzso T cell proliferation in the absence of pathogens and then explored the effects of different zzso molecules on zzso zzso Our results suggest that, in response to zzso which is zzso by zzso T cells, resident zzso zzso acquire zzso properties that are zzso by zzso However, zzso of zzso with zzso or zzso but not zzso or zzso eliminates their zzso properties, in part via the induction of zzso zzso These results suggest zzso zzso that activate zzso and consequently induce zzso but not those that exclusively signal through zzso abrogate the zzso properties of zzso and thus promote T cell expansion and elimination of invading zzso
