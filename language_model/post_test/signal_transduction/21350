The molecular zzso zzso is required for the folding and zzso of a large number of zzso zzso These are involved in essential cellular processes ranging from signal zzso to viral zzso For the zzso of its zzso zzso binds and zzso zzso which is the key driving force for zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso of zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso In addition, there is a transient zzso zzso of the two zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso structure is thought to be the zzso zzso zzso is a slow zzso with a turnover number of 1 zzso for the zzso zzso A key question for understanding the molecular mechanism of zzso is how zzso zzso is regulated and linked to zzso zzso In this study, we analyzed the zzso process structurally and zzso with a view to identify the zzso limitations of the zzso reaction zzso We showed that the first 24 zzso acids stabilize the zzso domain in a rigid zzso Their removal zzso flexibility specifically to the region between zzso acids 98 and zzso Most surprisingly, the deletion of this structure results in the complete loss of zzso activity and in increased zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso show that this rigid lid acts as an intrinsic kinetic inhibitor of the zzso zzso cycle preventing zzso zzso in the ground zzso On the other hand, this structure acts, in concert with the 24 zzso zzso acids of the other zzso domain, to form an activated zzso and thus regulates the turnover number of zzso
