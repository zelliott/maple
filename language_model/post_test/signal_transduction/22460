It is well known that sonic zzso signaling zzso plays a vital role during early embryonic zzso It is also responsible for stem cell renewal and development of several zzso like zzso and breast zzso and major brain tumors as zzso and zzso The role of sonic zzso signaling in the development of zzso has not been thoroughly zzso In this study, we attempted to determine the expression of zzso stem cell marker and of zzso zzso downstream target genes zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso protein patched zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso paired box gene 6 zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso and zzso interacting protein zzso in 11 zzso cell lines and 41 zzso zzso Also, zzso of the zzso was performed genetically by zzso zzso zzso or chemically by zzso After zzso low transcript expression was detected in downstream target genes like zzso in the cell zzso We further zzso promoter zzso studies of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes by melting curve zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed no zzso in zzso zzso gene promoter in zzso samples or in cell zzso one cell line zzso showed zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines and zzso zzso zzso samples showed zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines and zzso zzso samples showed zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest the possibility of two levels of control of the sonic zzso signaling zzso zzso and zzso which might offer new therapeutic possibilities to zzso the zzso and try to suppress tumor zzso
