This study investigated regulation of zzso calcium channels zzso by zzso zzso in rabbit portal vein zzso zzso currents were recorded using 5 zzso zzso as charge zzso zzso (10 zzso increased peak currents by zzso This effect was not reversed by the selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but was blocked by the zzso zzso zzso zzso (5 zzso The classical and novel protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso abolished zzso responses, whereas the classical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had no zzso zzso responses were also abolished by the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso (20 zzso by the zzso inhibitor zzso (10 zzso (but not the inactive analogue zzso and by zzso cells with an zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso had significantly greater currents than control zzso Current enhancement persisted in the presence of zzso suggesting that zzso is downstream of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased currents by zzso This effect was abolished by zzso C and reduced by zzso The zzso response was also reduced by zzso and the zzso component was blocked by zzso In zzso these data suggest that zzso enhances zzso currents via zzso receptors that couple zzso to zzso zzso a novel zzso and zzso zzso stimulates the novel zzso zzso along with a second zzso that is independent of zzso and involves a classical zzso
