Philadelphia zzso zzso leukemia is characterized by the zzso fusion protein that affects a wide range of signal zzso zzso The knowledge about its downstream target genes is, however, still quite zzso To identify novel zzso genes we used global gene expression profiling of several zzso and zzso cell lines treated with zzso Following zzso treatment, the zzso cells showed decreased growth, zzso and reduced zzso of zzso and zzso In total, 142 genes were identified as being dependent on zzso zzso mainly including genes involved in signal zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and insulin signaling zzso and in regulation of zzso Interestingly, zzso was found to activate several genes involved in negative feedback regulation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which may act to indirectly suppress the tumor promoting effects exerted by zzso In addition, several genes identified as zzso upon zzso expression could be assigned to the zzso and zzso signaling zzso as well as to reflect the zzso adjustments needed for rapidly growing zzso Apart from providing important zzso insights into zzso zzso the present study also provides a number of zzso genes that may provide attractive targets for future development of targeted zzso This article contains zzso zzso available at zzso
