In 2000, fishermen reported the appearance of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso from Lake zzso zzso Despite intensive zzso the causes of these abnormalities remain zzso Using gene expression zzso we sought to identify candidate genes and zzso processes possibly associated with the observed zzso zzso in order to gain insights into potential zzso Using in zzso zzso zzso we compared the expression levels at zzso unique transcript zzso in liver and head kidney tissue of male zzso with zzso and normally developed zzso zzso The fish had been collected on zzso sites of two genetically distinct zzso forms of Lake zzso We contrasted the gene expression profiles of 56 individuals, zzso 14 individuals of each zzso and of each zzso zzso analysis revealed weak expression differences between normal and zzso fish, and only one zzso zzso was found to be zzso in head kidney tissue of zzso fish from both zzso forms, However, this difference could not be confirmed with quantitative real-time zzso zzso analysis on the level of zzso processes revealed zzso the involvement of immune response genes in both zzso particularly those linked to complement zzso in the liver, zzso zzso in the liver and zzso zzso activity and Ras protein signal zzso in the head zzso In comparison with current literature, this gene expression pattern signals a chronic zzso disease in the zzso Based on the recent observations that zzso zzso are induced through feeding of zzso from Lake zzso we zzso that a zzso accumulated in zzso via the zzso triggering zzso as the likely cause of zzso zzso We propose several experimental strategies to verify or reject this zzso
