Many lines of evidence show that zzso contain zzso zzso zzso that are different from the rest of the membrane in specific zzso and protein zzso In several biological systems, they were shown to be necessary for trafficking and signal zzso Here, we investigate if zzso zzso have a role in the regulation of the G zzso zzso underlying zzso zzso zzso zzso contain zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are found in raft and zzso portions of the zzso zzso zzso is found exclusively in the zzso Distribution of these proteins does not change in the light or zzso In contrast, the G protein zzso the zzso complex, and the zzso zzso of zzso undergo dramatic zzso to the raft upon zzso zzso of zzso occurs exclusively in the zzso zzso or zzso toxin prevent the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso whereas zzso zzso causes both proteins to move to the raft in the zzso This shows that the zzso complex has the highest affinity to zzso in the transition state of the zzso zzso binds to zzso at a significantly slower rate in the zzso indicating that this zzso results in a reduced zzso zzso Thus, an external signal can rearrange components of a G protein zzso in specific zzso of the cell zzso changing its signaling zzso These findings could reveal a novel mechanism zzso by the cells for regulation of G zzso signal zzso
