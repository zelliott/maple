Previous work from our laboratory and others has established that zzso zzso zzso zzso is central to the regulation of zzso zzso With no zzso zzso zzso zzso has also been implicated in the regulation of zzso activity through upstream zzso of zzso Because previous studies from our laboratory also demonstrated a zzso interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso we explore here the possibility that zzso is another component of the regulation of zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso markedly inhibited zzso activity under zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of key zzso in the zzso domain of zzso revealed that the zzso activity does not play a role in the suppression of zzso zzso However, zzso of the two zzso motifs in zzso completely zzso this zzso As protein zzso 1 zzso also plays a central role in the zzso and zzso of zzso we investigated the possibility that zzso interacts with the zzso We identified a zzso zzso motif in zzso and demonstrated interaction using zzso zzso zzso of a key zzso zzso zzso within this motif prevented zzso zzso Furthermore, the physical interaction between zzso and zzso was required for zzso of zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our data are consistent with zzso indirectly zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso by scaffolding an zzso zzso in proximity to a zzso zzso
