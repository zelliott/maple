zzso injected neural precursor cells zzso were unexpectedly shown to reach the cerebral zzso and induce recovery in various diffuse brain zzso including animal models of multiple zzso However, the molecular mechanisms supporting zzso migration across brain zzso remain zzso Brain zzso constitutes the zzso barrier, which uniquely controls the access of drugs and trafficking of cells, including zzso from the blood to the zzso Taking advantage of the availability of in zzso models of human and rat zzso barrier developed in our laboratory and validated by us and others, we show here that soluble zzso acid, the major zzso of the zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso blocking zzso largely prevents zzso zzso to and migration across brain zzso in inflammatory zzso We present further evidence that zzso surprisingly, induce the formation of zzso cups at the surface of brain zzso cells, enriched in zzso and other zzso zzso thus zzso the zzso signaling recently shown to be involved in zzso zzso These results demonstrate the pivotal role of zzso in the zzso migration of zzso across brain zzso zzso we propose that they may help design new strategies for the delivery of therapeutic zzso to the brain by systemic zzso
