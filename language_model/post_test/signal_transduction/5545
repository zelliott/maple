zzso zzso B zzso is known to mediate a number of biological responses to insulin and growth factors, its role in zzso zzso being one of the most extensively zzso In this work, we have employed a recently described zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso to clarify the role of zzso in zzso metabolism in zzso subject that has received less zzso zzso of primary rat and zzso zzso with zzso resulted in zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in response to insulin, without affecting upstream insulin signaling zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was required for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and for the zzso action of zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso activity resulted in a reduction in de zzso zzso synthesis and in the ability of insulin to stimulate this zzso The regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by insulin through zzso of zzso which is a target for zzso protein zzso zzso was dependent on the presence of active zzso Finally, zzso was shown to be zzso by zzso on zzso in response to insulin, and this was associated with a reduction in zzso zzso In zzso we propose that zzso is required for the positive effects of insulin on zzso storage and that regulation of zzso and zzso by zzso is important for these zzso
