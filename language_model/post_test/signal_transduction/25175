zzso are a family of structurally and functionally related proteins that regulate zzso survival during zzso In the peripheral nervous system zzso both in zzso and in zzso studies have shown that zzso are potent factors for the survival of various sensory zzso and sympathetic zzso However, it is not clear whether all zzso zzso are zzso In the central nervous system zzso studies using injury models show that zzso promote the survival of zzso zzso But mice lacking individual zzso or a combination of zzso and zzso did not show significant zzso zzso zzso Here we derived mice lacking three zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to study the effect of triple zzso zzso on peripheral and central zzso These zzso mice did not nurse and died within 12 hours after zzso zzso cell counts showed that triple zzso zzso lacked most of their peripheral sensory zzso and had a statistically significant reduction of motor zzso in several motor zzso Our results suggest that zzso are essential for the survival of most peripheral sensory zzso and affect the survival of a small portion of motor zzso during zzso
