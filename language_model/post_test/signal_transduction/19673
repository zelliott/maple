Recent zzso association zzso studies have identified several novel genetic zzso associated with age at zzso and age at natural zzso However, the stringent significance threshold used in zzso studies potentially led to false zzso and true associations may have been zzso zzso biologically relevant information, we examined whether common genetic zzso in candidate genes of nine groups of biologically plausible pathways and related zzso are associated with age at zzso and age at natural zzso A total of zzso zzso and zzso single zzso zzso zzso in zzso genes were assessed for their associations with these two traits among a total of zzso women from the zzso Health Study zzso N zzso zzso and the Women's Genome Health Study zzso N zzso zzso Linear zzso was used to assess the marginal association of each zzso with each zzso We adjusted for multiple testing within each gene to identify statistically significant zzso associations at the gene zzso To evaluate the overall evidence for an excess of statistically significant gene associations over the proportion expected by chance, we applied a zzso test of proportion to each group of candidate zzso The zzso metabolism and zzso zzso was found significantly associated with both age at zzso and age at natural menopause zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the group of genes associated with precocious or delayed zzso was found significantly associated with age at zzso zzso zzso zzso and the group of genes involved in premature zzso failure with age at menopause zzso zzso zzso
