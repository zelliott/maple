The zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso plays a role in prostate and breast cancer, although its precise function has not been zzso In prostate cancer, zzso is involved in regulating zzso zzso expression via interaction with the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso by zzso agents has been associated with reduced zzso zzso We now report that reduced expression of zzso leads to a zzso change, increased migration and zzso in prostate cancer cells, reminiscent of transforming growth factor beta zzso function and zzso zzso Indeed, zzso of zzso expression triggers a zzso program of genes involved in the zzso pathway, migration, invasion, zzso and zzso zzso Our results establish zzso as a critical regulator of genes involved in cell zzso invasion, and zzso of prostate cancer zzso
