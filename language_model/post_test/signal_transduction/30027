The rat zzso zzso zzso gene encodes a G zzso zzso zzso zzso which possesses zzso zzso zzso zzso To characterize this activity further, we generated a series of point and deletion zzso of zzso Both expression of and zzso by the zzso was zzso Several point zzso were generated that contained modifications in the zzso zzso This zzso at zzso zzso of zzso is the counterpart of the common zzso motif of zzso which is known to be involved in G protein zzso We found that zzso of the zzso zzso within the zzso motif of zzso zzso to zzso acid resulted in a zzso zzso with similar zzso characteristics to the zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso is not the zzso of zzso activity of zzso Interestingly, a zzso carrying an zzso at zzso 130 zzso was severely impaired in zzso zzso zzso of zzso C, whereas it displayed similar levels of activity to zzso in zzso zzso Another protein that contained a modified zzso zzso zzso did not show zzso activity, whereas zzso zzso and zzso displayed similar activities to the zzso zzso This indicated that zzso zzso is critical for zzso function in zzso whereas zzso is zzso Finally, we identified two consecutive zzso within the zzso tails of both zzso and its zzso from human zzso zzso which are important for correct zzso expression of these zzso
