Our studies on the alpha zzso signaling have demonstrated that the zzso family is a signal zzso We report here that a zzso zzso C zzso is the zzso in this signal zzso The zzso was isolated by zzso a zzso complex which was induced in the bovine liver zzso zzso with zzso and zzso The zzso displayed a marked preference zzso for zzso zzso over other zzso at zzso zzso zzso of zzso with the alpha zzso and zzso zzso into zzso zzso resulted in a lowered zzso requirement for the zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso when the zzso was activated with the alpha zzso The formation of zzso zzso was hormone concentration dependent and reached zzso within 3 zzso which was faster than the formation in the presence of the alpha zzso An zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso of zzso C activity in the presence of zzso gamma zzso but not in the presence of zzso or zzso showing the association of zzso with the zzso of zzso zzso Thus, our novel approaches to identify the zzso involved in the alpha zzso zzso as well as the zzso studies, substantially demonstrate that the alpha zzso zzso signaling involves the zzso family and a zzso zzso
