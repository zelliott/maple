zzso infected zzso and zzso are zzso viral reservoirs persistently producing viral zzso zzso infection extends the life span of zzso by promoting the zzso zzso of the zzso cell survival zzso zzso various zzso also display the zzso zzso for long-term cell survival and zzso and zzso zzso have been extensively searched as zzso zzso This led us to investigate whether zzso zzso could antagonize long-term survival and zzso zzso of zzso infected zzso 

Here, we examined the effect of one such class of drugs, zzso zzso on cell death and zzso zzso signals in human zzso and a human zzso cell line, zzso infected with zzso zzso or zzso with zzso zzso zzso Our findings revealed that the zzso zzso and zzso specifically induced the death of zzso infected primary human zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, these two compounds reduced zzso of both zzso and zzso a downstream zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Additionally, we observed that zzso effectively reduced viral production in zzso infected primary human zzso These observations demonstrate that the zzso compounds tested are able to promote cell death in both zzso infected zzso and zzso expressing zzso cells by zzso the action of the zzso pathway, ultimately restricting viral production from the infected zzso 

This study suggests that zzso zzso such as zzso compounds, may serve as potential zzso agents specifically targeting zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
