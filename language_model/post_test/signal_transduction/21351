We have zzso zzso expressed sequence tags from laser capture zzso adult mouse gastric and small zzso zzso zzso obtaining zzso and zzso unique zzso zzso Using Gene zzso zzso terms, each data set was compared with zzso libraries from intact adult stomach and small zzso Genes in GO categories enriched in zzso were filtered against genes in GO categories represented in zzso zzso and embryonic stem cell zzso and mapped onto zzso factor networks, plus zzso signal zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth zzso vascular zzso growth factor, zzso and zzso acid zzso signaling zzso plus zzso fatty acid, and zzso acid zzso pathways are among those prominently represented in adult gut zzso The results reveal shared as well as distinctive features of adult gut stem cells when compared with other stem cell zzso
