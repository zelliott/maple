zzso zzso 1 zzso protein shares zzso with zzso zzso but lacks a critical zzso zzso Thus it is unclear whether it is able to interact with zzso in zzso Unlike zzso zzso have a single zzso zzso allowing a simple in zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso 

Here we show that zzso zzso can regulate zzso leading to altered cellular distribution of zzso itself and zzso expression of zzso target zzso The resulting adult zzso are indicative of reduced zzso function and are enhanced by zzso zzso confirming that zzso action is zzso In addition, cells expressing an alternative zzso zzso exhibit zzso in cell size, functions previously not attributed to zzso suggesting that zzso might also act via an alternative zzso 

Our results demonstrate that zzso can regulate the zzso zzso despite its zzso zzso
