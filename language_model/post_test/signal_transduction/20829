We previously demonstrated that zzso growth factor zzso zzso a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso activity and the zzso level of zzso zzso in cultured zzso human zzso zzso zzso of cell cultures with ultraviolet B zzso radiation resulted in a reduction of zzso zzso zzso To determine whether zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso cells were zzso with 20 zzso zzso or zzso and then incubated with 100 zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso entirely blocked the zzso induction of zzso zzso Since the binding of zzso to its plasma membrane zzso is the first step in initiating a biological response, the effect of zzso on zzso binding was zzso zzso treatment of cultured zzso resulted in an immediate and zzso reduction of zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the reduction of zzso binding was due to a zzso decrease in the number of available zzso from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso However, zzso decreased the zzso affinity very little zzso zzso zzso zzso in control and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso did not alter the rate of zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso blocks the signal zzso zzso of zzso that is involved in regulation of zzso gene zzso zzso analysis of extracts from zzso cells showed that zzso induced zzso zzso of zzso and that the quantity of zzso protein was unaffected by zzso zzso zzso of zzso may be responsible for decreased binding of zzso to its zzso
