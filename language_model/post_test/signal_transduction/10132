zzso stem zzso cells rely on growth factors provided by zzso cells or zzso to maintain their zzso In order to identify such factors, we have established zzso of zzso zzso cells which exhibit variable ability in supporting zzso cell zzso zzso screening identifies zzso and zzso as zzso zzso factors that zzso inhibit zzso cell differentiation in a zzso zzso Furthermore, direct zzso of zzso without disturbing the upstream components of the zzso zzso fully zzso the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso the zzso for zzso a known regulator of zzso cell zzso in the zzso Finally, zzso is able to mimic the serum effect to act zzso with zzso proteins to inhibit zzso cell zzso zzso our study reveals part of the molecular mechanisms by which the zzso zzso acts to prevent zzso cell differentiation through convergence on the zzso zzso at the level of zzso
