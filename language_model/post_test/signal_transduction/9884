Previous studies have reported that female gender zzso zzso against zzso zzso injury, partly because zzso activates zzso zzso zzso We have previously proven that zzso of zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso in male zzso The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the zzso of zzso zzso is influenced by zzso and the role of zzso zzso in such gender zzso 

zzso hearts from zzso male and female zzso rats were subjected to zzso for 40 zzso and zzso for 2 h in the zzso apparatus, and were randomly assigned to the following groups: no zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was performed with administration of zzso zzso at the first 10 zzso of zzso Left zzso developed pressure zzso left zzso zzso pressure zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso release were zzso zzso size was detected by zzso zzso zzso The protein expression of total zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined by Western zzso 

The zzso group showed lower zzso and higher zzso than zzso group in the same gender during zzso zzso The zzso release and zzso size were smaller in the female zzso group zzso zzso zzso versus male zzso zzso zzso zzso markedly improved left zzso function and decreased zzso zzso size in the male zzso group zzso zzso zzso versus male zzso zzso but not in the female zzso zzso zzso abolished the zzso of zzso zzso in the male zzso group zzso zzso zzso versus male zzso group), and markedly increased the zzso size and zzso and decreased zzso in female zzso The zzso protein expression was no significant difference in all zzso The ratio of zzso expression in the male zzso group was a little lower than that in the female zzso group, but there was no statistical zzso In male rats, the ratio of zzso was no difference between zzso and zzso group, but it was higher in zzso group than that in zzso group zzso zzso zzso In female rats, the level of zzso was markedly increased by zzso which was markedly higher than that in male zzso group zzso zzso zzso However, zzso was not different between zzso and zzso zzso zzso decreased the zzso expression in both male and female zzso 

It is concluded that female rat hearts showed greater resistance to zzso injury, and zzso zzso developed zzso in male rats but not in female zzso The zzso zzso may be involved in the zzso by both zzso zzso and zzso
