This review summarizes recent progress in understanding of zzso and zzso function in the regulation of zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso growth factors zzso zzso and zzso 

The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso protein and functions as an zzso zzso which extends lifespan when zzso and zzso the development of zzso zzso when disrupted in zzso zzso is a zzso hormone that regulates zzso and vitamin D zzso It has been shown that zzso mice and zzso knockout mice exhibit identical zzso This observation led to the identification of zzso as a zzso essential for the interaction between zzso and zzso growth factor zzso In addition to the zzso zzso recent studies have shown that zzso a zzso family zzso also functions as a zzso required for zzso and zzso signaling and determines zzso zzso activities of zzso and zzso 

Recent mouse genetic studies have broadened our understanding of molecular pathways involved in mineral and zzso acid zzso regulated by zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso requires the zzso gene family of zzso proteins for their zzso zzso Further investigations on zzso axes zzso by the zzso family and zzso zzso members are expected to provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which the zzso zzso growth factors regulate zzso acid, energy, and zzso D zzso
