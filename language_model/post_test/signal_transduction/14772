zzso complexes zzso by zzso interactions are essential for many cellular zzso zzso growth factor zzso signaling involves a cascade of zzso interactions and malfunctioning of this zzso has been implicated in human zzso Using an in zzso approach, we analyzed the naturally occurring human genetic variations from the proteins involved in the zzso signaling (10 zzso proteins and 242 other proteins interacting with them) to identify the ones that have potential biological zzso All proteins were searched in the zzso database for the presence of zzso single zzso zzso zzso A total of 118 validated zzso from 63 proteins were retrieved and analyzed in terms of 1) evolutionary conservation status, 2) being located in a functional protein domain or zzso and 3) altering putative protein motif or zzso zzso Our results indicated the presence of 31 zzso that occurred at zzso zzso zzso 37 zzso were located in protein zzso zzso or repeats, and 46 zzso were predicted to either create or abolish putative protein motifs or zzso zzso We undertook this study to analyze the human genetic variations that can affect the protein function and the zzso zzso The zzso reported in here can be characterized by experimental approaches to zzso their exact biological roles and whether they are related to human zzso
