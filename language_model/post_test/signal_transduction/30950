zzso zzso is the major regulator of zzso proliferation and survival of zzso zzso but the zzso changes in gene expression that lead to these effects are not fully zzso The aim of this study was to examine how zzso via zzso of zzso zzso zzso exerts its role in the development of zzso zzso from zzso cells, and to identify early zzso target genes in human zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso alone was able to induce cell cycle progression as demonstrated by zzso of zzso zzso E and A leading to zzso of the zzso protein zzso These effects were completely zzso by the zzso inhibitor zzso Furthermore, enforced expression of an activated form of zzso zzso highly zzso zzso zzso zzso cell sorting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso in the presence or absence of zzso were subjected to gene expression zzso Several novel target genes of zzso were identified, and the majority were regulated in a zzso manner, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso showed that the increased zzso expression of zzso and zzso was accompanied by an induction of the corresponding proteins zzso and zzso
