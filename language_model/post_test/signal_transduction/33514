zzso signaling by zzso zzso mediates a widely expressed form of long-term depression at zzso and zzso zzso zzso involving a reduction in neurotransmitter zzso In the zzso zzso occurs at zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and its induction requires a zzso reduction of zzso signaling resulting from minutes of type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso Although repetitive activity of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso required for zzso it is unclear whether zzso zzso terminals are passive targets of zzso or whether they actively contribute to zzso Here, we show that the zzso induction period for zzso may serve as a window to integrate associated spontaneous activity in the same IN receiving the retrograde zzso zzso Indeed, reducing spontaneous IN firing blocked zzso which could be rescued with extra stimulation of zzso zzso Moreover, cell pair recordings showed that a single IN expressed zzso onto a PC only if it was active during zzso zzso Several methods of zzso zzso zzso dynamics all blocked zzso strongly suggesting that IN spikes regulate zzso by raising zzso at the nerve zzso Finally, zzso the zzso zzso zzso fully blocked zzso but blocking another zzso did zzso Our findings support a model where both zzso signaling and IN activity shift the balance of zzso and zzso activity in the zzso terminal to induce zzso
