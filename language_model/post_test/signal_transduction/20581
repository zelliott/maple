The zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso were originally identified as zzso of the zzso zzso complex 2 zzso and as zzso of signaling by the zzso second zzso zzso zzso in budding zzso zzso zzso More recently, these proteins have been identified as critical zzso that facilitate zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso Here, we review the molecular basis for this regulation as well as place it within the context of recent findings that have revealed zzso and zzso zzso of zzso is coupled to the zzso of complex zzso and to their levels within the plasma membrane zzso as well as other forms of PM zzso Together, these studies reveal the existence of an intricate zzso feedback zzso zzso the activity of these signaling components is linked to the zzso of PM lipids according to cellular zzso
