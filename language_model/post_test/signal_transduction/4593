zzso liver diseases with zzso duct injury and zzso zzso account for a significant percentage of patients with zzso liver disease and undergoing liver zzso A number of different animal models have been established and have added substantially to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this group of chronic liver zzso In the present review, we discuss recent findings and new insight derived from different animal models of zzso tract injury and zzso 

zzso do not undergo zzso to zzso transition and do not contribute to the pool of zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso Rather zzso can acquire a zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso is controlled by a zzso axis playing a crucial role in the zzso response to zzso duct injury and zzso The nuclear zzso B and zzso signaling pathways play a critical role in zzso liver injury and the emergence of liver zzso Nuclear receptors are key zzso of zzso response mechanisms in zzso and potential zzso zzso 

Recent progress and zzso insights from mouse models have added to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso liver and zzso tract injury and pointed to new therapeutic zzso
