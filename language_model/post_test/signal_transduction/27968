zzso of the innate immune system engulf invading zzso into plasma zzso zzso called zzso zzso formed zzso gradually acquire zzso properties by a maturation process which involves sequential and coordinated rounds of fusion with zzso and zzso zzso Some pathogens interfere with this maturation sequence and thereby evade killing by the immune cells, managing to survive zzso as zzso zzso seem to be intimately involved in the processes of zzso formation and zzso and initial observations suggest that the ability of some zzso to survive zzso is associated with zzso in zzso zzso This chapter presents a brief overview of zzso in cells of the immune system, their metabolism in the context of zzso and zzso maturation and their possible zzso during infectious zzso
