zzso zzso zzso is differentiated regionally for regulating zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in underlying smooth muscle by signaling via zzso oxide and zzso zzso zzso activity is just zzso to the zzso arch and diminishes zzso The same differentiation pattern is reported here for a third and novel signal zzso zzso conversion of zzso to zzso zzso segments of rat zzso incubated in zzso convert zzso to a major zzso zzso identified as zzso Net synthesis of zzso is greatest in zzso segments of the zzso zzso significant quantities are also observed in the zzso zzso and lung but very little in 10 additional zzso zzso cells cultured from mouse brain, human zzso zzso or bovine zzso and human peripheral blood zzso also form zzso When zzso segments are zzso of zzso treatment with zzso in the presence of zzso significantly increases the zzso zzso A number of zzso derivatives inhibit the zzso conversion and decrease the zzso content in zzso segments in zzso
