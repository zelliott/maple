zzso cell zzso zzso factor zzso a distant member of the transforming growth zzso zzso was originally zzso and cloned as a potent survival factor for zzso zzso zzso Some studies have characterized the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso but its regulatory mechanisms have yet to be well zzso especially under zzso zzso In this study, we used a pharmacological approach to study the expression of the rat zzso gene induced by zzso zzso in primary cultures of zzso zzso zzso a blocker of nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso did not apparently affect zzso zzso gene zzso whereas it attenuated the zzso of zzso genes via zzso zzso zzso zzso In primary zzso cultures, zzso increased the zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in primary zzso cultures, it enhanced zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Of the several zzso zzso zzso tested, a zzso inhibitor blocked zzso zzso zzso in primary cultures of zzso but not of zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso through an zzso independent pathway, and that zzso is responsible for zzso zzso zzso in primary cultures of zzso
