The zzso protein zzso has been shown to function in roles unrelated to zzso in a variety of cell zzso We have previously reported that loss of zzso expression alters zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression via an zzso zzso Here we show that zzso is required for zzso to maintain expression of a variety of zzso zzso zzso Using zzso real-time zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso genes coding for zzso cartilage zzso proteins including collagen II, collagen IX, zzso and link zzso The decrease in zzso level of these zzso transcripts results, in part, from decreased zzso stability in zzso zzso zzso regulation is also likely involved because zzso with decreased zzso levels show decreased expression of zzso a zzso factor necessary for expressing the major cartilage zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso expressing zzso have a stable zzso when subjected to loss of serum factor zzso These cells maintain high levels of zzso as well as the zzso targets collagen II and zzso These results suggest that zzso is involved in a zzso important for maintaining a stable zzso zzso
