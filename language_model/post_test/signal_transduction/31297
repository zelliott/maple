Gene zzso signal zzso and zzso networks are major areas of interest in the newly emerging field of systems zzso In living cells, zzso dynamics play an important zzso however, the kinetic parameters of zzso reactions necessary for zzso these processes are often not accessible directly through zzso The problem of zzso zzso reaction zzso from zzso count data measured, with error, at discrete time points is zzso For zzso the system, a hidden zzso process is used, where the hidden states are the true zzso counts, and the transitions between those states zzso to reaction events following zzso of zzso Two different zzso are proposed for zzso the unknown model zzso The first is an approximate maximum likelihood method that gives good estimates of the reaction parameters in systems with few possible reactions in each sampling zzso The second algorithm, treating the data as exact zzso zzso the number of reactions in each sampling zzso by solving a simple linear zzso zzso the likelihood based on these approximations can provide good results, even in complex reaction zzso
