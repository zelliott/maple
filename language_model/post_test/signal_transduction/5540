To evaluate the relationship of hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and growth factor zzso zzso growth factor zzso human zzso growth factor zzso 2) expression with disease progression in zzso zzso 

zzso was performed on tissue zzso using standard zzso zzso between groups were evaluated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso between tumor stage and zzso expression were determined by linear trend zzso 

Compared with normal zzso zzso exhibited low zzso zzso alpha and zzso zzso expression (all P zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso beta expression increased in advanced stage disease zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso expression was lower in zzso compared with normal zzso zzso zzso zzso Human zzso growth factor zzso 2 expression was elevated and increased with disease progression zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso zzso zzso beta expression is elevated and increases with disease zzso whereas zzso zzso alpha and zzso zzso are zzso Human zzso growth factor zzso 2 expression is increased, whereas zzso growth factor zzso is lower than in normal zzso These data support a potential role for zzso zzso beta in disease progression via zzso with human zzso growth factor zzso zzso
