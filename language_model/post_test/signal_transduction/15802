In zzso zzso the zzso zzso mediates the termination of zzso and cryptic unstable transcripts zzso Both zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex interact with zzso zzso II zzso zzso during early zzso leading us to test whether these two processes are functionally zzso The deletion of zzso zzso the growth rate and termination defects of zzso zzso zzso is important for the appropriate recruitment of zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in the zzso region via the zzso zzso and zzso zzso complexes, both of which contain zzso finger proteins that bind zzso zzso Increased levels of zzso zzso reduce the efficiency of zzso zzso We speculate that zzso promotes proper early termination by the zzso complex by affecting the zzso of Pol II zzso in early zzso
