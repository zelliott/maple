The links between zzso health, sexual signals and mate choice are complex and subject to ongoing zzso In 1999, von zzso et zzso made the valuable suggestion that zzso stress may be an important missing piece of this complex zzso Their suggestion has been enthusiastically tested, with over 300 studies citing their paper, but most effort has concerned zzso (and to a lesser extent zzso visual signals, predominantly in birds and zzso Today, we know a great deal more about zzso stress and related zzso in both a pathological and regulatory sense, than we did in zzso We revisit von zzso et zzso predictions and, more importantly, highlight novel mechanisms that could link zzso stress with a range of energetically demanding signals, greatly increasing the scope from visual zzso systems that are usually discussed and nearly always zzso In particular, we argue that differences between individuals in their ability to regulate physiology related to zzso stress may be an important factor influencing the production of sexual signals and the costs that are incurred from zzso
