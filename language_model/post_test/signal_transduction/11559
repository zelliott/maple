zzso zzso B plays a critical role in the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulating cell growth, zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes were identified by zzso array zzso analysis using an zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso of zzso Genes zzso expressed in zzso cells treated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified at 3 and 20 zzso zzso zzso resulted in the repression of zzso early growth response 1 zzso transforming growth factor beta zzso III zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso induction is often associated with zzso zzso the zzso repression observed here is consistent with the zzso function of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso is consistent with the known zzso functions of zzso zzso genes were found to be largely distinct from zzso growth zzso zzso zzso only zzso zzso gene 51 zzso was induced in both zzso In contrast to their repression by zzso zzso zzso and zzso were induced by zzso indicating negative interference between elements upstream and downstream of zzso in the zzso signal zzso zzso
