Studies of many cell types show that levels of zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso are primarily controlled by zzso zzso degradation, zzso by zzso zzso zzso However, in the hypoxic niche of the zzso disc, the mechanism of zzso turnover in nucleus zzso cells is not yet zzso We show that in nucleus zzso cells zzso and zzso degradation was zzso through zzso zzso irrespective of oxygen zzso It is noteworthy that zzso degradation through zzso zzso was more pronounced in zzso Surprisingly, treatment with zzso a zzso zzso shows the zzso of only zzso and induction in activity of its target zzso but not of zzso Loss and gain of function analyses using zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of individual zzso show that in nucleus zzso cells only zzso played a limited role in zzso degradation; again zzso degradation was zzso We also show that the treatment with zzso of zzso zzso results in a strong zzso of zzso and to a much smaller extent of zzso zzso It is thus evident that in addition to zzso zzso degradation, the zzso turnover in nucleus zzso cells is primarily regulated by zzso zzso zzso our data clearly suggests that zzso degradation of zzso is not zzso by a classical zzso zzso zzso These results for the first time provide a rationale for the zzso stabilization as well as the maintenance of zzso levels of zzso and zzso in nucleus zzso zzso
