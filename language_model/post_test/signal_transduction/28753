An increasing body of evidence demonstrates that growth factor networks are highly interactive with zzso zzso signaling in the control of breast cancer zzso As such, tumor responses to zzso are likely to be a composite of the zzso zzso and growth zzso activity of these agents, with zzso in growth factor signaling providing a mechanism for the development of zzso zzso In this light, the current article focuses on illustrating the relationship between growth factor signaling and zzso failure in our in-house tumor models of breast cancer and describing how we are now beginning to successfully target growth factor activity to improve the effects of zzso drugs and to block aggressive disease zzso
