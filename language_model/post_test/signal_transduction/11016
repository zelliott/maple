Development of zzso a loss of sensitivity to zzso is associated with impaired zzso of peripheral sensory zzso in which zzso cells play a key role by zzso nerve growth factor zzso Recent clinical trials indicated that an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso in the zzso pathway, significantly improved zzso in diabetic zzso The fact that zzso is localized in zzso cells led us to investigate the role of the zzso zzso in zzso production of isolated zzso zzso Among various zzso factors zzso increased production of zzso was demonstrated in the cells treated with zzso zzso for 24 zzso zzso zzso production was significantly suppressed when cells were cultured in the medium containing high zzso In these cells, the levels of zzso zzso and zzso element binding protein zzso were reduced, whereas the level of activated nuclear zzso zzso was zzso These changes were abolished when an zzso inhibitor zzso was included in the zzso zzso zzso production was further attenuated in the cells treated with an inhibitor of zzso zzso Together, the enhanced zzso zzso activity under zzso conditions seems to elicit reduced zzso zzso production in zzso zzso zzso zzso stress linked to the zzso zzso activity may mediate this zzso
