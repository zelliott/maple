The effect of the zzso zzso injection of zzso zzso was evaluated using zzso behavioral tests in zzso zzso animals showed normal locomotion activity in a zzso environment and declined anxiety zzso in the elevated plus maze test and the shock zzso zzso The measurement of spontaneous locomotor activity in a novel environment also suggested that zzso reduced the stress zzso To zzso the regulatory mechanisms of the downstream signaling pathways underlying zzso activity and its relation to zzso and zzso behavior zzso zzso rat zzso responses were examined using a zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis software listed the zzso genes and they showed characteristic expression patterns in the rat zzso When zzso data sets for the same listed genes was analyzed using a zzso approach, the expressions of two zzso were found to have zzso One of these zzso zzso zzso exhibited increased expression in both the zzso and the zzso analysis, and a Western zzso analysis validated the mass zzso zzso A zzso data analysis is useful for predicting downstream signaling zzso and the zzso behavior of zzso may be zzso by an zzso signaling zzso in zzso These results suggest that zzso acts as an zzso zzso and that the downstream pathways zzso by its receptors may be potential candidates for the treatment of anxieties in the zzso
