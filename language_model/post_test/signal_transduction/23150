zzso hormone action on zzso stimulates in parallel two different zzso zzso zzso signaling branches zzso by protein zzso A and exchange protein activated by zzso zzso zzso 2A zzso Both pathways contribute toward zzso of zzso insulin zzso zzso However, the overall functional role of zzso in zzso as it relates to in zzso zzso zzso remains incompletely zzso zzso we have examined in zzso zzso in global zzso knockout zzso Additionally, we have conducted in zzso studies of zzso and calcium dynamics in isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso does not impact zzso in mice under zzso zzso However, when mice are exposed to zzso insulin resistance, zzso zzso stimulation of zzso with an zzso hormone zzso zzso analog or with a fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso 40 selective zzso zzso is required for the increased zzso response to zzso zzso Under these circumstances, zzso is required for zzso the early dynamic increase in zzso calcium levels after zzso zzso which is reflected in zzso zzso insulin zzso These studies broaden our understanding of zzso function and highlight its significance during increased zzso demand or drive on zzso Our findings advance the rationale for developing zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso in type 2 zzso
