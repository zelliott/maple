zzso zzso is conveyed by a large set of zzso zzso Their activity is controlled on long- and short-term zzso zzso regulation of zzso transport has to guarantee zzso and zzso molecular zzso and has to meet the actual cellular zzso zzso As transport activity depends not only on zzso zzso zzso of zzso or protein levels will not fully predict zzso zzso activity is also determined by zzso modifications zzso zzso zzso competition, and zzso zzso zzso The latter is a major target of short-term regulation of zzso zzso and involves rapid zzso and zzso of zzso zzso from and into the respective cell zzso In liver zzso cells, several signaling pathways were identified that govern these zzso however, the underlying molecular mechanisms still need to be zzso Different techniques have been employed in studies on zzso retrieval and zzso which are discussed in this zzso
