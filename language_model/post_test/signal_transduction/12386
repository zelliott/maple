zzso aberration of zzso is one of the major molecular characteristics of breast zzso However, the molecular changes associated with zzso signaling during different stages of breast cancer development have not been zzso In this study, complementary zzso and zzso technologies were used to profile the expression level of proteins in 4 zzso cell lines in the zzso model of breast cancer progression following a time course of zzso zzso A total of 80 proteins zzso from zzso 15 from zzso 2 common in zzso were identified to be zzso or zzso by zzso zzso Following zzso zzso the expression level of zzso a zzso that has been implicated in many human zzso was decreased in zzso normal breast zzso zzso cells, increased in zzso zzso and zzso low grade breast cancer cells, but showed no obvious difference in the zzso high grade cancer zzso The increase in zzso expression level following zzso treatment could also be observed in zzso cervical cancer zzso zzso increases of zzso expression levels in zzso breast cancer cells were zzso when zzso but not zzso was knocked zzso In addition, zzso of zzso diminished the proliferation of zzso zzso cells when compared to control zzso Taken together, our data suggested an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that has never been reported previously and that this zzso zzso during disease progression as modeled by the zzso zzso zzso of the novel relationship between zzso and zzso may contribute to an integrated understanding of the roles of these zzso factors during breast cancer zzso
