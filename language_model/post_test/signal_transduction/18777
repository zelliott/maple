Chemical random zzso techniques with the germ line zzso zzso zzso have been established to provide comprehensive collections of mouse models, which were then zzso and analyzed in zzso zzso Here, we applied zzso zzso in a zzso fashion for a zzso identification of new zzso zzso members of the large zzso of G zzso receptors zzso zzso type 3 zzso and type 4 zzso zzso and the orphan zzso zzso zzso were used as model targets to prove the feasibility of this zzso Parallel archives of DNA and zzso from mice zzso with zzso were screened for zzso in these zzso and in zzso zzso served as a zzso step before in zzso zzso was performed to generate the appropriate mouse zzso For example, mouse models for inherited obesity were established by selecting fully or partially zzso zzso in zzso Our technology described zzso has the potential to provide mouse models for a zzso dysfunction of choice within zzso zzso and can be extended to other gene classes of zzso
