Stem cell population size is highly regulated across species and tissue types, and zzso are associated with premature tissue failure or zzso We assessed whether the tumor zzso and zzso of cell contact zzso zzso plays a role in governing the zzso stem cell pool by stem zzso or zzso zzso zzso stem cells in zzso mice were increased in number and demonstrated a marked shift in location to the zzso These changes were entirely dependent on changes in the zzso with a marked increase in zzso bone and zzso zzso associated with increased zzso but without zzso zzso in stem cell zzso zzso is critical for maintaining normal structure and function of the zzso stem cell zzso It limits both bone and vascular zzso and our model suggests that it thereby zzso stem cell number and zzso
