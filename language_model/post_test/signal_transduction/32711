zzso zzso triggers a wide variety of cellular functions, yet its signaling zzso remains largely zzso We found that zzso of zzso cells activated zzso zzso of cellular proteins and zzso protein zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, and, zzso zzso cell zzso This zzso was resistant to boiling at 100 degrees C but completely abolished by treatment with zzso suggesting that zzso itself, but not any zzso zzso has the zzso In addition, we found that zzso zzso of zzso zzso was strongly suppressed by the expression of dominant negative zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso is activated by zzso and may play an important role in zzso zzso
