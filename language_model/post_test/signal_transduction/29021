Higher plants contain two structurally unrelated zzso zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso which mediate largely distinct response zzso zzso regulate plant development and zzso whereas zzso are primarily implicated in zzso responses such as phototropism and zzso zzso In the present study we identify interactions between zzso and zzso in several zzso of zzso zzso zzso are shown to exert a positive effect on zzso zzso under long-term zzso zzso Specifically, in a zzso genetic background zzso zzso zzso is reduced in the absence of zzso particularly at zzso where zzso show preferential zzso zzso in turn exert a small zzso effect on such zzso responses as zzso zzso and zzso zzso These effects are apparent in a zzso zzso zzso genetic zzso In addition to positive interactions between zzso zzso we demonstrate that the zzso also exert a negative regulatory zzso zzso of zzso protein decrease in blue light as a function of zzso zzso zzso This negative regulation occurs in part at the level of zzso zzso but may also involve zzso zzso These two classes of zzso thereby zzso zzso their overall zzso to blue light through multiple forms of zzso
