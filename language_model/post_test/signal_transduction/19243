zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso is required for T cell zzso survival, and zzso zzso Although this zzso is the subject of intense study, it is not known whether zzso signaling to zzso is digital zzso or analog in zzso Through analysis of the zzso and degradation of zzso and the nuclear zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso zzso is zzso Furthermore, zzso occurs well upstream of the zzso zzso complex, as protein zzso C zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso also demonstrate both digital behavior and high correlation with zzso nuclear zzso Thus, similar to the zzso signaling zzso analog zzso zzso are converted to digital zzso zzso to zzso at an early step downstream of zzso zzso
