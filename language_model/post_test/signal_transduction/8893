To investigate the effect of zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso signal zzso in zzso of zzso zzso cells under the challenge of acute zzso zzso zzso 

Models of acute zzso zzso injury were established and the level of local zzso a key element of zzso system zzso in kidney was measured using zzso zzso The expression of zzso muscle zzso zzso a zzso of zzso cells, was detected by zzso and zzso zzso Renal zzso cells zzso were cultured with various concentration of zzso followed by blocking of zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso an inhibitor of zzso signal zzso 

zzso of kidney tissue increased immediately after acute zzso injury, in time dependent zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells was found at 48 hours after zzso injury and in zzso cells treated by high concentration of zzso and was dose and time zzso The peak of zzso expression was seen after 30 minute treatment at the dose of zzso zzso which was interrupted by both of zzso and zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells occurs under acute zzso zzso Local zzso system may play a role in the zzso of zzso through zzso zzso and its zzso signal zzso
