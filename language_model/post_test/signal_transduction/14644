The search for molecular mechanisms to stimulate sensory zzso in the zzso inner ear is commonly based upon zzso zzso This has revealed many genes that regulate the differentiation of sensory zzso A major challenge is to place these genes into the context of functional networks that describe zzso processes more fully and increase the chances of identifying useful therapeutic zzso We used a novel approach to identify genes that are functionally related to the zzso factor zzso zzso profiles of gene expression were derived from three zzso zzso cell lines and clustered to those of zzso by applying the gamma model for zzso signals, a statistical method that allows quantitative analysis of zzso array zzso We derived an objective list of 28 genes that clustered with zzso in all three cell zzso A number of these genes have known functional links with zzso Genes zzso zzso binding proteins zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso are especially interesting as they are known to bind zzso proteins zzso The results provide strong evidence that our experimental approach can reveal functional relationships between genes that regulate fundamental processes in the differentiation of sensory cells in the inner zzso
