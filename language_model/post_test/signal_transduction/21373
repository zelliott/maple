The differentiation of veins in the zzso wing relies on zzso expression of zzso zzso in zzso territories during zzso zzso The expression of zzso in the zzso veins requires the integrity of the zzso region zzso zzso zzso to the coding zzso It is likely that this DNA zzso positive and negative regulatory signals directing zzso zzso during zzso zzso Here, we identify a minimal zzso zzso zzso giving zzso expression in the vein zzso and a zzso zzso zzso giving expression in all zzso zzso Using a combination of in zzso expression of reporter genes regulated by zzso zzso in zzso binding zzso and sequence comparisons between the zzso region of different zzso species, we found binding sites for the zzso zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as binding sites for the zzso zzso zzso Mad and zzso We conclude that zzso zzso enhancers regulated by zzso factors expressed in individual veins collaborate with general vein and zzso regulators to establish and maintain the expression of zzso confined to the veins during zzso zzso
