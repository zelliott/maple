zzso zzso is both a zzso and a pathogen of the human zzso Survival in the host environment requires resistance to zzso zzso oxide zzso However, zzso zzso lacks the zzso zzso regulator zzso that is used by many bacteria to sense and respond to zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso is able to sense and respond to both zzso and zzso by means of the zzso zzso system zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso zzso during zzso stress demonstrates the expression of zzso genes required for zzso zzso and assembly zzso zzso zzso zzso metabolism zzso zzso zzso zzso cluster repair zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso show that zzso and zzso are required for zzso resistance, whereas zzso is specifically required for zzso zzso We also show that zzso is required for survival in zzso zzso most likely due to oxygen zzso zzso by zzso zzso or a zzso zzso zzso zzso suggests that the zzso zzso senses impaired electron flow in the electron transport chain rather than directly interacting with zzso in the manner of zzso Nevertheless, like zzso zzso achieves the zzso goals of selectively expressing zzso in the presence of zzso and minimizing the potential for Fenton zzso zzso of the zzso zzso allows zzso zzso to maintain energy production and essential zzso zzso repair damage, and zzso zzso in diverse host zzso 

The zzso zzso is required for zzso oxide resistance and is widely distributed in zzso zzso expression must be tightly zzso because expression under zzso conditions in the absence of zzso oxide can exacerbate zzso zzso In most organisms, zzso expression is controlled by the zzso zzso zzso zzso but this zzso regulator is absent in the human pathogen zzso zzso We show here that zzso zzso achieves zzso regulation in response to zzso oxide and oxygen limitation by placing it under the control of the zzso zzso system, which senses reduced electron flow through the respiratory zzso This provides a striking example of zzso evolution, in which the common zzso goals of responding to zzso stress while minimizing Fenton chemistry are achieved by distinct regulatory zzso
