zzso zzso and zzso cell lines were used to determine the effect of zzso electromagnetic field zzso exposure on the production of zzso growth factors and the zzso of early signal zzso zzso Exposure of zzso cells to zzso minimally increased the amount of zzso zzso after 1 day, but had no significant effects zzso zzso exposure of zzso cells also had no effect on the amount of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Exposure of both zzso and zzso to zzso rapidly activated the zzso signaling pathway, as evidenced by increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso activity with the chemical inhibitor zzso blocked zzso zzso of zzso in both the zzso and zzso cell zzso These findings suggest that zzso exposure might function in a manner analogous to soluble growth factors by zzso a unique set of signaling zzso inclusive of the zzso zzso zzso
