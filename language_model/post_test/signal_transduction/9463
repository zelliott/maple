Our previous studies have implicated signaling through the tumor necrosis family receptors zzso and zzso as critical for maintaining zzso memory zzso We show that signals through both molecules are also required for zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso Under normal circumstances, male mice deficient in the zzso zzso factor zzso which lack regulatory zzso T cells, develop lethal zzso disease in the first few weeks of zzso However, in the combined absence of zzso and zzso zzso mice develop normally and breed zzso The extensive tissue zzso and organ destruction characteristic of zzso disease does not appear in these mice, and their mortality is not associated with zzso Although the absence of zzso plays the dominant role, zzso mice sufficient in zzso but deficient in zzso signals still eventually develop lethal zzso This result was supported by the observation that blocking zzso to zzso and zzso zzso also zzso disease zzso by zzso T zzso These observations identify zzso and zzso signals as essential for the development of clinically relevant zzso zzso and suggest that combination therapies that abrogate these signals might be used to treat established human zzso zzso
