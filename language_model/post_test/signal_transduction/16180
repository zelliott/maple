There is ample evidence that zzso channel zzso by accessory proteins within a zzso complex can regulate channel activity and thereby impact zzso zzso However, the downstream consequences of zzso channel zzso remain largely zzso The zzso zzso large zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso zzso via its binding partner zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso by zzso influences the zzso dependence of zzso zzso and zzso synaptic zzso zzso and zzso are expressed especially prominently in median zzso cells zzso in the zzso zzso zzso region of the zzso these cells also express and zzso zzso insulin like peptides zzso Previously, we found that flies lacking zzso exhibit increased resistance to zzso and we reasoned that zzso may regulate aspects of insulin signaling and zzso Here we investigate the role of zzso in metabolism and find that zzso zzso flies exhibit changes in energy storage and insulin zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso flies have decreased levels of zzso and increased levels of zzso a gene known to be involved in feeding and zzso zzso expression of zzso to zzso zzso these zzso in gene zzso as well as the zzso zzso Analysis of fly lines zzso for both zzso and zzso indicate that the effect of zzso on metabolism and gene expression is via zzso We propose that zzso of zzso by zzso regulates zzso in zzso influencing downstream insulin zzso signaling and zzso
