zzso Swiss zzso cells can be zzso to zzso DNA synthesis through specific zzso zzso pathways which include an increase in zzso zzso levels and the zzso of protein zzso zzso In the present study we have compared the effect of these two pathways on the expression of zzso and zzso in Swiss zzso zzso In cells treated with the zzso zzso agents zzso or zzso E1 or with the permeable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the levels of zzso zzso zzso were 5 to zzso of those induced by zzso which activates protein zzso zzso In contrast, a dramatic and comparable increase in the expression of zzso zzso zzso was observed when cells were treated either with the zzso zzso agents or with zzso Thus an increase in zzso zzso leads to the differential induction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in Swiss zzso zzso zzso we obtained comparable results when cells were treated with a zzso combination of zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, these findings have been confirmed at the protein zzso We concluded that the large induction of zzso can be zzso from zzso zzso zzso in Swiss zzso zzso
