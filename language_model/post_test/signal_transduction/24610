In zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulate production of zzso which directly activates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso adaptation is thought to result from a rise in zzso zzso To determine whether zzso of zzso channels plays a role in adaptation, we have investigated the action of zzso on these channels in zzso zzso patches from the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso Internal zzso with a zzso of 3 zzso profoundly zzso zzso channels by shifting the zzso relationship to higher zzso levels without altering the zzso zzso The zzso does not appear to result from a direct interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso washes out after zzso of the zzso patch, and zzso does not inhibit the cloned zzso zzso channel expressed in zzso zzso Hence we propose that a regulatory zzso zzso distinct from the zzso channel, controls the gain of signal zzso and contributes to zzso adaptation by decreasing the sensitivity of the zzso channel to zzso
