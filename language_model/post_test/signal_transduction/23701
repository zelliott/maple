Resistance to cell death is a hallmark of cancer and renders transformed cells resistant to multiple zzso zzso The zzso family member, zzso is a key driver of cell survival in diverse zzso including acute zzso leukemia zzso A screen for compounds that zzso zzso identified the zzso zzso zzso which demonstrates marked zzso activity against a panel of zzso diverse primary human zzso patient zzso We show that zzso zzso blocks zzso leading to zzso suppression of zzso rapid loss of zzso zzso and zzso of its zzso of zzso zzso zzso also targets the zzso zzso of zzso which leads to a loss of association between zzso and zzso The simultaneous loss of zzso and zzso association with zzso leads to rapid zzso of zzso zzso zzso low zzso expression in zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso On the other hand, the induction of zzso by zzso did not require the expression of the zzso proteins zzso Bid, zzso zzso or zzso zzso significantly reduced leukemia burden and increased the survival of mice zzso with human zzso without inducing overt zzso Future efforts to zzso zzso and zzso with drugs such as zzso in zzso are zzso
