zzso zzso zzso transition and the zzso zzso c release signify the commitment of a cell to zzso zzso However, the role of transient zzso zzso because of zzso opening of the zzso zzso transition pore remains zzso Here we show that zzso and the associated zzso flashes zzso zzso zzso constitute early zzso signals during zzso zzso zzso zzso (a zzso zzso but not zzso (a zzso zzso zzso an early and persistent increase in zzso flash activity prior to zzso fragmentation and a global zzso rise, independently of zzso zzso and zzso c zzso zzso targeting zzso flash activity by manipulating zzso D expression or scavenging zzso zzso markedly impacted the progression of zzso zzso while exerting little effect on the global zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso flash served as a convergence point for zzso and zzso regulation zzso by zzso D and zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso flashes act as early zzso signals zzso the zzso response during zzso stress, and provide the first demonstration of highly zzso local zzso zzso signaling in deciding cell zzso
