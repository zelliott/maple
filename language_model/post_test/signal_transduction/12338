zzso of zzso signaling zzso is an attractive strategy to induce potent zzso and tolerance in organ zzso Due to its strong zzso effect shown in nonhuman zzso experiments, zzso zzso zzso zzso have been tried in clinical settings, but it was interrupted by unexpected zzso zzso Thus, zzso of the counter zzso zzso has remained an alternative zzso In the previous preliminary study, we have shown that zzso a novel fully human zzso zzso has a fairly potent zzso effect on kidney zzso in nonhuman zzso In this study, we aimed to confirm the efficacy and zzso events of the zzso induction and zzso maintenance zzso zzso In both, zzso significantly suppressed zzso zzso responses and prolonged zzso zzso zzso of weekly zzso administration after the induction treatment further enhanced graft zzso Complete zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso productions was obtained only with zzso maintenance zzso No serious side effect including zzso complications was noted except for a transient reduction of zzso in one animal, and decrease of peripheral zzso counts in zzso These results indicate that the zzso appears to be a promising candidate for zzso in clinical organ zzso
