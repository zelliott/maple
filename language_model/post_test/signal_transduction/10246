zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein zzso that plays an important role in zzso signaling and cell zzso We used zzso zzso zzso technology to study zzso restricted zzso of the ilk gene by either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso brain regions are similar to those observed in mice lacking the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso including defective zzso deposition, abnormal zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso in zzso zzso pulse labeling and zzso cell nuclear zzso expression in the external zzso cell layer of the zzso demonstrated that proliferation is disrupted in zzso cells lacking zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso cell precursor zzso proliferation is dependent on zzso zzso several of which bind zzso and interact with zzso through the zzso zzso zzso Both ex zzso deletion of ilk and a small zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso activity decreased zzso zzso labeling in cultured zzso Together, these results zzso zzso as a critical zzso in a signaling zzso necessary for zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso
