zzso of the quail silver zzso which have zzso color changes, also display a unique zzso in the eye: during early embryonic development, the retinal zzso zzso zzso spontaneously zzso into neural retinal zzso zzso is considered to be the responsible gene and to function similarly to the mouse zzso zzso and tissue interaction between zzso and surrounding zzso tissue in organ culture has been shown to be essential for the initiation of the zzso process in which zzso growth factor zzso signaling is zzso The zzso results of the present study show that zzso and zzso zzso zzso both acting as zzso for zzso zzso are localized in the area of zzso of silver zzso much more abundantly than in zzso zzso More intense zzso zzso with zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso is also found in the neural zzso zzso and zzso tissue of silver zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that clusters of zzso cells zzso zzso neural crest zzso are frequently located around the developing eyes and in the zzso region of the silver embryonic zzso Finally, zzso zzso eyes were made by zzso silver quail zzso zzso to chicken host zzso in most cases, no zzso occurs in the silver zzso but in a few cases, zzso occurs where silver quail cells predominate in the zzso zzso These observations together with our previous in zzso study indicate that the silver zzso affects not only zzso cells but also zzso neural crest cells, which migrate to the eye zzso and that these crest cells play an essential role in the zzso of zzso possibly by zzso the zzso signaling zzso The precise molecular mechanism involved in zzso crest cell interaction is still unknown, and the quail silver zzso is considered to be a good experimental model for studying the role of neural crest cells in zzso eye zzso
