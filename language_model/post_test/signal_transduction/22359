zzso zzso regulate multiple signaling pathways to control a number of cellular processes during zzso zzso To investigate the downstream pathways through which zzso regulates zzso zzso junction formation, we screened a small interfering zzso zzso library targeting 28 known zzso target proteins in zzso human zzso zzso zzso This led to the identification of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, also called zzso zzso of zzso does not block the initial formation of primordial junctions at nascent zzso contacts but does prevent their maturation into zzso zzso zzso is recruited to primordial zzso and this zzso depends on its zzso zzso zzso binding is essential for zzso function and also zzso zzso recruitment to zzso zzso zzso acts as a zzso zzso and prevents zzso junction zzso We conclude that zzso is recruited to nascent zzso contacts through its zzso and zzso zzso and promotes zzso maturation through a zzso zzso
