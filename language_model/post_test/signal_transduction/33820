Here, we describe the rapid cloning of a plant zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso which encodes a putative Toll zzso zzso binding zzso class zzso which is involved in zzso against the zzso pathogen zzso zzso and against three other zzso zzso We have, through zzso case control bulk zzso comparisons of zzso in pools of zzso zzso zzso zzso identified the absence of a locus that causes zzso in zzso The significance of this locus on zzso 4 for zzso zzso resistance was supported by zzso zzso and zzso resistance to zzso zzso susceptible zzso in four independent zzso zzso lines support the hypothesis that zzso is required for zzso zzso The zzso in zzso also exhibited an enhanced zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso using zzso of a short transcript lacking the zzso domain, or a zzso zzso restored resistance to all zzso zzso The elevated expression of zzso on zzso zzso zzso further suggested convergence in zzso and gene regulation between zzso against zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the case of zzso zzso zzso is required for efficient zzso deposition downstream of zzso
