zzso frequently manifest distinct zzso as a function of cell density in a phenomenon known as zzso sensing zzso This zzso zzso process is zzso by zzso zzso comprised of zzso weight signals, known as zzso and their zzso zzso zzso As many of the zzso regulated by zzso can have a significant impact on the success of zzso or zzso zzso zzso there is considerable interest in methods to probe and zzso zzso pathways with zzso and spatial zzso Such methods would be valuable for both basic research in bacterial ecology and in practical zzso zzso and industrial zzso Toward this goal, considerable recent research has been focused on the development of chemical approaches to study bacterial zzso zzso In this zzso we provide an overview of the use of chemical zzso and techniques in zzso zzso Specifically, we focus on: zzso zzso approaches for the discovery of small zzso zzso zzso zzso affinity zzso for the isolation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and fluorescent zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso signals, and zzso the zzso sensing of zzso zzso The application of such chemical methods can offer unique advantages for both zzso and manipulating zzso pathways in culture and under native zzso
