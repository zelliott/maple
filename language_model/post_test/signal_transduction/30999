Previously we identified a zzso factor, zzso zzso Factor zzso zzso inflammatory zzso expression in zzso zzso To characterize the role of zzso in zzso we generated a zzso zzso mouse zzso Our data demonstrate that in zzso zzso several zzso (such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso are induced at lower levels in zzso compared with zzso control zzso zzso zzso mice are more resistant to zzso zzso To further identify zzso signaling zzso we tested mouse zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso exposed to zzso Using these cells, we now show that zzso expression can be induced after challenge either with zzso from zzso zzso via zzso at zzso or with zzso from zzso coli via zzso at zzso both requiring functional zzso We also show that, in response to zzso the zzso zzso zzso differs from the zzso zzso Furthermore, using a zzso zzso zzso was found to mediate zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso with a zzso inhibitor zzso blocked zzso nuclear zzso and reduced zzso zzso protein zzso Finally, zzso zzso rescued by zzso zzso zzso restored levels of zzso similar to those observed in zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is an important zzso of the zzso inflammatory response that can be distinguished from zzso zzso and that zzso is the specific zzso involved in the zzso linking zzso to zzso
