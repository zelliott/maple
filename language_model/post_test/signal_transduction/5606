The zzso encephalitis zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso includes a number of important human pathogens that cause serious neurological illnesses and zzso zzso These viruses pose a significant public health problem due to high rates of morbidity and zzso their emergence to new geographic areas, and the recent rise in the zzso of human zzso The most notable member of the zzso zzso is zzso encephalitis virus zzso a zzso zzso that causes debilitating and sometimes fatal zzso Although effective zzso zzso vaccines have been developed, there is currently no specific treatment for zzso To identify new targets for zzso intervention, it is imperative to understand interactions between zzso and the host immune response to zzso zzso zzso has a critical role in controlling zzso zzso zzso cells zzso represent an early target of zzso infection and are major producers of zzso Thus, interactions between zzso zzso responses, and the virus are likely to substantially influence the outcome of zzso Early zzso and DC responses are modulated not only by the virus, but also by the tick zzso and zzso compounds of tick saliva zzso with virus into the zzso Our laboratory is examining interactions between the zzso of virus, tick zzso and zzso host that contribute to the zzso of zzso zzso This work will provide a more detailed understanding of early events in virus infection and their impact on zzso zzso
