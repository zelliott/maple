zzso zzso zzso zzso are frequently associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in the zzso fusion gene that encodes a zzso activated zzso zzso We showed that zzso zzso cell proliferation and that zzso zzso played an important role in this zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family zzso proteins regulating the entry into S zzso It was reported that zzso function is impaired in many zzso In this study we investigated the role of zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

To investigate this phenomenon the zzso cell line zzso zzso cell line zzso expressing zzso and zzso zzso cell line were zzso The zzso protein expression before and after zzso zzso or zzso treatment and zzso status of zzso were measured in parental and zzso cells by Western zzso Also, the zzso of zzso protein was analyzed by zzso and zzso 

zzso was found to be zzso in zzso zzso cells, but zzso of zzso degradation zzso by zzso reversed this zzso In addition, treatment of zzso cells with zzso the zzso zzso caused zzso of zzso protein expression and its nuclear zzso 

Taken together, we zzso that zzso zzso stimulates cell proliferation by regulation of the expression and nuclear zzso of zzso
