zzso is reduced by cellular zzso to form zzso zzso zzso that are associated with zzso and zzso Much attention recently has been given to the role that the highly zzso zzso IV zzso zzso family of zzso plays in tolerating zzso induced by zzso and other zzso agents, yet little is known about how zzso DNA damage is processed by the zzso In this study, we characterized the genetic repair pathways that contribute to survival and zzso in zzso coli cultures grown in the presence of zzso We find that zzso zzso repair is a primary mechanism for processing damage induced by zzso The contribution of zzso synthesis to survival was minor compared to that of zzso zzso repair and depended upon Pol zzso In addition, survival also depended on both the zzso and zzso zzso We also found that zzso acts as a direct inhibitor of DNA replication at higher zzso We show that the direct zzso of replication by zzso occurs independently of DNA damage and is zzso once the zzso is zzso Previous studies that reported zzso zzso repair zzso that were fully resistant to zzso used high zzso of the drug zzso zzso and short exposure zzso We demonstrate here that these conditions inhibit replication but are insufficient in duration to induce significant levels of DNA zzso
