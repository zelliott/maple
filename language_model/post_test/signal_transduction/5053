In diabetic patients and susceptible mice, insulin is a targeted zzso zzso B chain zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells are key for initiating zzso diabetes in zzso zzso however, little is known regarding their origin and zzso To this end, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transgenic zzso mice were zzso of which, despite expressing a single zzso on the zzso zzso zzso background, only a fraction develops diabetes in an zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells convert into zzso zzso and zzso zzso regulatory T cells zzso soon after leaving the zzso as a result of zzso recognition and zzso zzso The generation of zzso causes the zzso diabetes zzso since crossing onto the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice develop accelerated and fully zzso zzso Similarly, adoptive transfer and bone zzso transplantation experiments showed differential diabetes zzso based on zzso zzso presence in the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso escapes zzso deletion and simultaneously converts into zzso and zzso establishing an equilibrium that determines diabetes zzso These results are of particular importance for understanding disease zzso They suggest that once central tolerance is bypassed, zzso cells arriving in the periphery do not by default follow solely a zzso fate upon zzso
