The zzso effects of zzso are zzso by the zzso factor zzso The activity of zzso is inhibited by small zzso modifier zzso zzso This occurs both directly through decreasing zzso zzso zzso and indirectly by zzso zzso zzso consequential to increased zzso zzso because of suppressed zzso zzso However, the zzso implications of zzso zzso have remained zzso Here, we used zzso and bone zzso zzso zzso from zzso mice expressing zzso zzso to explore the consequences of zzso zzso for zzso zzso Our experiments demonstrated buffer property of zzso for activated zzso such that zzso zzso zzso profoundly reduced zzso of zzso which affected both the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso the curtailed zzso activity in the nucleus caused by zzso zzso resulted in diminished zzso of zzso zzso and increased the zzso concentration more than zzso required to trigger zzso zzso in bone zzso zzso These experiments identify zzso zzso of zzso as a mechanism to permanently zzso the zzso sensitivity of cells, which prevents zzso to this zzso and its potentially self-destructive zzso This sets the mode of zzso zzso apart from the other negative zzso regulators known to zzso
