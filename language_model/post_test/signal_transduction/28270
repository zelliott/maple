Control of immune response requires the coordinated integration of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso of different signaling pathways is critical in providing an integrated cellular response to multiple external zzso Both zzso zzso and transforming growth factor zzso are zzso zzso and play critical roles in controlling immune zzso For example, zzso mediates important zzso functions in asthma including induction of the zzso zzso switch and expression of vascular cell zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso from B, zzso and zzso cells as well as zzso and zzso regulates their zzso zzso and zzso by other zzso In this study, we examined the effect of zzso on zzso signaling using B cells as well as embryonic kidney zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso production and gene expression of zzso zzso transcripts in B zzso In embryonic kidney cells, zzso signals suppressed zzso transcription, when we monitored using zzso zzso promoter zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso resulted in a resistance to zzso suppression of zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso regulation of zzso signaling may act by targeting zzso zzso
