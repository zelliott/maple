zzso which cover all zzso zzso and body cavities in zzso perform diverse functions in embryonic and adult zzso Yet, zzso are traditionally viewed as simple, uniform zzso Here we demonstrate distinct differences between visceral and zzso zzso the most basic subdivision of this tissue type, in terms of gene zzso zzso migration, and zzso Gene profiling determined that zzso a zzso zzso D originally discovered as a tumor zzso factor, was expressed exclusively in the more zzso and invasive visceral zzso and at zzso high levels in zzso zzso and loss of function studies demonstrate that zzso signaling is indeed a critical factor responsible for zzso differences within zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that known and novel small zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso dramatically blunt migratory and invasive behaviors of aggressive zzso Taken together, this study reveals distinct zzso within the zzso cell zzso demonstrates that differential zzso expression is the molecular underpinning for these differences, and provides a novel target and lead compounds to intervene in invasive zzso
