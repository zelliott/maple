zzso and zzso immunity play important roles in zzso and tumor zzso However, increasing evidence suggests that zzso immune cells may have a dual zzso zzso or promoting tumor growth and zzso Although regulatory T zzso cells induce immune tolerance by suppressing host immune responses against zzso or zzso thus playing critical roles in preventing zzso diseases, they might inhibit zzso immunity and promote tumor zzso Recent studies demonstrate that elevated proportions of zzso cells are present in various types of zzso and suppress zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso cells can inhibit immune responses only when they are exposed to zzso presented by tumor zzso zzso zzso cells at tumor sites have zzso effects on zzso directed to zzso This review will discuss recent progress in innate zzso zzso cells, and their regulation through zzso zzso zzso zzso It was generally thought that zzso recognition of specific structures of invading pathogens initiate innate and zzso immune responses through zzso zzso New evidence suggests that zzso signaling may directly regulate the zzso function of zzso zzso Linking zzso signaling to the functional control of zzso cells opens intriguing opportunities to manipulate zzso signaling to control both innate and zzso immunity against zzso
