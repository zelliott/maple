zzso is a time during development when cells destined to produce internal zzso and zzso move from the surface of the zzso into the zzso It is critical that the cell movements of zzso be precisely controlled, and coordinated with cell zzso in order for the zzso to develop zzso zzso zzso zzso is relatively simple, can be observed easily in the transparent zzso and can be manipulated genetically to uncover important regulatory zzso Many of these cellular and molecular mechanisms, including cell shape, zzso and cell cycle changes, appear to be zzso from flies to zzso Here we review zzso in zzso zzso with an emphasis on recent data linking zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and cell fate zzso to zzso zzso
