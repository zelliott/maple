zzso liver disease zzso is characterized by zzso of neutral lipids in zzso leading to zzso and zzso zzso and balloon cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso obesity also cause similar changes as evident in zzso fatty liver disease zzso Thus, zzso of lipids in zzso is a zzso hallmark of zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso cells zzso are characterized by the zzso content of not only vitamin A but also zzso and zzso zzso is associated with depletion of these zzso In fact, our recent work demonstrates that zzso zzso zzso regulation rendered by zzso zzso and zzso is essential for the maintenance of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of these zzso zzso factors is lost in activated zzso and the treatment of the cells with the zzso differentiation cocktail or zzso expression of zzso or zzso causes a reversal of activated cells to the zzso zzso In zzso zzso from zzso and zzso mouse models, the expression of these zzso zzso factors is induced while the normal control zzso lack such zzso Thus, zzso regulation is essential for zzso zzso while it makes zzso zzso Interestingly, under the zzso conditions of zzso and zzso zzso are still activated to cause zzso This fat paradox in zzso and zzso highlights contrasted significance of fat in these two cell types that depend on each other for their zzso zzso It further suggests, activated zzso in zzso zzso may have defective insulin signaling or zzso zzso
