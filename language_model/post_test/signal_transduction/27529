zzso zzso T cells can be divided into two different functional populations based on the expression of distinct zzso of the surface zzso zzso We have investigated the differences in the zzso signaling induced by zzso zzso zzso in zzso populations of zzso zzso and zzso zzso human zzso T zzso zzso of cell surface zzso zzso and zzso was comparable between zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso stimulation in the form of zzso produced markedly different patterns of zzso zzso Greater zzso zzso generation occurred in zzso cells and the rise in zzso free calcium was also substantially greater in zzso than in memory zzso zzso with the zzso zzso were considerably more active in zzso zzso zzso both at an overall level and specifically in terms of zzso and zzso zzso Despite these differences in zzso the amounts of zzso zzso and zzso were equivalent between the two zzso These findings suggest that the zzso signaling is zzso regulated in zzso and memory zzso T zzso This may be due to differences in the way that the two zzso of the zzso zzso regulate the activity of zzso zzso in the zzso signaling pathway, and could be an important means by which the unique functions of differentiated T cell populations are zzso
