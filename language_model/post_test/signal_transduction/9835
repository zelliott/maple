zzso the ability of either zzso or transplanted zzso zzso zzso to engage in zzso may constitute a novel therapeutic approach to zzso diseases of the zzso It is known that in adults neural zzso situated in the zzso zone of the lateral zzso zzso are capable of generating zzso which can migrate into white matter tracts such as the corpus zzso zzso We observed that zzso cells in the zzso of adult mice expressed zzso zzso receptors and that the zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso We therefore investigated the role of zzso signaling in regulating the migration of zzso into the zzso following their transplantation into the lateral zzso We established zzso cell cultures from zzso mouse zzso These cells expressed a variety of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso differentiated into zzso zzso in zzso To study the migratory capacity of zzso zzso in zzso we transplanted them into the lateral zzso of zzso zzso cells migrated into the zzso and differentiated into mature zzso This migration was enhanced in animals with Experimental zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression in zzso using zzso inhibited the migration of transplanted zzso into the white matter suggesting that their directed migration is regulated by zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso signaling is important in guiding the migration of transplanted zzso in the context of inflammatory zzso brain zzso
