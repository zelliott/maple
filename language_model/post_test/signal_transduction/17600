In order to get an insight into the evolutionary aspect of zzso zzso especially of the ubiquitous zzso pathway, we have carried out an extensive search of zzso and zzso similarities for zzso proteins in the zzso pathway, the zzso zzso cycle, alcohol and zzso zzso pathways and the zzso zzso This investigation of zzso acid sequences reveals a curious pattern of similarity zzso no similarity can be found between the zzso proteins in a section of the zzso zzso where the zzso or even zzso is converted into the zzso while many examples of zzso and zzso similarities are found even between zzso proteins in distant blocks, zzso between the proteins in the zzso cycle and those in the zzso zzso cycle, as well as between the functionally associated proteins in each of these zzso zzso to this characteristic pattern of zzso acid sequence zzso the search for similarities of zzso sequences also finds that the similarities of zzso zzso zzso some zzso and others zzso similarities, are concentrated on the zzso sequences of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso gene with its zzso although some of the copy sequences are also found in transfer zzso genes as well as in zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that the zzso pathways have been developed by the chance assembly of zzso proteins generated from the sense and zzso strands of pre-existing zzso zzso the zzso pathways and zzso zzso cycle by the proteins from the genes of zzso in the zzso zzso and the zzso cycle from all these successively increased zzso zzso the origin of zzso zzso genes to the close relation between the zzso zzso protein genes and the zzso gene zzso
