Resistance to therapy is the major obstacle to more effective cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso is often highly zzso in tumor zzso and its expression is further increased in response to zzso It has been suggested that zzso of zzso expression is a potential therapeutic approach to sensitize tumors to chemotherapy and zzso In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the zzso effects of zzso are zzso by suppression of zzso expression in cancer zzso Our results indicate that zzso strongly suppresses zzso zzso and protein expression in human zzso zzso zzso cervical cancer zzso and zzso lung cancer zzso zzso zzso also markedly reduced zzso zzso and protein levels in whole cell zzso and suppressed zzso zzso zzso protein stability and zzso response element zzso activity in zzso zzso We also found that zzso regulation of zzso expression is zzso by a zzso mechanism and that zzso significantly attenuated zzso signaling to suppress zzso expression in cancer zzso zzso of zzso signaling by zzso decreased zzso zzso expression in zzso cells, confirming that the zzso of zzso expression is zzso by an zzso of zzso signaling in cancer zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso zzso or the pharmacological zzso inhibitor compound C, revealed that zzso reduced zzso expression in an zzso zzso These results highlight the zzso axis as a new molecular target in zzso therapy in response to zzso zzso
