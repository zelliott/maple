To clarify the contribution of peripheral zzso input to the control of pecking behavior we examined head and jaw movement zzso and zzso zzso in pigeons with surgical section of zzso nerves providing zzso input to the zzso zzso procedures were used to bring the zzso components of pecking under the control of a visual zzso zzso head and jaw movements were monitored zzso using movement zzso and terminal zzso location was recorded using zzso zzso The periodic delivery of a food zzso provided repeated opportunities to monitor the zzso of zzso zzso zzso produced deficits in zzso during zzso pecking and in the coordination of head and jaw movements during zzso zzso These results are attributed to disruptions in zzso feedback and zzso mechanisms, zzso In contrast with previous studies, zzso did not impair the precision of zzso zzso zzso reasons for the absence of zzso deficits are zzso The results are discussed in relation to the role of peripheral zzso in the control of zzso zzso
