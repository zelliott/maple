The zzso limb zzso are subdivided into zzso cell populations that do not mix during zzso The wing is subdivided into zzso zzso and zzso zzso compartments by the activity of the zzso gene zzso in D zzso zzso causes segregation of D and V cell populations by at least two distinct zzso The zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso are zzso expressed in D cells and contribute to initial segregation of D and V zzso Signaling between D and V cells zzso by zzso and Fringe contributes to the maintenance of the zzso affinity zzso Given that zzso is activated zzso in D and V cells adjacent to the boundary, its role in boundary formation remains somewhat zzso We re-examine the roles of zzso and Fringe activities in zzso boundary formation and present evidence that Fringe zzso by itself, generate an affinity difference between D and V zzso Although not zzso Fringe is required via zzso zzso for expression of an zzso affinity zzso We propose that zzso controls expression of surface proteins that zzso an affinity difference in conjunction with activated zzso Thus, we view zzso as zzso and zzso activity as essential, but zzso
