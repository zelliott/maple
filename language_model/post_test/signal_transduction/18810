The zzso protein zzso has been implicated in the negative regulation of zzso zzso In this study, we report an unexpected role of zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso which occurs by a mechanism independent of its association with zzso This zzso function of zzso is executed in concert with zzso which zzso the interaction of zzso with zzso resulting in the nuclear zzso of zzso and the disruption of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso caused increased association of zzso with SARA and zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso exhibit enhanced association of zzso with zzso zzso zzso also lose their sensitivity to zzso disruption of the zzso complex and of nuclear zzso of zzso We suggest that the interaction of zzso with zzso through zzso may zzso regulate zzso signaling through controlling the zzso of zzso and, consequently, the assembly of the zzso zzso
