Ethanol has a variety of action on zzso functions, though its mechanism of action remains zzso Previous investigations have demonstrated functional zzso of neurotransmitter receptors and zzso channels by ethanol at its concentration observed in the blood of zzso Our recent studies have shown that chronic ethanol treatment zzso high zzso zzso calcium channels and zzso zzso both of which regulate zzso zzso zzso and that the zzso of these calcium channels zzso in behavioral changes including the rewarding zzso Among zzso zzso receptors zzso classified into three different zzso zzso 1 zzso type 2, and type 3 zzso with distinct zzso properties, zzso is the major zzso member in the central nervous system, predominantly enriched in zzso zzso cells and abundant in zzso in the cerebral zzso Although the most important result of zzso channel functions is the change in zzso zzso concentration and zzso of zzso there are few available data on ethanol effect on zzso In this report, we demonstrate the functional relationship between zzso rewarding effect and zzso expression and regulatory mechanisms of zzso expression after chronic ethanol exposure, especially focusing on zzso signal zzso pathways via zzso D1 receptors using mouse cerebral cortical zzso
