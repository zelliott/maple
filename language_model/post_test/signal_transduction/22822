The zzso signaling domain of the Sonic zzso zzso protein zzso which derives from the zzso precursor through an zzso reaction zzso by the zzso domain, zzso multiple functions in embryonic tissue zzso including induction of zzso and suppression of zzso cell types in the developing neural zzso An apparent zzso site within zzso is suggested by structural zzso to a bacterial zzso We demonstrate here that zzso of zzso presumed to be critical for a zzso activity does not cause a loss of zzso activity, thus ruling out zzso by zzso as a requirement for zzso We favor the alternative, that zzso functions primarily as a zzso for the putative zzso zzso zzso This possibility is supported by new evidence for direct binding of zzso to zzso and by a strong correlation between the affinity of zzso and the signaling potency of zzso protein zzso carrying zzso of zzso zzso in a particular region of the protein zzso These results together suggest that direct zzso binding to zzso is a critical event in zzso of the zzso zzso
