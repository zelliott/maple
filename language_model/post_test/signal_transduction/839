The zzso tumor zzso protein is a key zzso of an zzso DNA damage response cascade following cellular exposure to zzso zzso The zzso members, zzso and zzso are highly similar to zzso yet are zzso activated by zzso zzso and zzso via zzso and zzso signaling zzso Loss of function of zzso can occur by zzso or degradation; giving rise to zzso in zzso and zzso cell cycle checkpoint control, cell death, DNA repair and genetic zzso The end result of these zzso can be the generation of zzso zzso tumor zzso Indeed, in zzso systems, loss of zzso or zzso function has been associated with decreased zzso and zzso in zzso However, clinical data supporting a role for zzso zzso as an independent zzso factor for zzso outcome continues to be controversial due to variable zzso in clinical trial design and in methodology in detecting zzso zzso Nonetheless, in carefully controlled zzso studies where zzso in zzso have been detected using DNA sequencing or functional zzso the presence of zzso zzso can be associated with decreased local control following zzso This suggests that novel molecular treatment strategies specifically designed to zzso normal zzso function within resistant tumors can be used as combined zzso protocols to improve local control and maintain a therapeutic zzso A future challenge lies in the zzso determination of a zzso therapeutic zzso for individual patients which could allow for specific zzso based on zzso functional status and subsequent individualized zzso
