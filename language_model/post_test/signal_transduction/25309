The expression of zzso receptors on zzso cells and of zzso zzso on bone zzso zzso cells suggests a possible role for zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso In order to assess the involvement of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines were engineered to permit the conditional induction of the zzso active zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso The induction of zzso resulted in accelerated and increased zzso zzso These effects were observed under growth conditions that support differentiation and, to a lesser degree, under conditions that normally promote zzso zzso zzso of zzso deletion zzso showed that the differentiation promoting activity correlated with zzso zzso Furthermore, expression of a zzso active zzso of zzso zzso increased zzso zzso To test further the role of zzso zzso in a zzso context, zzso cells expressing zzso were cultured on zzso layers that either expressed or did not express the zzso zzso zzso Similar to the induction of zzso zzso accelerated zzso differentiation of zzso zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso of zzso promotes zzso differentiation via zzso zzso
