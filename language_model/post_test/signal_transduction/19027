Development of many zzso features depends on zzso acid zzso Because the action of zzso during development seems to be restricted to zzso it had been previously proposed that the zzso of zzso genetic machinery, including zzso nuclear hormone receptors zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, was an important step for the origin of zzso mechanisms leading to the zzso body zzso We tested this hypothesis by conducting an exhaustive survey of the zzso machinery in zzso databases for twelve zzso We reconstructed the evolution of these genes in zzso and showed for the first time that zzso genetic zzso is zzso zzso and zzso zzso present in zzso zzso This finding implies that zzso genetic machinery was already present during early zzso evolution, and therefore, is not a zzso zzso This new evolutionary viewpoint argues against the hypothesis that the acquisition of gene families underlying zzso metabolism and signaling was a key event for the origin of zzso We propose a new hypothesis in which zzso zzso and loss of zzso machinery genes could be related to the zzso radiation of zzso
