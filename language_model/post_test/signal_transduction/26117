zzso stress associated with drought or zzso is a major factor that limits plant zzso zzso zzso in the zzso protein zzso 2 zzso family are activated by zzso stress, suggesting that the zzso are involved in zzso stress zzso However, due to functional zzso their contribution to zzso stress responses remained zzso In this report, we constructed an zzso line carrying zzso in all 10 members of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso grew poorly under zzso stress conditions but was similar to the wild type in culture media in the absence of zzso zzso The zzso was also defective in gene regulation and the zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso under zzso zzso In addition, analysis of zzso defective in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso defective in the rest of the zzso zzso revealed that zzso are a merging point of zzso and zzso pathways for zzso stress zzso These results demonstrate critical functions of the zzso in zzso zzso stress signaling and zzso
