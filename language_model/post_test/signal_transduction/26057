In zzso the common expression border of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the prospective zzso border zzso in the neural plate at the end of zzso The presence of a compartment boundary at the zzso has been demonstrated, but the mechanism and timing of its formation remain zzso We show by genetic zzso fate mapping using a zzso zzso mouse line that descendants of zzso cells as early as embryonic day zzso zzso do not cross the zzso Without zzso zzso cells zzso populate the entire zzso demonstrating that zzso is essential for specifying zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells segregate from each other, suggesting that mutually exclusive expression of zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso is responsible for cell sorting in establishing the zzso The zzso organizer gene zzso which is expressed as a sharp zzso band immediately zzso to the lineage boundary at the zzso is crucial in maintaining the zzso boundary after zzso zzso deletion of zzso zzso zzso lineage zzso zzso of zzso pathways has a zzso effect on cell sorting in zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso may signal the nearby zzso cells to impart distinct cell surface characteristics or induce local zzso zzso which consequently prevents cell movements across the zzso Our findings reveal the distinct function of zzso and zzso in a zzso process in the development of the compartment boundary at the zzso and that zzso in addition to its organizer function, plays a crucial role in maintaining the lineage boundary at the zzso by restricting cell zzso
