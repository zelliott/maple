zzso zzso differentiation state is critical for zzso barrier function and is regulated by zzso a zinc finger zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso identified a novel, zzso protein zzso that maps to human zzso zzso a region with genes linked to familial focal zzso zzso The domain structure of zzso is similar to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso which contain three zzso zzso zzso interaction zzso and a zzso zzso region with a nuclear export zzso Other zzso zzso proteins zzso and mouse muscle zzso zzso did not interact with zzso in zzso zzso and zzso did not interact with an unrelated zzso factor, zzso zzso zzso was detected in cultured zzso and was zzso zzso with expression zzso in mouse kidney at embryonic day zzso zzso in kidney but zzso into zzso In zzso zzso demonstrated zzso expression in developing zzso zzso and in cultured zzso The partial zzso zzso which zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso zzso with zzso in zzso zzso with zzso and inhibited zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In contrast, full-length zzso was excluded from cell zzso but after the addition of zzso B, an inhibitor of zzso nuclear export, it accumulated in the nucleus and zzso with zzso in whole cell zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso zzso spots and with zzso at zzso zzso We propose that zzso monitors slit zzso protein assembly as part of a multiple protein complex, linking this specialized zzso junction to the zzso zzso and zzso into the nucleus after zzso injury, providing a mechanism zzso changes in slit zzso structure zzso gene zzso
