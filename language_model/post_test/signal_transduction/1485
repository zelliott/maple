zzso zzso mediates zzso trafficking to zzso zzso zzso by interacting with the zzso vascular zzso zzso While the structural basis for the zzso zzso interaction has been well zzso less is known about the signal zzso pathways that regulate the zzso zzso zzso interaction with zzso zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso a prominent zzso zzso of zzso and a zzso protein zzso that is zzso with an zzso zzso in the mouse zzso line zzso Cloning and expression of a full-length zzso zzso the mouse zzso revealed that the zzso zzso is a mouse zzso of zzso We also demonstrated that zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso the rapid zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in normal zzso and that zzso stimulation enhances the zzso zzso of zzso but not of zzso These results suggest that zzso signals initiated by zzso zzso involve the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso which are zzso zzso at least in part, by mechanisms that are zzso or zzso
