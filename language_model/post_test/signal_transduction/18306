Class A scavenger receptors zzso mediate the zzso of modified low density zzso zzso by zzso Although not typically associated with the zzso of zzso signaling zzso results with zzso zzso indicate that the zzso zzso zzso LDL zzso promotes zzso of zzso zzso and zzso These signaling responses were blocked by the treatment of cells with zzso toxin zzso indicating that zzso activates zzso signaling zzso The functional significance of zzso zzso zzso is not zzso In this study, we investigated the potential role of zzso zzso in regulating zzso zzso zzso Treatment of mouse zzso zzso with zzso decreased association of zzso labeled zzso with zzso This zzso was dependent on the zzso activity of the toxin confirming that the decrease in zzso zzso involved zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso treatment did not alter zzso cholesterol zzso or deposition of zzso The ability of zzso to completely inhibit zzso zzso and the lack of zzso effect on zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso effect is specific for zzso and not the result of zzso effects on zzso zzso Despite having an effect on an zzso zzso zzso there was no change in the relative abundance of zzso protein after zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso of a zzso G protein is involved in a feedback process that positively regulates zzso zzso
