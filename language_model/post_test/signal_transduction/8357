Group I zzso zzso and 5) zzso and/or zzso regulate synaptic transmission at zzso zzso By recording spontaneous zzso zzso in the spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso we here investigated the regulation of zzso transmission through the zzso of group I zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso the group I zzso increased zzso both in frequency and zzso particularly, the increased zzso was zzso The zzso increases of zzso frequency and zzso were not zzso zzso The zzso increase in the frequency of zzso the zzso effect being further confirmed by the zzso effect on zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso an index of zzso zzso was significantly but partially reduced by zzso of zzso sodium channel, zzso or zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso markedly enhanced the zzso increase of zzso frequency, which was mainly accomplished through zzso indicating an zzso role of zzso In contrast, the zzso increase of zzso zzso was not affected by zzso or zzso zzso although the long-lasting property of the increase was zzso however, the increase was completely inhibited by blocking both zzso and zzso Further study of signal zzso mechanisms revealed that zzso and zzso zzso the increases of zzso in both frequency and zzso by zzso while zzso zzso NO and zzso only that of zzso during zzso zzso Altogether, these results indicate that the zzso of group I zzso and their signal zzso pathways zzso regulate zzso release and synaptic responses in zzso thereby contributing to the processing of zzso signals from zzso zzso
