A primary limitation in the development and use of screens to identify factors that regulate zzso zzso zzso has been the development of sensitive reporter zzso Alternative zzso typically involves relatively small zzso zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso designed to allow direct analysis of zzso expression historically have at most a zzso window of discrimination between a positive signal and zzso Here we describe the design and application of a reporter cell line that makes use of the phenomenon of zzso zzso to amplify the detection of changes in zzso such that a three- to zzso change in zzso pattern is observed as a zzso to zzso change in zzso zzso Using this cell line we have identified two small zzso from a library of approximately 300 synthetic compounds, that can induce partial repression of a variable zzso from the zzso zzso We propose that the concept of zzso amplification of signal will allow the development of true zzso screening approaches to identify zzso of zzso alternative zzso
