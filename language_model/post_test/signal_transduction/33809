zzso evolved to produce natural products that inhibit growth of competing soil zzso In many cases these compounds act on zzso which are zzso with zzso gene sequences closely related to zzso including zzso The zzso zzso zzso A and zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso all act via targets zzso from zzso to zzso This allows the use of genetically zzso zzso as models to zzso how these drugs and their targets function in zzso and human zzso These zzso also enable studies aimed at harnessing their intrinsic zzso activities to develop novel zzso zzso zzso studies have revealed a globally zzso role for the zzso protein in regulating growth and proliferation in response to zzso and targeting its essential functions results in robust zzso zzso Similarly, a zzso and essential role for zzso in zzso zzso has been established and could be targeted by zzso for therapeutic uses in a variety of clinical zzso Finally, the discovery that zzso of zzso or zzso result in dramatic zzso with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso provides another therapeutic vantage zzso Taken together, these zzso targets and their zzso provide a robust platform from which to develop novel zzso zzso
