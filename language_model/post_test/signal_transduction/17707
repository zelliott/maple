We studied zzso signaling in locus zzso zzso zzso using both zzso and whole cell patch zzso Upon zzso of fast zzso spikes by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pH zzso zzso induced small, slow zzso These spikes were inhibited by zzso or zzso and were attributed to zzso of zzso zzso channels by zzso Upon zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso resulted in a membrane zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 17) that was reduced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 7; P zzso zzso and absent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 7; P zzso zzso upon exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 77 zzso zzso zzso zzso Either zzso or zzso but not 50 zzso zzso activated zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso channels by zzso reduced zzso increased firing rate and eliminated zzso increased firing zzso We conclude that zzso signals zzso zzso or zzso have multiple targets in zzso zzso including zzso zzso channels and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso activate zzso zzso channels, and this zzso is part of zzso signaling in zzso zzso
