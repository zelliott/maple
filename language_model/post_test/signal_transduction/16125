zzso how genes and the environment interact to shape zzso is of fundamental importance for resolving important issues in zzso zzso Yet, for most model species with mature zzso and accessible zzso resources, we know little about the natural environmental factors that shape their zzso By contrast, animal species with deeply understood zzso and well characterized responses to environmental cues are rarely subjects of zzso zzso Here, we preview advances in zzso in zzso and zzso that may help transform research on the regulatory mechanisms of zzso zzso This insect and zzso duo has the capacity to produce extremely divergent zzso in response to environmental zzso Sexual fate and zzso mode are zzso in both groups, which are also capable of altering zzso physiology and behavior in response to zzso and zzso zzso Recently, the zzso sequences for the pea zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were described by their respective research zzso We propose that an zzso study of zzso biology focused on the zzso zzso basis of their shared plastic traits and specialized mode of reproduction will provide broad insight into zzso plasticity and zzso by environment zzso We highlight recent advances in understanding the zzso regulation of alternative zzso and environmental cue processing, and we propose future research avenues to discover gene networks and zzso mechanisms underlying zzso zzso
