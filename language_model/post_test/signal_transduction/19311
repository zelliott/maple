The primary zzso organizes numerous signal zzso zzso and an understanding of signaling zzso trafficking to zzso is now zzso A defining feature of zzso is the zzso diffusion barrier that separates the zzso and plasma zzso Although lateral transport through this barrier may take place, polarized zzso to the base of the zzso has been the prevailing model for delivering membrane proteins to zzso Key players for this polarized zzso model include the zzso zzso and zzso the zzso and possibly the zzso zzso zzso In turn, the sorting of membrane proteins to zzso critically relies on the recognition of zzso targeting signals by sorting machines such as the zzso coat complex or the zzso zzso Finally, some proteins need to exit from zzso and zzso may regulate this zzso The stage is now set to dissect the interplay between signaling and regulated trafficking to and from zzso
