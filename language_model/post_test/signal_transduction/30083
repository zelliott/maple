zzso zzso factors trigger a cardiac zzso process in which the heart becomes zzso enlarged with a zzso decline in cardiac function and eventual heart zzso Heart failure is traditionally treated with drugs that antagonize early signaling events at or near the cell zzso Although such approaches have short-term zzso the five-year mortality rate for patients with late-stage heart failure continues to exceed zzso Because of the redundant nature of the signaling networks that drive cardiac zzso targeting the common downstream elements of the zzso would be a more effective therapeutic zzso Recent studies point to the importance of zzso that control zzso zzso as zzso regulators of gene expression in the zzso Given their role as nuclear zzso that couple divergent upstream signals to the gene program for cardiac zzso we propose that these zzso factors represent zzso targets for the pharmacological manipulation of cardiac zzso
