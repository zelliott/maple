zzso of zzso insects such as cockroaches and zzso exhibit a remarkable capacity for zzso complex structures from damaged zzso Until recent years, however, approaches to zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying the leg zzso process have been zzso Taking the cricket zzso zzso as a model, we found that a zzso related to zzso frequently appears during leg zzso even though no zzso is induced by zzso interference zzso in the cricket zzso designated as zzso zzso Since then, we have investigated the functions of various genes zzso signaling factors and cellular zzso proteins like Fat and zzso during leg zzso In this review, we zzso the classical knowledge about insect leg zzso and introduce recent advances concerning the signaling zzso required for zzso a zzso Our results provide clues to the mechanisms of zzso which are relevant to zzso zzso
