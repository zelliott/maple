The aim of this study was to assess the beneficial effects of zzso on cigarette zzso small airway zzso in zzso 

zzso was administered at different doses for 16 weeks to rats with cigarette zzso small airway zzso zzso analyses were performed, and collagen deposition, production of growth factors, inflammatory parameters and zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso were zzso 

zzso attenuated small airway wall zzso and prevented the increase in lung zzso content and collagen deposition induced in airway walls by cigarette zzso In addition, zzso zzso transforming growth zzso and zzso tissue growth factor protein and gene expression in the zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso and zzso and increases in zzso necrosis zzso concentration in zzso fluid were inhibited by zzso zzso the expression of zzso and the zzso of zzso and zzso in lungs exposed to cigarette smoke were inhibited during zzso zzso However, the increased expression of zzso and zzso proteins and the decreased level of zzso protein in zzso lungs were not affected by zzso 

zzso attenuated experimental small airway zzso as indicated by decreases in collagen deposition and small airway wall zzso zzso may inhibit cigarette zzso small airway zzso by reducing growth factor expression and zzso The mechanism of action of zzso on small airway zzso involved zzso and the zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso may have potential beneficial effects in the treatment of zzso
