Plants have evolved sensory mechanisms to detect pathogen attack and trigger zzso pathways that induce rapid zzso zzso These mechanisms include not only direct detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso molecular patterns zzso and zzso factors or zzso but also indirect sensing of zzso impact on the host zzso Among the first plant barriers to pathogen zzso are the cell wall and the zzso For those pathogens that penetrate the plant cell wall to gain access to water and nutrients of the plant zzso small wounds at penetration sites are created by zzso or physical disruption of the plant cell zzso Thus, cell wall integrity sensing is one mechanism by which plants may detect pathogen zzso Some plant cell wall fragments, notably zzso zzso elicit similar zzso responses in plants as the zzso zzso zzso zzso production of zzso oxygen species, elevated expression of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso may provide a good model for studying cell wall integrity sensing in zzso However, much remains to be discovered about this sensing zzso
