To investigate the influence on zzso zzso zzso 3, 9, and 13 levels of human zzso cartilage cells after blocking zzso cell derived factor 1 zzso zzso 4 zzso signaling zzso with zzso and to define the function mechanism of zzso 

A total of 144 cartilage blocks from 12 zzso zzso patients undergoing total knee zzso zzso cartilage zzso and 144 normal cartilage blocks zzso score of 0 or 1) from 12 patients undergoing traumatic zzso zzso cartilage zzso zzso cartilage group was further divided into zzso zzso zzso and zzso and normal cartilage group into zzso zzso zzso and zzso The cartilage zzso were cultured in zzso solution containing 100 zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso zzso in zzso A, 100 zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso zzso in zzso B, and 100 zzso zzso in zzso C, zzso The levels of zzso 9, and 13 were measured by zzso the expressions of zzso 9, and zzso were tested by zzso 

zzso and zzso results showed that the levels of zzso 9, and 13 and the expressions of zzso 9, and 13 zzso were significantly lower in zzso A than in zzso B and C at the same time points zzso zzso zzso the levels of zzso 9, and 13 and the expressions of zzso 9, and 13 zzso were significantly higher in zzso cartilage group than in normal cartilage group at the same time points zzso zzso zzso 

zzso could induce zzso and release of zzso 9, and 13 in the zzso cartilage through the zzso signaling zzso zzso could reduce the zzso expressions and zzso of zzso 9, and 13 in zzso cartilage by blocking the zzso signaling zzso but zzso could not make the zzso of zzso 9, and 13 return to normal levels in zzso zzso
