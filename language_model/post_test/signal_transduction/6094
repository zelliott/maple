zzso stimulates the disposal of blood zzso into skeletal muscle and zzso zzso by the zzso of zzso from zzso pools to the plasma zzso and consequently the concentration of blood zzso levels decreases rapidly in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso play a pivotal role in the stimulation of zzso transport by insulin, but detailed mechanisms are zzso We and others reported that not only insulin but also zzso growth factor zzso and zzso growth factor facilitate zzso zzso through zzso zzso by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in cultured zzso However, opposite results were also zzso We generated transgenic mice that specifically express the zzso zzso in skeletal zzso In these mice, zzso zzso zzso transport into skeletal muscle in zzso and in zzso Thus, zzso apparently shares with insulin some of the signaling molecules needed for the stimulation of zzso zzso The degree of zzso zzso in zzso reached approximately zzso of that by insulin injection in skeletal muscle, but blood zzso levels were not decreased by zzso in these zzso zzso zzso disposal of blood zzso into skeletal muscle is insufficient for rapid decrease of blood zzso zzso
