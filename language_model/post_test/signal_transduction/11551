Over the past ten years, our knowledge of the integral role that the zzso zzso zzso and their zzso zzso products zzso zzso zzso play in the mediation of signal zzso zzso zzso and membrane trafficking has expanded zzso They are now known to be involved in the regulation of cell growth, zzso mobility, proliferation and survival and hence they have become a potential target for the control of the growth and spread of cancer zzso More recently, the correlation of the zzso of zzso (both zzso and zzso within the different classes of the zzso with their functional relevance has become zzso This, combined with our further understanding of the protein recognition patterns for their different zzso and the zzso pathways in the control of the levels of these by zzso has provided new aspects and areas for interference in these multiple zzso zzso zzso However, in the search for effective, zzso drugs for use in the treatment of zzso these individual targets for zzso zzso need to be further correlated with the specific in zzso effects on cell survival, zzso and zzso zzso Here, the range of zzso zzso targets are discussed in the light of recent experimental findings, with a view to the exploitation of their zzso in new approaches to effective cancer treatments based on zzso activity zzso
