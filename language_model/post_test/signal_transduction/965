To determine whether carotid artery zzso was increased in patients with zzso essential hypertension who are zzso for the T zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene and in zzso mice carrying three copies of the zzso zzso zzso 

Using zzso systems, we studied carotid mechanical properties in 98 zzso zzso patients according to their zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso 

Patients zzso for the T zzso had a reduced carotid zzso and an increased zzso of the carotid wall material zzso elastic zzso independent of blood pressure, compared with patients zzso for the M zzso In zzso mice, carotid zzso was not significantly different from that of zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso of the zzso wall material was lower in zzso mice than in zzso zzso In zzso mice, the greater blood pressure was not associated with zzso zzso resulting in a greater zzso wall zzso The zzso and zzso zzso responses to zzso II were reduced in zzso mice, whereas the zzso response to zzso was not significantly different between zzso and zzso mice, indicating the integrity of the zzso apparatus and suggesting a dysfunction of the zzso II type 1 zzso zzso pathways in zzso zzso 

These data suggest that the zzso zzso zzso at position 235 could be a genetic marker for zzso zzso in patients with zzso hypertension, whereas in zzso mice the dysfunction of the zzso II type 1 zzso zzso pathways could explain the lack of zzso wall zzso and zzso
