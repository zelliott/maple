zzso and related compounds are suspected of causing neurological disruption in human and experimental animal offspring following zzso exposure during development and zzso The molecular zzso of the actions in the brain, however, have not been fully zzso A major participant in the process of the zzso is the zzso zzso namely the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso regulates the zzso of diverse genes through binding to the zzso element zzso Since the zzso has also been detected in various regions of the brain, the zzso may play a key role in the zzso zzso of zzso This study focused on the effect of zzso zzso in the developing zzso 

The influence of the zzso on the developing zzso was assessed using the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso was zzso zzso with zzso zzso and the established cell line was named zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells was confirmed using zzso with zzso suppressing the expression of zzso zzso The neurological properties of zzso based on zzso zzso were evaluated by zzso analysis of zzso molecules and by zzso analysis of zzso expression of zzso related zzso such as zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cells exhibited constant zzso of the zzso zzso zzso a typical zzso zzso zzso was induced without the application of zzso to the culture zzso zzso cells exhibited two significant functional zzso zzso zzso cells bore spontaneous zzso exhibiting zzso properties with the zzso of zzso In addition, zzso expression was increased in comparison to the control cell zzso The other is the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso as a functional marker of zzso neurotransmitter zzso Thus, zzso zzso induced zzso differentiation in zzso zzso 

The excessive zzso of zzso resulted in neural differentiation of zzso zzso This result revealed that zzso may affect the nervous system through the zzso zzso zzso zzso may disrupt the strictly regulated brain formation with irregular differentiation occurring rather than cell zzso
