Evidence is presented that distinct cellular signal zzso pathways involving zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso gene zzso through common as well as distinct zzso elements and zzso zzso When zzso and expressed in zzso and zzso zzso cells, fusion reporter plasmids that differ only by a single base deletion or addition to zzso the zzso zzso element zzso zzso to form the zzso zzso zzso element zzso zzso are zzso regulated by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso directed by the zzso is zzso by zzso and not zzso although the zzso expression zzso by this element in zzso and zzso cells is zzso by zzso protein zzso zzso In contrast, zzso mediates zzso responses to both zzso and zzso and the two agents together give synergistic zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso by expression of a zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso the response of zzso to zzso alone as well as the zzso component of the synergistic response to treatment with both zzso and zzso zzso of the protein zzso dependent zzso by prolonged exposure of cells to zzso zzso eliminates the zzso zzso by zzso and zzso the zzso component of the synergistic response to both zzso and zzso zzso both protein zzso A and C, are involved in zzso zzso by the zzso the function of either zzso alone results in a moderate level of activity, but the combined results of both functionally zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso using whole extracts of zzso cells indicate that a common zzso binds both zzso and zzso however, another zzso that binds to the zzso will not bind to the zzso Further, a zzso regulatory zzso element zzso located upstream of the zzso in the human alpha zzso zzso although inactive when paired alone with the alpha 100 promoter, zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity of both zzso and zzso on the average of zzso to zzso The data support the existence of a gene regulatory network consisting of related zzso elements and zzso proteins whose zzso activities are regulated by the zzso actions of protein zzso and zzso
