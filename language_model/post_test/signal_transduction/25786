The zzso zzso via its zzso zzso promotes increased survival of chronic zzso leukemia zzso B cells that express high levels of zzso protein zzso a zzso zzso zzso associated with aggressive zzso In this study, we investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms governing this zzso Although significant differences in the expression or turnover of zzso were not observed between zzso and zzso cell samples, zzso induced greater zzso zzso flux and stronger and more prolonged zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cells was blocked by zzso a small zzso inhibitor of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso cells were more sensitive than zzso zzso cells to the zzso effects of zzso in zzso at zzso that can readily be achieved in zzso The data suggest that zzso zzso cells may be more responsive to survival factors, like zzso that are elaborated by the leukemia zzso and this sensitivity could be exploited for the development of new treatments for patients with this zzso Moreover, zzso may have clinical activity for patients with zzso particularly those with zzso zzso
