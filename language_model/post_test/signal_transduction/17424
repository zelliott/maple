The zzso zzso zzso originally thought to signal merely through zzso zzso has recently been shown to also recruit and signal via zzso Following the discovery that the reference zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to be a partial zzso in zzso zzso we have identified additional biased zzso zzso that zzso couple to zzso or zzso zzso In this study, we explored zzso and zzso regions that are important for biased zzso zzso 

We evaluated a series of 48 zzso with subtle structural differences for their ability to induce zzso zzso protein zzso or zzso zzso zzso a zzso for zzso and zzso three-dimensional quantitative zzso relationship analysis correlated intrinsic activity values with structural zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso zzso model was used to identify zzso regions important for biased zzso zzso 

One zzso zzso with a zzso zzso on position zzso of the aromatic ring displayed an equal preference for the zzso and zzso zzso and was classified as unbiased zzso zzso The other 47 zzso were zzso zzso zzso activities of the unbiased as well as zzso zzso to induce zzso recruitment could be correlated with different zzso features and zzso zzso 

Small structural modifications resulted in diverse intrinsic activities for unbiased zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso features revealed efficacy hotspots responsible for zzso zzso This knowledge is useful for the design of zzso zzso with biased intrinsic activities and aids our understanding of the mechanism of zzso zzso
