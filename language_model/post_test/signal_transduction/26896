Despite its clinical significance, the mechanisms of joint zzso are zzso By combining zzso zzso for zzso sampling with zzso we show that the setting in which zzso zzso cells develop is distinct from adjacent growth plate zzso and is characterized by zzso of zzso such as zzso zzso zzso Using in zzso ex zzso and in zzso approaches, we show that low levels of zzso are essential for joint formation and contribute to proper growth plate zzso Mice lacking the zzso zzso in their limbs zzso which lack joint development and fail zzso zzso show zzso of zzso In zzso and ex zzso blockade of the sole zzso zzso zzso led to the rescue of joint formation and growth plate maturation in zzso but an acceleration of growth plate zzso in control zzso Our study characterized the zzso axis as an essential zzso for joint development and zzso zzso
