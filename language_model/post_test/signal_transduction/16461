zzso is one of the common side effects of many zzso agents targeting zzso zzso We previously reported the development of a new class of zzso zzso zzso inhibitor compounds that induce zzso in zzso Here, we demonstrated that a zzso zzso zzso 1 very rapidly reduced white blood cells in mice, only zzso after zzso zzso 1 induced death of peripheral blood cells or zzso resting zzso zzso ex zzso Cell death was induced very zzso after zzso of zzso suggesting that acute zzso observed in zzso might be, at least in part, due to direct zzso effects of zzso 1 on resting zzso While cell zzso zzso were not zzso the zzso terminal domain zzso of the largest zzso of zzso zzso II was zzso indicating zzso of zzso or zzso which zzso this domain, in resting zzso Indeed, the zzso inhibitor suppressed zzso zzso in resting cells at the dose required for cell death zzso zzso of zzso or zzso by zzso 1 was also confirmed by suppression of nuclear zzso B zzso zzso activity in the human cancer cell line zzso Interestingly, a zzso inhibitor with selectivity against zzso and zzso did not induce cell death in resting zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso possibly by zzso or zzso might be important for survival of resting zzso and that zzso zzso without zzso activity on these zzso might be an attractive agent for cancer zzso
