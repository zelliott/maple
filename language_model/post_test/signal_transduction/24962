The Ski and Sno zzso are components of a zzso complex containing the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This complex has been implicated in the zzso repression exerted by a number of zzso including nuclear hormone receptors and zzso Further more, Ski and Sno zzso regulate transforming growth zzso zzso signaling by recruiting this complex to zzso Here we show that loss of one copy of zzso increases zzso to zzso in zzso Mice lacking zzso died at an early stage of zzso and zzso was required for zzso zzso zzso zzso mice developed spontaneous zzso at a low frequency and showed an increased level of tumor formation relative to zzso mice when challenged with a chemical zzso zzso embryonic zzso had an increased zzso capacity and the introduction of activated zzso into these cells resulted in zzso zzso The B cells, T cells and embryonic zzso of zzso mice had a decreased sensitivity to zzso or cell cycle zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso acts as a tumor zzso at least in some types of zzso
