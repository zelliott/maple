In the present study, we examined whether zzso zzso a zzso protein that is specifically enriched in a brain, plays a role in obesity and zzso zzso signaling in zzso Upon aging, male zzso mice gained more body weight than male zzso zzso however, the daily amount of food intake was little zzso Rather, the obesity in male zzso mice was likely the result of decreased zzso rates, as indicated by lower oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide zzso zzso with this, zzso levels for the zzso zzso carrier zzso were reduced in brown zzso tissue of zzso zzso Although zzso mice showed increases in serum zzso levels, probably due to increased fat mass, the level of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of these mice was significantly zzso In addition, levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also reduced in the zzso of zzso zzso Because zinc released from zzso may activate zzso we examined whether zinc is involved in the zzso of zzso levels through the zzso of zzso zzso with this possibility, exposure of zzso cells to zinc activated zzso and induced zzso expression in an zzso zzso The present results demonstrate that zzso in the brain of male mice, particularly in the zzso may be involved in central zzso signaling and the zzso increase in peripheral energy zzso In addition to providing insight into the role of zinc and zzso in the development of zzso this new information may help design ways to overcome the pervasive problem of zzso
