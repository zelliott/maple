We previously reported that zzso zzso which is highly expressed in poorly zzso zzso cells, zzso the zzso zzso of zzso cells and that the zzso potential of zzso cells is completely suppressed by enforced zzso expression zzso et zzso zzso J Cancer zzso We recently discovered that zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso cell zzso In the present study, the zzso zzso of zzso cells was found to be zzso that of zzso zzso This zzso of zzso zzso which were produced by zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso decreased with increases in their zzso expression and zzso induced almost no zzso in zzso zzso cells, indicating that zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The expression of the zzso zzso zzso on zzso cells, zzso cells, zzso and a zzso was almost the zzso The level of zzso zzso of zzso after zzso stimulation in zzso cells, zzso zzso cells and a zzso zzso was significantly lower than in zzso cells and a zzso These findings suggested that zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso cells through suppression of zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells, a human zzso cell line, were used to investigate whether zzso interferes with other cancer cells expressing zzso zzso cells did not express zzso zzso induced cell scattering of zzso cells and the scattering was inhibited by zzso the cells with zzso The zzso in the cells was zzso by stimulation with zzso but after treating the cells with zzso the zzso zzso of zzso was zzso These results suggest that zzso acts as a negative regulator of zzso in cancer zzso
