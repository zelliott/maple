Emerging evidence indicates that zzso can regulate both the physiology and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso In the current study, Western zzso analysis showed that in rat zzso zzso cultures the signal zzso zzso activated by zzso a zzso expressed in the normal brain and at elevated levels during zzso involves a zzso coupled zzso zzso zzso as well as its immediate upstream zzso zzso and the downstream zzso factor zzso zzso 1/2 and the zzso factors zzso and zzso do not play a prominent zzso zzso also altered zzso influx and synaptic network activity in the zzso zzso These results suggest an important role for zzso zzso and zzso in zzso actions of zzso
