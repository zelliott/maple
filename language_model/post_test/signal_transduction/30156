Although it is known that the zzso family zzso zzso Lyn zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso signaling by zzso of the zzso zzso regulation of Lyn zzso activity and its consequences for zzso signaling are incompletely zzso Using a zzso zzso we show an increased zzso of the Lyn zzso regulatory zzso and decreased Lyn zzso activity during zzso zzso zzso mast cell zzso zzso zzso defective in the zzso zzso zzso zzso several zzso in resting cells, but did not cause zzso zzso zzso zzso or spontaneous zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling in the presence of zzso active Lyn exhibited enhanced zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso 1 and zzso gamma 2, and production of zzso zzso Although zzso activities of zzso gamma 1 and zzso gamma 2 were also zzso amounts of zzso zzso zzso of zzso calcium and zzso were zzso Additionally, zzso active Lyn was zzso less efficient than zzso Lyn in restoring the zzso calcium responses in bone zzso mast cells derived from zzso zzso These findings pinpoint the tight regulation of Lyn zzso activity as a critical event in mast cell zzso
