The zzso upper lip forms from initially freely projecting zzso zzso zzso and lateral zzso zzso at the zzso and lateral boundaries of the primitive oral zzso These facial zzso arise during early zzso from zzso zzso neural crest cells in combination with the head zzso and zzso and undergo directed growth and expansion around the zzso pits to actively fuse with each zzso zzso fusion is between lateral and zzso zzso processes and is followed by fusion between zzso and zzso zzso zzso Fusion between these zzso involves active zzso zzso and adhering interactions as well as programmed cell zzso Slight defects in growth and patterning of the facial zzso or zzso fusion result in zzso lip with or without zzso zzso the most common and disfiguring zzso birth zzso Recent studies of zzso development in animal models have identified components of several major signaling zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that are critical for proper zzso zzso and/or lip zzso There is also accumulating evidence that these signaling pathways zzso genetically as well as zzso zzso to control cell proliferation and tissue zzso This review will zzso the current understanding of the basic zzso processes and molecular mechanisms underlying upper lip development and discuss the complex interactions of the various signaling pathways and challenges for understanding zzso lip zzso
