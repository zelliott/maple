zzso zzso transport zzso which results from the zzso of zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso is completely blocked after prolonged insulin treatment of zzso zzso Since zzso 4 expression was reduced by only zzso we looked at the insulin signaling zzso in this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the major insulin zzso zzso zzso 1 was reduced by 50 zzso zzso while its expression was decreased by 70 zzso zzso When cells were treated with zzso (a zzso zzso together with insulin, the expression of zzso 1 diminished to a much lower zzso Associated with the decrease in zzso 1 expression and zzso the zzso by insulin of zzso zzso zzso activity and of zzso activities was zzso However, the expression of these proteins was normal and zzso activity remained responsive to the zzso promoter zzso Those results indicate that prolonged insulin treatment of zzso zzso zzso an zzso state with a reduced ability of insulin to stimulate the zzso and the zzso and a blockade of zzso zzso zzso
