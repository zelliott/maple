The efficient in zzso folding of many zzso proteins is a major bottleneck of high level production in bacterial hosts and simple zzso protocols have not been available zzso zzso inclusion body zzso based processes play a major role as a potential strategy for the production of complex zzso zzso These processes combine the advantages of a high zzso of the target protein in zzso bacteria such as zzso coli, efficient strategies for zzso isolation, zzso and in zzso protein zzso without the need of complicated zzso zzso Recent advances in the molecular physiology of zzso formation and zzso allow zzso zzso of zzso processes to obtain a high-quality zzso In addition, simple strategies have been developed to zzso the zzso and zzso of zzso bond containing proteins making a fast transfer of such processes into the industrial production scale zzso
