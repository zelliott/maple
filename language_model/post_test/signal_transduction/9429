Although normal breast tissue and breast cancer zzso are known to be elevated compared with plasma zzso levels, the mechanism behind this phenomenon has been an issue of debate for 2 zzso If local zzso zzso were to be confirmed as the main zzso source in breast cancer zzso zzso zzso of zzso production, avoiding systemic side effects, would become a potentially attractive option for breast cancer treatment and zzso Based on recent results from our groups exploring tissue zzso together with zzso and zzso gene expression levels, we propose a new model to explain elevated breast tissue zzso zzso Although local zzso production may be important, the local contribution is overruled by rapid zzso zzso including active zzso of circulating zzso or enhanced tissue zzso As for breast cancer tissue levels, elevated levels of zzso may be explained to a large extent by zzso zzso binding and local conversion of zzso into zzso This model indicates that effective suppression of benign and zzso tissue zzso as a treatment for zzso breast cancer requires systemic suppression and will not be markedly affected by local zzso zzso
