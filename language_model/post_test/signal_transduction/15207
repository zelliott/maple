The zzso of zzso and zzso activity is central to disorders such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso Numerous studies have shown explicit functions for bone zzso proteins zzso in zzso Their signaling activity has been shown in various contexts to be regulated by zzso zzso including Twisted zzso zzso However, experimental zzso determining the effects of zzso regulators on bone zzso are zzso In this study, we assessed the role of zzso in zzso bone zzso zzso zzso mice developed zzso that could not be explained by defective zzso function, because mineral zzso rate and differentiation markers were not significantly different compared with zzso zzso zzso Instead, we discovered a striking enhancement of zzso in zzso mice, leading to increased bone zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice was caused by increased cell fusion, zzso and function of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels were enhanced when zzso zzso were treated with zzso zzso suggesting direct regulation of zzso differentiation by zzso zzso in zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso was noted in zzso from zzso mice compared with zzso zzso Furthermore, the enhanced zzso in zzso mice was reversed in zzso in a zzso manner with exposure to zzso a zzso zzso strongly suggesting that the enhanced zzso in zzso zzso is attributable to increased zzso zzso Thus, we present a novel and previously zzso role for zzso in zzso zzso through regulation of zzso zzso
