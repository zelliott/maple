Several studies have shown zzso functions of zzso zzso a novel zzso However, the role of zzso in cancer development has not been zzso In this study, we showed that zzso inhibited tumor growth in zzso transgenic mice zzso with melanoma as well as colon tumor growth in zzso nude mice zzso with zzso colon cancer cells zzso The zzso effect of zzso on tumor growth was associated with the zzso of zzso activated nuclear zzso zzso zzso and of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso The expression of zzso cell proliferation and zzso genes zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso protein zzso cellular zzso and cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4, zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso was zzso whereas the expression of zzso target genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso and blood, the number of zzso zzso T cells and zzso natural killer cells and the levels of zzso increased, but that of tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We also found that forced zzso of zzso inhibited colon cancer cell zzso and zzso growth accompanied with the zzso of activated zzso and zzso in zzso In addition, when zzso was knocked down by small interfering zzso zzso or neutralized with an zzso zzso zzso colon cancer cell growth zzso the zzso decrease of zzso zzso and zzso production, and the increase of zzso production were zzso However, zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso colon cancer cell growth zzso These findings indicate significant zzso roles of zzso in cancer zzso
