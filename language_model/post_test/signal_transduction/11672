We report the effect of heat shock on zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein was significantly suppressed in both zzso zzso and zzso cells after heat shock at 43 degrees zzso The binding activity of nuclear factor zzso B zzso zzso was reduced by prior heat zzso zzso did not induce degradation of the zzso protein zzso B alpha in the shocked cells, which might be a potential mechanism to block zzso B zzso Furthermore, transient zzso zzso in zzso cells demonstrated that zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso B zzso was highly sensitive to heat zzso These data suggest that heat shock influences expression of zzso through the zzso zzso B zzso
