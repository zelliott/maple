zzso is associated with a pronounced zzso response in skeletal muscle, mainly reflecting degradation of the zzso proteins zzso and zzso Recent studies suggest that zzso muscle zzso may reflect zzso protein zzso An apparently conflicting observation is that the zzso zzso does not degrade intact zzso Thus, it is possible that zzso and zzso need to be released from the zzso before they can be zzso and zzso by the zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso results in disruption of zzso increased expression of zzso and zzso release of zzso in skeletal zzso zzso induced in rats by zzso zzso and puncture resulted in increased gene expression of zzso zzso and zzso and in zzso disintegration in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The release of zzso from zzso proteins was increased in septic zzso This response to zzso was blocked by treating the rats with zzso a substance that zzso the release of calcium from zzso stores to the zzso The present results provide evidence that zzso is associated with zzso disintegration and a zzso release of zzso in skeletal zzso zzso of zzso may be an initial and perhaps zzso component of zzso muscle zzso
