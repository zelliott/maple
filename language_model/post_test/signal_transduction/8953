zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that has diverse functions in zzso zzso zzso that reduce zzso can have zzso effects on growth, development, zzso zzso zzso stress resistance and zzso zzso is also modified by zzso zzso For instance, in the zzso zzso zzso both nutrition and stress can alter the activity of the zzso Here, we test zzso the hypothesis that a widespread zzso of zzso zzso zzso can alter the degree to which zzso in genes zzso zzso components affect zzso and its zzso zzso zzso infection, which is widespread in zzso zzso in nature and has been estimated to zzso 30 per cent of strains in the Bloomington stock zzso can affect broad aspects of insect zzso particularly traits associated with zzso We measured a range of zzso zzso in flies zzso zzso for zzso in the presence and absence of zzso We show that removal of zzso further reduces zzso and hence enhances the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso normally acts to increase insulin zzso This effect of zzso infection on zzso could have an evolutionary explanation, and has some implications for studies of zzso in zzso and other organisms that zzso zzso
