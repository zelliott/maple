zzso radiation is the major zzso responsible for skin zzso thus zzso of the molecular pathways altered in skin in response to zzso would reveal novel targets for therapeutic zzso It is well established that zzso leads to zzso of zzso 2 zzso in the skin which contributes to skin zzso zzso of zzso has been shown to promote colon cancer cell growth through zzso zzso however, little is known about the connection between zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso In the present study, we have identified a novel zzso in which zzso zzso zzso signaling in zzso which is modulated by zzso zzso Exposure of the mouse 308 zzso cell line zzso zzso and primary normal human zzso zzso zzso to zzso resulted in increased protein levels of both zzso zzso and total zzso In addition, we found that zzso zzso zzso reporter activity and expression of a downstream zzso target zzso We demonstrated that zzso zzso signaling is modulated by zzso as treatment of zzso with the specific zzso inhibitor zzso blocked zzso induction of zzso Additionally, zzso target gene expression was reduced in zzso zzso knockout zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso from zzso zzso mice exhibited increased zzso zzso and total zzso protein levels and increased zzso for total zzso and both responses were reduced in zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest a novel zzso in which zzso zzso zzso signaling in zzso which is enhanced by zzso zzso
