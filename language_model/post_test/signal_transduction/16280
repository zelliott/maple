We investigated the zzso of sexual identity in the budding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are divided into the zzso and the zzso Most zzso have two mating zzso one (called zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso produces a small, zzso zzso zzso and the other (a in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso produces a zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso group that makes it very zzso In the zzso all zzso are zzso and this difference zzso distinguishing feature between the zzso We asked whether the asymmetry in zzso modification is required for successful mating in zzso 

We cloned zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and a zzso and expressed these in the budding zzso zzso zzso to generate novel, alternative mating zzso We find that two zzso cells can mate even when both cells zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso this is true regardless of whether the cells express the zzso or zzso zzso which control zzso of other, zzso zzso in addition to the zzso and zzso zzso 

We demonstrate that the zzso zzso modification is not required for successful mating of zzso zzso and confirm that, in budding zzso the primary zzso of mating are the specificity of the receptors and their corresponding zzso
