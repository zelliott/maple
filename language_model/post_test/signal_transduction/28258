Many plant zzso zzso and zzso processes are zzso at least in part, by zzso zzso In particular, zzso in the availability of soluble zzso such as zzso and zzso help regulate a diverse array of zzso Multiple lines of evidence indicate that many of these processes are also regulated in response to other zzso zzso such as zzso This review draws examples from a variety of plant systems, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso Five of the most interesting and best developed examples of processes regulated via zzso or zzso between zzso and zzso are zzso including zzso seed zzso early zzso development, zzso and the regulation of zzso zzso The types of mechanisms by which different response pathways are known or zzso to interact are also zzso These mechanisms include regulation of the metabolism and/or transport of a zzso zzso by a different response zzso For example, zzso have been zzso to help regulate the zzso zzso and/or transport of zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso acid, zzso and zzso have been shown to help regulate sugar metabolism and/or zzso Similarly, zzso have been shown to regulate the expression of components of zzso pathways and zzso regulate the expression of some genes zzso possible components of zzso zzso Examples of proteins and second zzso that appear to act in multiple response pathways are also zzso
