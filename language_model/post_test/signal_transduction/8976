The zzso signaling zzso is regarded as one of the main regulators of neural stem cell behavior during development, but its role in the adult brain is less well zzso We found that zzso was mainly expressed in zzso zzso cells corresponding to newborn zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso was predominantly expressed in zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso cells in the zzso zone zzso of the normal adult zzso These findings were confirmed by conditional depletion of zzso cells in transgenic mice carrying zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso under the control of the zzso zzso In addition, the activated form of zzso zzso zzso domain, zzso and its downstream zzso targets, zzso and sonic zzso zzso were also expressed in zzso zzso Increased zzso of zzso signaling increased zzso cell zzso whereas zzso zzso signaling resulted in a reduction of zzso cells in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were increased in the zzso at 4 and 24 h after focal cerebral zzso Finally, zzso cell proliferation in the zzso was blocked by zzso of the zzso signaling pathway, suggesting that zzso signaling may have a key role in normal adult and zzso zzso
