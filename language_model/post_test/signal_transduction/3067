zzso zzso cells can respond to certain bacteria by producing an array of zzso and zzso which are associated with host immune zzso zzso zzso zzso is a characterized zzso originally isolated from human zzso This study aimed to test the ability of zzso zzso zzso to stimulate zzso and zzso production in zzso zzso cells and to zzso the mechanisms involved in their zzso In experiments using zzso zzso cell lines and mouse models, we observed that zzso zzso zzso could rapidly but zzso zzso a number of zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and that zzso showed lower expression levels with zzso zzso zzso treatment than zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso could activate a zzso molecular pattern zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso zzso cell lines was also enhanced by zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso and zzso production in the zzso zzso cell lines zzso by zzso zzso zzso suggesting that both zzso and zzso zzso signaling pathways were important for the production of zzso and zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso
