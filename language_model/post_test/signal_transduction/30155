In this study we set out to test whether zzso was required for negative selection of immature B zzso B cells expressing a B cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso underwent negative selection independently of zzso in both fetal liver organ culture and radiation zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso negative selection was not reversed by transgenic zzso of zzso zzso editing was not apparent in zzso B cells, presumably as a consequence of the failure of mature edited B cells to develop in the absence of zzso Interestingly, light chain zzso exclusion by the zzso zzso failed in the absence of zzso We observed a dramatic reduction in the overall zzso zzso zzso of cellular proteins in zzso immature B zzso However, the zzso zzso of a number of zzso including zzso C gamma 2, although reduced, was not completely zzso zzso zzso triggered an increase in calcium flux in the absence of zzso Thus signaling events that mediate negative selection can still occur in the absence of zzso This may be due to zzso with zzso protein 70 zzso which we demonstrate to be expressed in immature B zzso
