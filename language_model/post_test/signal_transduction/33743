Plasma membrane zzso during zzso involves both zzso zzso and zzso membrane zzso zzso membrane delivery from the recycling zzso zzso has an essential but zzso involvement in zzso In the zzso zzso early zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso which is essential for zzso function, is required for zzso and membrane integrity during zzso zzso We find that in zzso zzso zzso an initial loss of zzso at the zzso is followed by loss of the associated zzso zzso zzso zzso treated with zzso A or zzso inhibitor display similar zzso zzso or zzso increase of zzso zzso or genetically zzso decrease of zzso zzso suppresses the zzso zzso zzso and membrane zzso We also find that zzso does not properly zzso at the zzso in zzso zzso zzso and that zzso zzso components show strong specific genetic interactions with zzso We propose a model in which zzso zzso promote zzso integrity by regulating the rate of zzso zzso through the zzso zzso
