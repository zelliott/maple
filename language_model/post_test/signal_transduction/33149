We investigated the zzso operation and function of the zzso zzso using a comparative zzso analysis and behavioral experiments in zzso zzso architecture was documented in a series of zzso to identify evolutionary zzso features of zzso zzso As a result of this analysis, we distinguish between a frontal zzso system and zzso system of the zzso zzso The latter was invariably comprised of whiskers aligned in regular zzso In each row, whiskers were oriented perpendicular to the zzso zzso zzso all shared a specific zzso zzso In all species, progressing from zzso to zzso in any zzso row, there was a precisely exponential increase in zzso zzso Each zzso appeared to act as a zzso zzso providing information as to whether or zzso not zzso individual zzso had been zzso The zzso frontal zzso system was found to have a zzso tip density that was about 40 times higher than that of the zzso zzso In behavioral studies spatial tasks and object recognition tasks were used to investigate zzso search zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso object recognition zzso and zzso effects of selective zzso or zzso removal on task zzso A clear distinction between the functional roles of zzso and zzso was demonstrated in these zzso zzso zzso were critically involved in spatial tasks, but were not essential for object zzso zzso were critically involved in object recognition tasks, but were not essential for spatial zzso A synthesis of these zzso and behavioral data led to the following functional zzso The zzso zzso row is a distance zzso Its function is to derive head centered zzso contours at the various zzso angles represented by zzso zzso This distance detector model is functionally very different from traditional concepts of zzso function, in which the zzso whiskers were hypothesized to form a fine grain zzso zzso tactile zzso
