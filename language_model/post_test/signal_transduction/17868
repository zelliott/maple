In both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, diabetic complications in target zzso arise from chronic zzso of zzso The zzso effect of high zzso possibly in concert with fatty zzso is zzso to a significant extent via increased production of zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso nitrogen species zzso and subsequent zzso zzso zzso and zzso directly zzso and damage DNA, zzso and zzso In addition to their ability to directly inflict damage on zzso zzso and zzso indirectly induce damage to zzso by zzso a number of cellular zzso zzso These pathways include nuclear zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso In addition, there is evidence that in type 2 diabetes, the zzso of these same pathways by zzso in zzso and free fatty acid zzso levels leads to both insulin resistance and impaired insulin zzso zzso we propose here that the zzso and possibly zzso zzso of stress pathways plays a key role in the development of not only the late complications in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, but also the insulin resistance and impaired insulin zzso seen in type 2 zzso
