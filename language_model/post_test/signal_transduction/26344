To compare the effects of dietary fibers on zzso cellular signaling in zzso 

Mice were randomly divided into four groups zzso zzso zzso high-fat diet zzso control, zzso zzso and zzso fiber zzso zzso All mice were fed a zzso with or without zzso dietary fiber zzso for 12 zzso Body weight, food zzso zzso zzso and zzso insulin levels were zzso At the end of the study, zzso zzso growth factor zzso 21, zzso protein zzso zzso and insulin signaling protein content were zzso 

zzso zzso content was significantly zzso but zzso zzso growth factor zzso 1, zzso growth factor zzso 3, and zzso zzso zzso alpha proteins were significantly increased in the zzso group compared with those in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso supplementation also significantly enhanced insulin and zzso zzso as well as decreased zzso zzso and cholesterol in comparison with the zzso zzso The study has shown that dietary zzso especially zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso in the liver by enhancing zzso zzso insulin, and zzso signaling in mice fed a zzso 

This study suggests that the zzso of gastrointestinal factors by dietary fibers may play a key role in both enhancing zzso multiple cellular signaling and reducing zzso zzso
