The zzso zzso zzso Lyn mediates zzso zzso function in B cells and zzso cells, and zzso mice spontaneously develop an zzso and inflammatory disease that closely resembles human systemic lupus zzso zzso pathways have been implicated in the production of zzso zzso in systemic lupus zzso and mouse models of zzso We used a conditional zzso of zzso to determine whether the zzso of zzso mice is dependent on zzso signaling in B cells and/or in zzso cells zzso The production of zzso zzso zzso as well as the deposition of these zzso in the zzso of the zzso leading to zzso in zzso mice, were completely abolished by selective deletion of zzso in B cells, and zzso production and zzso were delayed or decreased by deletion of zzso in zzso The reduced zzso production in mice lacking zzso in B cells or zzso was accompanied by a dramatic decrease in the spontaneous zzso center zzso response, suggesting that zzso in zzso mice may depend on zzso zzso zzso with this view, zzso zzso zzso were absent if T cells were deleted zzso zzso zzso or if T cells were unable to contribute to zzso responses as the result of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso mice was dependent on T cells and on zzso signaling in B cells and in zzso supporting a model in which DC zzso combines with defects in tolerance in B cells to lead to a T zzso systemic zzso in zzso zzso
