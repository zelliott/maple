zzso is a zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso In this study, we examine the zzso mechanisms of action, zzso and toxicity of zzso in zzso and in zzso In zzso zzso testing of zzso was conducted using two aggressive zzso including the lung cancer cell line, zzso and breast cancer cell line, zzso The zzso combination of zzso zzso and zzso displayed potent zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso the drug combination inhibited both the zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso was advanced into tumor zzso models for assessment of zzso zzso and mechanisms of zzso In zzso a zzso schedule of zzso inhibited zzso and zzso tumor growth far more zzso than zzso zzso and zzso tumor cures in zzso zzso zzso zzso growth delays resulted from a doubling in tumor cell zzso and a 50% reduction in tumor cell proliferation compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso efficacy was achieved without clinically significant increases in acute zzso Thus, zzso displays potent synergistic activity in zzso and zzso activity in zzso with comparable toxicity to zzso These observations provide strong support for further development of zzso and an important proof of concept for safe, effective zzso delivery of three complementary zzso zzso
