To investigate the correlation between zzso protein zzso zzso signal zzso zzso and zzso resistance zzso in zzso zzso 

Western zzso was used to analyze the expression of zzso associated gene in transient zzso zzso induced zzso cells, which were treated with or without the specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso analysis of the cells treated by VCR with or without zzso was determined by zzso zzso The cell cycle analysis was performed by using flow zzso zzso and the drug sensitivity of zzso cells which were exposed to VCR with or without zzso was tested by using zzso zzso 

zzso exposure to VCR induced zzso but not zzso or zzso expression in zzso cells and the expression of zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso bodies were found in the cells treated with VCR or zzso zzso results indicated that more zzso cells showed zzso zzso when treated by VCR and zzso zzso zzso than treated by VCR only zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells zzso with VCR was zzso as that of negative control group zzso zzso and zzso as that of the group treated with zzso zzso zzso 

This study shows that the expression of zzso can be induced by transient exposure to VCR and this induction can be prevented by zzso which can block the activity of zzso zzso signal zzso zzso may play some roles in modulating zzso expression in gastric zzso
