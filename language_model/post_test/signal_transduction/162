zzso zzso zzso zzso are among the most potent factors regulating cardiac zzso zzso zzso 43 zzso the zzso zzso protein in the heart, has an indispensable role in modulating cardiac electric activities by affecting zzso zzso The present study investigates the effects of short-term stimulation of zzso zzso on zzso expression and gap junction zzso communication zzso zzso 

The level of zzso expression in zzso rat zzso zzso was detected by a Western zzso zzso The zzso function was evaluated by scrape zzso transfer zzso 

zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso for 5 zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso protein level, but not total zzso Selective zzso inhibitor zzso zzso but not zzso inhibitor zzso could fully abolish the zzso Moreover, zzso with both protein zzso A inhibitor zzso and zzso protein inhibitor zzso toxin also inhibited the zzso increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is accompanied with enhanced zzso zzso 

Taken together, zzso stimulation increases the expression of zzso zzso thereby enhancing the gating function of gap junctions in cardiac zzso in both a protein zzso A- and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
