In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transmission and is required for zzso long-term zzso at zzso zzso By using a combination of zzso zzso with zzso zzso proteins and zzso resonance energy transfer, we have reported that the zzso forms a zzso complex with the zzso zzso zzso and that this mechanism is crucial to recruit the zzso to the zzso zzso By using zzso and zzso zzso we also demonstrated that the interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso with zzso could represent a novel regulatory mechanism modulating zzso cellular trafficking and zzso
