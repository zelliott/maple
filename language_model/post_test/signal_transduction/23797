Changes in gene expression are the main outcome of hormone signaling zzso that widely control plant zzso In the case of the hormones zzso the zzso control is exerted through the activity of the zzso zzso which act as negative regulators in the signaling zzso This review focuses on recent zzso approaches in the context of zzso zzso which have provided useful information on new processes regulated by these hormones such as the regulation of photosynthesis and zzso Moreover, the enrichment of specific zzso among zzso primary targets has also helped extend the view that zzso proteins regulate gene expression through the interaction with multiple zzso factors from different zzso
