We investigated a genetic zzso in root hair development in zzso zzso involving the zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso exchange factors for zzso zzso and zzso and the small zzso zzso of plants zzso zzso and zzso analyses demonstrated distinct roles of zzso and zzso such that zzso is only important for root hair zzso while zzso mainly contributes to root hair zzso zzso dissection by zzso and zzso experiments indicated that their functional distinctions were mainly contributed by the zzso zzso Using fluorescent ratio imaging, we showed that functional loss of zzso and zzso zzso reduced zzso oxygen species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso and zzso had the same interaction specificity as zzso suggesting common downstream zzso We further showed that the promoting effects of environmental cues such as zzso zzso and zzso limitation on root hair development depended on zzso However, although functional loss of zzso and zzso largely abolished zzso zzso production, it did not compromise the responses to zzso environmental cues on root hair zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso and zzso are genetic components in zzso zzso (but not zzso zzso root hair zzso
