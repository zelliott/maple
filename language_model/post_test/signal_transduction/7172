zzso protein zzso zzso has been found promoting cell death under stress conditions, including cell death during brain zzso However, little is known about the mechanisms how zzso is involved in the zzso zzso process during zzso The present study was to examine the zzso signal zzso pathways using an zzso mimicking model, oxygen zzso deprivation zzso zzso was induced by zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso culture medium zzso with a mixture of zzso and zzso zzso expression was inhibited by zzso of zzso cells with zzso short hairpin zzso zzso Cell death induced by zzso exposure was assessed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressions were examined by Western zzso and protein interactions were detected with zzso followed by Western zzso zzso treatment resulted in zzso death and led to zzso zzso as demonstrated by increase of zzso zzso zzso and decrease of zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in turn led to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso stress zzso Further analyses showed that zzso zzso zzso expression through zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings revealed novel signal zzso pathways leading to zzso death in response to zzso
