The efficient functioning of the zzso is indispensable for most of the cellular activities and zzso zzso in the zzso functions of the zzso result in the zzso of a complex set of signaling pathways from the zzso to the zzso and nucleus, and these are collectively known as unfolded protein response zzso which is aimed to compensate damage and can eventually trigger cell death if zzso stress is severe or persists for a longer zzso The precise molecular mechanisms that facilitate this switch in brain damage have yet to be understood completely with multiple potential participants zzso The zzso zzso cell death pathways have been recognized in the numerous zzso conditions, such as diabetes, zzso zzso injury, and neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and bipolar zzso zzso there is an emerging need to study the basic molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso multiple cell zzso signaling zzso These molecules that regulate the zzso stress response would be potential drug targets in brain zzso
