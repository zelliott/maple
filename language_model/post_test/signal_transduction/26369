zzso zzso is a critical zzso of protein structure and function, regulating processes such as protein zzso stability and zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso plays a crucial role in the zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso of zzso was first demonstrated over a decade ago, it was unclear how this modification influenced zzso zzso In the present study, we show that zzso the zzso zzso process successfully zzso binding of zzso to zzso and subsequently renders cells resistant to zzso zzso The lung cancer cell line zzso the gastric zzso cell line zzso and the zzso cell line zzso zzso embryonic zzso exhibit reduced zzso zzso when either treated with two zzso including zzso (a potent zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso I family zzso or introduced with a zzso zzso version of zzso We demonstrate that defective zzso zzso prevents zzso proteins from being transported to the cell zzso Moreover, we clearly show that not only the complex type, but also a zzso type, of zzso can be localized on the cell zzso zzso these findings demonstrate that zzso zzso is essentially required for the successful cell surface transportation of zzso suggesting a novel mechanism by which the zzso sensitivity can be regulated by zzso zzso levels of zzso
