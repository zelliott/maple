zzso is a zzso growth factor that is required for zzso in the eye, ear, brain, and female zzso zzso It functions as an zzso zzso zzso by specifically binding to the zzso 4 zzso zzso Here we report the crystal structure of zzso which reveals a unique zzso structure with each zzso adopting a zzso zzso knot zzso zzso studies demonstrate that the novel zzso zzso interface is required for zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso contains separate binding sites for zzso and for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 5) or zzso Instead of inducing zzso zzso zzso zzso the formation of a zzso complex with zzso and zzso by binding to their respective zzso zzso These results provide crucial insights into the assembly and zzso of the zzso signaling zzso
