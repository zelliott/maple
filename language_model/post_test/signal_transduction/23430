zzso gut immunity is the first line of defense against oral zzso Although a few zzso molecules in insect zzso has been identified by zzso or zzso approach with comparison to well-studied zzso such as zzso or fat body, our knowledge about the molecular mechanism underlying the gut immunity which would involve a variety of unidentified molecules is still zzso To uncover additional molecules that might take part in pathogen recognition, signal zzso or immune regulation in insect zzso a zzso zzso display zzso library of the zzso zzso is zzso By use of different zzso for zzso zzso Controlled zzso zzso zzso has been zzso zzso is produced in zzso zzso cells and released into the gut zzso The protein level of zzso increases at the early time points during oral microbial infection and declines zzso In zzso binding zzso confirms its activity as a zzso binding zzso and it can further function as an zzso that promotes the zzso of zzso Moreover, it can induce the production of zzso zzso via a signaling zzso in which zzso is required and a dynamic zzso zzso of certain zzso membrane zzso Taken together, our results characterize zzso as a zzso protein involved in both the cellular and the zzso immune response of the zzso zzso zzso
