zzso muscle zzso is a very common clinical challenge in many disuse zzso Maintenance of muscle mass is crucial to combat debilitating functional consequences evoked from these clinical zzso In contrast, hibernation represents a zzso state in which there is natural protection against disuse zzso despite prolonged periods of zzso and lack of zzso zzso Even though zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a central zzso in muscle zzso zzso its role in the preservation of skeletal muscle mass during hibernation remains zzso Since zzso regulates muscle fiber type formation and zzso zzso we analyzed muscles of zzso ground zzso We find that animals in zzso exhibit a shift to zzso Type I muscle zzso This switch is accompanied by zzso of the zzso endurance exercise zzso In addition, we observe increased zzso capacity without evidence of zzso stress, a marked decline in zzso zzso and enhanced zzso abundance and zzso These results show that zzso of the endurance exercise zzso can be achieved in zzso despite prolonged periods of zzso and therefore might be an important mechanism for skeletal muscle preservation during zzso This zzso regulated zzso may be a potential therapeutic target promoting skeletal muscle zzso and zzso balance to prevent muscle loss in a variety of inherited and acquired zzso disease zzso
