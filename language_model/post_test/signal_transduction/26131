To investigate whether zzso zzso or zzso influence retinal zzso under zzso or pathological zzso 

Using the mouse model of zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso was zzso by quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso and localized in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was manipulated by zzso injection of zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso The zzso zzso zzso level of zzso increased significantly in the zzso phase zzso while zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed a significant - up to fivefold - increased expression at zzso the start of zzso visible zzso caused by relative zzso 

The zzso system is involved in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso using zzso and zzso respectively, enhanced zzso zzso In contrast, zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso is enhanced by zzso through both zzso zzso and zzso zzso The distinction in the expression zzso of zzso and zzso indicates that they govern two different zzso pathways and are regulated in diverse zzso zzso might be a useful drug for zzso zzso
