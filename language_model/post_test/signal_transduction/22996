Most zzso T zzso cells express a biased zzso repertoire that is positively selected by the zzso zzso class zzso zzso zzso The development of zzso zzso cells is zzso dependent but, in contrast to conventional T cells, requires positive selection by cells of zzso zzso Here, we show that the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is required for development of zzso zzso cells but not for the development of conventional T zzso In contrast, another zzso zzso zzso is required for the development of both zzso and T zzso zzso zzso cell development in zzso mice cannot be rescued by transgenic expression of zzso which is believed to increase the zzso of zzso recognition by zzso zzso Taken together, our data reveal a selective and zzso role for zzso in zzso cell zzso
