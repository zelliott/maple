zzso zzso zzso zzso cause zzso tissue damage and the skin to become zzso and zzso Here, we investigated the effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso expression in human skin zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso increases zzso expression and that this is zzso by zzso and zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso inhibited zzso zzso expression in a zzso manner, and also inhibited the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, inhibitions of zzso and zzso by zzso resulted in the decrease of zzso expression and zzso zzso induced by zzso respectively, which led to the zzso of zzso zzso DNA binding zzso This zzso effect of zzso on zzso was not zzso by an zzso zzso In conclusion, our results demonstrate that zzso can inhibit zzso zzso expression by zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potential agent for the prevention and treatment of skin zzso
