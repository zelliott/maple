The zzso is seeded by very small numbers of zzso cells that undergo massive proliferation before differentiation and zzso of zzso genes zzso Various signals mediate proliferation and differentiation of these cells, including zzso zzso zzso signals induce the interaction of the zzso zzso zzso with nuclear T cell factor zzso zzso zzso We identified target genes of the zzso zzso in the most immature zzso zzso using zzso DNA zzso in combination with three different functional zzso for in zzso induction of zzso zzso A relatively small number zzso 30) of genes changed zzso including several zzso zzso factors such as zzso and zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso but no genes involved in differentiation to mature T cell zzso The zzso molecules likely zzso the zzso immature zzso to the appropriate anatomical sites in the zzso For several of these target zzso we validated that they are true zzso target genes using real-time quantitative zzso and reporter gene zzso The same core set of genes was zzso in zzso mice, explaining the block in early zzso development in these zzso In conclusion, zzso signals mediate proliferation and cell zzso but not differentiation of the immature zzso zzso zzso
