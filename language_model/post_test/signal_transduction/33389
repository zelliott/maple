zzso is a small family of type II zzso proteins possessing zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed primarily on zzso zzso The function of these proteins is zzso We have developed zzso that recognize zzso family members on Western zzso zzso of cell extracts from zzso cell clones demonstrates that individual zzso family members are expressed on zzso of zzso zzso Because the zzso zzso do not react with the cell surface zzso signaling function was studied by generating cell lines that express a zzso zzso consisting of a zzso and zzso domain from zzso or zzso fused to the zzso segment of mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso of the rat zzso cell line, zzso were tested for the effect of zzso zzso on zzso activity against the zzso target cell lines, zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and calcium zzso in the zzso cell line expressing the zzso zzso zzso By contrast, zzso inhibited the zzso activity and failed to stimulate a calcium response in cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso selectively associates with the zzso zzso zzso but not with the zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso and zzso deliver, respectively, zzso and zzso zzso signals in zzso zzso
