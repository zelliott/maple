zzso zzso has been implicated in the signal zzso zzso leading to cell zzso Here we show that a zzso rat liver following partial zzso exhibited elevated zzso activity as shown by increased zzso of a subset of zzso proteins in zzso The zzso protein was shown to be a major zzso protein undergoing zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein peaked at 1 d following partial zzso which gradually declined to a zzso level within the next 14 zzso Likewise, zzso of zzso added bulk zzso followed the similar time zzso as the zzso zzso reflecting zzso changes in zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso of zzso added bulk zzso in the in zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso of zzso of the zzso zzso All the zzso zzso tested, zzso 1, zzso zzso 3 or 4, were able to inhibit zzso of the zzso protein while addition of zzso C, zzso zzso zzso bovine serum zzso and g zzso minimally affected zzso of the zzso zzso Since zzso of the zzso protein preceded proliferation of zzso upon partial zzso it is tempting to speculate that the zzso zzso protein by activated zzso zzso may be involved in an early signal critical for liver zzso
