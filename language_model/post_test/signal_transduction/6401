zzso zzso zzso produces a zzso range zzso called zzso which is a key zzso factor in rice grain rot and zzso in many field zzso Our molecular and genetic analyses of zzso zzso demonstrated that gene clusters for zzso production consist of four zzso zzso The zzso zzso genes were composed of five zzso zzso to zzso as zzso et zzso zzso reported zzso Genes zzso to zzso which are responsible for zzso zzso were zzso and similar to the genes for zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso reporter zzso we found that zzso a zzso regulator, regulates both the zzso and zzso zzso in the presence of zzso as a zzso In addition, the expression of both zzso required a zzso zzso zzso whose expression is regulated by zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso was responsible for the zzso of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso activated zzso zzso This is the first report that zzso sensing is involved in zzso by the regulation of zzso zzso and its transport in plant zzso zzso
