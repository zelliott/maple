The zzso protein belongs to the zzso gene family of zzso that are regulated by zzso zzso by zzso zzso regulation is accomplished by several pathways including zzso and zzso zzso We have expanded the analysis of zzso regulation in zzso zzso We used zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso cells and study the regulation of zzso upon stimulation with zzso zzso or upon zzso of the cells to immobilized zzso In addition, we studied the regulation of zzso activity by small zzso proteins of the zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso leads to a zzso zzso of zzso that is blocked by zzso This zzso requires the zzso zzso site present in the zzso loop of the zzso zzso in zzso and the zzso site present in a zzso domain at its zzso zzso in zzso which are targets for zzso regulation of zzso We tested whether zzso could be activated by zzso as it contains a putative zzso zzso We were unable to demonstrate a significant zzso of zzso by zzso stimulation under conditions where we detect zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso of zzso with activated small zzso proteins revealed that zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso However, this zzso was zzso insensitive and zzso zzso did not inhibit the zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso cells to immobilized zzso also leads to zzso of zzso However, it appears that the zzso zzso of zzso differs from zzso zzso in the fact that zzso zzso was blocked by zzso (or zzso whereas zzso was zzso The zzso zzso however, requires the intact zzso sites of zzso zzso of zzso with zzso results in increased activity in adherent cells compared with zzso zzso Since zzso failed to inhibit zzso zzso of zzso it suggests that zzso zzso is achieved by a parallel zzso zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso provides a link between zzso protection of zzso from zzso induced zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso of the zzso factor zzso induced by cell zzso is prevented by activated zzso suggesting that zzso regulates cell survival zzso In zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso could be achieved through signaling pathways involved in the regulation of cell survival, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso can be accomplished via zzso zzso pathways and by zzso zzso independent zzso In addition, zzso of zzso by the small zzso protein zzso has been zzso
