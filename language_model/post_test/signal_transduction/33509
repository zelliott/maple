We develop a new model that explains how the zzso may generate the timing in classical delay zzso zzso Recent studies show that both zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso zzso have parallel signal processing zzso with two time zzso an zzso zzso fast process and a zzso zzso zzso zzso slow zzso Moreover, one consistent finding is an increased zzso of PC zzso (in zzso zzso zzso in animals when they acquire the classical delay zzso conditioning naturally, in contrast to in zzso studies, where learning involves long-term depression zzso Our model proposes that the delayed response comes from the slow dynamics of zzso zzso zzso and the ensuing calcium concentration change, and not from zzso The zzso stimulus zzso arriving on the parallel zzso triggers this slow zzso in zzso and PC zzso These zzso (from PC zzso and zzso (from zzso signals then interact at the PC zzso to generate variable zzso of PC zzso When the zzso stimulus zzso arriving on the climbing zzso is coupled frequently with this slow zzso the zzso is amplified zzso to an increased zzso and leads to a timed pause in the PC zzso The zzso of deep zzso zzso by this timed pause causes the delayed zzso zzso This suggested zzso interaction emphasizes a richer role of the zzso in learning and also zzso to the recent evidence that zzso in the zzso zzso may participate in slow motor zzso We show that the suggested mechanism can zzso the zzso zzso with the versatility to learn almost any zzso pattern, in addition to those that arise in classical zzso
