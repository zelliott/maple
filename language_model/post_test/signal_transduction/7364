zzso is an zzso protein that contributes to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transition zzso in zzso zzso cells was regarded as one of the key events in zzso To determine whether zzso is involved in the zzso process, we investigated its regulation of zzso in human kidney zzso zzso cells zzso and explored the underlying zzso In this study, we found that zzso of zzso suppressed zzso marker zzso and increased the expression of zzso and the zzso marker zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso significantly activated zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso or zzso reversed zzso zzso in human kidney zzso zzso zzso zzso with Ras and son of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso increased Ras zzso through recruiting zzso Treatment with a Ras inhibitor markedly zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso leading to restraint of zzso We further demonstrated that zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso interaction, resulting in reduction of Ras zzso and suppression of zzso zzso by zzso zzso we found that depletion of zzso significantly inhibited zzso of zzso and zzso signaling in mice with unilateral zzso zzso We conclude that zzso through zzso Ras and the downstream zzso and zzso signaling zzso plays an important role in regulating zzso zzso zzso and could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of zzso kidney zzso
