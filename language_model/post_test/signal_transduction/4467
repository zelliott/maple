In the zzso zzso bone zzso protein zzso zzso maintain zzso stem cells zzso in an zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso within zzso results in the zzso repression of the differentiation factor bag of marbles zzso The zzso zzso zzso complex and the zzso zzso also help to promote zzso zzso How the activities of different zzso and zzso regulators are coordinated to keep the zzso in an zzso state remains zzso Data presented here show that zzso zzso regulates zzso maintenance in addition to its previously described role of promoting zzso zzso zzso Within zzso germ cells, zzso associates with zzso zzso components and zzso the translation of a shared target zzso suggesting that zzso can enhance zzso zzso in specific zzso In addition, disruption of zzso compromises zzso zzso resulting in the inappropriate expression of bam in germ cells immediately adjacent to the cap cell zzso Loss of zzso results in premature translation of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso stem zzso These data suggest that zzso has distinct functions in the zzso and zzso in regulating the fates of both zzso and their zzso zzso
