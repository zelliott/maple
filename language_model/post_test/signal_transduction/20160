zzso avoidance signaling involves perception of incident zzso zzso light by zzso zzso and zzso of downstream zzso zzso Although these responses are well studied in zzso little is known about the role of zzso and the zzso responses to shade in the woody perennial zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso of zzso zzso was studied by quantitative real-time zzso zzso and zzso transient zzso zzso lines with altered zzso and/or zzso expression were used in zzso zzso and transcript profiling with zzso zzso was used to identify zzso responses to enriched zzso zzso All three zzso were zzso expressed among tissue types and zzso were targeted to the nucleus under white zzso zzso zzso rescued zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso transgenic lines and the expression of candidate shade response genes suggested that zzso and zzso distinct yet overlapping zzso zzso analysis indicated that genes associated with cell wall modification and zzso signaling were induced under enriched zzso light in zzso This study is an initial attempt at deciphering the role of zzso zzso by evaluating zzso zzso to enriched zzso and demonstrates functional diversity and overlap of the zzso zzso and zzso in regulating shade zzso
