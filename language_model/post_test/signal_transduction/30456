Iron is an essential element in all living organisms and is required as a zzso for zzso zzso Iron zzso oxygen zzso and zzso are consequently strongly zzso Iron needs to be tightly zzso as iron zzso zzso a zzso anemia in zzso coupled to zzso in zzso whereas excess iron is toxic, and causes generation of free zzso Given the links between oxygen transport and iron zzso associations between the physiology of hypoxic response, and the control of iron availability are zzso Numerous lines of investigation have proven that the zzso zzso factors function as central zzso of cellular adaptation to critically low oxygen levels in both normal and compromised zzso Several of these target genes are involved in iron zzso reflecting the molecular links between oxygen zzso and iron zzso
