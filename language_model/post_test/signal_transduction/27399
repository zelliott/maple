In zzso rates of incorporation and turnover of zzso and zzso in brain zzso were measured in awake rats treated chronically with lithium, following intravenous infusion of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso lithium, at a brain level considered to be therapeutic in humans, decreased turnover of zzso within brain zzso zzso and zzso by up to zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso had a minimal effect on turnover of zzso causing only a zzso reduction in turnover in zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that a major therapeutic effect of zzso is to reduce turnover specifically of zzso possibly by zzso zzso zzso involved in signal zzso The effect may be secondary to the known action of zzso on the zzso cycle, by zzso the activity of zzso zzso
