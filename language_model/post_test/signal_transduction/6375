zzso zzso of nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso a differentiation signal appropriate to zzso likely through induction a zzso zzso however, biological importance of zzso is zzso To address the signaling mechanism of the zzso zzso we analyzed the effect of two different types of zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso component zzso or zzso portion of human zzso zzso zzso was fused to zzso lacking the zzso domain, and the zzso of this fusion protein was induced by addition of the chemical zzso of zzso zzso or erythropoietin, zzso Such treatment resulted in induction of zzso a marker of zzso in a dose dependent manner, with an efficiency equivalent to that of induction by zzso However, zzso zzso showed relatively low levels of zzso pit forming activity, and expression of zzso zzso and zzso K, compared with zzso which were induced in the presence of zzso As expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 zzso was also reduced in zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso is a critical event to generate fully matured zzso through zzso of zzso
