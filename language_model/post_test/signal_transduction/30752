zzso has multiple actions in the brain to zzso zzso synaptic zzso and zzso While many of these actions undoubtedly involve mediation via the classical zzso mechanism of regulation of zzso of genes via zzso nuclear zzso there has been growing interest in the rapid zzso effects of zzso and the role they may play in the neural actions of zzso In this review, we will focus on these rapid zzso actions of zzso in the brain and discuss the potential zzso significance of these zzso The evidence for rapid zzso regulation of cell signaling zzso including zzso zzso channel and zzso signaling pathways in the brain will be zzso as will evidence derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of these cell signaling zzso Evidence supporting classical and zzso zzso zzso zzso to the plasma membrane of zzso will also be zzso including the putative new membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso how membrane zzso receptors couple to zzso signaling pathways is zzso but we will discuss the latest findings on zzso zzso scaffold zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso which are capable of linking zzso receptors and zzso such as zzso and zzso to potentially mediate zzso zzso zzso Finally, we will review the growing evidence that rapid zzso effects of zzso play an important zzso role in the neural actions of zzso in the brain, including zzso feedback control and zzso of zzso regulation of synaptic zzso and zzso zzso
