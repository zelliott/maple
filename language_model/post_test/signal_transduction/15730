To understand complex biological zzso mechanisms, mathematical zzso of signal zzso pathways has been applied successfully in last few zzso However, precise quantitative zzso of signal zzso events such as zzso zzso of zzso remains one bottleneck to this zzso 

We use zzso zzso measured by flow zzso zzso for studying signal zzso events to zzso zzso In this method, zzso latex beads capture the protein of interest from cellular zzso and are then stained with differently zzso zzso to zzso the amount of the zzso zzso of an interaction partner and of zzso zzso The zzso signals are measured by zzso Combining this procedure with beads containing defined amounts of a zzso allows retrieving absolute numbers of stained zzso and not only relative zzso Using zzso we derived zzso data on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso network, including the recruitment of the zzso zzso to the zzso and subsequent zzso zzso by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and primary zzso T zzso zzso these data showed that cell stimulation by zzso led to a transient decrease of the zzso ratio at the zzso A zzso mathematical model of the underlying processes demonstrated that an initial massive recruitment of zzso zzso was responsible for this zzso Further, the model predicted a zzso order of zzso zzso of zzso (with zzso zzso preceding zzso at zzso that we subsequently verified zzso 

The quantitative data sets generated by zzso are one order of magnitude more precise than Western zzso zzso This accuracy allowed us to gain unequalled insight into the dynamics of the zzso zzso zzso
