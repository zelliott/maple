The zzso interface gives rise to a boundary of particular importance in zzso development as it forms a local zzso zzso the proper functioning of which is essential for the formation of zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso boundary zzso within the zzso is dependent on the interface of zzso and zzso expression zzso yet in the absence of either or both of these zzso zzso genes are still zzso suggesting that other, as yet unknown mechanisms are also involved in zzso zzso Here, we present evidence for a role for zzso zzso in zzso cell lineage restriction and regulating zzso gene expression at the zzso Experimental interference with zzso zzso in the chick zzso zzso zzso formation, including zzso of the zzso signal zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in cells of the anterior zzso results in an exclusion of those cells from zzso 1 and 2, and in a simultaneous zzso along the anterior and zzso boundaries of this area, suggesting that zzso zzso influences cell zzso These cells zzso express the boundary marker zzso In agreement with a role for zzso zzso in cell zzso anterior zzso cells with activated zzso zzso segregate from normal cells in an zzso zzso Finally, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso across the zzso leads to a shift in boundary position and loss of restriction of zzso to the zzso We propose that differential zzso zzso zzso the zzso through regulating cell sorting and specifying boundary cell zzso
