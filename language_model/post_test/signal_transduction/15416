The zzso action between zzso acid zzso and salicylic acid zzso in plant zzso responses has been well zzso However, their relationship in secondary zzso production is largely zzso Here, we report that zzso a protein zzso from zzso zzso triggers zzso generation, zzso zzso and zzso zzso production of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suppress not only zzso zzso generation, but also the zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso can still enhance zzso zzso production even though the zzso generation is totally zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene zzso not only zzso zzso zzso but also suppresses the zzso zzso zzso production when zzso zzso is zzso Interestingly, expression of zzso does not inhibit the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso levels are significantly enhanced when zzso zzso is impaired in the transgenic zzso Together, the data suggest that both zzso and zzso are involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso zzso might be enhanced to substitute for zzso to mediate the zzso zzso zzso zzso when zzso zzso is impaired, which reveals an unusual complementary relationship between zzso and zzso in zzso plant secondary zzso zzso
