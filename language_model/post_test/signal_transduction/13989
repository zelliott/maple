We have previously shown that oral administration of zzso significantly decreases the percentage of zzso zzso cells and partially zzso the severe zzso zzso of the zzso zzso mouse model in a zzso zzso Here we compared the gene expression in zzso nerves of zzso zzso and adult zzso with the same age groups of zzso mice and found a significant increase in gene expression for zzso inflammatory response and zzso zzso the latter specifically the zzso family, in zzso zzso We also detected an zzso of different branches of unfolded protein responses zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso results in lower expression of zzso markers suggesting it zzso zzso zzso zzso cell stress sensors in zzso nerves of zzso mice while the level of zzso proteins stays comparable to zzso zzso zzso We further tested if zzso levels could influence the severity of the zzso zzso zzso reduced dosage of the zzso strongly zzso the severity of the zzso zzso though the absence of zzso had little effect in zzso zzso In aggregate, these data provide further insights into the pathological disease mechanisms caused by zzso gene zzso and further support the exploration of zzso as a therapeutic approach for selected forms of inherited zzso and potentially for other genetic diseases due to zzso zzso
