zzso zzso exerts its zzso effects through the zzso zzso zzso complex that consists of the zzso specific zzso zzso and the zzso zzso In this study, we used a modified zzso zzso system to isolate zzso zzso proteins that interact with the zzso domain of the human zzso zzso zzso We have identified zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso as an zzso interacting zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso was confirmed by zzso and zzso zzso This is the first demonstration that zzso associates with a membrane zzso We also mapped zzso acids zzso in zzso and zzso acids zzso in zzso to be important for zzso Interestingly, the region in zzso that binds zzso is adjacent to the site previously shown to interact with zzso zzso binds zzso and mediates zzso zzso possibly through its zzso zzso zzso Our results therefore suggest that zzso may act as a zzso of zzso or as an zzso protein for molecules that are important for zzso zzso
