The ten mouse and six human members of the zzso zzso gene family all contain an AAA zzso Little is known of their function, but previous studies suggest roles in immune cell zzso In this report, we assessed zzso regulation and function in zzso which are key cellular regulators of innate zzso 

Multiple members of the zzso family were zzso in mouse bone zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso in the zzso model of zzso zzso Of these, the most zzso was zzso zzso zzso that signal exclusively through the zzso zzso protein had more modest effects on zzso zzso levels, thus implicating zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso This was supported by the substantial reduction in zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso causes growth arrest in zzso and other zzso family genes have been implicated in growth zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso during zzso zzso factor zzso differentiation of bone zzso zzso into zzso To determine the role of zzso in zzso we zzso the gene specifically in zzso in mice using a zzso zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells did not alter zzso colony formation or proliferation in zzso zzso numbers, as well as inflammatory zzso recruited to the zzso zzso were reduced in transgenic mice that specifically zzso zzso while zzso numbers and zzso activity were increased in the zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso levels were zzso during zzso zzso but zzso during zzso zzso zzso expression in the zzso lineage in zzso zzso zzso We zzso that the zzso of zzso gene expression during zzso differentiation is a necessary step in development of this zzso
