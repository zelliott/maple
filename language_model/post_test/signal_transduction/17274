zzso is a common zzso disease affecting zzso of zzso and representing one of the leading causes of both maternal and fetal zzso zzso symptoms occur as an excessive systemic inflammatory reaction in response to the zzso factors released by the zzso stressed and functional impaired zzso The zzso zzso domain and zzso domain zzso family is a relatively newly described group of molecules with a zzso structure and important zzso zzso Identification of zzso as a zzso for zzso has established the zzso zzso as an important regulator of zzso immunity and tolerance zzso 

The aim of our study was to investigate the expression and function of zzso and zzso molecules by peripheral blood zzso cells and the possible role of zzso zzso in the zzso of healthy pregnancy and zzso zzso We determined zzso and zzso expression and zzso of peripheral zzso of zzso zzso women and healthy pregnant woman using flow zzso 

zzso peripheral zzso of women with zzso zzso our results showed a decreased zzso expression by T cells, zzso T cells, zzso cells and zzso zzso cells compared to healthy pregnant zzso Interestingly, we found a notably increased frequency of zzso positive cells in each investigated zzso population in the case of zzso zzso zzso We further demonstrated increased zzso activity by zzso T and zzso zzso cells in women with zzso zzso Our findings showed that the strongest cellular zzso response of zzso occurred in the zzso positive zzso of different zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

These data suggest that zzso zzso could play an important role in the immune regulation during pregnancy and the altered zzso and zzso expression could result an enhanced systemic inflammatory response including the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso
