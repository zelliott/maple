Recent advances have shown that direct type I zzso signaling on T cells is required for their efficient expansion in response to viral infections in zzso It is not clear which zzso signaling zzso is responsible for this zzso Although zzso has been shown to mediate many of the type I zzso biological effects, its role in T cells remains uncertain in zzso In this study, we demonstrated that zzso signaling in zzso T cells was required for their efficient expansion by promoting the survival of activated zzso T cells upon zzso viral infection in zzso suggesting that the direct effect of type I zzso on zzso T cells is zzso by zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso T cells that lack zzso signaling did not survive the contraction phase to differentiate into zzso memory zzso These results identify a critical role for type I zzso signaling in multiple stages of zzso T cell response in zzso and suggest that strategies to activate type I zzso signaling zzso may enhance vaccine zzso
