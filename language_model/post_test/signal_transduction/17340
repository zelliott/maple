The zzso zzso zzso type 3 zzso is specifically expressed in cone zzso A zzso zzso directed against zzso revealed expression at the protein level at zzso zzso in outer and inner retinal zzso which increased in intensity between zzso and 7 zzso This expression pattern differed from sections of the adult zzso showing strong zzso in outer segments of double cones and short single cones, less intense zzso in long single cones, but no zzso in the inner zzso Although zzso and protein expression levels of zzso are similar to that of the zzso regulator zzso zzso protein 3 zzso we surprisingly found that zzso is present in a zzso zzso excess over zzso in zzso zzso Further, zzso was an efficient regulator of zzso zzso activity in native zzso retinal membrane zzso zzso we investigated the zzso function of zzso by two different behavioral zzso Using the zzso zzso technique, we knocked down expression of zzso and recorded the zzso and zzso responses of zzso control zzso and wild type fish at 5-6 zzso No significant differences in behavioral responses among wild type, zzso and control zzso were found, indicating that a loss of zzso has no consequences in primary visual processing in the zzso zzso despite its prominent expression zzso Its zzso function is therefore compensated by other zzso zzso
