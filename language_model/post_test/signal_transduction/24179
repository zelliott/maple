zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso adapter zzso that is believed to function downstream of receptors for growth factors and zzso We previously found that zzso in the mouse zzso gene led to embryonic zzso and defects in zzso zzso in response to growth factors and zzso Here, we established immortalized zzso cell lines and zzso roles of zzso in growth zzso signaling and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso which function upstream of zzso was zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso form of Ras was also reduced in these zzso zzso zzso exchange activity for Ras was suppressed in the zzso cells and expression of a zzso active zzso restored zzso zzso in these cells, indicating that zzso functions upstream of zzso Furthermore, activated form of zzso zzso zzso zzso such as colony formation in soft zzso and tumor formation in nude mice, was strongly suppressed when the zzso cells were zzso with active zzso whereas the active zzso efficiently induced transformation of zzso zzso The data show that zzso plays an essential role in zzso cell proliferation and zzso
