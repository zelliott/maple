The zzso factor zzso factor 1 zzso has recently emerged to be a crucial regulator of the immune response following pathogen perception, including the response to the important human pathogen zzso zzso However, as mechanisms involved in zzso zzso by bacterial pathogens are not fully zzso understanding how bacteria and bacterial compounds impact on zzso stabilization remains a major zzso In this context, we have focused on the effect of zzso factors of zzso zzso on zzso zzso Surprisingly, we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly zzso zzso protein zzso Further characterization revealed that zzso zzso was dependent on a subset of key zzso factors involved in zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso sensing zzso signaling zzso and in particular the zzso zzso signal zzso Under hypoxic conditions, the zzso zzso of zzso was linked to the suppressed induction of the important zzso target gene zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that zzso molecules directly target zzso protein degradation through the zzso zzso zzso but independently of the zzso zzso domain zzso In conclusion, this is the first report showing that bacterial molecules can repress zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso signaling by zzso zzso zzso could have major consequences for the host response to infection and may facilitate the zzso properties of this zzso
