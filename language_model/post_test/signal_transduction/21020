Mechanical damage to leaf tissue causes an increase in zzso acid zzso which in turn activates the zzso of zzso acid zzso The resulting higher zzso zzso levels subsequently activate the expression of zzso zzso This study shows that zzso zzso the expression of different sets of genes in roots and leaves of potato zzso When roots of intact plants were treated with zzso high levels of zzso inhibitor II zzso zzso D zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso accumulated in the systemic zzso However, in the treated roots, very low, if any, expression of these genes could be zzso In contrast, a novel, zzso zzso zzso accumulated in the zzso root tissue which could not be detected in leaves, either systemic or those directly treated with zzso Application of zzso acid and zzso revealed that a protein zzso step is involved in the regulation of this differential zzso In leaves, a protein zzso is required for the zzso expression of zzso and the other genes zzso This zzso activity is not necessary for the zzso expression of a zzso zzso in roots, suggesting the existence of different zzso pathways for the zzso signal in these zzso The requirement of a protein zzso activity for zzso gene induction has enabled identification of a zzso zzso for zzso induction of zzso and the other zzso zzso This alternative zzso involves a protein zzso and appears to be selective for zzso zzso Our data suggest the presence of a complex, zzso zzso network for regulating the effects of the plant hormones zzso and zzso on gene expression upon zzso
