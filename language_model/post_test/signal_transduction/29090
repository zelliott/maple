zzso in signaling zzso activity have been implicated in the zzso of zzso muscular dystrophy, a degenerative muscle disease caused by a zzso in the zzso protein zzso zzso the notion of the zzso complex, and by extension the zzso as harboring signaling components has received increased attention in recent zzso The zzso of most, if not all, signaling zzso to this zzso region relies on interactions with scaffolding proteins directly or indirectly associated with the zzso zzso One of these scaffolds is zzso a large, zzso protein zzso A zzso zzso protein or zzso Previous studies have demonstrated a zzso of zzso expression in human zzso muscular dystrophy, suggesting a connection to the zzso of the zzso Here we report that zzso muscle exhibits reduced zzso activity zzso in part, from severely zzso zzso and the type II regulatory zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso and zzso zzso in native muscle extracts and directly interact in zzso Our findings reveal for the first time abnormalities in the zzso signal zzso zzso and zzso regulation in zzso zzso
