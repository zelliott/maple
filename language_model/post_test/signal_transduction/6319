Clinical studies suggest that the zzso of Alzheimer's disease zzso is increased following an zzso or hypoxic episode, such as zzso Furthermore, levels of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso precursor protein zzso are enhanced in experimental zzso In our previous study zzso zzso Green, zzso zzso zzso Vaughan, zzso zzso processing of zzso precursor protein in the human zzso zzso by chronic zzso zzso zzso 83 (2002) zzso we reported that exposing cells of zzso origin to a period of chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso 24 zzso led to a decrease in processing of the zzso precursor protein zzso by the alternative and zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, the most likely mechanism was that zzso zzso the protein level of zzso 10, a zzso zzso widely believed to be the zzso One effect of zzso is to alter the activity of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso terminal zzso zzso and zzso Thus, the main aims of this study were to investigate the effect of zzso on zzso the activity of these zzso in zzso and zzso whether changes in the activity of these zzso may account for the zzso decreases in zzso 10 expression and zzso zzso We demonstrated that the zzso zzso of zzso was decreased approximately 50% following a period of zzso An inhibitor of zzso did not mimic the effects of zzso on either zzso 10 expression or zzso zzso under conditions in which the zzso of zzso was inhibited by approximately zzso Thus the loss of zzso activity does not appear to be linked to the decrease in expression of zzso 10 and zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of zzso was enhanced approximately zzso following a period of zzso However, zzso of zzso were unable to reverse the loss of zzso in zzso cells, indicating that this increase in activity was not linked to the altered processing of zzso
