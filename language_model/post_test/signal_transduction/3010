zzso zzso factor zzso plays an important role in zzso survival through zzso of zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso and its truncated zzso zzso We investigated the changes in zzso protein levels and signaling activity under zzso conditions, which are characteristic of brain zzso traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative zzso zzso stimulation of cultured rat zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso a truncated form of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso by zzso whereas the increase in zzso protein levels required zzso and translation zzso zzso of zzso receptors in zzso zzso correlated with a decrease in zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso zzso which prevents zzso degradation, did not zzso the decrease in signaling activity of these zzso On the other hand, incubation with zzso to prevent the zzso of zzso protected to a large extent the zzso signaling activity, suggesting that truncated receptors may act as zzso The zzso of zzso under zzso conditions was correlated with an increase in zzso zzso of zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso fully protected zzso zzso zzso with zzso when present during zzso stimulation with zzso in contrast with the partial protection observed in cells zzso zzso or expressing zzso These results indicate that zzso protects zzso zzso by two distinct zzso through the zzso effects of zzso receptors and by zzso of zzso receptors coupled to zzso of the zzso zzso
