zzso of a New Zealand Black zzso zzso 13 zzso onto a zzso zzso background zzso is sufficient to produce many hallmarks of zzso including zzso zzso zzso production, abnormal zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this study we sought to characterize the immune defects leading to these zzso By generating zzso zzso and zzso transgenic mice, we show that the zzso zzso zzso can be transferred by zzso cells and requires the presence of zzso B zzso Using the zzso egg white zzso zzso transgenic mouse model, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso and zzso editing are zzso Nevertheless, zzso B cells exhibit altered peripheral zzso selection, as demonstrated by enhanced survival and zzso of zzso B cells with zzso to zzso and zzso Given the zzso zzso to nuclear zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso B cells were zzso to zzso a zzso zzso demonstrating enhanced proliferation and survival as compared to B6 B zzso Our findings indicate the presence of an intrinsic zzso zzso on zzso zzso 13 that results in zzso to a zzso analogue and implicates its potential supporting role in the generation of zzso in zzso zzso
