zzso syndrome zzso is characterized by zzso and the presence of zzso zzso zzso that directly recognizes plasma zzso I zzso zzso zzso factor zzso the major zzso of the zzso zzso system, is induced on zzso by zzso in zzso explaining in part the zzso in zzso We previously reported that the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso expression on zzso In this study, we identified plasma zzso as a protein associated with zzso zzso by using zzso zzso and mass zzso zzso An in zzso binding zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso interacts with plasma zzso which binds to zzso zzso zzso through zzso The zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso on the cell surface was enhanced in the presence of plasma zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso zzso protein was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment, and its zzso was attenuated in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, focal zzso zzso a downstream zzso of the zzso zzso pathway, was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that molecules including zzso and zzso are involved in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso and that zzso is a possible therapeutic target to modify a zzso state in patients with zzso
