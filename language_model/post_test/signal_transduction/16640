The continuing growth in zzso data acquisition has led to a proliferation of network models to represent and zzso biological zzso These networks involve distinct interaction types detected by a combination of methods, ranging from directly observed physical interactions based in zzso to interactions zzso from zzso zzso zzso expression and comparative zzso The discovery of interactions increasingly requires a blend of experimental and zzso zzso Considering zzso as a model system, recent zzso methods are reviewed here and specific aims are proposed to improve network interaction zzso and facilitate zzso biological zzso
