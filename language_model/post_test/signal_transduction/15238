Recently, zzso acid bacteria zzso have attracted a great deal of interest because of their potential to serve as oral delivery vehicles for zzso protein zzso An important limitation to their use is the typically low level of zzso expression obtained in zzso To address this, a dynamic flux balance analysis zzso model was used to identify gene targets for increasing specific expression of Green Fluorescent zzso zzso a model zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Two zzso each targeting one of the top zzso zzso were constructed and tested in zzso Data show that both zzso by a conservative estimate, achieved zzso higher zzso per cell than the control strain, a qualitative confirmation of the model zzso A zzso zzso model for zzso zzso growing on zzso medium is presented along with the procedure for screening gene targets and a powerful method for visualizing zzso in zzso zzso zzso
