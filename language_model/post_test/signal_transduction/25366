Advances in molecular zzso have enabled identification of several zzso conditions involving small vessels zzso to zzso and zzso strokes and diffuse white matter zzso With emphasis on cerebral zzso dominant zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso we review the molecular zzso of recently characterized disorders including cerebral zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso retinal zzso with cerebral zzso zzso and the zzso type IV, alpha 1 zzso zzso zzso remains the most common zzso small vessel disease zzso caused by zzso different zzso in the zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of vascular smooth muscle cells in small arteries and zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene are associated with zzso zzso zzso activity results in increased transforming growth zzso zzso provoking multiple actions including vascular zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso disorders characterized by profound zzso are associated with zzso in zzso which encodes an abundant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lead to zzso zzso or insufficient quantities of zzso The zzso disorders are highly variable zzso four major zzso with overlapping systemic and central nervous system features including zzso with cerebral zzso in children and zzso zzso zzso likely zzso the zzso zzso resulting in fragile vessel zzso The zzso zzso albeit with variable zzso demonstrate how effects of different defective genes zzso to produce the characteristic zzso and zzso disintegration leading to vascular cognitive zzso
