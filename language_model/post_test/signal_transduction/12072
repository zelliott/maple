zzso zzso of zzso is one of the major zzso pathways involved in the development of various types of zzso including zzso cancer zzso and thus becomes a promising therapeutic zzso zzso zzso has long been used as an important component in many traditional Chinese medicine formulas to clinically treat zzso Previously, we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso cell growth through zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated its zzso activities in zzso and in zzso To further zzso the precise mechanism of the potential zzso activity of zzso zzso using a zzso mouse zzso model, in this study we evaluated its therapeutic efficacy against zzso and investigated the underlying molecular zzso 

zzso mouse zzso model was generated by subcutaneous injection of human colon zzso zzso cells into nude zzso Animals were given zzso administration with 6 zzso of the ethanol extract of zzso zzso zzso daily, 5 days a week for 16 zzso Body weight and tumor growth were measured every two zzso zzso growth in zzso was determined by measuring the tumor volume and zzso zzso cell viability was examined by zzso zzso Cell zzso and proliferation in tumors from zzso zzso mice was evaluated via zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso density zzso was examined by using zzso for the zzso zzso marker zzso The zzso of zzso was evaluated by determining its zzso level using zzso The zzso and protein expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was measured by zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso treatment reduced tumor volume and tumor weight but had no effect on body weight change in zzso zzso decreased zzso cell viability in a zzso manner, suggesting that zzso displays therapeutic efficacy against colon cancer growth in zzso and in zzso without apparent zzso In addition, zzso significantly inhibited the zzso of zzso in tumor zzso indicating its zzso action on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso resulted in an increase in the zzso zzso ratio, decrease in the expression of the zzso zzso D1 and zzso as well as zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Finally, these molecular effects led to the induction of zzso the zzso of cell proliferation and tumor zzso 

zzso zzso possesses a broad range of zzso activities due to its ability to affect zzso pathway, suggesting that zzso zzso could be a novel potent therapeutic agent for the treatment of zzso
