zzso act as zzso molecules promptly released in response to pathological zzso zzso they may represent one component of protection and/or repair mechanisms mobilized by zzso zzso zzso under zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in protecting zzso zzso from zzso altered spontaneous activity both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso can be zzso through moderate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blockade of zzso actions through zzso zzso antagonism worsens the outcome of transient zzso on zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso mediates zzso actions by delaying damage and/or restoring function of zzso cells through zzso of zzso zzso zzso Lastly, they point to zzso receptors as valuable targets in protection of zzso zzso against zzso injury and emphasize the need for a better understanding of zzso actions in the fine control of zzso zzso
