zzso zzso zzso are zzso fragments of plant cell walls that are able to induce zzso and zzso zzso To understand plant responses to zzso at the zzso level, changes in gene expression were examined using zzso zzso that cover almost the entire zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso Columbia zzso cells, approximately zzso of the total zzso exhibited significant change in abundance in response to treatment with zzso for 2 zzso zzso changes in the abundance of transcripts zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso factors were particularly zzso As in other plant cell types, zzso elicit a zzso but zzso zzso in zzso free zzso The zzso transient can be abolished by the protein zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and by the zzso channel inhibitor zzso thereby zzso a distinction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso Among the zzso transcripts that were zzso by zzso the response of 93 zzso was selectively sensitive to abolition of the zzso zzso These zzso zzso transcripts included two noteworthy classes, the first zzso genes involved in cell wall modification following pathogen attack, and the second consisting of genes involved in the zzso of zzso and zzso volatile zzso These results support the notion of an important role for zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso following zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso genes identified several putative zzso that might be involved specifically in zzso zzso zzso
