Under zzso conditions, zzso take up zzso from the synaptic zzso metabolize it to zzso and return it to zzso where zzso is zzso to zzso and stored in neurotransmitter zzso However, under pathological conditions, such as zzso failure, zzso and ammonium are elevated globally in the zzso The Trojan horse hypothesis of zzso toxicity assumes that zzso zzso of zzso enhances ammonium locally and leads to zzso zzso In the present study, we show that exposure of zzso primary zzso as well as of the zzso zzso zzso to zzso promotes zzso zzso and formation of zzso structures in the zzso Furthermore, zzso induced an increase in zzso zzso cell shrinkage zzso volume zzso cell fragmentation and formation of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso suppressed zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and ammonium enhanced production of zzso oxygen species, as detected with zzso zzso induced by zzso was inhibited either by the radical scavenger zzso or by the zzso oxide zzso blocker N zzso zzso A, a zzso of the zzso transition pore complex component zzso D, prevented zzso zzso Furthermore, blockade of zzso activity with zzso prevented zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso of zzso and, zzso zzso of ammonium in zzso induce the intrinsic zzso of zzso characterized by zzso dysfunction and zzso of zzso which activates zzso
