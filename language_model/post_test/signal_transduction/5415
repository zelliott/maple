Extraordinary technical advances in the field of human zzso over the past few years have zzso an explosion of new information about the zzso of human zzso In particular, the ability to scan the entire zzso for common zzso that associate with disease has led to the identification of numerous new risk genes involved in zzso zzso Several themes are zzso zzso disorders have a complex genetic zzso multiple genes contribute to disease risk, each with generally modest effects zzso In addition, it is now clear that common genes zzso multiple zzso zzso There is also zzso among zzso within a disease and across major racial zzso The current crop of genetic associations are only the start of a complete catalog of genetic factors for zzso and it remains unclear to what extent common variation versus multiple rare zzso contribute to disease zzso The current review focuses on recent discoveries within functionally related groups of genes that provide clues to novel pathways of zzso for human zzso
