To identify small molecules that induce zzso zzso from neural stem cells zzso is promising for therapy of Parkinson's zzso Here we report the results of analyzing structurally related steroids in traditional Chinese medicine to identify agents that enhance zzso differentiation of zzso Using zzso cells zzso by zzso zzso zzso promoter reporter zzso zzso with zzso but not cholesterol and cholesterol zzso can effectively promote the activity of zzso zzso This effect depends on bone zzso protein zzso zzso zzso cellular analysis indicated that zzso zzso differentiation of zzso to zzso zzso with increased expression of specific zzso markers including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and higher level of zzso zzso zzso significantly increases the expression of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso positive zzso and expression of zzso were detected in zzso treated with zzso indicating that zzso may activate the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso or zzso of zzso affects the effect of zzso on the zzso zzso These findings may contribute to efficient production of zzso zzso from zzso culture for many applications and raise interesting questions about the role of zzso in zzso
