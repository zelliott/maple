One of the most intriguing features of the immune system is zzso a limited response when zzso zzso We propose a minimal network model for immune regulation in a zzso network containing two types of zzso B zzso and zzso that bind to their zzso zzso interactions between B cells, zzso by other components of the immune system can be zzso or zzso In our model, B cell clones and zzso species are represented by zzso and interactions by zzso We expect that, as in many complex systems, the connectivity distribution is zzso motivating study of the model on a zzso zzso for comparison we study the same dynamics on a random zzso We characterize the dynamics of the model and its response to zzso Our model reproduces several key features of immune system zzso regulation zzso of zzso and more rapid response upon repeated zzso with the same zzso Our results suggest that a zzso network of interactions contributes to the regulation and dynamics of the immune zzso
