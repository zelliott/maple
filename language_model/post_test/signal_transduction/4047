When a hair cell is zzso by positive zzso of its hair zzso increased tension in gating springs opens zzso channels, permitting zzso to enter zzso and zzso the zzso zzso is thought to be required in zzso zzso for exposure of hair zzso to zzso zzso eliminates responsiveness by zzso tip zzso zzso zzso connections that probably are the gating zzso zzso also zzso in adaptation to stimuli by controlling the activity of a molecular motor that sets zzso zzso Using a flexible glass fiber to measure zzso zzso we investigated the effect of zzso concentration on zzso before and after the disruption of gating zzso The zzso of intact hair zzso depended zzso on the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of approximately 1200 zzso occurred when zzso were bathed in solutions containing 250 zzso zzso approximately the concentration found in zzso zzso For cells exposed to solutions with sufficient zzso capacity to reduce the zzso concentration below approximately 100 zzso zzso zzso fell to approximately 200 zzso and no longer exhibited zzso zzso Because cells so treated lost zzso zzso we attribute the reduction in bundle zzso to zzso zzso The results indicate that gating springs are not zzso zzso instead, they stiffen with increased strain, which rises with zzso activity at the zzso zzso zzso zzso
