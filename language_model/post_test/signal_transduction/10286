zzso effects induced by low dose of zzso radiation have been shown to widely exist in many cell types and may have a significant impact on radiation risk zzso Though many studies have been reported on this zzso zzso the mechanisms underlying this process are not clear, especially on the questions of how soon after zzso the bystander effects can be initiated and how far this bystander signal can be zzso once it is zzso DNA zzso breaks zzso induced by zzso radiation or zzso chemicals can be zzso in zzso using zzso zzso zzso Our previous studies have shown that in zzso zzso of zzso could be used to assess zzso zzso zzso effect at an early stage after zzso In the present studies, we used this method to investigate the time and spatial effects of damage signals on zzso bystander zzso The results showed that increased zzso in zzso and zzso bystander areas could be zzso 2 zzso after radiation and reached its maximum 30 zzso after zzso The average levels of zzso formation at 30 zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso bystander areas were zzso and zzso higher than those of the zzso control cells, zzso zzso the formation of zzso declined with incubation time and remained steady for at least 6 h at a level that was statistically higher than their zzso The results also showed that the bystander signal derived from zzso cells could be transferred to anywhere in the dish and the percentage of zzso in the zzso bystander cells was not dependent on the dose zzso Moreover, the fraction of zzso positive cells in zzso bystander areas showed a zzso increase based on its distance to the zzso area at very early stage zzso Both zzso and zzso significantly suppressed the yield of zzso in the cells of zzso bystander areas, which suggest that gap zzso zzso communication and zzso oxygen species played important roles in the induction of the bystander effects, both in zzso and zzso bystander zzso
