zzso a zzso from zzso zzso sea zzso eggs, zzso stimulates a membrane zzso zzso and activates a zzso channel that zzso zzso However, previous studies of zzso and of zzso membrane zzso reached conflicting conclusions about the mechanisms that open these zzso We find that zzso zzso and increases the zzso content of zzso zzso We confirm previous findings that zzso zzso and zzso enhance this zzso but not zzso The G protein zzso zzso and zzso also are zzso Thus, it is unlikely that a G protein zzso in the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso responses to zzso are increased by zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the absence of zzso The responses to zzso and to zzso have similar zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and sensitivities to the channel zzso zzso and 3, zzso indicating that they likely result from opening of the same zzso zzso zzso that zzso inhibit zzso zzso do not alter responses to zzso and zzso zzso zzso do not zzso zzso In addition, zzso of protein zzso and zzso fail to alter zzso zzso by zzso The increase in zzso zzso content produced by zzso therefore may directly mediate opening of the channel that zzso zzso membrane zzso Similar mechanisms presumably operate in intact zzso
