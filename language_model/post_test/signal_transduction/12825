We have previously demonstrated that the zzso hormone, zzso can inhibit the growth of zzso zzso zzso breast cancer cells and suppress zzso gene zzso To investigate the relationship between the zzso response zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso zzso human breast cancer cells were zzso zzso with an zzso response element zzso zzso reporter construct and then treated with zzso zzso zzso for 30 zzso followed by zzso M zzso zzso or treated with each compound zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso We also conducted experiments to determine if zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso levels by 57 and zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso can act as a biological modifier to affect zzso zzso activity by regulating signal zzso pathways which impinge on the zzso and by altering zzso zzso zzso and zzso DNA binding zzso
