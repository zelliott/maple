The cancer stem cell zzso theory is currently central to the field of cancer research, because it is not only a matter of academic interest but also crucial in cancer zzso zzso share a variety of biological properties with normal zzso stem cells in terms of zzso the propagation of differentiated zzso the expression of specific cell markers and stem cell zzso and the zzso of common signaling pathways and the stem cell zzso However, zzso differ from normal stem cells in their zzso zzso Thus, zzso are also termed cancer initiating zzso In this paper, we briefly review zzso described study results and refer to some excellent review articles to understand the basic properties of zzso In addition, we focus upon zzso of lung zzso since lung cancer is still increasing in zzso worldwide and remains the leading cause of cancer zzso zzso the properties of, and exploring cell markers and signaling pathways specific to, zzso of lung zzso will lead to progress in therapy, intervention, and improvement of the prognosis of patients with lung zzso In the near future, the evaluation of zzso may be a routine part of practical diagnostic zzso
