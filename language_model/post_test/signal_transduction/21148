zzso has a dual function as signal zzso and zzso of transcription, and is activated in response to growth factors and zzso We examined zzso in the rat brain during development and following transient focal zzso using Western zzso Two bands of 91 and 84 zzso corresponding to zzso alpha and zzso beta forms, were found with an intensity that increased from zzso day 0 to adulthood in zzso and cerebral zzso zzso caused a strong induction of zzso in the zzso zzso after 4, 7 and 15 days, but not at 6 or 24 zzso These results show that zzso is normally expressed in the zzso and adult rat brain and is induced under brain zzso
