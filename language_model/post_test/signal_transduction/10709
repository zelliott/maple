zzso zzso in adult muscle are necessary for the repair, maintenance and zzso of zzso muscle zzso With age, fat deposition and zzso contribute to the decline in the integrity and functional capacity of zzso In a previous study we reported increased zzso of zzso in zzso zzso obtained from aged mice, accompanied by an zzso of genes involved in zzso zzso The present study was designed to extend our understanding of how aging affects the fate and gene expression profile of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed using zzso extracted from zzso zzso isolated from adult zzso and aged zzso zzso zzso The cells from the aged animals exhibited major zzso in the expression level of many genes directly or indirectly involved with the zzso signaling zzso Our data indicate that with age, zzso zzso acquire the paradoxical zzso of being both zzso activated based on zzso of zzso zzso but resistant to the zzso effects of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso tissue growth factor, may play a role in increasing zzso in aging zzso
