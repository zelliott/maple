zzso growth factor zzso supports a zzso signal zzso zzso that controls stem cell zzso Here, we directly addressed the role of zzso in zzso liver zzso by utilizing mice harboring zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso To activate oval cells, the zzso stem cell zzso zzso we used a model of liver injury induced by diet containing the zzso agent, zzso zzso zzso of zzso in oval cells was confirmed in both models by zzso chain reaction analysis of zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso Loss of zzso zzso decreased the zzso capacity of oval cells in zzso as well as reduced oval cell pool, impaired migration, and decreased zzso differentiation in zzso as demonstrated by double zzso using zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso Furthermore, lack of zzso had a profound effect on tissue zzso and overall composition of zzso zzso which was associated with greatly reduced zzso zzso zzso activity and decreased expression of zzso factor zzso Using a combination of double zzso of zzso markers with zzso and gelatin zzso on the isolated cell zzso we identified zzso as a major source of zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso deletion caused the greatest zzso impact on zzso response, as compared to the selective zzso in the zzso cell lineages achieved in zzso zzso zzso However, in both models, genetic loss of zzso triggered a similar cascade of events, leading to the failure of zzso zzso and death of the zzso 

These results establish a direct contribution of zzso in the regulation of zzso response and support a unique role for zzso as an essential zzso zzso for zzso of diseased zzso
