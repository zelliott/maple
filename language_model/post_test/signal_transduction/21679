zzso acid zzso has emerged as a new class of zzso zzso involved in diverse cellular functions in plants, animals, and zzso zzso progress has been made recently on the production, cellular function, and mode of action of PA in the zzso The cellular levels of PA undergo dynamic changes in response to zzso and environmental zzso The production of signaling PA is zzso by families of multiple zzso that regulate the timing, location, amount, and molecular species of zzso A number of PA target proteins have been identified, which include proteins involved in zzso and zzso of proteins and zzso as well as in G protein regulation, zzso trafficking, and zzso PA mediates cellular functions through different modes of action, such as membrane zzso zzso of zzso activities, and/or structural effects on cell zzso The regulatory processes in which PA has been implicated include signaling pathways in cell growth, zzso zzso and responses to hormones and zzso and zzso zzso
