zzso is a key regulator of iron recycling by zzso that is zzso mainly by zzso but also by zzso However, very little is known about the molecular regulation of zzso in zzso In the present study, we investigated zzso regulation in the zzso zzso cell line and in zzso zzso zzso zzso with different zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso and zzso zzso activated zzso expression in zzso cells and in zzso zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso production by zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso was enhanced by high amounts of iron present in the culture zzso We conclude that zzso expression in zzso is regulated mainly through zzso and zzso receptors via the zzso signaling zzso and that zzso regulation of iron zzso in zzso by zzso may affect the levels of zzso zzso zzso
