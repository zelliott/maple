zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10 zzso signaling zzso play an important role in multiple cellular functions such as cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is activated by growth factors and zzso zzso such as vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso The amplification and zzso of zzso and the loss of the tumor zzso zzso are common in various kinds of human solid zzso The genetic zzso of upstream and downstream of zzso signaling molecules such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, are also frequently altered in human zzso zzso signaling regulates tumor growth and zzso by zzso zzso and other targets, and by inducing zzso and zzso zzso zzso is required for tumor growth and zzso In this review, we highlight the recent studies on the roles and mechanisms of zzso and zzso in regulating zzso and zzso and the roles of the downstream targets of zzso for zzso the zzso We also discuss the zzso of these signaling molecules and cellular events during tumor growth, zzso and tumor zzso Finally, we zzso the potential applications of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and their outcome in clinical trials for cancer zzso
