Members of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso family play a central role in innate immunity by inducing zzso and zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso gene zzso zzso required for the production of zzso zzso and zzso However, the molecular mechanisms that activate these protein zzso and their complement of zzso zzso remain poorly zzso Using zzso a novel inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) and zzso a novel inhibitor of zzso we demonstrate that two different zzso pathways participate in the zzso of the zzso protein zzso by zzso that activate the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 and zzso zzso One zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso which directly zzso and activate zzso and zzso whereas the second zzso appears to culminate in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is zzso solely by the zzso zzso In turn, the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and their regulatory zzso zzso zzso essential zzso which is associated with reduced zzso activity and zzso gene zzso We also show that the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso not only have unique zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso but also have several zzso in common, including the zzso and regulatory zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Taken together, our studies reveal that the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso regulate each other by an intricate network involving zzso of their zzso and regulatory zzso and zzso zzso to balance their activities during innate zzso
