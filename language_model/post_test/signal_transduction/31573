We have shown in zzso and in zzso that zzso zzso zzso in the 7th generation of zzso during zzso zzso but the underlying molecular mechanism remained zzso To determine the role of heat shock protein zzso zzso a molecular zzso for client proteins in signal zzso and zzso regulation, in zzso zzso we cloned zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was detected highly at zzso stage and in both the membrane and zzso zzso only in germ zzso zzso while zzso zzso was expressed in the membrane fraction of only germ zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso associated zzso with zzso zzso on the plasma membrane of germ cells, suggesting that zzso zzso is also one of the client proteins for zzso zzso of zzso function by zzso was shown to promote zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso is involved in signaling zzso zzso through the zzso
