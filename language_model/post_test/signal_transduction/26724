We examined zzso signaling and cell fate decisions in response to a potent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are poorly understood zzso produced by zzso zzso and several cancer zzso zzso human cells showed a rapid zzso of zzso zzso that zzso targeted the zzso zzso factor at low doses and zzso zzso at more severe damage, producing zzso and zzso responses, zzso zzso zzso was zzso and its loss was accompanied by increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso was insensitive to zzso of mismatch repair and zzso and base zzso repair, excluding the role of small DNA zzso in this zzso The zzso signaling was zzso absent in zzso cells and specific to zzso in cycling zzso Unlike other zzso zzso zzso zzso was functional zzso promoted zzso in lung zzso cells and caused zzso in normal lung zzso zzso did not induce zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso indicating a zzso mode of zzso zzso zzso arrest by zzso caused a zzso of zzso from a zzso zzso zzso but no zzso zzso associated with stalled zzso These results suggest that unlike typical DNA zzso that stall DNA zzso replication zzso by zzso zzso largely results from blocking upstream zzso zzso which prevents zzso of zzso Overall, our findings indicate that zzso zzso zzso of the zzso axis is a critical stress response to zzso which has implications for understanding of zzso zzso
