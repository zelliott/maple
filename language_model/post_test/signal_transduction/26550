zzso zzso zzso zzso the production of zzso zzso which may contribute to the zzso of numerous neurodegenerative zzso zzso suppression of zzso molecules could be developed as a therapeutic zzso zzso zzso turmeric oil isolated from zzso zzso has long been used in Southeast Asia as both a remedy and a zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso effects of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were tested for the expression and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso the production of zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as the underlying signaling zzso zzso significantly suppressed zzso expression and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso also reduced zzso zzso zzso and zzso production in zzso zzso zzso Further, zzso markedly inhibited the production of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were observed in zzso zzso cells exposed to zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited the zzso and degradation of zzso as well as the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso impaired the zzso inflammatory response of zzso cells by zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso Lastly, zzso protected zzso zzso cells from indirect zzso toxicity induced by activated zzso zzso These novel findings provide new insights into the development of zzso as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of neurodegenerative zzso
