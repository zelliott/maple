A zzso exposure to zzso exerts a profound zzso zzso in zzso zzso In the present study, we examined mechanisms by which zzso generates this effect, exploring the roles of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors zzso in acute and chronic zzso zzso zzso hearts from zzso acute zzso zzso 10 zzso or chronic zzso zzso mice zzso zzso 5 zzso underwent zzso zzso and zzso zzso After zzso zzso hearts exhibited marked zzso and zzso dysfunction zzso product zzso 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso pressure zzso 33 zzso 3 zzso whereas AM hearts showed significant improvement in recovery of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and 23 zzso 4 zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, CM hearts demonstrated a complete return of zzso function and significantly greater recovery of zzso function zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso with zzso protein inhibitor zzso toxin abolished AM protection while partially attenuating CM recovery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso inhibitor zzso did not affect AM zzso yet completely zzso CM zzso Similarly, zzso zzso significantly attenuated the zzso state afforded by zzso whereas it was ineffective in AM zzso zzso zzso with zzso was ineffective in CM hearts while completely zzso AM zzso Moreover, whereas zzso blockade with zzso failed to alter recovery in CM hearts, the zzso zzso zzso significantly attenuated zzso zzso These data describe novel findings zzso CM zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso involving zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas AM zzso is zzso via zzso proteins and zzso
