zzso is the name for a zzso activity, which is assumed to play a key role in the prevention of the molecular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso similar to zzso are essential for a wide range of biological zzso such as cell zzso and embryonic zzso The molecular culprit in zzso is the zzso zzso zzso zzso which derives from the zzso precursor protein zzso through sequential zzso by the two zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso which is the zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso domain, thus preventing zzso zzso Additionally, it produces a zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso An increase in zzso zzso is considered a therapeutic approach for zzso but the molecular mechanisms regulating zzso zzso are only partly zzso zzso zzso C and zzso protein zzso constitute central signaling hubs for the regulation of zzso zzso Additionally, recent studies increasingly demonstrate that the correct spatial and zzso zzso of the two membrane proteins zzso and zzso is essential for efficient zzso zzso of zzso This review highlights the role of signaling pathways and protein trafficking in the control of zzso zzso zzso
