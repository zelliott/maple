The status of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso was investigated in 132 zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mixed zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared with the zzso parameters associated with zzso patients' zzso and other genetic zzso found frequently in these zzso zzso genetic differences between zzso and high-grade zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected in 26 and zzso of cases, zzso We found zzso zzso in only zzso of high-grade zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso had a higher frequency of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso In the mixed zzso zzso zzso the most frequent zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso In some cases, zzso and zzso zzso zzso but they rarely zzso with the zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso zzso are frequent events in zzso zzso of any zzso zzso However, location of the zzso zzso either in zzso 9 or zzso 20, varies significantly according to the zzso grade and type of zzso zzso with zzso 20 zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso were often high-grade zzso associated with zzso invasion; in contrast, tumors that carried zzso 9 zzso were more likely to be zzso zzso The zzso analysis suggested that zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso a worse prognosis zzso Although zzso in the zzso signaling zzso alone did not influence overall survival, patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso and zzso zzso had shorter survival zzso than patients with only zzso zzso Such a relationship was lost when we considered zzso 9 zzso zzso Our results contribute to further characterize the molecular genetic model for zzso zzso
