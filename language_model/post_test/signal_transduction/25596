zzso fine, and zzso particulate matter zzso zzso possess different physical properties and chemical compositions and may produce different adverse health zzso Studies were undertaken to determine whether or not gene expression patterns may be used to discriminate among the three size zzso zzso zzso cells obtained from 6 normal individuals were exposed to Chapel Hill coarse, fine or zzso PM zzso zzso for 6 and 24 h zzso different individuals zzso zzso was isolated and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso genes were identified and mapped to zzso zzso zzso of selected genes was confirmed by zzso zzso chain reaction zzso The numbers of genes altered by coarse, fine, and zzso PM increased from 0, 6, and 17 at 6 h to zzso zzso and 455 at 24 zzso zzso The zzso zzso stress response, cell zzso DNA damage checkpoint regulation, and zzso roles of zzso zzso were the top three pathways altered by all three zzso Fine and zzso PM displayed more similar gene expression zzso One example was the increased expression of zzso zzso reflecting the higher zinc content associated with fine and zzso zzso A set of 10 genes was identified that could discriminate fine and zzso PM from coarse zzso These results indicate that common properties shared by the three size zzso as well as zzso factors, zzso compositions, may determine the effects on gene zzso zzso markers may be used to discriminate coarse from fine and zzso zzso
