The zzso growth zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that plays an important role in the zzso trafficking of zzso zzso and zzso degradation of zzso However, its role in signal zzso after zzso binding remains zzso In the present study, we report that zzso zzso in the rat brain is coupled to a zzso and that its zzso by zzso an analog that binds rather selectively to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso release from the rat zzso zzso This effect is zzso by a zzso toxin zzso zzso protein and is dependent on protein zzso zzso zzso zzso of downstream zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso and growth associated zzso Additionally, treatment with zzso causes a reduction in zzso currents and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso This effect, which is blocked by an zzso against the zzso zzso is also sensitive to zzso and is zzso via zzso of a zzso zzso These results together revealed for the first time that the single zzso domain zzso zzso expressed in the brain is zzso coupled and is involved in the regulation of central zzso function via the zzso of specific zzso signaling zzso
