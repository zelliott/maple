Aging of human cells can be reproduced in zzso cultures, revealing the zzso of zzso zzso It was shown that zzso human zzso enter a stable growth arrest zzso at the end of their lifespan and, in particular, these cells are resistant to various zzso zzso In contrast, human zzso cells from the zzso vein zzso acquire a zzso zzso when reaching zzso and this probably results from zzso oxygen species zzso induced damage and associated zzso zzso were shown to accumulate in zzso zzso and are also known as potent regulators of zzso cell zzso To further study zzso changes in zzso to zzso between zzso and zzso cells, both cell types were challenged by administration of zzso zzso and zzso cell death was zzso While zzso can efficiently induce zzso in both young and zzso cells of either zzso quantitative evaluation of the data show that zzso zzso are more resistant to zzso induction when compared to their young counterparts, whereas in the case of zzso cells zzso for zzso is increased in zzso zzso Together, these data suggest significant differences in the regulation of zzso associated with zzso in zzso and zzso zzso
