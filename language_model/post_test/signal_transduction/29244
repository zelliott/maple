zzso is a potent zzso protein for zzso and zzso that is expressed strongly in zzso and is present in vascular smooth muscle zzso To study the role of zzso in blood vessel zzso we generated zzso zzso The zzso mice developed zzso without obvious defects in cardiovascular development or zzso Surprisingly, zzso mice had persistently low blood pressure, lower in female mice than in male mice, without zzso cardiac dysfunction, and a lean body zzso The examination of the major blood vessels revealed that the zzso of zzso mice were zzso compared to those of control mice, without altered wall zzso zzso zzso smooth muscle cells from the zzso mice exhibited exaggerated levels of zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in response to stimulation with either sodium zzso or zzso zzso The results of this study, along with those of previous studies demonstrating that zzso stability is under the control of zzso oxide via the zzso rule pathway, suggest that zzso may balance vascular tone by attenuating zzso signaling in zzso in opposition to zzso another zzso zzso of G protein zzso family member known to inhibit G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the function or the expression of zzso may provide an alternative approach to treat zzso
