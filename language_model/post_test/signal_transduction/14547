zzso development and zzso are suppressed during zzso in various zzso species, mainly due to the suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso gene product, is an zzso zzso for zzso a zzso zzso and suggested to play a critical role in regulating the zzso zzso The present study therefore aims to determine whether zzso zzso signaling in discrete brain areas is inhibited by the zzso stimulus that causes suppression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso level was significantly lower in the zzso nucleus zzso zzso region in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso rats than in zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso nucleus was kept at a low level in both zzso and zzso rats despite zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were significantly lower in zzso than zzso rats in the zzso zzso nucleus, but the levels in zzso mothers of the zzso area and zzso zzso were comparable with zzso zzso Although zzso zzso cells or zzso zzso zzso were densely located in the ARC of zzso controls, few were found in the ARC of zzso zzso zzso Various doses of zzso zzso zzso zzso and 2 zzso injected into the third zzso caused a significant increase in zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso rats, suggesting that zzso rats are responsive to zzso zzso zzso Thus, the present study demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso expression is inhibited in the ARC by the zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso is most probably involved in suppressing zzso zzso in zzso zzso
