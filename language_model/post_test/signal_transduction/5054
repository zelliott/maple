zzso signaling zzso is related to neural zzso in zzso and other areas affected by zzso and neurodegenerative zzso It is not known if long-term calorie restriction zzso can zzso this relationship through improved insulin signaling or if such an effect might influence task learning and zzso To model this hypothesis, magnetic resonance imaging was conducted on 27 zzso and 17 control zzso monkeys aged zzso years from a zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses were used to associate insulin sensitivity with brain volume and zzso zzso Monkey motor assessment panel zzso performance was used as a measure of task zzso zzso improved zzso parameters and related zzso Higher insulin sensitivity predicted more gray matter in zzso and frontal zzso across zzso An insulin sensitivity zzso dietary condition interaction indicated that zzso animals had more gray matter in zzso and other areas per unit increase relative to controls, suggesting a beneficial zzso Finally, bilateral zzso volume adjusted by insulin sensitivity, but not volume itself, was significantly associated with zzso learning and zzso These results suggest that zzso improves zzso regulation and may positively influence specific brain regions and at least motor task zzso Additional studies are warranted to validate these zzso
