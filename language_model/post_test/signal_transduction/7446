zzso zzso receptors zzso are cell surface molecules that regulate the activities of zzso cells through the balance of zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes are located within the zzso zzso complex zzso on zzso zzso adjacent to zzso zzso which are subject to zzso and copy number variation zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are highly zzso receptors with similar zzso zzso zzso contains zzso zzso motifs and zzso is coupled to an zzso with zzso zzso zzso We zzso the sequences of the zzso zzso zzso regions of zzso and zzso in 20 individuals, and determined the copy number of these zzso in addition to those of other members of the zzso zzso We found 41 zzso sites within the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of these sites were common to both zzso zzso but not zzso exhibited zzso In 20 out of 48 human cell lines from the International zzso Working Group, zzso was deleted or zzso The only other zzso gene exhibiting zzso aberration was zzso in this case due to a partial zzso
