zzso has long been known as a zzso of acute zzso but its mechanisms of action still remain to be zzso In this study, we employed inflammatory swelling induced in mice by zzso and zzso as models and dissected the role and mechanisms of action of each zzso zzso at the molecular zzso zzso or zzso vascular zzso was significantly reduced in zzso zzso zzso the zzso response was suppressed by zzso zzso zzso treatment, zzso zzso zzso and mast cell zzso The impaired zzso response in mast zzso mice was rescued upon zzso with zzso mast cells but not with zzso mast zzso Although the number of mast cells, zzso activity, and zzso contents in ear zzso in zzso mice were comparable to those in zzso mice, the zzso contents in ear zzso were attenuated upon zzso treatment in zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso release in mouse zzso and bone zzso mast cells, and it exerted zzso and zzso production in a manner sensitive to zzso toxin and a zzso inhibitor and dependent on zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso triggers mast cell zzso via an zzso zzso pathway, and this mechanism zzso zzso vascular zzso and zzso zzso zzso
