Although numerous animal models for low back pain associated with zzso disk zzso zzso have been proposed, insufficient data have been provided to make any conclusions regarding zzso Our aim in this study was to determine the reliability of complete zzso zzso zzso injection into the rat spine as an animal model representing human zzso zzso 

We studied zzso degenerative changes with pain development after a zzso zzso injection into the zzso zzso of adult rats using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso changes were analyzed to detect degenerative zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso E zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso were determined using zzso or real-time zzso chain reaction as support data for pain zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso at the zzso was considered indirect evidence of neural zzso into the zzso 

There was a significant increase of the zzso withdrawal response in the zzso group until 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed progressive degenerative changes of the disks without any damage in adjacent structures, including nerve zzso In the zzso zzso study, the bilateral zzso horns and zzso had positive zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was increased in the zzso root zzso zzso at 2 and 4 zzso whereas zzso and zzso zzso were markedly increased at 2 zzso The zzso of zzso expression was higher in zzso rats compared with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso injection led to chronic disk zzso with zzso which was suggested by pain behavior and expression of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso also suggest zzso signal processing between the zzso and the neural zzso in this animal zzso This animal model may be useful for future research related to the zzso and development of novel treatment for zzso zzso
