zzso in the gene zzso zzso cause zzso zzso with zzso 17 type zzso In zzso Alzheimer's disease, and other zzso zzso zzso zzso forms the zzso zzso characteristic of these zzso We previously reported a zzso zzso model for zzso using human normal and zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso expression caused zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here we describe a zzso zzso interference zzso screen for genes that modify the zzso zzso zzso We tested zzso sequences for zzso genes and found 75 that enhanced the zzso zzso zzso zzso of these genes have sequence similarity to known human genes and fall into a number of broad classes including zzso zzso zzso and zzso The remaining 29 zzso have sequence similarity only with other zzso zzso To determine if the enhancers are specific for the zzso zzso behavior, we exposed several zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso Fifteen enhancers modified zzso in multiple zzso zzso whereas 60 modified only the zzso zzso in the zzso transgenic zzso We also introduced the zzso zzso into the background of genetic zzso zzso for a subset of the zzso zzso zzso transgenic animals zzso for loss of these zzso genes exhibited increased impaired zzso relative to the zzso zzso line zzso This work zzso novel candidate genes that prevent zzso zzso as well as genes previously implicated in zzso zzso
