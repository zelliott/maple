The zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in pancreatic cancer but its role remains zzso To delineate the cell populations able to respond to zzso zzso zzso we expressed an zzso zzso of zzso zzso to cell autonomously activate zzso signaling in the mouse zzso Surprisingly, we found that expression of zzso in zzso cells was not able to activate the zzso and had no impact on pancreatic development or zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso in the zzso led to zzso zzso zzso indicating that only the tumor zzso is competent to zzso the zzso zzso Using a zzso reporter zzso we show that zzso signaling is active in zzso cells surrounding zzso tumor zzso in various mouse pancreatic cancer zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the tumor zzso of human pancreatic and zzso cancer specimens was confirmed by quantitative zzso of zzso tissue zzso These data support a zzso model of zzso zzso in which tumor cells zzso zzso zzso to induce zzso zzso target genes in adjacent zzso
