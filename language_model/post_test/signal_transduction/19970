Lead remains a significant environmental zzso and we believe we may have identified a novel target of lead toxicity in zzso zzso These cells are responsible for the maintenance of joint zzso and do so under the regulation of zzso zzso As lead is concentrated in zzso cartilage, we zzso that it can disrupt normal zzso zzso through suppression of zzso zzso These experiments examine the effects of lead exposure in zzso and in zzso at biologically relevant levels, from 1 zzso to 10 zzso on zzso collagen levels, zzso degrading zzso activity, zzso zzso and zzso surface zzso Our results indicate that viability was unchanged at levels zzso zzso zzso but low and high level lead in zzso exposure resulted in zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso Lead treatment also decreased levels of type II collagen and increased type X zzso in zzso and in zzso Additionally, zzso activity increased in a zzso zzso Active zzso 3 and 8 were zzso zzso and treatment with 10 zzso zzso resulted in increases of zzso and zzso zzso zzso lead treatment resulted in a corresponding reduction in zzso reporter activity, with a zzso reduction at zzso zzso of zzso and 3 were suppressed in zzso and in zzso and lead zzso increased zzso These changes closely parallel those seen in zzso Over time this zzso shift could compromise maintenance of the joint zzso
