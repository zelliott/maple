Previous studies have found that inappropriate zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression and activity is zzso with early onset of zzso in zzso zzso zzso we further investigated the role of increased zzso in zzso zzso and the related molecular regulatory mechanisms of elevated zzso in zzso zzso zzso blockade of zzso in zzso mice significantly attenuated zzso pathology but not zzso during early zzso lung zzso Furthermore, zzso was found to be a zzso factor to positively regulate a protein zzso zzso 1 zzso by binding to an zzso site of zzso zzso A synergistic regulatory effect on zzso expression was also detected between zzso and zzso zzso zzso knockout lung at zzso had reduced zzso zzso which in turn resulted in increased zzso of zzso zzso at the zzso factor zzso protein 1 zzso zzso and zzso binding sites of zzso promoter and increased zzso of zzso In addition, increased zzso expression and nuclear zzso was also detected in zzso lungs at zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso promoter were elevated in zzso zzso We thus propose that zzso of zzso causes zzso of zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity resulted in increased zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased zzso of zzso factors including zzso and zzso to zzso promoter significantly zzso zzso transcription, contributing to zzso zzso
