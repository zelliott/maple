zzso zzso zzso by zzso and expressed zzso zzso is reduced markedly by the expression of functional zzso zzso zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso protein and cellular protein zzso are zzso consistent with a reduction in zzso zzso that results from zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso The zzso of protein zzso zzso is correlated with the gating properties of expressed zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, cellular protein zzso zzso is reduced within minutes by acute treatment with the zzso zzso zzso zzso Because zzso zzso in turn influences zzso channel activity, these results suggest that zzso zzso interactions occur between zzso channel and protein zzso zzso signaling zzso
