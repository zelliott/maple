zzso originally discovered as zzso of G zzso zzso zzso have more recently been appreciated to also function as signal zzso in their own right, although the consequences for cellular physiology have not been well zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso mediates zzso zzso signaling zzso by a typical zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso in rat vascular smooth muscle cells or by zzso in zzso zzso zzso stimulation leads to concerted zzso of two zzso zzso and zzso which zzso to zzso and zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso effects as well as zzso activities can be zzso by an zzso analog zzso which has been previously shown to activate zzso but not G zzso zzso and are zzso by zzso small interfering zzso These findings establish a key role for zzso in zzso cellular zzso functions by a zzso zzso and define the zzso pathways zzso
