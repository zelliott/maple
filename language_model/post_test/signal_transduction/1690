The zzso effects of a drug depend not only on its molecular structure but also on the zzso of its zzso One of the main reasons for the importance of zzso patterns in drug action is biological zzso those of zzso zzso These rhythms affect most zzso functions as well as drug zzso zzso and dynamic processes that may alter drug availability and target cell responsiveness with reference to biological zzso We present an overview of the importance of zzso signals in physiology focused on the insights provided by a modeling zzso We first discuss examples of zzso zzso communication by hormones such as zzso hormone, and by zzso zzso zzso zzso signals in zzso zzso Models based on zzso zzso zzso account in both cases for the existence of optimal patterns of zzso zzso Turning to zzso zzso we examine how models can be used to account for the response of zzso patterns to external stimuli such as light zzso or gene zzso and to predict how to restore the zzso characteristics of altered zzso zzso treatments of cancer involve two distinct lines of zzso The first, currently evaluated in clinical trials, relies on zzso zzso of zzso drugs, while the second, mostly based on theoretical studies, involves a resonance phenomenon with the zzso zzso We discuss the implications of modeling studies to improve the zzso patterning of drug zzso
