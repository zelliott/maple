We determined the precise role of zzso family zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the regulation of zzso and zzso by zzso and delineated the signaling cascade that contributes to zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso treatment of cells in which zzso was silenced resulted in diminished induction of zzso and zzso by zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso the zzso expression of these zzso zzso or zzso of zzso resulted in no changes in the zzso zzso and zzso Studies using chemical zzso and zzso to signaling molecules showed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso factors zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso are involved in zzso induction of zzso Our findings provide the first characterization of signaling cascade involved in the regulation of any zzso by zzso and offer zzso insights on how zzso likely mediates zzso zzso zzso
