zzso are a large family of zzso zzso zzso basement membrane proteins that contribute to the structure of zzso zzso and influence the behavior of associated cells, such as zzso zzso migration, zzso stability, and resistance to zzso In lower organisms such as zzso there is only one zzso of zzso but higher organisms have at least 16 zzso zzso with varying degrees of zzso zzso In zzso protein and cell culture studies, gene manipulation in animals, and zzso gene zzso in human diseases have provided insight into the specific functions of some zzso but the biological roles of many zzso are still largely zzso mainly zzso to difficulties in zzso them in pure form from zzso or zzso In this review, we zzso the evolution of zzso describe their molecular complexity, and explore the current knowledge of their diversity and functional aspects, including zzso signaling via membrane zzso in zzso cell biology, and involvement in various zzso gained from animal model and human disease zzso The potential use of zzso in cell biology research and biotechnology is zzso
