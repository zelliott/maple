zzso zzso interacting protein of 30) is a zzso interaction protein of 30 zzso that functions in neurotransmitter zzso Using a chronic zzso injury zzso model of zzso pain, we zzso gene expression in the rat spinal zzso and brain and identified zzso which was zzso after zzso Here, we show that zzso induced a bilateral increase of zzso in the zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso a key brain region that has been implicated in pain zzso We put rats in a chamber with one half painted white zzso zzso and the other half painted black zzso zzso and measured zzso zzso place zzso paradigm zzso to zzso the level of negative emotion evoked by painful stimuli using a Von Frey zzso zzso of zzso induction of zzso by zzso injection of zzso targeting the rat zzso gene reduced zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso did not affect zzso evoked pain such as heat zzso and mechanical zzso Neither did it affect general learning and zzso zzso zzso of zzso was correlated with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso administration of zzso or zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso and blocked the induction of zzso Additionally, zzso of zzso suppressed the frequency of zzso and increased zzso ratios in zzso slices and decreased zzso zzso zzso Together, our results highlight zzso as a target of zzso and zzso in the zzso to mediate zzso zzso negative emotion via zzso of zzso release and zzso synaptic zzso
