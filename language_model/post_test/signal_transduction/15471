zzso muscle differentiation zzso organized sequential events, including cell cycle arrest of zzso zzso cells and cell fusion, which lead to the formation of zzso zzso This process involves both zzso and zzso regulation of the gene expression of zzso zzso as well as zzso related zzso zzso proteins bind to specific sequences of target zzso and regulate gene expression in a zzso zzso However, few zzso zzso binding proteins have been zzso zzso we report that the zzso binding proteins zzso and zzso were found to be zzso expressed in muscle during differentiation in zzso Further, zzso of either by zzso interference suppressed zzso arrest and delayed zzso differentiation in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso or zzso induced cell cycle arrest, and then had a positive effect on zzso zzso zzso analysis using zzso zzso proteins indicated that zzso binds to the zzso transcript in zzso zzso with this, differentiation of zzso zzso cells was rescued by zzso of zzso Together, our results suggest that zzso plays a crucial role in cell cycle arrest and zzso differentiation via its binding to zzso
