The durability of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso lens makes this zzso system a potential contributor to certain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study addresses zzso involvement in zzso zzso zzso gene zzso in human lens zzso 

zzso B-3 cells were treated with zzso in combination with the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso target gene expression was measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso were used to assess zzso zzso Western zzso analyses were performed with zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso induced the expression of zzso muscle zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso in zzso B-3 cells and primary cultured human lens cells from donor zzso zzso also induced a zzso decrease in the level of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels decreased in the presence of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso blocked the induction of zzso zzso the loss of zzso zzso the decrease in zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso B-3 cell line and primary cultured human lens cells respond similarly to zzso treatments by zzso zzso gene zzso This response in both of these model systems is blocked by zzso the zzso This suggests that the zzso can mediate cataract and zzso changes and therefore is a novel target of medical zzso
