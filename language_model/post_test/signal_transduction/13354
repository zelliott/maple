The zzso of type 2 diabetes zzso is complex and involves abnormalities in both the action and zzso of zzso These abnormalities are caused by a complicated interplay between genes and zzso A determination of the genetic defects that zzso to either insulin resistance or decreased insulin zzso is important, as an improved understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms may be essential for the development of the most effective zzso This paper focuses on genetic zzso identified in genes zzso proteins in the early insulin zzso zzso Variations frequently occur in these zzso but their effect varies in different zzso This may suggest that the genetic background is a considerable factor and that the synergistic effect of several zzso plays a major zzso Future, zzso studies of large populations are therefore important in order to obtain sufficient statistical zzso The paper also discusses recent results that suggests, that insulin itself has an effect on insulin zzso by the zzso and that insulin zzso in the zzso plays an important role in the regulation of energy zzso fuel zzso and zzso
