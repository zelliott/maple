The zzso L system is a widely recognized zzso signal zzso zzso in which zzso zzso protein zzso triggers a programmed cell death when bound by the zzso zzso zzso zzso This system in the zzso is believed to be a zzso signaling system by which zzso cells expressing zzso L can initiate killing of zzso germ cells during zzso So far, the presence of zzso zzso in zzso zzso was related only to zzso or zzso zzso We demonstrated for the first time that normal zzso zzso also express zzso zzso Our data showed that a large percentage of normal zzso zzso of fertile bulls are zzso positive for zzso Our observations provide further evidence of the zzso of zzso membrane zzso Furthermore, we suggest that in mature fertile zzso zzso the zzso zzso may also provide resistance to programmed cell death, like in some other cells expressing molecules that inhibit the signals induced by zzso or the death program zzso In addition, we suggest that zzso zzso can partly protect the zzso against zzso induced by zzso damage that can occur spontaneously in the male zzso at various stages in its zzso
