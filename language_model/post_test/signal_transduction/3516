zzso zzso is required to initiate zzso bone zzso following zzso zzso in zzso however, it is unclear whether zzso zzso also produce the signals that induce zzso zzso We determined the spatial and zzso patterns of zzso zzso and expression of zzso signaling molecules in zzso zzso from female zzso rats zzso old) were zzso loaded to a single fatigue level, and zzso were analyzed 3 and zzso later zzso to the first appearance of zzso zzso of genes associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were assessed by zzso using zzso isolated from zzso segments of zzso zzso with confirmation and spatial zzso of gene expression performed by zzso A novel double zzso zzso method permitted simultaneous zzso of zzso zzso and zzso expressing zzso signals relative to zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso regulatory signals exhibited different spatial zzso with zzso zzso zzso cells highest in the damage region and declining to control levels within several hundred zzso of the zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso or zzso peaked between 100 and zzso from the damage site, then returned to control levels beyond this zzso zzso zzso in zzso control bones expressed zzso However, zzso zzso was reduced markedly in zzso immediately surrounding zzso These results demonstrate that while zzso zzso triggers the bone zzso response to zzso the neighboring zzso zzso are the major source of zzso zzso Moreover, both the zzso and zzso zzso populations are localized in a zzso and temporally restricted pattern consistent with the targeted nature of this zzso zzso
