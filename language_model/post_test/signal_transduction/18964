The zzso outgrowth inhibitor protein zzso has been identified as an inhibitor of zzso zzso and zzso as a regulator of zzso zzso but the additional roles of zzso zzso especially zzso have obtained little zzso zzso is zzso expressed in liver and kidney compared to the high expression in skeletal zzso Here we detected the weak expression of zzso in human embryonic kidney cell line zzso and found that zzso expressed in zzso could induce cell zzso Further experiments demonstrated the zzso of zzso and zzso but not zzso in zzso expressed zzso And zzso inhibitor zzso could reduce cell zzso induced by zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso and zzso the expression and zzso of zzso were also zzso The data first revealed zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso by inducing zzso and zzso zzso through the zzso zzso
