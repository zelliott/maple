The molecular mechanisms for zzso differentiation have been studied by observing skin development in zzso but the early signaling zzso involved in tongue zzso differentiation are not completely zzso Based on the gene expression patterns of the zzso signaling molecules and previous results from zzso and zzso knockout mice, it was hypothesized that there would be fundamental signaling interactions through the zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso to regulate tongue zzso zzso To zzso these zzso interactions in tongue zzso zzso this study employed an in zzso tongue organ culture system with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso signaling revealed precise zzso zzso which showed that zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso tongue zzso differentiation via zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso
