We have compared the zzso and trafficking of zzso growth factor zzso zzso induced by zzso light and zzso zzso zzso of zzso was not detected in zzso cells by zzso of whole cell zzso or zzso zzso with zzso specific for each of the five activated zzso sites of zzso In addition, zzso of zzso cells did not demonstrate increased zzso However, zzso cells demonstrated a gel mobility shift of zzso which was not abolished by alkaline zzso zzso zzso did not induce zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso induced zzso of zzso without zzso or zzso zzso zzso was transferred to early zzso and arrested in zzso zzso close to the cell zzso Whereas zzso of the zzso zzso zzso effectively inhibited zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso zzso induced neither zzso of zzso and zzso nor zzso of zzso but zzso of zzso and zzso was zzso Our work indicates that zzso zzso zzso of zzso independent of its zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and altered zzso trafficking compared with zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso by zzso does not appear to be zzso by zzso zzso
