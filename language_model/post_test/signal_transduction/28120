In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activates zzso differentiation and zzso zzso stimulates the expression of zzso zzso The local tissue zzso of zzso in turn, are modulated by zzso zzso type 1 zzso To clarify the change of energy metabolism in condition of reduced energy zzso we investigated whether food restriction alters the zzso size and levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression in the white zzso zzso of normal zzso Male zzso rats weighing 340 g were housed under free feeding or zzso reduction of food intake for 2 or 14 zzso We found that zzso food restriction did not cause any change in the mean size or number of zzso in the zzso while zzso food restriction decreased the size and increased the number of zzso In addition, the levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression in the zzso were lower in the zzso rats after 2 days, while they did not differ after 14 zzso Also, after both 2 and 14 days, plasma zzso of free fatty acid zzso were higher in the zzso rats than in control zzso Finally, plasma zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were the same in the both groups after 2 days, although they were higher in the zzso rats after 14 zzso These results suggest that zzso differentiation in the zzso of zzso rats is attenuated after 2 days but recovers after 14 days, resulting in an increase in the number of small zzso It is also likely that zzso induced during the zzso period of food restriction decreased the size of zzso Further, food restriction may affect the efficiency of local zzso effects by altering zzso and zzso zzso zzso Also, higher levels of plasma zzso and recovery of zzso and zzso zzso expression may contribute to the recovery of the levels of zzso zzso expression in the zzso and result in the recovery of zzso zzso
