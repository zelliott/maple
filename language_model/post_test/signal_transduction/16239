In recent years, zzso has emerged as one of the most credible and best supported candidate genes for schizophrenia and related zzso zzso Furthermore, increasing zzso genetic and zzso that many of its protein interaction partners are also involved in the development of these zzso In this study, we applied a pooled sample zzso sequencing strategy, to explore the contribution of genetic variation in zzso and 10 of its interaction partners zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to schizophrenia zzso in an isolated northern Swedish zzso zzso burden analysis of the identified zzso in a population of zzso zzso patients and zzso control individuals, revealed that zzso rare zzso with a zzso were significantly more present in patients compared to controls zzso versus zzso zzso providing further evidence for the involvement of zzso and some of its interaction partners in psychiatric zzso This increased burden of rare zzso zzso was even more striking in a zzso of early onset patients zzso versus zzso zzso highlighting the importance of studying zzso of patients and identifying zzso Upon investigation of the potential functional effects associated with the identified zzso zzso we found that zzso of these zzso reside in zzso zzso protein zzso The observed increase in zzso burden in patients provides further support for the role of the zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, this study presents the first evidence supporting the involvement of zzso within zzso zzso protein regions in the zzso of psychiatric zzso As many important biological functions depend directly on the zzso state, zzso of this disorder in key pathways may represent an intriguing new disease mechanism for schizophrenia and related zzso zzso Further research into this unexplored domain will be required to zzso the role of the identified zzso in schizophrenia zzso
