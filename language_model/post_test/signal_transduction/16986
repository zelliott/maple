zzso survival requires the rapid propagation of signals through gene networks during stress, but how this is achieved is not well zzso This study systematically characterizes the signaling dynamics of a cascade of zzso interactions in the zzso system, which regulates stress responses and zzso formation in zzso zzso zzso zzso are at the center of the zzso system; target zzso are bound by zzso proteins that inhibit their translation, zzso proteins are zzso by zzso zzso zzso and the degradation of zzso zzso is increased by zzso zzso Here, we show using in zzso experiments and quantitative modeling that the zzso system zzso three strategies to achieve rapid and robust zzso These strategies include: zzso the zzso of stable proteins by zzso zzso which rapidly zzso protein zzso zzso the degradation of stable zzso zzso which enables their rapid zzso and zzso a zzso loop created by zzso repression of zzso production, which reduces the time for the system to achieve steady zzso We also demonstrate that zzso in the zzso system results in signaling that is robust to growth rates because it does not rely on the slow dilution of molecules via cell zzso therefore, signaling can occur even during growth arrest induced by zzso or zzso zzso
