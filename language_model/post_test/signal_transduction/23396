zzso zzso was monitored for zzso responses in adult mouse liver at 2, 4, 8 and 24 zzso after a single oral administration at four dose levels, 0, 10, 30 and 100 zzso The expression data obtained using zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso by the zzso method and expressed as three zzso zzso surface zzso with axes of time, dose and copy numbers of zzso per zzso We developed the programs zzso for comprehensive screening of the zzso surface data and zzso for zzso and confirmed the significant responses by visual zzso In the first 8 zzso approximately 100 probe sets zzso related to zzso and zzso and other zzso zzso were induced whereas zzso and zzso were zzso At 24 zzso about 1,200 zzso were strongly zzso We zzso the zzso database consisting of 111 chemicals on the liver zzso and found that about half of the zzso belonged to the zzso pathways including zzso zzso stress response networks shared with some of the 111 zzso The other half of the induced genes were zzso signaling network genes zzso and their induction was unique to zzso Toll like receptors and other pattern recognition zzso zzso regulatory factors and zzso alpha itself were included but inflammatory zzso were not zzso In zzso these data indicated that functional symptoms of zzso treatment, such as zzso and zzso sweating might be zzso by the zzso rather than the previously documented zzso zzso zzso zzso might become a hint for developing low molecular weight orally available zzso zzso drugs following zzso and zzso as zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
