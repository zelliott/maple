Depending on the pH of the growth zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso or an alkaline zzso the synthesis of which is also controlled by zzso zzso and sulfur zzso as well as by the presence of zzso zzso Previous results have indicated that the alkaline zzso response to pH was dependent on zzso zzso and zzso three components of a zzso pH signaling zzso initially described in zzso zzso To identify other partners of this response pathway, as well as zzso regulators of zzso we searched for zzso that affect the expression of either or both zzso and alkaline zzso using a zzso zzso zzso Four zzso affected only alkaline zzso expression and identified the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso affected the expression of both zzso and identified 10 zzso Five of them define a zzso zzso pathway, which acts, as in other zzso by zzso alkaline genes and zzso zzso genes at alkaline zzso Our results further suggest that in zzso zzso this zzso is active at zzso pH and is required for the expression of the zzso zzso zzso The five other genes are zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are not involved in pH sensing but define at least a second zzso regulatory zzso
