The nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the inflammatory response in zzso We show here that zzso is highly expressed in zzso skeletal muscle and that its zzso in muscle leads to reduced zzso content and zzso function, as well as zzso of zzso These cellular effects resulted in both impaired zzso zzso and increased clearance of this zzso leading to compromised exercise zzso On a molecular level, zzso zzso resulted in zzso of the zzso signaling zzso These effects were zzso in isolated fibers and in muscle cells after zzso of the gene zzso zzso zzso In complementary experiments, zzso zzso in zzso increased the number of zzso and improved respiratory capacity, whereas muscle zzso or pharmacological zzso of zzso in zzso increased exercise zzso This study identifies zzso as a pharmacological target that improves muscle zzso function by modulating gene networks controlling zzso number and zzso
