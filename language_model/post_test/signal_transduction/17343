Chlorella zzso is an important industry zzso potential for zzso zzso zzso size is one of the important factors in zzso large-scale culture, and has great effects on the growth, zzso zzso and metabolism of zzso As the first barrier of cell zzso membrane plays a vital role in zzso zzso zzso The knowledge of zzso the main membrane component and high zzso of zzso as the major content of total lipids mass in some zzso is necessary to understand the role of membrane in cell growth and metabolism under different zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso led to the identification of 119 zzso zzso To discover the zzso molecules most related to change of zzso sizes, zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis zzso was employed and the results revealed that zzso sizes significantly affected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and several zzso zzso species might play an important role under our experimental zzso Further analysis of these zzso indicated that cell membrane status of zzso zzso might play an important role in the zzso to the zzso zzso And the culture with zzso size of 1 zzso zzso cells zzso presented the best membrane status with the highest content of PC and zzso and the lowest content of zzso We discovered that the zzso size of 1 zzso zzso cells zzso might provide the best growth condition for zzso zzso Also we proposed that zzso zzso and several PC may play an important role in zzso metabolism in zzso zzso which may work through zzso membrane and zzso zzso Thus this study would provide more potential targets for zzso engineering to improve zzso production and productivity in zzso
