Despite zzso zzso many cells resist zzso zzso Although differences in surface zzso expression can explain zzso resistance, multiple proteins below zzso level also inhibit zzso zzso To examine the mechanism of zzso resistance, we studied zzso zzso in human zzso vascular smooth muscle cells zzso from healthy coronary zzso zzso showed marked zzso to zzso zzso exhibiting both zzso zzso viable, zzso zzso 4, P zzso zzso and zzso zzso viable, zzso zzso 3, zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed surface zzso and could recruit zzso indicating that functional zzso complexes were zzso However, zzso cells showed reduced expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso 3, 7, and 8 and increased expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was associated with zzso of zzso 3 and blocked by zzso of zzso 3 or 8 but not zzso 1, 6, or zzso Selective zzso of zzso 3 or 8 by zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso but their zzso could not rescue the zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso showed marked zzso of expression of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso sensitivity is determined not only by expression of surface zzso but by differential expression of zzso proteins below zzso zzso zzso of cells within the same tissue have different sensitivities to zzso determined by expression of specific zzso zzso
