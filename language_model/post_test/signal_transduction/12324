zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso by organisms in response to iron zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso produces two zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are required for systemic dissemination in host zzso Previous studies have shown that CB is produced in zzso and can trigger the zzso of the plant zzso gene zzso To further investigate the function of CB during zzso we analyzed its effect in zzso zzso zzso plants following leaf zzso CB activates the salicylic acid zzso signaling pathway, while the CB zzso complex is zzso suggesting that the zzso activity of this zzso is due to its zzso zzso We confirmed this hypothesis by testing the effect of zzso structurally unrelated to zzso including zzso There was no zzso of zzso defense in plants grown under iron zzso before CB zzso zzso analysis of the genes zzso the root zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and determination of the activity of this zzso in response to CB or zzso showed that these compounds induce a zzso iron zzso zzso This root response as well as zzso gene zzso in the leaf were not compromised in a zzso zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso we have shown that CB promotes bacterial growth in zzso and can zzso plant defenses through an zzso mechanism between zzso and zzso acid signaling zzso zzso these data reveal a new link between two processes zzso by zzso and iron in response to microbial zzso
