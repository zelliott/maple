A novel zzso zzso was recently discovered, which shares a similar sequence zzso with, but is functionally distinct from, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Li, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Liu, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Huang, zzso zzso (2001) zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine the signaling mechanisms of zzso we investigated zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso show that zzso zzso in a zzso fashion the expression of zzso and zzso in both primary zzso zzso cells zzso and human zzso vein zzso cells zzso zzso activated a zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso in both cell zzso Selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso manner, zzso expression of zzso and zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso and zzso production is zzso through the zzso of zzso in both cell zzso
