We present an approximation scheme for zzso reaction rate equations of genetic regulatory zzso This scheme predicts the zzso of transient dynamics of such networks more accurately than does standard zzso state analysis by introducing zzso to the zzso that govern the dynamics of the protein zzso These zzso render the zzso systems slower than their zzso state approximation zzso We introduce the method by examining a positive feedback gene regulatory network, and show how the transient dynamics of this network are more accurately modeled when the zzso is zzso Next, we examine the zzso a genetic zzso and show that the period, zzso and zzso zzso defining the onset of the zzso are better estimated by the zzso zzso Finally, we examine the consequences of the method to the dynamics of reduced models of the zzso zzso switch, and show that the switching times between the two states is slowed by the presence of the zzso that arises from protein zzso and DNA zzso
