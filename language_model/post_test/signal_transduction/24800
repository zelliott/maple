We have previously shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso in canine zzso and skeletal zzso The aim of this study was to determine the molecular mechanism of zzso enhancement of the insulin zzso For this purpose, zzso cells, which express a limited number of insulin receptors and lack zzso zzso B2 zzso zzso or insulin zzso zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso and/or insulin zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso and zzso In zzso cells that expressed zzso and insulin zzso zzso zzso alone had no effect on the zzso of the insulin zzso but it enhanced zzso zzso zzso of the insulin zzso In zzso cells that expressed zzso insulin zzso and zzso zzso zzso also enhanced zzso zzso zzso of the insulin zzso and zzso An increase in zzso zzso of zzso by treatment with zzso in zzso cell was associated with increased binding of 85 zzso zzso of zzso 3 zzso zzso and increased zzso associated zzso zzso zzso These effects of zzso were not observed in zzso cells which lack the expression of zzso zzso or insulin zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso activity against insulin zzso zzso in plasma membrane fraction of zzso cells was significantly reduced by zzso suggesting that the effect of zzso was in part zzso by zzso of protein zzso zzso Our results clearly demonstrated that zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso activity of the insulin zzso and downstream insulin signal cascade through the zzso zzso signal zzso
