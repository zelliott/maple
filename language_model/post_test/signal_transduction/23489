The small zzso zzso family of zzso encompassing the three major zzso classes zzso zzso and cell division control protein 42, are key zzso signaling molecules that regulate multiple zzso cellular zzso including cell proliferation and zzso These proteins are known for their role in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso which is achieved through modulating the activity of their downstream zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso and zzso proteins were the first discovered zzso zzso that were primarily established as players in zzso stress fiber formation and focal zzso zzso It has since been discovered that the ROCK zzso actively zzso a large cohort of zzso proteins and intermediate filament proteins to zzso their zzso It is well established that global cellular zzso as modulated by the three zzso zzso zzso zzso intermediate filaments and zzso is regulated by a variety of accessory proteins whose activities are dependent on their zzso by the zzso As a consequence, they regulate many key cellular functions associated with zzso including cell zzso zzso and zzso In this current review, we focus on the role of the zzso pathways in disease including zzso
