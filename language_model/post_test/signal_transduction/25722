Several risk factors of cardiovascular diseases have been studied using direct association zzso Because the zzso of obesity and cardiovascular diseases is rising, it is important to correctly model these risk factors involved in development of cardiovascular zzso Until now, statistical methods lacked to achieve this goal because of complex zzso zzso zzso zzso Modeling zzso is an advanced statistical technique that enables solving this zzso The aims of this study were to investigate whether zzso could unravel pathways involved in cardiovascular diseases and to zzso these pathways in a zzso In zzso healthy participants of the zzso zzso factors for zzso And zzso study, 18 to 24 years of age, we explored pathways leading to zzso measured by carotid zzso zzso Using zzso we were able to model these pathways for males and females using body fat percentage, serum zzso levels, and blood zzso We are the first to present a model of complex direct and indirect effects of fat mass leading to zzso using zzso Both male and female zzso had an excellent zzso Fat mass had a significant effect on carotid zzso thickness through various zzso with the largest effect size on carotid zzso thickness via blood zzso zzso showed that the pathways differed between males and zzso with a larger effect of serum lipids on carotid zzso thickness in zzso In conclusion, zzso is suitable in identifying models to unravel potential zzso pathways in complex origins of zzso We present a model involving several zzso showing that fat mass has an influence on risk factors for zzso already at 21 years of zzso
