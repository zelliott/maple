zzso during S phase needs to be zzso and temporally regulated to prevent zzso between the zzso and replication zzso zzso have evolved a number of mechanisms to make both processes compatible under normal growth zzso When conflict management fails, the head-on encounter between zzso and DNA zzso results in zzso instability unless conflict resolution mechanisms are zzso Nevertheless, there are specific situations in which cells need to dramatically change their zzso landscape to adapt to environmental zzso Signal zzso zzso such as zzso protein zzso zzso serve to regulate gene expression in response to environmental zzso zzso members of zzso are the zzso zzso and zzso zzso In response to stress, zzso zzso control zzso and also regulate cell cycle zzso When zzso cells are stressed during S phase, zzso promotes gene induction and, zzso also delays replication by directly affecting early origin firing and fork zzso zzso by delaying zzso zzso plays a key role in preventing conflicts between zzso and DNA zzso In this review, we focus on the zzso zzso and mechanisms that make compatible zzso with replication during S phase to prevent zzso instability, especially in response to environmental zzso
