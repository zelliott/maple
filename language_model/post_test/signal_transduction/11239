An zzso zzso system was developed for zzso plant cell death in individual zzso zzso a zzso zzso member of the zzso family, zzso zzso cell death in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso from a zzso promoter results in zzso characteristics of zzso namely DNA zzso increased zzso and loss of plasma membrane zzso In zzso targeting analysis monitored using zzso green fluorescent protein zzso reporter indicated full-length zzso was localized to the zzso as it does in animal zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain of zzso completely abolished targeting to zzso zzso expression was followed by zzso oxygen species zzso zzso Treatment of zzso with the zzso N zzso zzso zzso during induction of zzso expression strongly suppressed zzso zzso production and the cell death zzso However, some population of the zzso depleted cells still induced cell death, indicating that there is a process that zzso plant cell death is independent of zzso zzso zzso suppression of zzso plant cell death also takes place in two different zzso zzso of a key zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and suppressed zzso cell death and transient expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso substantially suppressed zzso cell death without altering cellular zzso zzso Taken together, our results collectively suggest that the zzso cell death and its suppression in plants is zzso by zzso and zzso zzso
