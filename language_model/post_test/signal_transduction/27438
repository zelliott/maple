zzso the heart with a short period of zzso makes it resistant to zzso from a subsequent zzso zzso We have proposed that zzso is triggered by the release of zzso substances including zzso which activate protein zzso C through zzso cell signaling zzso However, it has also been proposed that the initial brief zzso may result in mast cell zzso without significant zzso damage, making it less likely that the toxic zzso contents could be released to zzso damage vulnerable zzso cells during the subsequent prolonged zzso To study the role of mast cells in zzso zzso zzso isolated rabbit hearts were subjected to 30 zzso of regional zzso followed by 120 zzso of zzso zzso size was measured with zzso zzso In control hearts zzso was zzso zzso zzso of the risk zzso zzso with 5 zzso of global zzso and 10 zzso of zzso reduced zzso size to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso zzso zzso zzso a mast cell zzso was infused shortly before the long zzso it did protect the heart zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso vs zzso which supports the mast cell zzso However, a mast cell zzso agent, compound zzso (24 zzso added to the zzso prior to the 30 zzso zzso period could not mimic PC zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso are rich in zzso and the latter was zzso in zzso by zzso as a marker of intact zzso In zzso left zzso from normal rabbit hearts and those following a standard PC protocol of zzso global zzso zzso zzso contents were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso wet zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso levels to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso Although baseline zzso contents were zzso higher in rats, PC also had no effect, but compound zzso reduced content by zzso zzso zzso tissue content and presumably mast cell zzso were unaffected by a PC protocol which successfully protected zzso zzso while pharmacological zzso zzso depletion was not associated with zzso zzso mast cells do not appear to be important in zzso zzso Although a mast cell stabilizer such as zzso can protect zzso zzso it may do so by one of its other properties, zzso membrane zzso
