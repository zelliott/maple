zzso acids inhibit the transformation of zzso acid to zzso via zzso but can also enhance the liberation of zzso acid in human zzso and zzso Using human zzso we explored the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso zzso release of zzso acid and the subsequent metabolism by zzso zzso zzso Both zzso acid and zzso acid zzso markedly enhanced the release of zzso acid via zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas for generation of zzso acid zzso zzso was less potent than zzso acid and was without effect at higher zzso zzso or zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso release of zzso acid and formation of zzso was more rapid and occurred in the absence of zzso The zzso release of zzso acid and zzso production zzso by zzso acid was not affected by pharmacological zzso of signaling molecules relevant for zzso zzso acid liberation and zzso It is noteworthy that in zzso zzso zzso acid increased zzso zzso approximately zzso in the absence but not in the presence of zzso whereas zzso inhibited zzso zzso No direct zzso effects of zzso acids on zzso activity in zzso zzso were zzso zzso immobilized zzso zzso to zzso zzso selectively zzso zzso from zzso zzso but failed to bind zzso Taken together, we show that zzso acids induce the release of zzso acid and the synthesis of zzso in human zzso by unique zzso routes, and we identified zzso as a selective molecular target of zzso zzso
