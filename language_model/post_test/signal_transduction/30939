zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso B zzso signaling pathways play a critical role in zzso survival zzso In this study we have investigated how loss of zzso (the primary cause of zzso muscular zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso signaling pathways in skeletal muscle in response to mechanical zzso zzso of zzso was significantly higher in zzso muscle from zzso zzso mice compared to normal mice at both zzso and zzso zzso Higher zzso of zzso was also observed in cultured zzso primary zzso differentiated in zzso Application of passive mechanical stretch ex zzso zzso increased the zzso of zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were also higher in zzso of zzso mice compared to normal zzso zzso of zzso with zzso inhibitor zzso blocked the zzso of zzso in normal and zzso zzso Higher zzso of zzso was associated with increased zzso of its downstream targets zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso target of zzso zzso Treatment of zzso muscle with zzso inhibited the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor in normal and zzso zzso Mechanical stretch also reduced the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso Finally, cellular levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso linked zzso were higher in zzso muscle of zzso mice compared to normal zzso Taken together, our data suggest that loss of zzso and/or mechanical stretch results in the zzso of zzso and zzso signaling pathways in skeletal zzso
