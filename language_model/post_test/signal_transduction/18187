The zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is a zzso of the growth hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we tested whether zzso is involved in zzso regulation of the zzso zzso Based on cell zzso and zzso zzso we find zzso present at the plasma membrane and in the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso in zzso and zzso growth factor zzso membrane zzso To test if zzso is required for zzso zzso we zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso in zzso cells and zzso for zzso and zzso membrane zzso and fluid phase zzso zzso of zzso zzso enhanced zzso and zzso produced by zzso zzso but not zzso zzso Point zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso both lacking a functional zzso domain, inhibited membrane zzso and zzso induced by zzso and zzso zzso zzso which possesses a functional zzso domain and enhances zzso zzso activity in zzso systems, also inhibited zzso membrane zzso zzso failed to inhibit zzso nuclear zzso of zzso indicating zzso is active in these zzso Taken together, these results show that zzso is required for zzso zzso reorganization by a mechanism discrete from the action of zzso as a zzso of zzso zzso zzso
