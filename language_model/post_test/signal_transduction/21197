zzso is an important zzso protein whose zzso leads to cell transformation in zzso zzso zzso Although the formation of zzso complexes involving zzso zzso zzso 317 is necessary to induce this zzso the zzso proteins in these zzso cells are not substantially zzso This observation led to our hypothesis that the zzso zzso region of zzso might have specific affinity for the zzso zzso We show here that zzso peptides encompassing the zzso zzso region, zzso can bind to the zzso domain of zzso regardless of the state of zzso zzso When delivered into cells, both zzso and zzso zzso peptides inhibit growth zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso peptides with single point zzso at zzso zzso or zzso are zzso suggesting that these zzso play an important role in zzso protein zzso Our findings represent the first paradigm of the specific interaction between an zzso zzso region and an zzso domain and have important implications for understanding the mechanism of cell transformation by zzso zzso
