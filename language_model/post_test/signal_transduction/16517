The ubiquitous zzso zzso zzso zzso is present in zzso zzso in plant zzso and is regarded as one of the major zzso of cellular zzso zzso Recent research has highlighted a regulatory role for zzso in influencing the expression of many genes important in plants' responses to both zzso and zzso zzso zzso it becomes important to consider how zzso levels and its zzso state are influenced by environmental factors, how zzso is integrated into primary metabolism and precisely how it can influence the functioning of signal zzso pathways by modulating cellular zzso zzso This review draws on a number of recent important observations and papers to present a unified view of how the responsiveness of zzso to changes in photosynthesis may be one means of linking changes in nuclear gene expression to changes in the plant's external zzso
