The design and construction of synthetic gene circuits with complex zzso dynamics was pioneered in bacteria, but it took almost a decade until synthetic biologists were able to construct genetic circuits with complex zzso dynamics in zzso zzso This review highlights the most recent advances in zzso synthetic biology, and it describes zzso hormone, and zzso genetic switches as well as the design and construction of synthetic networks that feature zzso zzso We conclude by discussing not only the current limitations but also possible ways to transform the construction of synthetic zzso systems from an art into a zzso engineering zzso
