We have studied the zzso induced gene expression zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter gene zzso in rat smooth muscle cell primary cultures zzso under the control of zzso response elements zzso It was found that zzso induced gene expression is sensitive to signal zzso zzso and zzso In particular, protein zzso C zzso by zzso C prevented gene expression by zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to produce an enhancement of gene zzso This suggests that zzso zzso zzso zzso exerts an zzso action on ORE induced gene zzso Gene expression was also induced by treating cells with zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso protein zzso zzso Moreover, the same zzso and zzso have been shown to affect the zzso induced expression of zzso zzso zzso
