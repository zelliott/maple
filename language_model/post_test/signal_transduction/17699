T cells engineered to express hybrid receptors with zzso defined specificity can successfully be targeted to tumor zzso In order to select zzso zzso of zzso receptors capable of efficiently activate T cells in zzso and in zzso we compared the function of zzso which share the same zzso zzso part, joined to different zzso signal zzso zzso The zzso binding domain of the receptors was a zzso zzso of a zzso zzso which recognize a High zzso Weight zzso zzso with high zzso The zzso tails were derived from the zzso zzso zzso chain zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and from a zzso zzso zzso able of stronger signal zzso We compared the activity of the different zzso receptors at a zzso level by using a zzso line that expressed an zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso with immobilized zzso all receptors were able to induce zzso expression in the majority of the T zzso In contrast, zzso expression was induced by contact to melanoma cells in zzso only in T cells that expressed the zzso zzso that contained the zzso zzso zzso In these T cells, the zzso of zzso receptors that contain a zzso zzso tail lowers the threshold of zzso zzso and zzso tumor recognition in zzso and in zzso Given their specificity and efficiency, T cells grafted with these type of receptors may represent potential candidates for cancer passive zzso
