To perform the vital functions of zzso and division, cells must undergo dramatic shifts in cell zzso Recent evidence suggests that polarized zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are clearly important for regulating cell zzso during migration, also play an important role during the final event in cell division, which is zzso Thus, there is a critical interplay between the membrane zzso and the zzso zzso that regulates the complex series of cell shape changes that accompany these two zzso
