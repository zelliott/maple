After stroke, brain inflammation in the zzso zzso zzso brain tissue reorganization and functional zzso Housing rats in an enriched environment zzso dramatically improves recovery of lost zzso functions after experimental zzso We show here that rats housed in zzso after stroke induced by permanent zzso of the middle cerebral artery zzso showed attenuated levels of zzso zzso in the zzso core and the surrounding zzso area, including a significant reduction in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and its natural zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To mimic beneficial effects of zzso we studied the impact of zzso zzso action on functional recovery after transient zzso zzso zzso treated with the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed improved recovery compared with zzso rats after zzso without a zzso reduction in zzso zzso This was accompanied by a reduction of zzso immune cells in the zzso hemisphere, particularly cluster of differentiation zzso zzso and zzso T zzso zzso zzso and delayed death of zzso induced by zzso was prevented by zzso zzso We conclude that zzso excessive zzso of the zzso zzso after stroke contributes to depression of zzso function after stroke and that zzso antagonism is beneficial for the recovery after zzso
