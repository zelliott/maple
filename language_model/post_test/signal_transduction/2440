zzso virus zzso zzso zzso between the nucleus and the zzso A nuclear zzso signal zzso has been identified in zzso at zzso acids zzso to 345 zzso zzso et zzso Cell zzso zzso However, some zzso zzso that lack this region still zzso to the nucleus, suggesting an additional zzso in zzso We therefore investigated the zzso transport of zzso from influenza virus zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso lacking the 38 zzso zzso zzso as well as those lacking the 38 zzso zzso acids and the previously identified zzso localized to both the zzso and the zzso Nuclear zzso of a protein containing zzso acids 1 to 38 of zzso fused to zzso proved that these 38 zzso acids function as an zzso Within this region, we identified two basic zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are crucial for zzso nuclear zzso After being imported into the nucleus, the zzso zzso and the zzso fusion construct containing zzso acids 1 to 38 of zzso were both transported back to the zzso where they zzso These data indicate that zzso has intrinsic structural features that allow nuclear import, nuclear export, and zzso zzso in the absence of any other viral zzso Further, the information required for nuclear import and export is located in the 38 zzso zzso acids of zzso although other zzso nuclear export signals may zzso Treatment of cells with a protein zzso C inhibitor increased the amounts of nuclear zzso whereas treatment of cells with a zzso zzso increased the amounts of zzso zzso These findings suggest a role of zzso in zzso transport of zzso
