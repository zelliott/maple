zzso zzso viral integration site 1 zzso forms a zzso with zzso that zzso zzso gene expression and is associated with zzso and zzso zzso Here we identified 2 independent actions of zzso in zzso development: one regulating cellular proliferation and the other involved in zzso lineage zzso First, we found that zzso zzso indirectly zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells derived from embryonic stem zzso zzso of zzso and zzso greatly enhanced the formation of zzso colonies from embryonic stem cells, with the exception of zzso zzso by maintaining zzso zzso cells in a state of zzso Second, zzso of zzso zzso the development of early zzso zzso acting in zzso at the zzso zzso stage to skew development away from zzso generation and toward zzso zzso This previously zzso action of zzso may explain the embryonic zzso observed in zzso mice that arises from failure of zzso separation and can result as a consequence of defective zzso zzso These results show that zzso exerts 2 independent functions, with its role in proliferation of zzso zzso acting earlier in development from its influence on the fate choice at the zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso
