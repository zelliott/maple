zzso zzso is an important component of the red cell membrane zzso It zzso structural integrity and has zzso signaling roles by direct interactions with zzso proteins and other membrane skeletal zzso notably zzso and zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso exposure on zzso from two patients with zzso zzso were zzso using zzso zzso and zzso C as zzso We also looked for protein abnormalities in the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso exposure was significantly increased in zzso zzso obtained from the two different individuals when zzso to zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso exposure was zzso zzso zzso C and zzso were missing or sharply zzso zzso there was an zzso or zzso of zzso zzso and a lack of zzso zzso Based on a recent study in zzso mice, we found that there are clear functional differences between interactions of human red cell zzso and its zzso zzso 

zzso C is known to bind zzso and we have defined previously that it also binds zzso From our evidence, we suggest that zzso plays a role in the zzso exposure signaling zzso that is of fundamental importance in red cell zzso The linkage of zzso to zzso may be relevant to this zzso
