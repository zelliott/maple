An increasing body of evidence shows that many of the key zzso lipids and zzso responsible for their metabolism reside in zzso Moreover, the association of the nuclear zzso cycle with progression through the cell cycle and commitment toward differentiation has built a wider picture of the implications of zzso in the control of nuclear zzso This article reviews a central aspect of zzso nuclear zzso zzso the spatial organization of the signaling system within the nucleus in relationship to the nuclear organization in functional zzso Most of the evidence obtained with a variety of zzso and electron zzso zzso techniques indicates that the zzso the zzso required for their synthesis and zzso and the targets of the zzso second zzso are localized at zzso structures involved in the transcript processing in the zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that nuclear zzso lipids exist in a zzso form, linked to structural nuclear proteins of the inner nuclear zzso They also suggest that the zzso signaling in the nucleus is completely independent of that at the cell surface and that it probably preceded in evolution the systems that are present at the zzso and cell membrane zzso
