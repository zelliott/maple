zzso gene zzso into cell lines has been an approach used successfully to zzso the functional role of cell surface zzso We have zzso the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso gene into a human, zzso zzso cell line, zzso zzso This zzso led to a marked zzso of zzso zzso in zzso to zzso and collagen zzso and inappropriately zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was reduced in the zzso despite increased expression of focal zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso showed a distinct cell zzso an increased number of focal zzso sites, and different sensitivity to zzso D treatment than control zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that inappropriate zzso of cell surface zzso such as zzso can change focal zzso as well as zzso signal zzso and block zzso cell zzso in zzso
