zzso is a zzso element zzso binding protein that causes zzso of select sets of transcripts in different cell zzso We have recently described that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stabilization and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso through an impairment of zzso zzso 

zzso of this study was to identify additional zzso targets whose stability and zzso levels are enhanced by zzso zzso First, through zzso analyses of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, we identified 34 zzso transcripts zzso in cells expressing a zzso active form of zzso In zzso by an affinity zzso technique followed by zzso zzso 12 zzso target of zzso additional to zzso were zzso Among them, seven zzso were zzso in cells expressing activated zzso Both zzso levels and stability of these new zzso targets were consistently increased by either zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

Our study identified a set of transcripts that are targets of zzso and whose expression is increased by zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso binding zzso signaling molecules and a zzso zzso The increased expression of these gene products upon zzso zzso could play a role in the cellular events initiated by this signaling zzso
