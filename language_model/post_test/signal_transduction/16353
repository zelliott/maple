zzso plays a key role in the zzso of Alzheimer's disease and related zzso We have previously shown that expression of zzso human truncated zzso zzso zzso derived from sporadic Alzheimer's disease, induced zzso zzso accompanied by zzso and zzso zzso in the brain of transgenic zzso The aim of the current study was to determine the molecular mechanism underlying innate immune response induced by zzso truncated zzso We found that zzso zzso truncated zzso induced zzso transformation of zzso from resting into the zzso zzso zzso truncated zzso caused the release of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tissue inhibitor of zzso from the mixed zzso zzso zzso when the pure zzso culture was activated with truncated zzso it displayed significantly higher levels of the zzso zzso suggesting a key role of zzso in the zzso inflammatory zzso zzso analysis showed that truncated zzso increased the zzso levels of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso factors zzso and zzso that ultimately resulted in enhanced zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our results showed for the first time, to our knowledge, that zzso truncated protein zzso is able to induce innate immune response via a zzso zzso zzso we suggest that zzso truncated protein zzso represents a viable target for zzso of Alzheimer's zzso
