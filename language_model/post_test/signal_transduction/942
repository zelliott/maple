zzso immunity constitutes the first line of defense against attempted microbial invasion, and it is a zzso phenomenon in zzso and zzso Recent pioneering work has revealed striking similarities between the molecular organization of animal and plant systems for zzso recognition and zzso zzso Like animals, plants have acquired the ability to recognize zzso zzso molecular patterns zzso that are characteristic of microbial organisms but which are not found in potential host zzso Such structures, also termed general zzso of plant defense, are often indispensable for the microbial lifestyle and, upon zzso perception, inevitably betray the zzso to the plant's surveillance zzso zzso similarities have been uncovered in the molecular mode of zzso perception in animals and plants, including the discovery of plant receptors resembling zzso zzso receptors or zzso zzso zzso domain zzso repeat zzso Moreover, molecular building blocks of zzso signaling zzso leading to the zzso zzso of immune response genes are shared among the two zzso In particular, zzso oxide as well as zzso protein zzso zzso have been implicated in triggering innate immune responses, part of which is the production of zzso zzso In addition to zzso pathogen defense, disease resistance programs are often initiated upon zzso recognition of microbial zzso zzso factors, a recognition specificity that is not known from zzso
