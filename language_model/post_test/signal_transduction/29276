T cell zzso differs dramatically depending on whether the cell is circulating within the zzso zzso through zzso or interacting with zzso zzso The transition between these states requires important zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso Recently, analysis of zzso proteins associated with T cell zzso has provided new insights into how T cells control zzso dynamics in response to external stimuli and how zzso zzso downstream signaling events and zzso zzso Among the zzso proteins that have been identified are zzso factors such as zzso zzso and zzso severing proteins such as zzso motor proteins such as zzso zzso and zzso proteins such as zzso and zzso We review the current literature on how signaling pathways leading from diverse cell surface receptors regulate the coordinated activity of these and other zzso proteins and how these proteins control T cell zzso
