To investigate the association of zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso and development of alcohol dependence in Mexican zzso 

zzso blood samples were collected from 374 alcoholic and zzso zzso Mexican zzso these two groups were zzso and zzso Sample DNA was extracted and zzso DNA was amplified by zzso chain zzso The zzso 2-3 zzso chain reaction products were zzso with zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in the regulatory region as well as zzso zzso and zzso in zzso 3 were studied by zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso distribution of zzso 2-3 was zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso group compared to zzso zzso and zzso in the alcoholic group zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso distribution of zzso was zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso group compared to zzso zzso and zzso in the alcoholic group zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not zzso in Mexican Americans, and all those studied had zzso zzso and zzso zzso for these three zzso zzso The zzso 2-3 did not show zzso level difference between alcoholic and zzso individuals, but zzso zzso showed a significant zzso frequency difference between alcoholic zzso and zzso zzso populations zzso zzso zzso Excluding obese individuals, significant differences were found at both zzso and zzso levels for the zzso 2-3 zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso Excluding smokers, a significant difference was found only at the zzso level for the zzso 2-3 zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso controls, but only at the zzso level for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso in the regulatory region of zzso are implicated in zzso of alcohol dependence and the zzso signaling zzso might be important for this dependence development in Mexican zzso
