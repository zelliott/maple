Heat zzso zzso zzso changes that improve the ability to cope with extreme environmental zzso zzso zzso is zzso by an expanded dynamic zzso span zzso reflected in the intact zzso by a lower temperature threshold zzso for heat zzso and delayed zzso for zzso zzso This principle shares common zzso features with each of the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso induced zzso response increases due to greater cardiac output distribution to the zzso zzso thereby increasing circulatory reserves and delaying zzso zzso During short-term heat zzso zzso accelerated zzso zzso plays a major role in the control of body zzso zzso zzso however, is achieved only following long-term heat zzso zzso and is characterized by increased zzso zzso efficiency, namely zzso organ zzso zzso ratio zzso Two zzso responses, derived from our data on the zzso rat model, are zzso zzso zzso of the zzso signaling for water zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso mechanisms for increased zzso efficiency in the zzso Our data indicate that increased efficiency upon zzso develops by zzso of gene zzso A reduced zzso hormone level is responsible for some of the molecular zzso zzso Delayed zzso injury observed upon zzso is due to enhanced zzso mechanisms of which the zzso heat shock protein zzso 72 zzso plays a major zzso Our data indicate that heat zzso zzso the zzso molecular machinery to respond faster and increases the zzso level of the zzso zzso is the zzso during which most zzso adaptations are switched zzso
