In the zzso zzso zzso the presence of high levels of zzso leads to an array of zzso effects known as zzso zzso This process is complex due to the presence of feedback zzso and zzso between different zzso complicating the use of intuitive approaches to analyze the zzso 

We established a logical model of zzso zzso repression, zzso as a zzso The model was constructed based on verified regulatory interactions and it includes 50 gene zzso 22 zzso 5 zzso and 118 zzso We zzso the logical steady states of all zzso in the network in order to simulate zzso and deletion zzso responses to different sugar zzso zzso of the model zzso power was achieved by comparing changes in the logical state of gene zzso with zzso zzso Overall, we observed zzso true predictions, and analyzed sources of errors and discrepancies for the zzso 

Though the zzso nature of logical zzso models zzso inherent limitations, our model constitutes a primary tool for storing regulatory knowledge, searching for zzso in hypotheses and evaluating the effect of deleting regulatory elements involved in zzso zzso
