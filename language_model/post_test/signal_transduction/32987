zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been implicated as a contributing factor in the development of zzso and zzso zzso diseases such as cancer and zzso Several zzso studies suggest that green tea may prevent the development of cancer and zzso One of the major constituents of green tea is the zzso zzso zzso zzso In an attempt to offer a possible explanation for the zzso and zzso activity of zzso we examined the effect of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the 44 zzso and 42 zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells zzso from rat zzso zzso were treated with zzso zzso zzso for 24 h and zzso with the above mentioned zzso for different time zzso zzso of the zzso was detected by the enhanced Western zzso method using zzso zzso zzso zzso that recognized the zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso with 10 and 50 zzso zzso resulted in an zzso and a complete zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso In striking contrast, zzso zzso zzso did not influence zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso II, and zzso Similarly, the zzso effect of zzso on the zzso and zzso zzso expression as well as on zzso free zzso concentration was completely inhibited in zzso zzso whereas the effect of zzso was not zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by the enhanced Western zzso method revealed that zzso treatment effectively zzso zzso zzso of these zzso in zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso formation of human zzso cells zzso and colony formation of zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso are completely inhibited by zzso zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso is a selective inhibitor of the zzso zzso of zzso and its downstream signaling zzso The present findings may partly explain the zzso and zzso activity of green zzso
