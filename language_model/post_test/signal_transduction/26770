The zzso zzso zzso forms contacts with the plasma zzso These contacts are known to function in zzso zzso transport and zzso zzso resides in specific zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso where it binds zzso lipids at the zzso face of the plasma zzso Here, we report that zzso recruits zzso of the zzso zzso to the plasma zzso zzso determines the amount of cortical zzso present and the distance between the zzso and the plasma zzso zzso of zzso resulted in an increased distance between zzso and plasma membrane and allowed access of zzso to the space between the two zzso zzso that zzso zzso showed an association of the nucleus with the plasma zzso The zzso of the zzso and zzso growth were sensitive to the abundance of zzso Moreover, zzso effects on zzso pH and genetic interactions link zzso to the activity of the zzso pump zzso in the plasma membrane during cellular adaptation to the growth phase of the zzso zzso we found a partial zzso of zzso cortical zzso and zzso zzso of the plasma zzso Hence zzso may be critically positioned in zzso that couple functions of the zzso and the plasma zzso
