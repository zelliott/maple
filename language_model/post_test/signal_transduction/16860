zzso target rapidly dividing cancer cells by directly or indirectly inducing DNA zzso Upon recognizing DNA damage, cells initiate a variety of signaling pathways collectively referred to as the DNA damage response zzso Interestingly, the pathways used to elicit this response are as varied as the types of DNA damage zzso However, the zzso of these various pathways has similar results including DNA repair, suppression of global general translation, cell cycle arrest and, ultimately, either cell survival or cell zzso This review will focus on a series of zzso DNA zzso and highlight recent advances in our understanding of the zzso the DNA repair pathways it activates and the cellular consequences of these zzso zzso
