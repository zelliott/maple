The zzso zzso mediates zzso cell binding to the zzso zzso and zzso an zzso signal promoting survival of zzso cells and various tumor zzso While the zzso zzso survival signal has been shown to be zzso dependent, a thorough analysis has not been performed comparing the zzso effects of zzso binding to zzso zzso with the effects induced by the growth of cells in zzso In this study we demonstrate that expression of zzso zzso in human embryonic kidney zzso cells transfers the zzso zzso survival zzso to an zzso cell zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso zzso cells respond differently to zzso zzso zzso treatment and growth in suspension zzso Treatment with the zzso zzso zzso resulted in an zzso response occurring prior to cell detachment and was not observed in either suspended cells or zzso suspended zzso These data suggest that the death induced by zzso binding to zzso zzso results in an zzso signal with different zzso than the zzso signal induced by zzso detachment zzso Since zzso zzso zzso expression in tumor models is thought to play a role in tumor cell survival, these data have implications for the use of zzso zzso as zzso zzso
