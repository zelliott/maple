zzso zzso neurotransmitter zzso which constitute a gene zzso are crucial for limiting neurotransmitter zzso Thus, it is critical to understand their zzso This review focuses primarily on the zzso zzso the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso administration of drugs that alter neurotransmitter release or inhibit zzso activity can produce persistent zzso changes in brain zzso number and zzso However, regulation has not been universally zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso function and/or number occur in response to more acute zzso including membrane potential changes, zzso exposure, ethanol exposure, and zzso zzso zzso In many cases, acute regulation has been shown to result from a rapid zzso of the zzso between the cell surface and zzso zzso Second zzso systems involved in this rapid regulation include protein zzso and zzso of which protein zzso C has been the best zzso These signaling systems share the common characteristic of altering zzso transport zzso and/or cell surface zzso consistent with regulation of zzso zzso Although less well zzso zzso acid, zzso oxygen species, and zzso oxide also alter zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso interactions and zzso zzso regulate zzso activity and zzso Furthermore, promoter regions involved in zzso zzso regulation have begun to be zzso Together, these findings suggest that zzso zzso neurotransmitter zzso are regulated both long-term and in a more dynamic manner, thereby providing several distinct mechanisms for altering synaptic neurotransmitter zzso and zzso
