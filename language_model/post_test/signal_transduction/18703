Cell for cell, probably no human cancer is as aggressive as zzso It is among a handful of zzso whose dimensions are reported in zzso zzso thickness approaching 4 zzso presents a high risk of zzso and a diagnosis of zzso melanoma carries with it an abysmal median survival of zzso zzso What features of this zzso account for such aggressive zzso Is it the migratory history of its cell of origin or the programmed adaptation of its differentiated progeny to environmental stress, particularly ultraviolet zzso While the answers to these questions are far from complete, major strides have been made in our understanding of the zzso zzso and genetic zzso of zzso More importantly, these discoveries carry profound implications for the development of therapies focused directly at the molecular engines driving melanoma, suggesting that we may have reached the brink of an unprecedented opportunity to translate basic science into clinical zzso In this review, we attempt to zzso our current understanding of the zzso and biology of this disease, drawing from expanding zzso information and lessons from development and genetically engineered mouse zzso In addition, we look forward toward how these new insights will impact on therapeutic options for zzso melanoma in the near zzso
