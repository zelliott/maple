The content and activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein is high in sink zzso but low in source zzso In this report, we examined light and zzso signals regulating zzso protein degradation in zzso zzso zzso leaves during zzso We found that zzso protein accumulated in zzso leaves of the zzso zzso but was rapidly zzso upon exposure to white, blue, or red zzso This occurred concurrent with the zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation was not inhibited by the zzso inhibitor zzso Moreover, neither full-length nor truncated zzso zzso at the zzso site was found in the crude zzso zzso fraction zzso zzso zzso isolated in the presence of zzso However, zzso degradation was strongly inhibited by feeding zzso or zzso acids to detached leaves, while zzso feeding had no zzso Of the zzso acids tested, zzso zzso had the greatest zzso zzso these results demonstrate that zzso protein degradation during zzso zzso is zzso zzso can be triggered by either blue- or red zzso signaling zzso zzso does not involve the zzso zzso and zzso is inhibited by free zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso degradation is important to supply zzso for the synthesis of other proteins required for zzso zzso
