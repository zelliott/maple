zzso exposure is a zzso germ cell injury model leading to cell cycle arrest or zzso The zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso cell death induced by different stimuli including growth factor withdrawal, cell cycle zzso DNA damage, and loss of cell zzso However, the in zzso relevance of this zzso zzso has not been explored in the zzso To evaluate a protective role for zzso in the zzso in zzso we examined the zzso of zzso in zzso mice after zzso germ cell zzso We found that zzso zzso activity increases in the zzso of zzso mice after zzso radiation, and that loss of zzso results in an earlier onset of germ cell zzso and enhanced sensitivity of zzso zzso to zzso zzso At both the zzso and protein level, neither zzso nor zzso expression were induced in the absence of zzso These data demonstrate an important survival function governed by zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso in the survival of germ cells after zzso zzso zzso In addition, the results point to a role for zzso zzso in the regulation of this zzso
