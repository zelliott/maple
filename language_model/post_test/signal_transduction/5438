zzso limb development is controlled by three signaling centers that regulate limb patterning and growth along the zzso zzso zzso (AP) and zzso zzso limb zzso zzso of limb development along these three axes is achieved by interactions and feedback zzso involving the zzso signaling molecules that mediate the activities of these signaling zzso However, it is unknown how these signaling interactions are processed in the responding zzso We have found that distinct zzso zzso zzso factors, zzso by the zzso zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso integrate the signaling events that link limb patterning and outgrowth along all three zzso zzso loss of zzso and zzso function resulted in patterning and growth defects along the zzso and the zzso limb zzso zzso but more zzso zzso were observed when the activities of all three factors, zzso zzso and zzso were significantly reduced by removing their obligatory zzso zzso This reveals that the zzso zzso factor zzso can partially compensate for the function of zzso and zzso in regulating zzso and zzso limb patterning and zzso We further showed that zzso and zzso can fully substitute for each other, and that zzso is partially zzso in controlling the production of output signals in zzso cells in response to zzso and zzso zzso Our results indicate that several distinct zzso zzso factors in conjunction with their zzso zzso serve as common central zzso of distinct signaling interactions and feedback zzso to coordinate limb patterning and outgrowth along the zzso zzso and zzso axes after limb bud zzso
