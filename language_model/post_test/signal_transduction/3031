zzso signaling is strongly implicated in zzso but the role of this zzso in human breast cancer has been zzso Here, we examined zzso zzso zzso as a function of breast cancer zzso and tested for a relationship with zzso zzso using a human tissue zzso zzso benign breast zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and invasive zzso zzso were scored for zzso zzso a key functional component of zzso zzso and for zzso zzso a hallmark of zzso zzso zzso Only zzso of benign samples exhibited zzso zzso indicating a finite frequency of zzso zzso The frequency of membrane zzso was similar in zzso samples, but was significantly reduced in zzso zzso zzso consistent with loss of zzso junctions during acquisition of zzso zzso membrane status in zzso correlated with higher grade zzso and zzso zzso status zzso both zzso of poor zzso zzso a substantial frequency of zzso zzso was observed in benign breast zzso zzso similar to that in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso observed in benign breast may identify putative stem zzso An increased frequency of zzso zzso was observed in zzso tumors zzso suggesting that zzso zzso may be an early event in human breast zzso A correlation was observed between zzso expression and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was detected in zzso mouse zzso zzso The zzso mouse strain, a previously validated reporter of zzso zzso zzso was zzso to define in zzso zzso consequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso observed in zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso mice, highlighted by robust zzso zzso likely represent the earliest stage of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our study thus provides provocative evidence for zzso signaling as an early, zzso event in breast zzso
