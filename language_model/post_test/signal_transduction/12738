zzso of zzso and zzso signaling pathways has been implicated in many aspects of biological events during zzso and in zzso A zzso protein zzso and its zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to zzso zzso signaling and also inhibit zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling activity by zzso is brought about by an interaction with the zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso is by binding to zzso zzso Here we have investigated the mode of action of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso It was found that zzso binds zzso through one of three zzso formed by the zzso zzso The zzso deletion construct lacking the zzso loop domain nevertheless binds zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso does not interfere with zzso zzso suggesting separate zzso for the physical zzso zzso zzso also show that the ability of zzso to block zzso activity through zzso is not zzso by zzso In contrast, the ability of zzso to inhibit zzso is prevented by additional zzso zzso a preference of zzso in binding zzso over zzso In addition to the interaction of zzso with zzso and zzso the molecular characteristics of zzso such as zzso and association with zzso zzso zzso on the cell surface, are zzso This study helps to understand the multiple functions of zzso at the molecular level and suggests a possible role for zzso in balancing zzso and zzso zzso
