The aim of this study was to determine whether the zzso zzso zzso zzso affects the zzso zzso and growth in zzso zzso zzso We showed that the zzso zzso increased the zzso level of zzso in zzso cells and led to rapid stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso also resulted in suppression of cell growth and a zzso induction of zzso Data showed that zzso (up to 50 zzso an zzso zzso did not affect the cell zzso whereas the zzso of zzso zzso was completely blocked by zzso a zzso inhibitor at a concentration of 210 zzso We conclude that the zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso is a major zzso to mediate the zzso
