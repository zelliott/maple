zzso infection of the zzso spinal zzso zzso was used as a model system to investigate innate immune responses during viral zzso including the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso signaling and increased expression of inflammatory zzso zzso zzso was associated with the pronounced zzso of SC zzso as evidenced by characteristic changes in cellular zzso and increased expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of inflammatory zzso known to be released by activated zzso including zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso and gamma zzso zzso was also significantly zzso in the SC of zzso animals compared to zzso zzso zzso infection of the mouse SC was also associated with increased expression of genes involved in zzso zzso including zzso genes zzso Further, zzso infection of mice deficient in the expression of the zzso zzso zzso resulted in accelerated zzso demonstrating that zzso signaling is protective during zzso zzso zzso performed in ex zzso SC slice cultures zzso confirmed that resident SC cells contribute to the production of at least some of these inflammatory zzso and zzso during zzso zzso zzso but not zzso were still zzso and zzso inflammatory zzso were still produced in zzso zzso mice, demonstrating that zzso signaling is not absolutely required for these zzso zzso Our results suggest that activated zzso and inflammatory zzso contribute to a local zzso that is deleterious to zzso zzso
