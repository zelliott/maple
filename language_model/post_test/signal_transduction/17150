Stroke is the second leading cause of death among adults zzso zzso is an zzso protein that plays important roles in regulating zzso zzso and zzso zzso The role of zzso in the context of brain zzso has not been zzso 

zzso zzso of the middle cerebral artery was performed on zzso knockout zzso mice, mice that carried a zzso zzso active zzso zzso zzso and the appropriate zzso The outcome of the zzso was evaluated by examination of the zzso and zzso volumes and by neurological score zzso The brains were collected 24 h or 3 days following the induced zzso Compared with the control mice, the zzso zzso mice exhibited lower zzso volumes and better outcomes in the neurological zzso zzso mice exhibited low expression levels of zzso inflammatory zzso an attenuated recruitment of inflammatory cells, and inhibited zzso of zzso The zzso zzso levels were also lower in the brains of the zzso zzso mice than in those of the control zzso The mice that expressed a zzso zzso active zzso zzso exhibited effects following the cerebral zzso injury that were the opposite of those that were observed in the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso signaling zzso was elevated in the zzso brains of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso mice exhibited minor zzso an attenuated inflammatory response and low levels of zzso zzso following an zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso is a critical zzso of zzso brain injury in an experimental stroke zzso zzso signaling most likely mediates the biological function of zzso in this model of cerebral zzso
