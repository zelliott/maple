A crucial event in the development of the zzso zzso junction zzso is the zzso enrichment of muscle zzso zzso receptors zzso This process involves two distinct steps: the local zzso of zzso at zzso which depends on the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by neural zzso and the global zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso which is triggered by zzso or by zzso zzso We and others have previously shown that zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulate zzso cluster formation in muscle cells, and that zzso zzso also mediate the zzso of zzso zzso clusters by zzso zzso although the specific zzso involved in this latter step remain zzso 

Using an zzso system that allows zzso cluster assembly and zzso to be studied separately and zzso we describe a previously zzso role of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso cluster zzso zzso was robustly expressed in embryonic zzso muscle in zzso and in cultured zzso muscle cells, and treatment of the muscle cultures with an inhibitor of zzso zzso blocked the zzso of zzso zzso clusters by zzso zzso In contrast, zzso in muscle cells of either zzso or zzso active zzso accelerated cluster zzso zzso forced expression in muscle of the zzso zzso zzso regulatory protein zzso also enhanced the zzso of zzso zzso whereas the expression of a truncated zzso zzso that suppresses zzso signaling inhibited cluster zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso zzso by zzso zzso through signaling zzso such as zzso promotes the zzso of zzso zzso clusters to facilitate the selective zzso of zzso at developing zzso
