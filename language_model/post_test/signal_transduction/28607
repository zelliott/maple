We recently showed that zzso zzso in zzso zzso have a much larger body size and that the zzso gene encodes zzso zzso protein zzso zzso Cell sizes, but not cell numbers, in the major zzso are increased in the zzso zzso interaction studies suggest that zzso zzso the zzso zzso that is known to control body zzso To understand the mechanisms of body size control in zzso zzso we zzso zzso zzso and zzso small zzso in the zzso zzso The volumes of major zzso were precisely determined with the method developed by zzso They are significantly decreased as compared to those of the zzso while cell numbers are not, indicating that cell size is zzso DNA contents in the zzso of major zzso are not significantly changed in the small zzso and in an zzso large zzso Total protein contents are much decreased in the small zzso and slightly increased in the zzso zzso Based on these results, we propose that decreased cell and body size of the small zzso in the zzso zzso is mainly due to decreased levels of protein zzso and that increase in fluid content is a major reason for the increase in cell and body size in zzso zzso
