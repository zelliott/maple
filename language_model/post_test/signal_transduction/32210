Signaling through the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is modulated by its interaction with zzso zzso zzso and zzso In cells expressing the zzso zzso complex, zzso stimulation results in the zzso of small zzso zzso and stimulation of cellular zzso By contrast, in cells expressing zzso and Met, zzso stimulation results in an association with the zzso protein zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso process that involves the zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso of zzso is necessary for zzso zzso of cellular zzso It is, however, unknown how zzso zzso regulates zzso interaction and zzso Here we show that the zzso of zzso by zzso and its subsequent zzso zzso by Met creates a zzso site for the zzso domain of growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso is thereby recruited into the zzso zzso complex and, through its zzso domain, interacts with zzso zzso and mediates zzso zzso zzso of zzso by Met and the recruitment of zzso have no effect on the zzso activity of zzso but are required for zzso zzso zzso effects of zzso on breast cancer zzso These data show zzso as a direct link between zzso and zzso downstream zzso
