zzso zzso is a key mechanism for regulating transcription, which plays an important role in the control of gene zzso tissue growth, and zzso In particular, zzso zzso 7 zzso a member of class zzso zzso is crucial in maintaining vascular zzso zzso zzso cells zzso play an important role in zzso However, whether zzso plays a role in the processes of zzso zzso remains zzso zzso and tube formation were the two major components of zzso zzso In this study, we show for the first time that zzso zzso weakened the migration and tube formation abilities of zzso zzso induced an increase of zzso and its nuclear export in a zzso manner, which could be partly inhibited by protein zzso D1 zzso zzso but not by the zzso inhibitor or the zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso involved in the zzso might be controlled by zzso zzso which regulates the zzso zzso by zzso but not the zzso and zzso zzso
