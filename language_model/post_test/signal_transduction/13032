The modulating effects of the orally active zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso on cell growth and zzso were evaluated in four zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso that express the zzso growth factor zzso and in zzso which is zzso growth factor zzso zzso growth zzso zzso growth was completely inhibited by zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso growth factor zzso cell lines, as were transforming growth zzso zzso zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso and downstream components of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Growth zzso in the absence of added transforming growth zzso was also observed which could be consistent with suppression of action of zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso by zzso zzso In support of this, transforming growth zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected by zzso in the zzso growth factor zzso cell zzso zzso zzso inhibited growth of the zzso zzso cancer zzso at 200 zzso zzso These data lend further support to the view that targeting the zzso growth factor zzso in zzso cancer could have therapeutic zzso
