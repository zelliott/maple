zzso cells zzso control allergic reactions and contribute to protective innate immune responses through zzso zzso The zzso zzso Lyn is important to the high affinity zzso zzso zzso signal zzso system in zzso but its role on the zzso zzso cascade is still zzso Here, we characterized several zzso responses in bone zzso mast cells zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso lower amounts of zzso after zzso challenge when compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso showed less zzso zzso zzso and zzso nuclear zzso after zzso triggering than zzso zzso zzso zzso and inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso reduced in the absence of zzso A zzso interaction between zzso zzso associated factor 6 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in zzso zzso and this complex was insensitive to zzso zzso Lyn zzso was activated and associated to zzso shortly after zzso addition in zzso zzso zzso two local zzso innate immune responses zzso we found that Lyn positively controls early zzso production and immune cell recruitment after an zzso injection of zzso Our results indicate that Lyn plays a positive role in zzso production of zzso in zzso controlling the activity of the zzso protein zzso
