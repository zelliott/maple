The zzso family zzso B zzso factor belonging to the zzso family zzso zzso plays a fundamental role in regulating peripheral B cell survival and zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to mediate these functions via zzso of the zzso zzso Signaling by the zzso is also required to sustain the zzso center zzso zzso zzso of this zzso results in the induction of zzso suggesting that this zzso factor acts downstream of the zzso and zzso zzso to promote peripheral B cell survival during primary and zzso zzso To test this idea, we created lines of mice zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso form of the zzso derived from the B zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, although dramatically elevated numbers of B cells accumulate in the periphery of these mice, these B cells exhibit extremely zzso primary development, formation of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, mice expressing the zzso zzso alone display a loss of marginal zone B cells, an expansion of zzso B cells that appear zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso and zzso regulate key and zzso aspects of peripheral B cell survival and zzso
