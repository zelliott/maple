zzso zzso 1 zzso is a zzso zzso implicated in zzso signaling pathways in vascular smooth muscle zzso We demonstrate that human coronary artery smooth muscle zzso cells require zzso for growth and that zzso zzso and protein levels are elevated in zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso we used pharmacological zzso of the zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly blocked zzso induction of zzso zzso and protein zzso indicating a regulatory role of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso To determine which zzso of zzso regulates zzso zzso and protein levels, zzso specific for zzso zzso and zzso were zzso We show that zzso zzso significantly blocked zzso increases in zzso zzso and protein expression levels as well as zzso zzso activity zzso In contrast, zzso or zzso zzso did not have an zzso Together, these results demonstrate that the zzso signaling zzso is involved in regulation of zzso with zzso playing a key role in zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso
