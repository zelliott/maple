The zzso zzso domain zzso zzso family zzso domain containing 12 zzso plays a protective role in zzso inflammation and zzso but the zzso function of this zzso during microbial infection is largely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a leading cause of food poisoning zzso Here, we show that zzso mice were highly resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso by suppressing zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso molecules prevented efficient clearance of bacterial burden, highlighting a role for zzso as a negative regulator of innate immune signaling during zzso These results underscore a signaling zzso defined by zzso zzso of host immune defenses that could be exploited by zzso zzso to persist and survive in the zzso
