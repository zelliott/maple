zzso zzso cell zzso zzso remains one of the most common zzso worldwide, and the mortality rate of this disease has increased in recent zzso No molecular markers are available to assist with the early detection and therapeutic evaluation of zzso thus, identification of zzso expressed proteins may assist with the detection of potential disease markers and shed light on the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso We performed a zzso zzso zzso analysis using an integrated zzso trap and zzso zzso system and a zzso data analysis pipeline to identify proteins that are zzso expressed in zzso zzso tumor cells relative to adjacent zzso zzso We identified zzso unique proteins in zzso oral zzso zzso obtained from three pairs of zzso specimens with a false discovery rate of zzso Among these, zzso proteins were zzso between tumor and zzso zzso Our data revealed 80 zzso proteins zzso zzso and 27 zzso when a zzso change was used as the zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analyses were performed to confirm the zzso of 12 zzso proteins in zzso zzso When the biological roles of 80 zzso expressed proteins were assessed via zzso analysis, the zzso zzso signaling zzso emerged as one of the most significantly altered pathways in zzso As many as zzso (10 of zzso of the zzso proteins belonged to the zzso gene zzso family, including zzso zzso protein zzso Using zzso cancer tissue zzso we determined that zzso is zzso in the majority of cheek and tongue zzso and in several cases of zzso zzso In addition, we found that zzso stimulates zzso expression in oral cancer cells and enhances their zzso in zzso Our findings shed new light on zzso zzso and provide a basis for the future development of novel zzso
