The type III zzso system zzso exports proteins from the zzso through both the inner and outer zzso to the external zzso Here, a system is constructed to harness the zzso zzso within zzso zzso Island 1 to export proteins of zzso zzso The system is composed of an zzso containing the target protein fused to an zzso zzso tag and its zzso zzso zzso is controlled by a genetic circuit that only turns on when the cell is actively zzso zzso The system is refined using a small human protein zzso zzso and demonstrated by exporting three silk zzso zzso zzso and zzso representative of different types of zzso zzso zzso genes zzso silk zzso were designed to enhance genetic stability and zzso zzso constructed by automated DNA zzso and cloned into the zzso control zzso zzso rates up to zzso zzso zzso zzso are demonstrated with up to zzso of expressed protein zzso This work introduces new parts to control protein zzso in zzso bacteria, which will be broadly zzso to problems in zzso
