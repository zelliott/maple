Free zzso zzso in zzso zzso excess zzso zzso which may be an important zzso response to the excess free cholesterol zzso zzso We have recently shown that zzso loading of zzso leads to zzso increases in PC mass and zzso and to the zzso zzso of the zzso form of zzso zzso zzso a key zzso in PC zzso zzso we explore further the mechanism of CT zzso in zzso zzso First, enrichment of zzso from control zzso with zzso in zzso did not increase CT activity, and PC zzso in zzso is zzso by zzso loading even when CT and zzso appear to be mostly in different zzso zzso These data imply that zzso activates zzso CT by a signaling zzso That the proposed signaling mechanism involves structural changes in the CT protein was suggested by data showing that two different zzso against synthetic CT peptides showed increased recognition of zzso CT from zzso cells despite no increase in CT zzso Since CT is zzso two-dimensional maps of peptides from zzso control and zzso zzso were zzso six zzso spots from zzso CT, but none from soluble CT, were zzso in the zzso zzso Furthermore, incubation of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso A, blocked increases in both PC zzso and zzso recognition of zzso zzso treatment of zzso from control zzso with zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso increased both CT activity zzso and zzso recognition of CT; soluble CT activity and zzso recognition were not substantially affected by zzso zzso In zzso zzso loading of zzso leads to the partial zzso of zzso CT, and possibly other cellular zzso which appears to be important in CT zzso This novel regulatory action of zzso may allow zzso to adapt to zzso loading in zzso
