Plant growth is regulated by a complex network of signaling zzso Points of convergence for the signaling zzso between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso which partly control overlapping processes during plant development, are largely zzso At the cellular level, zzso responses are controlled by members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family of zzso factors as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins that repress the activity of at least a subset of zzso Here, we show that the two zzso zzso zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are direct and critical zzso targets downstream from zzso in the control of zzso flowering time, and zzso zzso deficient in the synthesis or signaling of the zzso zzso are also impaired in zzso zzso and zzso and interestingly, zzso and zzso were previously identified as important zzso targets of the zzso signaling zzso In line with a critical regulatory role for zzso and zzso downstream from both zzso and zzso zzso we show here that the zzso zzso of zzso signaling is sufficient to suppress zzso zzso zzso through repression of zzso and zzso In addition, we show that zzso promotes zzso protein abundance through a zzso mechanism that could serve to override the zzso negative feedback regulation of zzso on its own zzso and thereby further promote zzso zzso
