zzso in DNA repair promote tumor development, but the impact on tumor progression is poorly zzso Here, discovery of a zzso circuit linking hormone signaling to DNA repair and therapeutic resistance is zzso zzso show that zzso zzso zzso activity is induced by DNA damage and promotes expression and zzso of a gene expression program governing DNA zzso zzso investigation revealed that activated zzso promotes resolution of zzso breaks and resistance to DNA damage both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as a key target of zzso after damage, controlling zzso DNA repair and cell survival after zzso zzso Finally, zzso was shown to zzso zzso function, consistent with a dual role in both DNA repair and zzso zzso zzso these studies identify the zzso circuit as a major zzso of DNA repair and therapeutic resistance and establish a new zzso for therapeutic intervention in advanced zzso 

The present study identifies for the fi zzso time a positive feedback circuit linking hormone action to the DNA damage response and shows the significant impact of this process on tumor progression and therapeutic zzso These provocative findings provide the foundation for development of novel zzso of therapeutic intervention for advanced zzso
