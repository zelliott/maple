zzso regarding substances that zzso zzso of cancer cells has gathered significant attention, as they benefit the development of novel zzso zzso The zzso and zzso activities of zzso zzso extracted from bark of zzso zzso were investigated in lung cancer cells in this zzso 

zzso and zzso effects of zzso E were examined by 3- zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and invasion zzso were performed on zzso zzso zzso and zzso human lung cancer zzso Cell zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso proteins were investigated by western zzso 

zzso E exhibited zzso and zzso activities in zzso zzso Cell zzso revealed that treatment of the cells with zzso zzso of zzso E resulted in a decrease of activated focal zzso zzso zzso downstream protein zzso B zzso zzso and Cell division zzso zzso all of which were associated with the zzso effect of this zzso zzso E inhibited invasion and migration of other lung cancer cells, namely zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

These results suggest that zzso E may be a promising candidate for zzso zzso
