It is well known that zzso acid zzso plays an important role in signal zzso in the central nervous zzso However, the function of zzso in the peripheral nervous system, including sensory zzso is still zzso In this study we have characterized the zzso cellular distribution, and function of zzso zzso zzso and the recently discovered zzso auxiliary zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, which are devoid of zzso We found zzso expression of both zzso and zzso zzso and a zzso membrane zzso of zzso In addition, we found that zzso zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso recordings showed that responses to the zzso zzso zzso zzso were variable and both increases and decreases in zzso were zzso This correlated with observed differences in zzso zzso current responses to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The functional diversity of the zzso regulation on the zzso of the zzso zzso cell bodies could be due to the zzso expression of zzso zzso and subsequent regulation of plasma membrane zzso zzso Taken together with our previous demonstration of a local zzso zzso system in rat zzso we provide an updated zzso model in the rat zzso that incorporates both zzso and zzso zzso
