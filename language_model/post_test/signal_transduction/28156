To verify whether targeting defective zzso T cell death zzso the sustained therapeutic benefit of zzso in Crohn's disease, we explored its in zzso zzso effect after 10 weeks of treatment, and its in zzso killing activity on zzso zzso T cells zzso and peripheral blood T cells zzso both isolated from Crohn's disease zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were collected from 10 Crohn's disease patients (six steroid zzso and four zzso before and after three consecutive infusions of zzso administered at week 0, 2, and 6 in a single intravenous dose (5 zzso and from 10 subjects who proved to have functional zzso zzso was determined in zzso by zzso zzso and in zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso from Crohn's disease patients cultured with zzso The effect of the broad zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso was tested in zzso on zzso and zzso treated with zzso zzso activity was determined by zzso 

In Crohn's disease patients, zzso treatment induced a sustained zzso zzso still evident four weeks after the last zzso In zzso zzso induced death of zzso from Crohn's disease patients occurred via zzso rather than zzso zzso showed a higher zzso to zzso induced zzso than zzso in Crohn's disease zzso The zzso zzso underlying the restoration of zzso induced zzso zzso occurred via the zzso zzso but not zzso zzso interaction in Crohn's zzso 

These findings demonstrate that zzso is the major mechanism by which zzso exerts its killing activity on zzso in Crohn's zzso The sustained zzso zzso action of zzso which extends far beyond its circulating half life, may be responsible for the sustained zzso induced in Crohn's disease patients by zzso zzso
