The effects of zzso a protein zzso zzso on the signal zzso and proliferation of zzso were zzso Signal zzso in response to zzso A zzso zzso as well as zzso A zzso zzso zzso of zzso incorporation into zzso were inhibited by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso proliferation in response to Con A in the presence or absence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso This zzso was observed regardless of whether zzso was added together with Con A or 3 zzso zzso High zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso proliferation induced by the calcium zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso whereas lower zzso of the inhibitor zzso or zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso incorporation in response to these zzso This dual effect of zzso was also observed in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the response to zzso and zzso at all zzso of the inhibitor and no zzso was zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso in zzso cells was also inhibited by zzso We suggest that the zzso of zzso proliferation by zzso results from zzso of both protein zzso C and zzso zzso the zzso of the response to zzso and zzso results from zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso of signal zzso as well as zzso of zzso zzso result from zzso of zzso zzso
