A zzso model of zzso potential generation in the male zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso It takes into account all zzso zzso zzso of zzso molecules from air to zzso zzso their zzso and interaction with the zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso zzso focuses on the main zzso zzso These processes involve the production and degradation of second zzso zzso and zzso the opening and closing of a series of zzso channels zzso zzso channel, zzso zzso channel, zzso zzso channel, and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The whole network is regulated by zzso zzso zzso C and zzso that exert feedback zzso on the zzso and zzso The evolution in time of these linked chemical species and currents and the resulting membrane zzso in response to single pulse stimulation of various zzso were zzso The unknown zzso values were fitted by comparison to the zzso and zzso characteristics zzso and falling zzso of the zzso measured zzso potential at various zzso zzso The model obtained captures the main features of the zzso zzso the wide dynamic range of six decades with the same zzso as the experimental data, the short rising time, and the long falling zzso It also reproduces the second zzso zzso It suggests that the two main types of zzso zzso channels play different roles at low and high zzso zzso the zzso zzso channel plays the major role for zzso at low zzso and the zzso zzso channel plays the major role for zzso at middle and high zzso Several testable predictions are proposed, and future developments are zzso
