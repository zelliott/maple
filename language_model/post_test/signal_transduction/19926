zzso the molecular mechanism that zzso the differentiation of neural stem cells zzso is vital to develop zzso medicines for neurological zzso In our previous work, zzso was found to be able to prompt zzso differentiation when it was down zzso However, it is unclear how zzso regulates this differentiation zzso zzso a novel systems biology approach is presented here to identify putative zzso pathways regulated by zzso during zzso zzso and these pathways can provide insights into the zzso differentiation zzso In particular, our proposed approach combines the zzso power of zzso biology and molecular zzso With different biological experiments, the genes in the zzso identified zzso network were validated to be indeed regulated by zzso during the differentiation of zzso In particular, one randomly selected zzso involving zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso verified to be regulated by zzso These promising results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed systems biology approach, indicating the potential zzso power of zzso zzso and experimental zzso
