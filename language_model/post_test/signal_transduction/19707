zzso Type 1 diabetes zzso is a devastating zzso disease that destroys beta cells within the pancreatic zzso and zzso over 10 million people zzso These patients face zzso risks for blindness, cardiovascular and zzso diseases, and complications of insulin zzso New therapies that protect zzso from zzso destruction and allow continuing insulin production are zzso zzso evidence regarding the zzso of zzso indicates that zzso are destroyed by the relentless attack by zzso immune cells evolving from an zzso action of the zzso in addition to zzso immune system that produces zzso zzso zzso and other zzso of zzso zzso We tested the hypothesis that targeting nuclear import of zzso zzso factors evoked by zzso innate and zzso immunity receptors would protect zzso from zzso zzso 

Here we show that a zzso inhibitor of nuclear import, zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso protection following a zzso course of intense treatment in zzso mice, which resulted in a zzso state for one year without apparent zzso This nuclear import inhibitor zzso reduces the zzso of zzso zzso zzso while enhancing zzso cell death of T and B zzso derived from zzso zzso non-obese diabetic zzso mice that develop zzso Moreover, in this widely used model of human zzso we noted zzso of zzso zzso and zzso production in immune zzso 

These results indicate that a novel form of zzso that targets nuclear import can arrest zzso destruction of zzso beta cells at the site of zzso attack within pancreatic zzso during the progression of zzso
