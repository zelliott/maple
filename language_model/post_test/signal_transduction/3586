Researchers from various disciplines, including cell and zzso biology, zzso and molecular medicine, have revealed an exceptional diversity of cellular functions that are zzso by zzso zzso Recent studies have directed our attention to proteins that zzso to the zzso transition zone zzso a small zzso zzso zzso that is situated between the zzso body zzso and the more zzso zzso zzso These reports shed light on the roles of zzso proteins in zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and pave the way for understanding their contribution to human zzso In this review, we describe the interplay of zzso protein complexes at the zzso zzso zzso genetic and zzso data towards an account of zzso function in zzso zzso
