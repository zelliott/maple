Human zzso zzso is considered the most zzso zzso discovered to date, although the precise mechanism activated downstream of its zzso zzso in blood vessels remains zzso The aim of this study was to determine the role of the store operated zzso entry zzso signaling zzso in zzso coronary artery zzso 

We used a combination of zzso tension zzso zzso imaging, zzso and molecular approaches to study zzso rat coronary artery zzso and zzso zzso zzso in coronary smooth muscle zzso We found that zzso promoted zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso influx, which were sensitive to classical zzso zzso In addition, zzso of either zzso or zzso essentially inhibited zzso zzso and prevented zzso but not zzso evoked contraction in zzso coronary zzso Moreover, we found that zzso zzso zzso was involved in zzso effects and that is zzso with zzso in different zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso significantly independent zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso an independent zzso zzso product, activated zzso but not zzso contraction and zzso 

Here, we demonstrated that different critical players of zzso signaling zzso are required for zzso zzso of rat coronary zzso
