zzso is a zzso zzso zzso which zzso in zzso cell signal zzso during T cell zzso as well as in zzso negative and positive zzso In zzso this zzso exhibits a variety of zzso of different molecular weight, whose roles have still to be fully zzso We report here that zzso of rat zzso after in zzso zzso and heat shock treatment was accompanied by an early zzso increase of cells expressing zzso the high molecular weight zzso of zzso zzso The same phenomenon was observed in zzso derived from in zzso zzso zzso However, the increase of zzso cells was not apparently characteristic of cells undergoing zzso as the same phenomenon was also observed in rat zzso induced to zzso by zzso zzso On the whole, these results suggest that zzso zzso can be added to the list of early molecular events, such as the increased expression of genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso factors zzso zzso we previously demonstrated in the same experimental model to occur and to be shared by these two apparently opposite biological zzso zzso cell proliferation and zzso both likely depending on a complex balance of protein zzso and zzso
