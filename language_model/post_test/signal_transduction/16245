The effects of essential zzso acid zzso supplementation during moderate steady state zzso zzso exercise on zzso skeletal muscle metabolism are not well zzso and the potential role of supplemental zzso on muscle protein synthesis zzso and associated molecular responses remains to be zzso 

This zzso crossover study examined whether zzso supplementation with 2 different zzso of zzso affected zzso state exercise zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso target of zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso 

Eight adults completed 2 separate bouts of cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso oxygen zzso zzso (10 g zzso drinks with different zzso contents zzso zzso zzso g zzso zzso zzso g zzso were consumed during zzso zzso and zzso protein turnover were determined by using primed continuous infusions of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso analyses were used to zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was zzso greater zzso zzso zzso after consumption of zzso zzso zzso zzso than after consumption of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein breakdown and synthesis were lower zzso zzso zzso and zzso was greater zzso zzso zzso after consumption of zzso than after consumption of zzso Regardless of dietary treatment, multiplex analysis indicated that zzso and zzso target of zzso zzso were increased zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso after zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso of zzso protein zzso and zzso regulated protein zzso increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso factor 2 decreased zzso zzso zzso after exercise but was not affected by dietary zzso 

These findings suggest that increasing the concentration of zzso in an zzso supplement consumed during steady state exercise elicits a greater zzso response during zzso This trial is registered at zzso as zzso
