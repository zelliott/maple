zzso females enter zzso with zzso reserves that exceed the number needed for zzso during a single zzso zzso depletion occurs throughout zzso life and ends in menopause, or zzso zzso when the zzso pool is zzso The mechanisms regulating the production of a zzso initial zzso pool are not well zzso However, the establishment of a zzso reserve is critical to defining the length of zzso zzso Here we show that zzso A zzso a known regulator of zzso formation and growth in zzso increased the number of zzso mouse primordial zzso by zzso when administered to zzso animals during the time of zzso zzso breakdown and zzso zzso This expansion in the initial zzso pool was characterized by a significant increase in both germ cell and zzso cell zzso However, the excess zzso formed shortly after birth did not persist into zzso and both adult zzso and zzso animals demonstrated normal zzso A zzso zzso kinetic constant zzso was modeled for the two groups of animals, and consistent with the empirical data, the zzso for zzso was twice that of zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso formation, zzso loss and zzso expansion from birth to zzso day 19 were also derived for vehicle and zzso treatment zzso zzso introduction of zzso zzso revealed an intrinsic zzso zzso sensing mechanism that controls the number of zzso available at zzso We propose that there is an optimal number of zzso present at zzso and when the zzso number is zzso it occurs at the expense of zzso zzso The proposed mechanism provides a means by which the zzso eliminates excess zzso containing zzso of poor quality prior to zzso thus maintaining fertility in the face of abnormal hormonal stimuli in the zzso zzso
