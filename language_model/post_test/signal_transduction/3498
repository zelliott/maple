The conversion of chemical energy into mechanical force by zzso zzso associated with diverse cellular zzso zzso is integral to cellular zzso including DNA zzso protein zzso cargo transport and membrane zzso The zzso zzso motor zzso zzso regulates zzso trafficking, zzso zzso formation and zzso zzso and zzso its precise functions has been challenging because of its rapid zzso of action and the lack of zzso chemical zzso Here we describe the discovery of zzso the first specific zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein trafficking within the primary zzso leading to their zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso also prevent zzso pole zzso zzso attachment, zzso zzso and zzso zzso in cultured zzso We further demonstrate the ability of zzso to block zzso zzso gliding and zzso activity in zzso zzso therefore will be useful zzso for studying cellular processes that require this zzso motor and may guide the development of additional zzso zzso zzso zzso
