zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso are effective for zzso cell lung cancer with zzso zzso zzso However, even in patients with an initial dramatic response to such a drug, acquired resistance develops after zzso zzso A secondary zzso of zzso in zzso and amplification of the zzso gene account for this zzso however, the zzso of approximately zzso of acquired resistance cases remain zzso We established an zzso lung cancer cell line named zzso that harbors an zzso zzso after continuously exposing zzso cells to zzso zzso cells were zzso more resistant to zzso than the parental zzso Although the zzso cells did not carry the zzso zzso or zzso amplification and had similar levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso increased in the resistant zzso It was found in the present study that zzso h of exposure to zzso in both cell lines did not affect zzso zzso but did result in increased zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was less suppressed than in zzso cells, although zzso and zzso were markedly suppressed in both cell zzso The combined treatment of zzso plus a zzso inhibitor zzso suppressed zzso in zzso zzso Similarly, the combination of zzso plus zzso or zzso against zzso restored sensitivity to zzso in zzso zzso The combination of zzso plus zzso was also effective for reducing zzso tumors in a zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso of zzso partially accounts for acquired zzso zzso
