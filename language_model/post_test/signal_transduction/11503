Stem cells generate many zzso short-lived cell types, such as blood, skin, and zzso throughout adult zzso Stem cells maintain a long-term capacity to zzso producing daughter cells that either zzso or initiate zzso Although the surrounding zzso or zzso influences stem cell fate decisions, few signals that zzso from the niche to specify stem cell zzso have been zzso Here we demonstrate that the zzso hub cells in the zzso zzso act as a cellular niche that supports stem cell zzso zzso cells express the zzso zzso zzso which activates the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso in adjacent germ cells to specify zzso and continual maintenance of the germ line stem cell zzso
