The potential contribution of zzso stress to zzso in infants induced by adaptation to chronic zzso and by zzso zzso is poorly zzso Under conditions of zzso stress, zzso oxygen species and zzso nitrogen species may contribute to zzso changes in hearts adapted to chronic zzso and to the zzso of zzso injury during both zzso and zzso Hearts from infant rabbits zzso from birth can be zzso by brief periods of zzso In contrast, hearts from infant rabbits adapted to zzso from birth appear resistant to zzso zzso Chronically hypoxic infant rabbit hearts are already resistant to zzso compared with zzso zzso controls, and thus additional zzso by zzso zzso may not be zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso protein and its product zzso oxide are increased, but not zzso message, in chronically hypoxic infant hearts to protect against zzso zzso zzso from birth also increases zzso of infant hearts by increasing association of heat shock protein 90 with zzso zzso infant hearts also generate more zzso by an zzso zzso zzso mechanism than chronically hypoxic zzso Thus, zzso appears to be critically important in adaptation of infant hearts to chronic zzso and in resistance to subsequent zzso by regulating the production of zzso oxygen and nitrogen zzso
