Six novel zzso that contain a fused zzso zzso ring system were zzso recently from the Red Sea purple zzso zzso zzso zzso of the effects of these zzso on cultured zzso and zzso cells revealed that they possess potent growth regulatory properties, and affect cell shape and zzso In mouse zzso cells, the zzso zzso inhibited cell proliferation and induced a process of differentiation during which the cells flattened onto the surface, increased considerably in size, and extended long zzso In zzso zzso the zzso slowed down cell zzso and caused an exceptional cell zzso or zzso In a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso restored many aspects of normal cell growth and zzso In addition, several of the zzso zzso the effects of zzso zzso on two zzso zzso processes involved in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity and induction of zzso for zzso zzso zzso All these effects suggest that the zzso zzso may act on the zzso signaling zzso However, a single application of these compounds was sufficient to completely block cell zzso and to induce and sustain differentiation and zzso zzso Furthermore, these effects were not readily zzso following removal of the zzso In contrast, a single application of agents that mimic or elevate zzso induced a transient response that waned with time in culture, and the effects induced by constant zzso of zzso reverse rapidly following drug zzso We propose that the zzso zzso cause growth zzso zzso and reverse transformation by zzso the activity state of proteins that are involved in the regulation of cell shape and zzso and serve as a target for the zzso and/or other second zzso zzso
