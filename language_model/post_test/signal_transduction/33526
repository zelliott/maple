zzso and high mobility group box zzso protein 1 zzso are two potent zzso zzso implicated as important zzso of zzso Increased levels of these zzso are found in the zzso of zzso arthritis patients, and the zzso trigger arthritis when applied into the zzso of zzso zzso zzso is actively released from immune cells in response to zzso once released, zzso in turn zzso production of several zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Whether zzso arthritis is zzso via the zzso pathway, however, is zzso The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether the zzso effect of zzso is dependent on zzso expression in zzso and to assess whether zzso zzso affects a zzso zzso response to zzso in zzso 

zzso knockout mice and zzso control animals on a zzso background were injected zzso with 5 zzso zzso zzso were dissected 3 days after zzso injection and were evaluated zzso by scoring the frequency and severity of zzso For in zzso studies, mouse zzso cultures from zzso knockout mice and from control mice were incubated with different doses of zzso and cell culture zzso were collected at different time points for analysis of zzso 

zzso injection of zzso into healthy mouse zzso resulted in an overall frequency of zzso to zzso zzso zzso No significant differences were found with respect to the severity and zzso of zzso between mice deficient for zzso zzso out of 18 mice with zzso in comparison with control zzso animals (six out of zzso No significant differences were detected between zzso cells from zzso mice versus zzso mice regarding zzso production upon stimulation with highly zzso zzso after 24 hours and 48 zzso Upon stimulation with a zzso dose of zzso zzso however, the zzso from zzso animals released significantly more zzso than cells from the knockout mice zzso zzso 112 zzso and 304 zzso 50 zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Our data show that zzso joint inflammation is not zzso via the zzso zzso Combined with our previous study, we suggest that zzso arthritis is probably zzso through zzso zzso
