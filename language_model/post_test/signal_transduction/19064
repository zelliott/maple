The zzso inhibitor zzso zzso has been shown to enhance the cell death induced by radiation and other DNA damaging agents selectively in cells with high rates of zzso like cancer zzso While energy linked modification of DNA and cellular repair processes have been suggested as possible mechanisms of zzso other effects such as global stress response cannot be zzso In this pilot study, we have investigated the effect of zzso and radiation on the zzso in an attempt to zzso how zzso impacts gene expression in undamaged verses zzso zzso damaged cells using a human zzso zzso cell line, zzso zzso growing zzso cells were exposed to various combinations of zzso and zzso and total zzso was isolated four hours after zzso Gene expression changes were zzso using zzso zzso As expected, zzso cells treated with zzso showed zzso of several zzso zzso stress response zzso Selective zzso and Western zzso confirmed these gene zzso Given that zzso deprivation leads to zzso zzso and zzso led to zzso of zzso response genes in our present study zzso zzso and zzso we examined the impact of transient zzso zzso and observed that induction of zzso and zzso appear to be via zzso zzso The majority of gene zzso seen with zzso alone were consistent with previous zzso While most gene zzso seen with zzso and zzso dual treatment were confirmed in the gene profiles seen with individual zzso or zzso treatments, several genes appeared zzso regulated between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, gene expression patterns suggested zzso in cell cycle regulation, zzso and zzso signaling zzso Taken together, this study provides new insights into how the zzso of tumor cells are likely to be affected by a combined stress caused by zzso and zzso
