zzso zzso genes have negative growth effects on tumor cells with certain cell zzso We have previously reported that zzso is specifically zzso in human zzso cell zzso cell zzso lines as well as zzso regions of zzso and that the zzso is expressed in the zzso cells of the zzso However, the precise role of zzso in growth control of zzso cells remains zzso In this study, we examined whether zzso could act in growth control against a human zzso cell, zzso zzso In order to estimate the cell growth control, we established zzso cells that have stable expression of zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells induced contact zzso of growth and reduced zzso growth ability, but did not significantly affect lag phase growth zzso This growth control by zzso was dependent on the zzso of the zzso transition from zzso to S phase at high cell density, and the zzso of the zzso transition related to the suppression of zzso zzso Furthermore, the suppression of zzso expression in zzso cells by short interfering zzso induced the zzso of zzso These data suggest that zzso has negative growth control of zzso cells, partly due to the zzso of the zzso zzso
