zzso zzso zzso zzso is a negative regulator of insulin zzso It is thought to carry out this role by interacting with and zzso the activated insulin zzso zzso However, little is known regarding the nature of the cellular interaction between these zzso especially because the zzso is localized to the plasma membrane and zzso to the zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso resonance energy transfer zzso the interaction between zzso and the zzso was examined in zzso human embryonic kidney zzso zzso Biological activities were not significantly affected for either zzso or the zzso with the fusion of zzso fluorescent protein zzso to the N zzso of zzso zzso or the fusion of zzso to the C zzso of the zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso was monitored in cells zzso with either wild type zzso zzso or the zzso form zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso with zzso resulted in distribution of zzso to the plasma zzso but no zzso was obtained upon insulin zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso with zzso caused an increase in zzso zzso zzso and, in some cells, a significant zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is interacting with the zzso during its zzso zzso of these cells with insulin resulted in a rapid induction of zzso that increased over time and was localized to a zzso zzso zzso of zzso with a zzso zzso zzso marker and treatment of the cells with insulin identified a zzso zzso compartment as the site of zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso could be prevented by the treatment of the cells with a specific zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso appears not only to interact with and zzso the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso compartment but is also involved in maintaining the zzso in a zzso state during its zzso
