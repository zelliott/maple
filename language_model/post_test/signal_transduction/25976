zzso zzso cells may opt to forgo normal cell division and instead form spores if subjected to certain environmental zzso for example zzso zzso or extreme zzso The resulting spores are extremely resilient and can survive for extensive periods of time, zzso under particularly harsh conditions such as those mentioned zzso The zzso process is highly time and energy consuming and essentially zzso The bacteria must therefore ensure that this route is only undertaken under appropriate zzso The gene regulation network governing zzso initiation accordingly incorporates a variety of signals and is of significant zzso We present a model of this network that includes four of these zzso zzso levels, DNA damage, the products of the competence zzso and cell population zzso Our results can be zzso as zzso zzso the model displays the correct zzso zzso in response to these zzso zzso a zzso level of zzso expression may prevent zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso is more likely to occur in a large population of cells than in a small one; zzso finally, and of most interest, zzso can act simultaneously as a zzso signal and as a timing zzso delaying zzso when the cell has damaged DNA, possibly thereby allowing the cell time to repair its DNA before forming a zzso
