In the brains of patients with fetal zzso disease zzso which is caused by exposure to zzso zzso during development, many zzso are zzso zzso and zzso indicating disrupted migration, zzso and zzso zzso affects a myriad of signaling zzso but little is known about which signals are primary targets for zzso deficits in zzso zzso In this study, using a mouse model of zzso we examined how zzso affects the migration of zzso zzso cells during early zzso zzso The zzso is one of the most susceptible brain regions to zzso exposure, and profound loss of zzso zzso cells is detected in the brains of patients with zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso cell migration by reducing the frequency of zzso zzso spikes through zzso in zzso zzso and zzso growth factor 1 zzso zzso First, zzso slows the speed of zzso cell migration in a zzso manner, independent of the mode of zzso Second, zzso reduces the frequency of spontaneous zzso spikes in zzso cell zzso in a zzso zzso Third, a unique in zzso zzso system for cell migration reveals that reducing the zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso spike frequency by stimulating internal zzso release and zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, or zzso zzso receptors ameliorates the zzso effects of zzso on zzso cell zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso spike frequency and zzso zzso and zzso signaling could be potential therapeutic targets for infants with zzso zzso
