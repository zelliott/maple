In bacteria, zzso zzso systems are major players for adaptation to environmental zzso The perception of a chemical or physical signal by a zzso triggers its zzso The zzso group is then transferred to the zzso response regulator, which mediates the appropriate zzso zzso zzso of the zzso cough agent zzso zzso is controlled by the zzso system zzso zzso the zzso zzso is active without specific stimuli at zzso in laboratory conditions and is zzso by the addition of negative chemical zzso The structure of zzso is complex, with two tandem zzso Venus zzso zzso and a zzso zzso domain that precedes the zzso domain, which is followed by additional zzso zzso zzso zzso are small, ubiquitous sensing or regulatory zzso The function of the zzso domain in zzso remains zzso 

We showed that zzso zzso zzso proteins form zzso that are stabilized by zzso zzso regions zzso the zzso zzso A structural model of the zzso domain zzso was built and zzso by zzso zzso and by zzso and functional zzso Although we found no zzso for the zzso domain zzso its integrity is required for zzso We also showed that the structural stability of the zzso core and its proper zzso to its zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are crucial for zzso zzso 

We propose that a major function of the zzso zzso domain is to maintain zzso signals arising from mechanical strain generated by the zzso zzso The tight structure of the zzso core and its connections with the upstream and downstream zzso ensure signaling to the zzso domain, which determines zzso zzso Many mild zzso that map to the zzso domain keep zzso active but make it unresponsive to negative zzso supporting that zzso increases zzso strain in the zzso
