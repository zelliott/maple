zzso is a common zzso modification of proteins and lipids of the zzso zzso that generates binding sites for zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso increases affinity for zzso Both zzso expression of the zzso and the zzso supply of zzso to the zzso and zzso regulate zzso distribution while protein sequences specify zzso site zzso providing zzso and genetic contributions to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso forming dynamic zzso or zzso that regulate various zzso of cell zzso migration, zzso survival and zzso There are a similar number of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and humans, but expression of zzso zzso zzso are a more recent feature of zzso zzso zzso might be considered a reading code for repetition of the minimal units of binding zzso and zzso site zzso in zzso The rapidly evolving and structurally complex zzso modifications to surface receptors are interpreted through affinity for the zzso which regulates zzso levels as a function of the cellular environment, and thereby the probability of various cell zzso Many important questions remain concerning the regulation of the zzso the zzso zzso and lattice interaction with other membrane zzso and zzso zzso
