A growing body of evidence suggests that exercise enhances zzso plasticity and function through zzso zzso which is zzso by zzso zzso However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms zzso the effect of zzso The present study investigated the effect of treadmill exercise on zzso zzso which mediates synaptic plasticity in the zzso of stressed zzso zzso were subjected to zzso stress zzso for 7 zzso The rats were run on the treadmill at a speed of zzso zzso for 5 zzso Western zzso was used to assess changes in the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and in zzso and various synaptic zzso zzso stress significantly decreased zzso expression and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, and zzso were zzso zzso exercise significantly attenuated the decreased expression of these zzso Moreover, exercise significantly increased zzso signaling in the absence of zzso zzso These results suggest that treadmill exercise reverses zzso changes in the rat zzso via an increase in zzso signaling and may induce a functional zzso of zzso zzso that mediate zzso zzso
