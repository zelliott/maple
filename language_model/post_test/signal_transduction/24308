Despite the prominent role played by zzso zzso stores in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso little is known about their contribution to the control of free zzso concentration zzso in the inner segments of zzso zzso Previously, zzso zzso zzso stores were shown to play a role in regulating zzso release from zzso To understand the properties of these zzso stores better we used pharmacological approaches that alter the dynamics of storage and release of zzso from zzso zzso zzso evoked readily discernible changes in zzso in the inner segments of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso responses in cone inner segments were unmasked in the presence of zzso of the plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso responses were blocked by zzso a selective blocker of zzso release and by zzso acid, a blocker of zzso zzso into the zzso zzso These two zzso also substantially reduced the zzso of zzso zzso increases, providing evidence for zzso zzso release zzso in rods and zzso The magnitude and zzso of zzso zzso zzso depended on the zzso zzso zzso activity and on zzso zzso These results reveal an intimate interaction between the zzso zzso zzso zzso channels, zzso and zzso zzso stores in zzso inner zzso and suggest a role for zzso in the regulation of synaptic zzso
