zzso zzso of nuclear factor zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso and degradation of its zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso rapid zzso of zzso which is responsible for zzso repression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the nucleus, where it zzso zzso from DNA and zzso zzso from the nucleus to the zzso in a nuclear export zzso process that is sensitive to zzso B zzso In the present study, zzso was used as a tool to inhibit nuclear export zzso nuclear protein export and evaluate the consequences for regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso of cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso or tumor necrosis factor zzso This is a consequence of the zzso of zzso degradation of zzso Although zzso treatment does not affect the signal zzso zzso leading to zzso degradation, it blocks zzso nuclear zzso zzso is thus accumulated in the nucleus, and in this compartment it is resistant to zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso degradation of zzso is zzso if not exclusively, a zzso zzso An efficient nuclear export of zzso is therefore essential for maintaining a low level of zzso in the nucleus and allowing zzso to be zzso active upon cell zzso
