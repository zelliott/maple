The zzso Growth Factor zzso zzso plays a role in multiple tumor cell processes and is targeted by several zzso zzso Although zzso zzso may determine tumor zzso in a small proportion of patients, knowledge of the zzso signaling zzso status in tumors may help guide further drug development and zzso combination zzso We aimed to validate and apply a novel zzso zzso zzso technique to characterize the status of zzso signaling in matched zzso tumor and normal colon tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso made from both zzso and normal zzso tissue in 18 patients and stained with zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso scored using the zzso Cellular Imaging System zzso II, zzso zzso zzso was compared against cell line Western zzso zzso and visual scoring zzso by a zzso We found that zzso analysis was highly zzso and results were well correlated with other zzso A zzso zzso zzso technique of analyzing zzso human samples showed good correlation between paired human samples zzso correlation for tumors, zzso zzso zzso zzso Cancer samples had markedly higher zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We conclude that zzso zzso of human tissue samples is zzso zzso and zzso with Western blots and zzso in cell line zzso as well as zzso scores of human zzso zzso tumors show higher zzso of zzso and downstream zzso compared to matched normal zzso zzso
