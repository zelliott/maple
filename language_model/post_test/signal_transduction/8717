Previous studies indicate that the zzso zzso is active and functional during zzso lens zzso In this study, the consequences of zzso zzso the zzso in lens during development were zzso 

To activate zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso coli zzso genes were zzso zzso in two zzso lines that are active in whole lens zzso or only in differentiated fibers zzso from zzso Lens zzso in zzso zzso was investigated by zzso zzso zzso zzso quantitative zzso zzso and zzso 

Only zzso with zzso resulted in zzso zzso indicating zzso signaling functions in lens zzso and during early fiber zzso zzso zzso were characterized by increased progression of zzso cells through the cell cycle, as shown by zzso zzso and zzso 3 and zzso D1 zzso and maintenance of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the fiber zzso zzso cell differentiation was delayed as shown by reduced expression of zzso and zzso and delay in expression of the zzso zzso From zzso there were numerous cells undergoing zzso and by zzso there was evidence of zzso transition with numerous cells expressing zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed large changes in expression of zzso target genes zzso zzso T zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and also several zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

These data indicate that the zzso zzso plays key roles in regulating proliferation of lens zzso cells during early stages of fiber cell zzso
