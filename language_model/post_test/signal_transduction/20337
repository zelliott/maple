The secondary zzso zzso in zzso growth factor zzso zzso is the major mechanism of acquired resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cell lung cancer zzso Although irreversible zzso zzso such as zzso or zzso have been introduced to overcome the acquired resistance, they showed a limited efficacy in zzso with zzso zzso we identified the novel de zzso resistance mechanism to irreversible zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells, which are zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso activated zzso zzso zzso signaling via zzso zzso zzso in both zzso zzso of zzso signaling zzso increased the sensitivity to zzso Cancer cells showed stronger zzso zzso and enhanced resistance to zzso in the presence of zzso lung zzso zzso of zzso significantly increased the sensitivity to zzso through zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by the interaction with zzso suggesting a critical role of zzso zzso loop between zzso and cancer cells in the development of drug zzso The enhancement of zzso sensitivity by zzso of zzso signaling was confirmed in in zzso zzso zzso zzso Similar to zzso de zzso resistance to zzso in zzso and zzso cells was also zzso by zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso signaling can be a potential therapeutic target to enhance the efficacy of irreversible zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso
