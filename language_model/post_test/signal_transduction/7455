zzso a product of the obese zzso has been reported to contribute to the development of zzso zzso in patients with diabetes and to activate the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso a citrus zzso protects zzso zzso zzso against high zzso zzso zzso by modulating the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We investigated the hypothesis that zzso prevents zzso injury by zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that the exposure of zzso cells to zzso (35 zzso for a 24 h markedly zzso the expression levels of both zzso and zzso zzso However, the increase in the expression levels of zzso and zzso receptors was greatly attenuated by treatment of the zzso cells with 80 zzso zzso 2 h prior to exposure to zzso In addition, treatment of the cells with 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso for 24 h prior to exposure to zzso markedly ameliorated the increased expression of zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso Of note, zzso of the cells with either 80 zzso zzso or 50 zzso LA markedly inhibited the zzso injury, leading to an increase in cell viability and a decrease in the total number of zzso cells, preventing zzso oxygen species zzso generation, as well as the dissipation of zzso membrane potential zzso In conclusion, the findings of the present study provide the first evidence that the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is involved in zzso injury, including zzso zzso zzso generation and the dissipation of zzso in zzso cardiac zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso protects cardiac cells against zzso injury by zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
