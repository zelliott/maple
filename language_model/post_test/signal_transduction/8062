We develop a zzso model for combining kernel zzso to predict the function of zzso It extends previous approaches in that it can handle multiple labels which naturally appear in the context of protein zzso 

zzso modeling of zzso significantly improves the capability of learning protein function from multiple zzso The performance and the zzso of the zzso model are further improved by simultaneously predicting the zzso zzso of proteins and by combining zzso zzso to consistent class membership zzso 

For the purpose of functional prediction of zzso zzso provide valuable information that should be included adequately in the training process of zzso Learning of functional categories gains from zzso of zzso zzso zzso separation rules allow very detailed insights into the relevance of different zzso like zzso structure, interaction data, or expression zzso A preliminary version of the software can be downloaded from zzso
