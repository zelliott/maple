Lower levels of zzso zzso activity in males are associated with a higher zzso of heart failure and worsened cardiac function after zzso zzso While zzso zzso by zzso provides zzso in zzso no information exists regarding the effect of testosterone on the zzso zzso zzso following zzso We hypothesized that following zzso zzso zzso testosterone will decrease zzso zzso zzso in male zzso zzso zzso testosterone will mediate downstream signals of zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso administration of zzso testosterone will zzso negative effects on the zzso zzso in zzso male zzso 

zzso hearts from zzso adult zzso zzso zzso zzso males with zzso zzso zzso zzso males with chronic zzso zzso zzso or acute testosterone infusion zzso zzso zzso zzso were subjected to zzso zzso zzso or zzso treatment significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso increased downstream zzso molecules zzso zzso zzso but reduced zzso consistent with decreased zzso injury in male hearts following zzso ATI administration, but not chronic zzso reversed these effects on zzso signaling associated with further exacerbated cardiac dysfunction in zzso zzso zzso lower levels of zzso were observed in male hearts, and zzso or zzso treatment restored zzso zzso expression to the levels of females in male hearts after zzso 

Our study represents the initial evidence of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in male hearts following zzso thereby zzso cardiac injury through decreased zzso reduced ratio of zzso in the zzso and increased zzso in the zzso
