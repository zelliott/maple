Signal zzso via zzso zzso receptors was investigated in zzso cells, a continuous cell line originally derived from an zzso human zzso zzso zzso specificity for zzso receptors in zzso cells was investigated with various zzso and their zzso zzso zzso zzso production was significantly increased by zzso zzso and zzso gamma zzso The zzso specificity of this effect agreed well with that of the zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso influx was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso beta S zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso specificity of zzso influx was much broader than zzso zzso Also zzso and zzso toxin had no effect on both zzso production and zzso influx by zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso influx more effectively than zzso zzso A zzso membrane protein was zzso with zzso This zzso protein is a putative zzso zzso zzso In particular, the zzso was inhibited by a zzso profile that corresponded to that for zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso stimulate zzso influx and zzso formation by separate pathways via zzso and zzso zzso G zzso Thus, in zzso cells, zzso formation is coupled to the zzso zzso while zzso influx is coupled to another zzso such as zzso that regulates calcium zzso
