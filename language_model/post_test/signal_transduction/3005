The assembly of neural circuits is dependent upon the generation of specific zzso zzso each zzso displaying unique properties that direct the formation of selective connections with appropriate target zzso zzso of zzso factors in neural zzso and zzso cells are key regulators in this zzso zzso zzso factors control crucial aspects of zzso zzso including zzso identity and zzso zzso Nonetheless, their regulation during development is poorly understood and the identity of the downstream molecular zzso of their activity remains largely zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso factor is zzso regulated in distinct pools of zzso zzso during the development of zzso connectivity in zzso Indeed, zzso of zzso provokes defective zzso zzso guidance in zzso while specific conditional deletion of zzso in the zzso produces zzso defects that alter projections from the zzso zzso nucleus and from the zzso zzso nucleus in zzso Moreover, we demonstrate that zzso influences zzso guidance and the topographical sorting of zzso by regulating the expression of zzso and zzso guidance zzso which are essential for these zzso to establish correct connections in the cerebral zzso Finally, zzso zzso function restores normal zzso guidance in zzso zzso By regulating zzso guidance zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso regulates the zzso guidance program of distinct populations of zzso zzso thus enabling the establishment of specific neural zzso
