Signaling through the zzso zzso is essential for the control of numerous zzso processes during embryonic life as well as in adult tissue zzso and zzso Since the outcome of zzso signaling is highly zzso and its precise zzso and pathological role in many zzso is zzso it is of great interest to zzso and identify the cells that receive active zzso signals in zzso Here, we report the generation and characterization of a zzso mouse line, zzso that when crossed to a zzso reporter mouse line allowed the identification of cells undergoing active zzso signaling in zzso Analysis of embryonic and adult zzso mice demonstrated that the zzso pattern of the zzso zzso with previously observed zzso patterns of the zzso zzso zzso Thus, this novel reporter mouse line provides a unique tool to specifically investigate the spatial and zzso aspects of zzso signaling in zzso
