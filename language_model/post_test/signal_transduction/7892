zzso zzso asymmetry is regulated by early zzso signals within the zzso Even though the role of the bone zzso protein zzso zzso in this process has been reported extensively in various model organisms, opposing models for the mechanism by which zzso signaling operates still zzso Here we show that in zzso zzso there are two distinct zzso during zzso patterning in which zzso signaling is zzso Using transgenic lines that zzso express either zzso or zzso we show a requirement for zzso signaling during early zzso to repress zzso expression in the right lateral plate zzso and regulate both visceral and heart zzso A second phase was identified during late zzso when zzso signaling is required in the left lateral plate zzso to regulate zzso gene expression and heart zzso Using zzso knock down experiments, we identified zzso as the zzso responsible for both zzso of zzso zzso In addition, we detected zzso expression in zzso zzso and show that restricted knock down of zzso in this structure results in zzso patterning zzso The identification of these two distinct and opposing activities of zzso signaling provides new insight into how zzso signaling can regulate zzso zzso
