In zzso zzso an initial exposure to zzso zzso exerts a short-term conditioning effect such that a second zzso exposure zzso activates zzso zzso current zzso The purpose of the present study was to determine the mechanism underlying the short-term conditioning induced by zzso that results in subsequent zzso zzso of zzso Cat zzso zzso were studied using a zzso patch whole cell recording zzso Changes in zzso zzso current zzso zzso were used as an index of relative changes in zzso zzso zzso The results show that when zzso zzso are treated with two consecutive zzso to 10 zzso zzso separated by a recovery zzso zzso activates a larger increase in zzso zzso zzso than zzso The additional zzso increase in zzso is selectively blocked by 10 zzso zzso identifying the current as zzso Moreover, zzso activated immediately after the withdrawal of zzso exhibited a transient increase in zzso above control zzso zzso consistent with rebound stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso a selective zzso of zzso protein zzso A, blocked the rebound stimulation of zzso and abolished zzso zzso of zzso zzso (5 zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso of zzso without decreasing rebound stimulation of zzso Rebound stimulation of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso both varied as a function of zzso zzso We conclude that withdrawal of an initial zzso exposure elicits a rebound zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso This mechanism zzso a short-term conditioning in zzso zzso such that a subsequent zzso exposure activates zzso The present results demonstrate novel zzso signaling mechanisms in the regulation of zzso
