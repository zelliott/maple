Based on previous studies showed zzso zzso induction of tissue factor upon zzso zzso we investigated whether zzso and zzso are linked to signaling pathways leading to tissue factor gene zzso Cellular interaction was zzso by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso on the surface of human zzso vein zzso cells zzso resulting in induction of tissue factor zzso and protein zzso zzso factor production could be independently abolished by zzso against zzso and by WEB zzso a zzso factor zzso zzso zzso Because WEB zzso prevented the production and/or zzso of zzso by zzso these results provide evidence for zzso and zzso signal pathways leading to tissue factor synthesis in zzso cells via an zzso feedback loop involving zzso and zzso zzso
