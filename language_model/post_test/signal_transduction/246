zzso is essential for zzso and zzso outgrowth during zzso Recent work points to the involvement of nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso in the regulation of genes important for zzso growth and zzso However, zzso has not been reported to directly control the zzso of zzso zzso zzso To identify zzso targets, we performed an in zzso promoter analysis and found a putative zzso site within the zzso zzso Using in zzso and in zzso experiments, we demonstrated that zzso regulates zzso but unexpectedly, does not promote but zzso the expression of zzso in zzso and in the developing zzso Specifically, in zzso zzso cells and in cultured cortical zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we also show that prior to zzso zzso zzso zzso occupies the zzso promoter in zzso cells, in cultured zzso and in the mouse zzso Finally, we observe that zzso is required to repress the zzso expression of zzso and other zzso outgrowth genes in specific zzso windows in the mouse zzso Taken together, our data reveal an unexpected role for zzso as a direct zzso zzso of zzso expression and suggest a more general role for zzso in the control of the zzso outgrowth zzso
