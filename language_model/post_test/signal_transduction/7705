zzso are zzso receptors controlling a range of responses that serve to zzso the zzso efficiency of zzso These include zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso movements in response to changes in light zzso Since the isolation of the zzso zzso gene in 1997, zzso have been identified in zzso and zzso where their zzso functions appear to be zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso and zzso that exhibit overlapping functions in addition to having unique zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso protein zzso Light sensing by the zzso is zzso by a repeated motif at the zzso region of the protein known as the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain results in zzso zzso and an initiation of zzso zzso Here we zzso the zzso and zzso events underlying zzso zzso in addition to the current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms associated with zzso zzso
