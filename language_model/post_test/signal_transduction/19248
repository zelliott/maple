The zzso zzso represents a key site for the induction of T cell zzso In particular, zzso regulator zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso provide a spectrum of zzso zzso that, through both direct presentation and zzso by zzso cells, purge the developing T cell repertoire of zzso zzso Despite this role, the mechanisms of zzso zzso development remain zzso particularly those stages that occur zzso expression and represent zzso terminal zzso In this study, in mouse zzso we analyze late-stage zzso development in relation to the timing and requirements for zzso and zzso zzso the latter a marker of terminally differentiated zzso including zzso zzso We show that zzso expression and terminal differentiation within the zzso lineage are temporally zzso events that are controlled by distinct zzso We find that whereas mature zzso are not essential for zzso zzso development, use of an zzso zzso transgenic mouse zzso which positive selection can be temporally zzso that the emergence of zzso zzso critically depends upon the presence of mature single positive zzso Finally, although initial formation of zzso zzso depends upon zzso zzso continued zzso development to the zzso stage maps to zzso of the zzso axis by mature zzso zzso our results reveal further complexity in the mechanisms regulating zzso zzso development and highlight the role of distinct zzso in initial and terminal differentiation stages in zzso
