To investigate zzso zzso in highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso upon exposure to zzso radiation and to examine the zzso impact on zzso responses in F1 zzso progeny of zzso zzso zzso male zzso in relation to its zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso gamma radiation was evaluated on two markedly apart zzso zzso zzso and adult zzso zzso growth, zzso behavior and zzso molecular responses were examined zzso F1 progeny of zzso zzso zzso scavenging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cascade zzso zzso zzso its zzso zzso zzso were studied in zzso and zzso plus microbial challenge regimen zzso by zzso zzso zzso 

An inverse correlation of zzso with zzso age of insect was zzso F1 zzso was higher than parent zzso F1 progeny exhibited zzso in development and decreased survival upon zzso Sex ratio in F1 progeny was skewed towards zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso transcripts were zzso upon zzso zzso resulting in enhanced vulnerability of larvae to incidental microbial zzso These transcripts were zzso in F1 progeny of zzso male zzso zzso zzso upon zzso 

zzso impact on zzso molecular responses in F1 progeny is correlated with its zzso zzso These observations will permit defining regimen having pragmatic viability of zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso dose of 100 zzso would ensure balance between induced zzso of males and their field zzso These parameters would facilitate integration of zzso strategy with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
