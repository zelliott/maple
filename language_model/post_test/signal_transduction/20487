The zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso protein is a key zzso of the zzso zzso zzso activated by zzso growth zzso factor zzso zzso zzso promotes recruitment and zzso zzso of zzso which in turn recruits multiple proteins and mediates zzso signaling leading to cell survival, zzso and zzso We previously reported that, without its zzso zzso is a functional zzso target during zzso allowing the generation of a zzso zzso that zzso zzso In this study we established that zzso is also a functional zzso target by zzso a zzso zzso zzso that contains the zzso binding zzso zzso is zzso by zzso before zzso and the resulting zzso zzso is zzso by zzso upon zzso binding and can interact with a subset of zzso partners, zzso and zzso but not with zzso This zzso zzso favors cell survival by maintaining zzso zzso zzso of zzso and by hindering zzso zzso zzso These data demonstrate an zzso role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
