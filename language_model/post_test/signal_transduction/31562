Tomato zzso zzso fruit zzso is characterized by a massive zzso of zzso zzso zzso as zzso change to zzso To address the question of the role of zzso in controlling zzso zzso fruit zzso discs zzso green zzso were cultured in zzso in the presence of various zzso zzso A significant difference in soluble sugar content was achieved depending on external zzso zzso zzso limitation delayed and reduced lycopene and zzso zzso with no significant effect on other zzso zzso degradation and starch zzso were not affected by variations of zzso zzso The reduction of lycopene synthesis observed in zzso conditions was zzso through zzso changes illustrated by reduced zzso zzso zzso In addition, variations of zzso availability modulated zzso gene zzso Taken together our results suggest that the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso availability occurs at the zzso level and involves the differential regulation of genes involved in zzso zzso
