zzso zzso zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso 3 plays a pivotal role in human tumor zzso To discover zzso of zzso zzso signaling pathways as novel zzso drugs, we developed a zzso zzso zzso Using this high zzso zzso plate zzso we identified zzso zzso I) from the National Cancer Institute Diversity zzso zzso suppressed the levels of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells and human cancer cells zzso zzso value of 500 zzso in the human lung zzso zzso and rapidly zzso zzso within 1-2 zzso The suppression of zzso zzso levels resulted in the zzso of zzso DNA binding and zzso but not serum response zzso gene zzso zzso also decreased the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso but not those of zzso zzso was highly selective for zzso and did not inhibit other zzso and tumor survival pathways such as those zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2, or zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso (1 zzso zzso inhibited the growth in nude mice of zzso tumors, zzso zzso zzso tumors, and the human breast zzso zzso all of which express high levels of zzso activated zzso but it did not affect the growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors that are zzso independent or of the human lung zzso zzso which has barely zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso also inhibited tumor growth and significantly increased survival of zzso competent mice bearing zzso melanoma with zzso activated zzso These results give strong support for zzso targeting the zzso signaling zzso for zzso drug zzso
