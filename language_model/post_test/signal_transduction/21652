It was found recently that zzso sensory zzso zzso which possibly serves as a zzso for chromatic adaptation, interacts with a soluble zzso zzso The X-ray structure of the zzso protein revealed an extensive zzso network of zzso acid zzso and water molecules in the zzso half of zzso in high contrast to its zzso zzso Using zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso in the visible and infrared zzso we tried to determine whether this zzso network is used to zzso zzso and whether those zzso transfers are important for interaction with the zzso We found that the retinal Schiff base zzso which occurs in the M intermediate of the zzso of zzso results in zzso of zzso on the zzso side of the zzso The zzso of the Schiff base zzso a zzso change of zzso observed through the zzso of associated zzso We suggest that the zzso shuttling of zzso in the zzso of zzso and the ensuing zzso changes might activate the zzso zzso the M intermediate may be the signaling state of zzso
