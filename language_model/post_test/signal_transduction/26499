zzso growth factor zzso signaling has been implicated to play an important role in regulation of cardiac growth, zzso and zzso function and has been linked to the development of age-related zzso heart zzso Here, we address the question to what extent zzso zzso signaling is essential for maintenance of the structural and functional integrity of the adult zzso zzso To investigate the effects of zzso signaling in the adult heart without zzso effects due to zzso zzso or adaptation during embryonic and early zzso development, we zzso the zzso zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso in adult cardiac zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso as assessed by Western analysis and real-time zzso went along with reduced zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis by zzso zzso and zzso revealed no functional zzso in young adult zzso mice (age 3 zzso However, when induced in aging mice (11 zzso zzso cardiac function was zzso To address the question whether insulin signaling might compensate for the defective zzso zzso we zzso zzso by zzso However, the zzso functional depression was similar in control and zzso zzso Similarly, analysis of the cardiac gene expression profile on zzso zzso did not reveal zzso of overt zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling is required for conservation of cardiac function of the aging heart, but not for the integrity of cardiac structure and function of young zzso
