Plant innate immune response to pathogen infection includes an elegant signaling zzso leading to zzso oxygen species generation and resulting hypersensitive response zzso localized programmed cell death in tissue surrounding the initial infection site limits pathogen zzso A veritable symphony of zzso signaling molecules (including zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been suggested as early components of zzso zzso However, specific interactions among these zzso secondary zzso and their roles in the signal cascade are still zzso Here, we report some aspects of how plants translate perception of a pathogen into a signal cascade leading to an innate immune zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso conducts zzso into cells and provide a model linking this zzso current to downstream NO zzso NO is a critical signaling zzso zzso plant innate immune response to zzso Plants without functional zzso lack this cell membrane zzso current and do not display zzso providing the zzso with NO zzso this zzso The bacterial zzso molecular pattern zzso zzso activates a zzso zzso zzso which may be linked to NO generation due to buildup of zzso zzso
