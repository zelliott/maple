To meet tissue requirements for zzso blood vessels are efficiently distributed throughout the zzso Multiple interactions between the zzso and surrounding zzso are involved in this zzso zzso vascular development is controlled by interactions between zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso In particular, zzso feedback between zzso cells and zzso is crucial for proper vascular zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor expression in zzso plays a key role in retinal vascular zzso Recently, leukemia zzso factor zzso from zzso cells was shown to act zzso with oxygen as a negative feedback zzso This zzso feedback mechanism provides a promising target for novel zzso strategies against zzso zzso diseases and zzso Here, we briefly review what is currently known about the molecular events involved in the cellular interactions between zzso cells, zzso and zzso cells that control retinal vascular zzso
