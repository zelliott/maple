zzso zzso zzso requires a complex dialogue based on the exchange of zzso signals between the zzso zzso zzso express key zzso zzso genes in response to plant signals - zzso - before zzso Host plants sense counterpart zzso zzso molecules - zzso factors - through transient changes in zzso zzso Here we investigate the potential involvement of zzso in the symbiotic zzso zzso activated by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By using zzso zzso zzso we monitored zzso zzso dynamics and the zzso dependence of nod gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso transient increases in the concentration of zzso zzso that were essential for the induction of nod zzso zzso molecules not specifically related to zzso such as zzso were not perceived by zzso through zzso zzso A zzso strain cured of the symbiotic zzso responded to zzso with an unchanged zzso signature, showing that the zzso regulator zzso is not directly involved in this stage of zzso perception and plays its role downstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings demonstrate a key role played by zzso in sensing and zzso zzso zzso signals in zzso and open up a new perspective in the zzso paradigm of nod gene zzso
