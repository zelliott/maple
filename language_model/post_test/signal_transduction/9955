zzso of zzso signaling is a key step in zzso zzso zzso However, it is unclear whether the selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is linked to the zzso cascade and is able to zzso the zzso 

zzso data are reported on the therapeutic effects of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso but the molecular mechanism of action is zzso Here, we further delineated the zzso effects and the potential efficacy of zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso proven zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that six of 12 tumors expressed at least one of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected in seven of 10 zzso cancer cell lines derived from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells demonstrated a direct link between zzso and zzso zzso (10 zzso for 48 zzso drastically reduced zzso expression and redistributed it from the nucleus to the cell zzso It stabilized zzso junctions by increasing zzso binding and reduced the invasive potential of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso (10 zzso for 48 zzso attenuated T cell zzso zzso factor activity, reduced zzso D1 levels and zzso suppressed zzso proliferation by half without affecting zzso 

Our data provide a molecular mechanism for the zzso activity of zzso that may help to develop it as a therapeutic option in a subset of zzso zzso
