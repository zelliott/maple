The zzso and duration of contacts between cells and adhesive surfaces play a key role in several biological zzso such as cell migration, cell zzso and the immune zzso The interaction of receptors on the cell membrane with zzso on the adhesive surface leads to triggering of signaling zzso which allow zzso zzso and large-scale deformation of the cell zzso which allows the cell to spread over the zzso Despite numerous studies of cell zzso the zzso dynamics of the membrane during formation of zzso zzso and initiation of signaling are not well zzso Using interference reflection zzso we study the zzso of cell spreading at the zzso scale, as well as the topography and fluctuations of the membrane at the zzso scale during spreading of zzso zzso on zzso zzso We observed two modes of zzso which were characterized by dramatic differences in membrane dynamics and zzso zzso of signaling clusters was closely related to the movement and zzso of the membrane in contact with the zzso zzso Our results suggest that cell membrane zzso may be a critical constraint on signaling at the zzso zzso
