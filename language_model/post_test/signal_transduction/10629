One striking feature in the assembly of linear zzso zzso DNA viruses is that their zzso is zzso into a zzso protein coat via a motor involving two zzso components with certain characteristics of zzso In bacterial virus zzso these two components include the protein zzso and a packaging zzso zzso The structure and function of other zzso motor components have been well zzso however, studies on the role of zzso have been seriously hampered by its zzso and zzso Such problems caused by zzso also occur in the study of other viral zzso zzso zzso data have been published regarding the role and zzso of zzso which has been reported to bind every motor zzso including zzso DNA, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Such conflicting data from a binding zzso could be due to the zzso of zzso Our recent advance to produce soluble and highly active zzso has enabled further studies on zzso It was demonstrated in this report that zzso bound to DNA zzso zzso bound to the zzso zzso much more strongly than to the zzso zzso The domain of zzso for zzso interaction was the zzso paired zzso zzso The zzso zzso that is essential for DNA packaging was found to be zzso for zzso zzso This result confirms the published model that zzso binds to the zzso with its central domain and extends its zzso zzso domain for zzso zzso It suggests that zzso serves as a linkage between zzso and DNA, and as an essential zzso component during DNA zzso The data also imply that, with the exception of the zzso zzso the main role of the zzso zzso zzso region of zzso is not for zzso binding but for binding to zzso
