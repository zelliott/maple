zzso plant zzso processes are modulated by zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the two pathways involves the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that suppresses zzso signaling and promotes zzso responses in zzso Although zzso is a zzso zzso its site of action and targets are zzso Several studies have suggested that zzso acts in the nucleus, where it zzso nuclear components such as the zzso proteins to regulate signaling zzso Using zzso zzso fused to a zzso signal or to a zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso promotes zzso responses and suppresses zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso failed to complement the spy zzso To examine whether zzso of zzso activity by zzso and spy is zzso by the nuclear zzso zzso zzso responses were studied in double and quadruple zzso zzso lacking the activities of zzso OF zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Unlike spy, the zzso zzso were zzso Moreover, when zzso was applied to a zzso quadruple zzso zzso it was able to suppress various zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso and zzso regulate zzso responses via a zzso zzso
