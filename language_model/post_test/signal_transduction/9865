The maintenance of zzso and their zzso in case of injury are crucial to the survival of all zzso High rates of tissue turnover and nearly unlimited zzso capabilities make zzso zzso an ideal system with which to investigate these important zzso yet little is known about the cell biology and anatomy of their zzso Here we focus on the zzso zzso system, which consists of internal zzso zzso We find that these assemble into complex branching patterns with a stereotyped succession of cell types along their zzso zzso zzso is likely to originate from a precursor structure arising in the zzso which zzso extensive branching zzso In an zzso screen of signaling zzso we identified an zzso zzso zzso as a crucial regulator of branching zzso and zzso Overall, our characterization of the zzso zzso system establishes a new paradigm for zzso zzso and provides a platform for exploring its functional and evolutionary zzso with zzso zzso zzso
