A diverse range of accessory proteins regulates the zzso of most zzso and zzso zzso zzso For zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso two unrelated zzso zzso zzso and zzso density protein 95 zzso bind to zzso and zzso zzso respectively, but are reported to exert similar effects on zzso zzso zzso We have tested the hypothesis that distinct zzso binding sites control zzso receptors via a common zzso zzso Rapid zzso application to excised patches revealed that neither zzso nor zzso affect the onset of zzso The rate of zzso zzso by 10 zzso zzso was similar in control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patches zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and patches containing zzso and zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Likewise, the time course of recovery from zzso zzso was similar in both control and zzso conditions, whereas zzso accelerated recovery almost zzso Peak and zzso zzso zzso relationships to zzso were unchanged by zzso treatment zzso control, zzso zzso 31 zzso 28 zzso vs zzso zzso zzso 45 zzso 9 zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso does not convert zzso channels with high zzso affinity into an open zzso Instead, we demonstrate that the effects of zzso on zzso responses reflect a shift in the relative contribution of different open states of the zzso In contrast, the effect of zzso on recovery zzso suggests that the association between zzso receptors and zzso proteins regulates zzso at zzso zzso Our results show that zzso and zzso regulate zzso receptors via distinct zzso mechanisms targeting selective molecular steps in the zzso zzso
