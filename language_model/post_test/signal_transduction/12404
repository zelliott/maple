The onset of an zzso immune response requires the zzso of T and B zzso by zzso cells, through a specialized form of zzso communication, known as the zzso zzso zzso In B zzso the IS promotes efficient recognition and acquisition of zzso zzso while in T cells, it zzso the T cell response upon exposure to zzso zzso zzso In this review, we highlight the similarities that determine B and T cell zzso focusing on immune zzso downstream signaling events that lead to zzso zzso We stress the notion that polarization of T and B zzso characterized by global changes in zzso and membrane trafficking zzso zzso structure and function, thus determining zzso zzso functions and zzso
