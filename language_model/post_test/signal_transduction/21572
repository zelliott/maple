We have recently reported that pancreatic growth driven by zzso released zzso by feeding the synthetic zzso inhibitor zzso requires the zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we evaluated a number of signal zzso pathways for their zzso as part of the growth response and whether their zzso was dependent on zzso 

Male zzso mice were fed with either zzso or zzso plus 1 zzso of zzso zzso was administered at 3 zzso After various times from 12 hours to 10 days, pancreatic samples were prepared and zzso for activity of various signal zzso zzso zzso 

zzso feeding increased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the translation factor zzso initiation factor zzso and activated the zzso target of zzso zzso that leads to zzso of the zzso protein zzso and of the zzso initiation factor zzso binding protein but with different time zzso Treatment of mice with the zzso inhibitor zzso totally blocked zzso zzso zzso zzso partially blocked the zzso target of zzso pathway, and had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso of zzso initiation factor zzso 

The pancreatic growth response is accompanied by zzso of a number of signaling pathways regulating zzso and translation, some of which are dependent on and some independent of zzso
