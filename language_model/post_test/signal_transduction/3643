Bone zzso zzso zzso a member of transforming growth zzso zzso zzso the terminal differentiation of zzso zzso and changes their differentiation zzso into cells expressing zzso zzso such as alkaline zzso zzso activity and zzso production zzso et zzso 1994, zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso Two type I receptors for zzso zzso and zzso have been zzso but the role of the respective receptors in signal zzso is not zzso In the present study, we examined the signal zzso of zzso in zzso cells using zzso activated zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells expressed zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso at zzso levels in Northern zzso When zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso into zzso cells, both zzso and zzso similarly induced zzso activity in the absence of zzso We also established zzso cell lines of zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso When the zzso zzso cells were cultured in medium with low serum zzso zzso without zzso the cells differentiated into zzso zzso cells and not into zzso heavy zzso zzso These zzso zzso cells expressed zzso activity and zzso zzso in a zzso manner, but neither muscle zzso zzso nor zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso type I receptors can zzso zzso zzso signals in the absence of the zzso in zzso zzso
