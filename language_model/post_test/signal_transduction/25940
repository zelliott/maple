A cycle of zzso of zzso mediates zzso trafficking between the zzso apparatus and the plasma zzso but nothing is known about how this cycle is zzso We show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso in a zzso fashion and promotes zzso A variety of zzso of the zzso activity of zzso including zzso zzso and zzso increase zzso zzso zzso zzso retrograde trafficking of zzso from the plasma membrane to the zzso in a zzso zzso fashion, zzso early zzso loading of Ras in response to growth factors, and promotes zzso zzso outgrowth from zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso regulates zzso trafficking by promoting zzso through zzso zzso of a zzso bond in proximity to the zzso zzso
