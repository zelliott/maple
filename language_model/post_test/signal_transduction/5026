Although significant research has detailed zzso during development and cancer, little is known about cardiac zzso yet it is critical for survival following pathological zzso The zzso factor zzso is a target of zzso therapies because of its zzso and zzso zzso In the current study, we investigate its role in cardiac zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso using zzso cardiac zzso cells and zzso demonstrate that zzso is essential to vessel formation, and zzso vessel formation is dependent on zzso expression in zzso Gene analyses revealed that zzso gene expression is unique in cardiac zzso and varies in a zzso zzso In zzso zzso cultures demonstrated zzso role in the expression of zzso zzso factors, while also providing evidence for zzso zzso zzso Additional in zzso vascular analyses support zzso critical role in zzso formation and vessel patterning during development and also in response to a pathological stimulus where its expression in zzso is required for zzso zzso 

These data demonstrate that proper zzso expression in cardiac zzso and zzso is essential to cardiac zzso These results have the potential for novel therapeutic applications involving the zzso response during cardiac zzso
