Patients with advanced zzso have survival rates zzso The zzso zzso plays an important role during lung development and physiology but is often zzso in lung cancer, making it a potential therapeutic zzso We investigated zzso signaling in zzso and hypothesized that high zzso activity contributes to radiation zzso 

zzso signaling in zzso patient samples was investigated using quantitative zzso zzso zzso cells with either high or blocked zzso activity were generated and their radiation sensitivity monitored using zzso zzso In zzso zzso tumors were zzso and response assessed using growth zzso zzso parameters were analyzed by zzso 

Patients with high zzso activity in tumors showed significantly worse zzso zzso In zzso zzso activity did not affect the proliferation or intrinsic zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso with blocked zzso activity grew slower than wild type zzso zzso with high zzso activity grew significantly faster, were more hypoxic and showed a zzso zzso 

We demonstrate an important role for zzso in tumor growth and correlate high zzso activity with poor prognosis and zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso might be a promising intervention to improve outcome after zzso
