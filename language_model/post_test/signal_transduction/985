Aging of T cells is characterized by a series of zzso in surface zzso expression and a zzso decline in functional activity in many zzso We have extended this analysis by comparing the ability of T cells from mice of different ages to cause zzso disease zzso by using a parent into zzso model zzso T cells into zzso zzso zzso host zzso Young zzso zzso adult zzso zzso or old zzso zzso T cells were introduced into zzso zzso zzso Animals that had undergone transplantation were assessed for clinical and zzso evidence of zzso and for zzso At a given zzso dose (2 zzso zzso zzso there was a zzso zzso zzso decline in severity of zzso with all recipients of young T cells zzso to lethal zzso zzso of recipients of adult T cells zzso and no deaths occurring among recipients of old T zzso In zzso zzso zzso expansion was greater for young than old zzso groups after zzso whereas old zzso cells showed enhanced in zzso expansion compared with young zzso Among zzso and zzso cells, the zzso zzso repertoire, surface zzso expression on activated cells, and zzso zzso function were similar for all ages after expansion in zzso The progeny of old T cells zzso after transplantation expressed type 1 zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso at a lower frequency than young cells and had decreased zzso function against zzso target zzso This provides a partial explanation for the decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso labeling of transplanted cells showed comparable rates of proliferation when comparing zzso (12 zzso and zzso (19 zzso T cells in both zzso and zzso host zzso We suggest that the lack of zzso activity demonstrated by old T cells in zzso is a reflection of a zzso zzso downstream of signals required for zzso zzso
