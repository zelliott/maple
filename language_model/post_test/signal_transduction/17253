We have previously reported that zzso zzso infection of zzso zzso cells zzso requires an zzso danger signal such as zzso to activate an zzso and zzso thereby inducing zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso also stimulates production of zzso oxygen species zzso in zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso is generated in response to zzso and the role that different zzso receptors may play in zzso zzso is still zzso In this study, we revealed that the zzso zzso zzso is assembled with the zzso zzso and its associated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production through a complex consisting of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso production can activate the zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, separate depletion or zzso of zzso zzso or zzso complex blocks zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso following zzso zzso However, zzso via zzso alone zzso zzso generation but not zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is generated through stimulation of a zzso complex, and reveal an unexpected role for zzso which acts as a positive regulator of zzso zzso during microbial zzso
