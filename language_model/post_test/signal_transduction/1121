Signal recognition by zzso zzso zzso receptors is typically coupled by zzso zzso to downstream zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Some responses perceived by zzso receptors in zzso cells and possibly in human cells can initiate downstream action independently of zzso zzso Plants use zzso zzso signaling in the regulation of growth and development, particularly in hormonal control of seed zzso but it is not yet clear which of these responses zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso has a predicted zzso domain and other features characteristic of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate that zzso plays a positive role in zzso zzso and zzso zzso regulated seed zzso The zzso zzso of zzso are less sensitive to zzso and zzso in seed zzso This zzso is similar to that previously observed for transcript zzso zzso in the zzso zzso However, the reduced sensitivities toward zzso and zzso in the single zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are additive or synergistic in the double and triple zzso Thus, zzso unlike a typical zzso zzso apparently acts independently of the zzso zzso in at least some aspects of seed zzso suggesting that this alternative mode of zzso zzso action also functions in the plant zzso
