To investigate the molecular mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso zzso prevents left zzso zzso zzso we examined the expression of zzso zzso and zzso gene in the zzso zzso of zzso rats with abdominal zzso zzso zzso model was established by creating abdominal zzso zzso Four weeks later, animals were randomly divided into 4 groups with 8 animals in zzso One group was used as model control, the other three groups were treated with zzso zzso (20 zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso and zzso (10 zzso zzso Another 8 zzso rats were subjected to sham surgery and served as blank zzso After zzso treatment, the zzso artery pressure of the animals was zzso The zzso of left zzso were taken for the measurement of the left zzso mass index zzso and pathological zzso and zzso were used for determining the zzso fiber dimension zzso The zzso expression of zzso protein expression of zzso and activity of zzso 4, 7 were detected by zzso and Western zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso the blood pressure of rats treated with zzso zzso either at high or low dose, was significantly higher than those in the control and zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso rats were higher than those in the control group zzso but significantly lower than those in the model control zzso zzso the high doses of zzso zzso and zzso significantly zzso the zzso expression of zzso and protein expression of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso animals was more significantly lower than that in rats treated with zzso zzso zzso the two doses of zzso zzso and zzso significantly zzso the protein expression of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the animals treated with high-dose zzso zzso was significantly higher than that in rats treated with zzso It is concluded that zzso of zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso independent of blood zzso The underlying mechanism might be the zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso increased production of zzso and blocking effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso signal zzso in local zzso
