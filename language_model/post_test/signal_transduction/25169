zzso transfer of proteins or zzso acids across cellular zzso is a major problem in cell zzso Recently the existence of a zzso sequence was predicted in the junction area of the zzso and zzso of the zzso virus surface zzso We have identified cell zzso as a novel property of the zzso Cell zzso of zzso is not restricted to zzso zzso zzso in an zzso manner into cells and is evenly distributed over the zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso is zzso by an zzso zzso between zzso acids 41 and 52 of zzso zzso of this zzso motif zzso zzso cell zzso zzso per zzso can act as a shuttle for peptides and functional proteins (such as zzso This permits the highly specific zzso of zzso signal zzso by transfer of peptides competing zzso interactions as demonstrated by specific zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso functionality was demonstrated by zzso protein transfer into primary bone zzso cells and into the zzso The zzso motif is zzso between the different zzso virus zzso and the surface proteins of avian and zzso zzso exhibit similar zzso zzso zzso In respect to zzso zzso the zzso could represent the zzso fusion zzso and play a crucial role in the zzso of the viral zzso
