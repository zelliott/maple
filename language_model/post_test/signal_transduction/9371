zzso zzso zzso zzso in tomato plants provide a useful model system to zzso the signal zzso pathways that regulate systemic defense zzso Among the proposed zzso signals for zzso zzso expression are the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso An increasing body of evidence indicates that zzso and zzso work in the same signaling zzso to activate the expression of zzso and other zzso zzso However, relatively less is known about how these signals interact to promote zzso communication over long zzso zzso analysis of the zzso signaling zzso in tomato plants provides a unique opportunity to study, in a single experimental system, the mechanism by which zzso and zzso signals interact to coordinate systemic expression of zzso zzso Previously, it has been proposed that zzso is the long-distance mobile signal for defense gene zzso Recently, zzso experiments with tomato zzso defective in zzso zzso and signaling provide new evidence that zzso rather than zzso functions as the systemic wound zzso and that the zzso of zzso is regulated by the zzso zzso Further understanding of the zzso signaling zzso promises to provide new insights into the basic mechanisms governing plant defense to zzso zzso
