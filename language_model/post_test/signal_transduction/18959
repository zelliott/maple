This study aimed at increasing the zzso productivity of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso production zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were screened and selected after zzso zzso zzso zzso of the parent strain zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with the parent strain, zzso zzso zzso and b in electron transfer chain zzso of zzso and zzso b in zzso were zzso As a consequence, the activities of key zzso zzso of the zzso zzso including zzso zzso complex I, complex I + III, complex II + III, and complex IV, decreased by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso With the zzso of zzso in zzso a large amount of excessive zzso zzso was zzso which hampered the further increase of the zzso zzso An zzso electron zzso zzso was added to the strain zzso culture to zzso the excessive zzso Compared with the parent strain, the concentration of zzso and the zzso consumption rate of strain zzso were increased by zzso and zzso respectively, upon addition of zzso zzso of zzso The strategy for increasing the zzso flux in zzso zzso by zzso the zzso zzso zzso may provide an alternative approach to enhance the zzso flux in zzso
