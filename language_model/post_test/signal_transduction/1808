zzso that regulate water channels in the plant plasma membrane zzso were investigated in zzso suspension zzso Cell zzso zzso was measured with a cell pressure probe and was reduced zzso as compared to control values when calcium was added in the zzso and in bathing zzso To assess the significance of these effects in zzso PM zzso were isolated by zzso zzso zzso and their water transport properties were characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated in standard conditions exhibited reduced water zzso zzso together with a lack of active water zzso In contrast, when prepared in the presence of zzso of zzso zzso PM zzso showed a zzso higher zzso and active water zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso PM zzso with zzso zzso reduced their zzso ) and water channel activity down to the zzso level of zzso isolated in standard zzso zzso was the most efficient with a zzso of zzso at zzso zzso free zzso Water transport in zzso PM zzso was also zzso blocked by zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso pH zzso Thus, both zzso and zzso contribute to a zzso switch from active to inactive water channels that may allow zzso of water transport to cell zzso and zzso
