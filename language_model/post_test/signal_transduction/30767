Endurance training may decrease the risk of coronary artery zzso It has been speculated that these effects may be due to an zzso stimulation of zzso The underlying mechanisms are not yet zzso zzso using zzso we investigated the plasma level of vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a group of untrained men aged zzso years with zzso 

All men were zzso into a zzso group zzso 3 zzso 60 zzso each, zzso zzso zzso a zzso group ( training 3 zzso 90 zzso each, zzso zzso 7) and a sedentary control group ( zzso zzso zzso Both training groups worked at moderate intensity zzso zzso zzso The intervention had a duration of 6 zzso Before and after this period, blood samples were taken from the participants at rest and they underwent a medical zzso 

Body mass index zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure, and plasma levels of zzso and zzso were comparable in all three zzso Endurance training significantly reduced zzso in both exercise groups zzso zzso before v after zzso zzso v zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso v zzso zzso zzso for the running and cycling groups zzso but not in the control group zzso zzso v zzso zzso zzso Endurance training did not influence zzso plasma level zzso v after zzso zzso v zzso zzso zzso for the running zzso zzso zzso v zzso zzso zzso for the cycling zzso and zzso zzso v zzso zzso zzso for the control zzso Plasma level of zzso was significantly reduced in both exercise groups zzso zzso before v zzso zzso zzso v zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso v zzso zzso zzso for the running and cycling groups zzso but not in controls zzso zzso v zzso zzso zzso 

Endurance training may reduce the zzso mechanisms in men aged zzso years by reducing zzso plasma level and this may subsequently decrease the risk of cardiovascular zzso
