zzso zzso shows its zzso effect through binding to specific cell surface zzso A DNA synthesis zzso zzso zzso has been successfully combined with zzso to improve the efficiency of zzso therapy for chronic zzso leukemia zzso To understand the mechanism of this combination effect, expression of zzso receptors on the zzso cell line, zzso was studied before and after treatment with zzso 

zzso were treated with zzso at a dose of 0, zzso zzso or zzso zzso for 48 zzso zzso zzso were performed using zzso zzso at 4 degrees zzso Cell cycle analysis was carried out using flow zzso following zzso cellular DNA with zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis was performed to evaluate the zzso of zzso regulatory zzso zzso gene expression by zzso 

zzso cells showed a zzso and zzso increase in binding of zzso zzso zzso zzso The increase of binding was caused by an increase in the number of binding sites with a constant zzso zzso Similar results were obtained in the zzso zzso cell line, zzso Cell cycle analyses suggested that zzso of the zzso zzso may have occurred as a result of the zzso in the cell cycle zzso Furthermore, zzso induction of the zzso gene zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells was zzso higher than that in zzso zzso 

Thus, zzso may have an ability to enhance the response to zzso probably because of its ability to zzso the zzso zzso suggesting that this may be involved in the mechanism of effective combination therapy of zzso with zzso
