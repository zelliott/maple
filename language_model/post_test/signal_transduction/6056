zzso zzso and zzso such as zzso proteins zzso play a pivotal role in the adequate folding and the stability of steroid hormone zzso As shown by zzso zzso and zzso analysis, the zzso inhibitor zzso induced a rapid zzso zzso depletion of zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso breast zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or of protein synthesis zzso which both suppressed zzso zzso of zzso failed to modify zzso degradation caused by zzso On the other hand, partial zzso such as zzso (a zzso and zzso zzso (a zzso stabilized zzso making it immune to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso did not interfere with zzso zzso induced by zzso Thus, the current study points to possible variation in the zzso of zzso zzso Besides, the protective effect of partial zzso suggests that zzso stability is only zzso by zzso disruption when the zzso is in its native, zzso zzso
