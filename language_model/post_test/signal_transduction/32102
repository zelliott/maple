We have previously demonstrated that zzso zzso is a potent zzso cassette (ABC) B1 inhibitor and explored the cellular zzso mechanisms for its synergistic effect on the zzso of zzso The present studies were conducted to zzso the key factors that influenced zzso zzso which could further alter zzso cellular zzso Meanwhile, the influence of zzso on the above factors was revealed for explaining its synergistic effect from the view of zzso zzso The results indicated that zzso inhibited zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that zzso markedly inhibited zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso factor zzso pathway, zzso zzso to the nucleus, and zzso binding zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso the zzso ability of zzso to bind to the human zzso resistance zzso promoter, and zzso zzso and zzso small interfering zzso reversed the zzso expression of zzso Moreover, the cellular zzso of zzso was also significantly altered by zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso expression and subsequently alters the cellular zzso of zzso It was speculated that zzso acted on this zzso to lower zzso zzso expression in zzso cells, which provided zzso support to the development of zzso as a zzso reversal zzso
