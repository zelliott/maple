zzso basic zzso zzso zzso factors are crucial in regulating the differentiation and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso how these zzso factors direct such processes is largely unknown due to the lack of bona fide targets in zzso zzso evidence suggests that zzso factors have shared targets in their common differentiation role, but unique targets with respect to their distinct roles in zzso zzso zzso However, whether zzso zzso targets exist remains an zzso zzso To address this question, we focused on zzso zzso a zzso zzso factor that specifies distinct zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso including the zzso zzso zzso 1) population of the developing spinal zzso We identified transcripts unique to the zzso lineage using zzso analyses of specific zzso populations from zzso zzso zzso experiments followed by zzso reporter analyses identified five direct zzso zzso targets of zzso in zzso along with their zzso zzso These targets, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have diverse functions that range from zzso factors to regulators of zzso and signaling zzso Only zzso and zzso are expressed across several different zzso zzso zzso including external zzso cells zzso zzso cell zzso in the developing zzso hair cells of the inner ear, and Merkel zzso Our work establishes on a molecular level that zzso differentiation zzso zzso factors have distinct zzso zzso
