In contrast to a wealth of knowledge about the zzso of zzso metabolism in zzso that in zzso remains largely zzso In this study, we found that a blue light signal triggers reduction of active zzso content in rice zzso with simultaneous repression of two zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso and acute induction of four zzso zzso genes zzso For further examination of the regulation of these zzso we established a series of zzso lines through reverse genetic screening from a zzso zzso population and construction of zzso lines based on an zzso interference zzso By using these lines and zzso zzso we zzso that zzso 1 zzso consisting of two species in rice plants zzso and zzso is indispensable for robust induction of the zzso zzso On the other hand, repression of the zzso genes is zzso by zzso In addition, we found that the zzso also mediate the repression of a zzso zzso gene zzso in the zzso These results imply that, in rice zzso zzso mediate the repression of zzso zzso capacity, while zzso mediates the induction of zzso zzso zzso The zzso action was demonstrated to be dominant in the reduction of active zzso content, but, in rice zzso the cumulative effects of these independent actions reduced active zzso content in the zzso This zzso design in which different types of zzso independently but zzso regulate active zzso content is unique from the viewpoint of zzso zzso This zzso should provide zzso to the response in rice zzso
