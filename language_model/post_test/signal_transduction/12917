zzso bacteria that are zzso for animals or plants zzso a zzso Type III zzso system to inject zzso proteins into their zzso target zzso The basis for selection of the proteins to be zzso via type III systems is still zzso No clearly defined consensus zzso acid sequence that could serve as a specific zzso signal has been identified, and the hypothesis that an zzso secondary structure acts as the signal has several zzso We have zzso a zzso signal that is sufficient to ensure the zzso of the zzso zzso a zzso and an indispensable zzso component of the type III zzso machinery of zzso zzso zzso tomato zzso to the first 15 zzso zzso of zzso starts at a single site 42 zzso upstream of the first zzso Gene swapping experiments revealed that altering the continuity of the zzso zzso leader with the region including the zzso signal radically decreased zzso of the zzso zzso These results indicate that an zzso secondary structure, possibly formed in this region, is important for efficient expression of the zzso The proposed secondary structure is not, however, indispensable for the zzso of zzso and it does not couple zzso and zzso
