To study mechanisms of T zzso rejection of B cell zzso we developed a zzso zzso model wherein three potential rejection zzso human zzso chicken zzso zzso and zzso are zzso After transfer into zzso mice zzso of zzso growing zzso expressing all three zzso were zzso zzso expressing only human zzso protein were not zzso zzso expressing zzso were infiltrated by T cells, showed zzso class I and II zzso and lost zzso zzso indicating immune zzso In contrast to zzso recipients, zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso recipients died of lymphoma, indicating that host zzso signaling is critical for zzso zzso arising in zzso and zzso mice had invariably lost zzso zzso suggesting that poor overall survival of these recipients was due to inefficient elimination of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells in zzso animals was dependent on zzso of zzso by cells of the tumor zzso These findings provide first evidence for an important role of the tumor zzso in T zzso control of zzso zzso and highlight the importance of incorporating zzso strategies into future zzso zzso
