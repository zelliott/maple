zzso zinc signaling is important in the control of a number of cellular zzso zzso factors that regulate cellular zinc influx and initiate zinc signals are poorly zzso The present study investigates the possibility for cross talk between the zzso and zinc signaling pathways in cultured rainbow trout zzso zzso zzso The rainbow trout zzso A zzso gene possesses a putative zzso response element and multiple metal response elements zzso base pairs upstream of the start zzso whereas zzso B zzso and zinc zzso zzso have multiple metal response elements but no zzso response elements in this zzso zzso increased zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso and this stimulation was enhanced if cells were treated with cortisol together with zzso zzso treated with zinc showed increased zinc zzso zzso zinc influx zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zinc zzso These responses were also significantly enhanced in cells zzso with cortisol and zzso The zzso effects were blocked by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating mediation via a zzso In reporter gene zzso zinc zzso zzso promoter activity, whereas cortisol did zzso Furthermore, cortisol significantly reduced zzso zzso promoter activity in cells expressing zzso rainbow trout zzso These results demonstrate that cortisol enhances cellular zinc zzso which in turn stimulates expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
