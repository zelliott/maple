The development of zzso zzso hinges on the timely exposure to the appropriate combination of zzso zzso stimulating hormone zzso and zzso hormone zzso are both produced in the zzso zzso and are transported via the blood circulation to the zzso layer surrounding the zzso From there both hormones are transported into the zzso by zzso zzso are expressed mainly in the zzso while zzso are expressed in a zzso with highest expression in the zzso How this spatial organization is achieved is not zzso Equally it is not understood whether zzso and zzso trigger distinct zzso programs or whether the distinct spatial zzso of their zzso coupled receptors is sufficient to convey their distinct biological zzso 

We have developed a zzso zzso model of the zzso zzso processes within the zzso and zzso predict that zzso and zzso form a zzso inside the zzso zzso show that the spatial distribution of zzso and zzso can arise from the well known regulatory zzso and zzso find that the differential activity of zzso and zzso may well result from the distinct spatial zzso of their zzso even when both receptors respond with the same zzso zzso cascade to their zzso 

The model zzso the large amount of published data into a consistent framework that can now be used to better understand how observed defects translate into failed zzso zzso
