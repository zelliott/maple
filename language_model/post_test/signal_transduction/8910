zzso are membrane proteins controlling cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso Their zzso zzso bear versatile zzso zzso chains that provide structural zzso for zzso to function as zzso or zzso for molecules like growth factors and constituents of the zzso zzso also signal via their protein zzso and their zzso zzso and zzso zzso The direct interactions and signaling zzso they support are becoming better zzso These interactions are regulated by zzso induced zzso and shedding of the zzso zzso zzso zzso evidence is emerging that zzso concentrate in unconventional zzso zzso and might govern novel zzso trafficking zzso Here we focus on recent findings that refine our understanding of the complex zzso relationships of these cellular zzso
