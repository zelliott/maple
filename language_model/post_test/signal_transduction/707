zzso of zzso gene zzso by zzso receptors zzso and zzso plays an important role in breast cancer development and zzso High expression of the zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso factor 1 zzso has also been correlated with aggressive breast tumor zzso Here, we describe a positive regulatory loop between the zzso signaling zzso and zzso zzso competence in human breast cancer zzso Treatment of breast zzso zzso cells with zzso increased zzso zzso activity and expression of zzso target zzso including zzso zzso These effects were blocked by the zzso zzso and by zzso zzso and, conversely, zzso gene expression and growth of zzso cells were impaired on zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were activated by zzso in the presence of zzso and by zzso of a zzso active zzso indicating that zzso signals to both zzso In particular, zzso was able to translate the effects of zzso on its own zzso as well as enhance zzso protein 1 zzso containing genes zzso D1 and zzso in the presence of zzso This correlated with an increased zzso occupancy of responsive promoters at both zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein zzso site in zzso was highly zzso by zzso revealing an essential role of the zzso domain in response to zzso zzso These results identify a complete zzso loop between the zzso and zzso signaling pathways that dictates zzso gene expression and growth of breast cancer zzso
