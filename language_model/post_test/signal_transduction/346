Beyond its role as an electron zzso in zzso zzso oxygen is also a key zzso of many zzso zzso The zzso machinery and the very fabric of cell identity and function have been shown to be deeply zzso Here we take a first look at how oxygen might lie at the crossroads of at least two of the major molecular pathways that shape pancreatic zzso Based on recent evidence and a thorough review of the literature, we present a theoretical model zzso evolving oxygen tensions might choreograph to a large extent the sequence of molecular events resulting in the development of the zzso In particular, we propose that lower zzso prior to the expansion of the zzso may zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and repression of zzso zzso limiting zzso cell zzso With the development of zzso and improved oxygen delivery to the developing organ, zzso support for zzso zzso may decline while the zzso zzso zzso is zzso which would support zzso cell differentiation and perhaps zzso cell zzso
