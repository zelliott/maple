A reduction of blood flow in the spiral zzso artery zzso which supplies the zzso is implicated in hearing loss and zzso zzso are known to be the most potent zzso zzso The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the zzso responds to zzso which zzso type is present and which signal zzso zzso is zzso The zzso was isolated from the zzso zzso by zzso and zzso in a bath chamber on the stage of an zzso zzso The vascular diameter was measured by video zzso and the zzso zzso concentration was monitored simultaneously by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso caused a zzso zzso with zzso being the more potent zzso The zzso zzso zzso had no significant zzso The preferential zzso zzso zzso zzso had a higher affinity zzso the zzso zzso than the preferential zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was prevented by zzso of zzso C with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso stores with zzso zzso and depletion of zzso stores by zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso increase and reduced the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso causes a zzso of the zzso which is zzso via zzso zzso The data suggest that the signal zzso zzso of the zzso zzso involves zzso C, zzso receptors and release of zzso from zzso zzso zzso
