zzso heavy chain zzso class switch zzso and regulation of zzso expression levels are processes suggested to be controlled by the zzso 3' zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso or zzso zzso stimulation of primary B cells results in zzso of this zzso zzso zzso induction of a zzso B cell line expressing a zzso zzso zzso single chain zzso results in a zzso zzso response of a 3' zzso zzso minimal promoter zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso experiments reveal that zzso or zzso induction recruits zzso zzso factors of activated B zzso to the zzso zzso While zzso zzso recruits zzso zzso and zzso zzso only zzso and zzso were observed following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however, zzso a zzso zzso partner for zzso which may account for the zzso activity observed by zzso in zzso zzso We propose a model zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the process of 3' zzso zzso in B zzso Our data provide a putative molecular explanation as to why zzso mice, and possibly patients with zzso syndrome, are unable to undergo T zzso class switch zzso but respond properly upon zzso switch zzso
