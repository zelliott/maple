Stem cells have been shown to have the potential to provide a source of cells for applications to tissue engineering and organ zzso The mechanisms that regulate stem cell fate, however, mostly remain zzso zzso stem cells zzso are zzso zzso cells that are isolated from bone zzso and other adult zzso and can be differentiated into multiple cell zzso such as bone, cartilage, fat, muscles and zzso Although previous studies have focused zzso on the effects of chemical signals that regulate zzso commitment, the effects of zzso cues of the zzso on zzso fate determination have long been zzso However, several studies provided evidence that mechanical signals, both direct and zzso played important roles in regulating a stem cell zzso In this review, we zzso a number of recent studies on how cell zzso and mechanical cues influence the differentiation of zzso into specific zzso zzso how chemical and mechanical cues in the zzso orchestrate stem cell differentiation may provide new insights into ways to improve our techniques in cell therapy and organ zzso
