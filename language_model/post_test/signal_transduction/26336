zzso and zzso are known to zzso zzso healing, zzso and tear zzso While a zzso cross talk has been recently shown to zzso zzso healing in rats, it is not known whether it also plays a role in the regulation of zzso zzso In this study we aim to investigate the effects of zzso eye drop treatment on zzso zzso function and on the local expression of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso function was measured in 3 months old rats by modified zzso test at baseline and after 3 weeks of topical zzso eye drop zzso Whole zzso zzso from rats were removed after treatment and zzso by zzso for zzso and zzso zzso To investigate if the effects of zzso were zzso by changes in the zzso we repeated the experiments in zzso rats, a strain with zzso impairment associated with decreased tear zzso After topical treatment with zzso eye zzso an increase in tear zzso was observed in both zzso and zzso zzso A significant decrease of zzso levels was also observed in zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso rats, accompanied by a significant increase in zzso zzso zzso of zzso at the zzso surface in rats results in changes of tear function and zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso Further studies on the zzso zzso at the zzso surface may expand our knowledge on the zzso of several diseases characterized by tear zzso
