zzso signaling mediates embryonic vascular development and normal vascular zzso zzso knockout mice develop zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is zzso but has been associated with vascular injury in the liver zzso in clinical zzso We investigated the role of zzso signaling in liver zzso zzso cells zzso 

We studied zzso zzso mice zzso knockout mice without zzso disruption of zzso mice with zzso knockout were created by crossing zzso with zzso zzso zzso vein pressure was zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was assessed by zzso and scanning electron zzso zzso We performed functional and expression analyses of isolated liver zzso 

zzso knockout of zzso led to zzso in the absence of fibrosis, with a persistent increase in proliferation of zzso zzso deletion led to zzso vascular zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that vascular changes preceded zzso zzso zzso zzso mice had reduced zzso zzso and developed portal hypertension and zzso zzso over zzso In contrast, mice with zzso disruption of zzso had a normal zzso 

zzso signaling is required for vascular zzso of zzso zzso it maintains zzso and differentiation of zzso in adult zzso zzso of zzso signaling in zzso leads to spontaneous formation of zzso indicating its role as a tumor zzso in the liver zzso
