zzso factor zzso is an important zzso of cell loss following diverse zzso challenges, but the manner in which zzso zzso death is not zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso pathways are zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso can be zzso through zzso zzso mechanisms and can initiate zzso zzso when zzso zzso are elevated by approximately 15 zzso for 60 zzso zzso zzso zzso to less than 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso By pharmacological zzso of zzso zzso I and II zzso activity and zzso of zzso I zzso zzso by zzso zzso we show that the zzso zzso death zzso is regulated by zzso I and, to a lesser extent, by zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso actions of zzso I are zzso zzso I zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso under normal zzso conditions, but expression is not sufficient to reduce an acute rise in zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso expression is induced when cells are deprived of serum or exposed to zzso zzso zzso limiting the duration of pathological zzso zzso zzso To block zzso zzso death pathway, we screened a panel of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso accelerated zzso zzso and inhibited zzso zzso 3 zzso Both zzso act indirectly to promote zzso I zzso zzso activity by reducing zzso I zzso zzso These findings identify zzso I zzso as a potent zzso protein and describe a new means of zzso targeting zzso I to inhibit zzso cell zzso
