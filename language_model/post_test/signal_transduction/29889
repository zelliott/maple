In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso is a zzso in the zzso using two experimental zzso 1) hydrogen zzso zzso retinal zzso zzso in zzso and 2) zzso zzso zzso in zzso We demonstrated that both zzso and zzso zzso significantly protected against zzso retinal zzso zzso however, zzso had no zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso zzso zzso activity, when zzso zzso and zzso were used as zzso zzso levels were also zzso increased by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso tamoxifen did not reverse the protective effect of zzso whereas the zzso inhibitor zzso inhibited the protective effect of zzso suggesting that zzso mediates its effect through some zzso pathway, independent of the zzso zzso zzso experiments with zzso zzso fused to the zzso zzso 2 domain of zzso the regulatory zzso of zzso indicated that zzso and zzso but not zzso identified zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso as a binding zzso zzso with insulin zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso zzso administration of zzso significantly protected the structure and function of rat zzso against zzso zzso cell zzso and inhibited zzso zzso In addition, systemic administration of zzso activated retinal zzso but not the zzso growth factor zzso and produced a transient increase in zzso activity and zzso of zzso in rat zzso The results show that zzso has retinal zzso properties in zzso and in zzso and suggest that the insulin zzso signaling zzso is involved in zzso retinal zzso
