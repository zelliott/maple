zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is controlled by a host of small, zzso signaling zzso including zzso To test the hypothesis that the plant hormone zzso controls zzso development, we assessed zzso formation in two zzso of tomato zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso with zzso polar zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso roots were zzso with spores of the AM fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions were observed in root organ culture zzso and internal zzso colonization was zzso both in zzso and in intact zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso root branching in zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso roots zzso production of zzso fans indicative of zzso formation and were zzso more rapidly than zzso zzso By contrast, approaching zzso reversed direction to grow away from cultured zzso roots and failed to colonize zzso In intact zzso zzso and zzso roots were zzso poorly, but development of zzso zzso and zzso was zzso normal within roots of both zzso zzso We conclude that zzso signaling within host roots is required for the early stages of AM formation, including during zzso signal zzso
