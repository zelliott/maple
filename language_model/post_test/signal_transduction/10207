Various zzso produced during the immune reaction can zzso the neuroendocrine zzso zzso probably by inducing changes in the activity of zzso zzso zzso However, the precise cellular and molecular effects of zzso on these zzso have not been reported zzso To gain a better insight into these regulations, we first examined the pattern of expression of zzso receptors in a novel zzso cell line expressing zzso zzso zzso Among others, zzso is expressed in zzso cells, together with the zzso zzso zzso specific for zzso as well as zzso M zzso zzso with the latter zzso we show that zzso stimulates the expression of the immediate early genes zzso and early growth zzso in zzso cells, an effect dependent upon the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso studies performed in parallel in zzso cells and in primary zzso zzso cell cultures show that zzso although devoid of any effect of its own on zzso gene zzso can inhibit zzso the stimulation of zzso expression by zzso zzso In conclusion, these data demonstrate that a zzso zzso cell line can be modulated in zzso by zzso implicated in the regulation of the zzso zzso Moreover, they provide the first evidence of an involvement of zzso in these zzso
