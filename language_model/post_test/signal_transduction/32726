zzso detection of multiply labeled compounds in biological samples is often used to follow zzso zzso zzso of zzso bound to zzso atoms offers a more sensitive approach than direct zzso zzso but generally results in the loss of zzso zzso zzso We have modified an zzso sequence to zzso the carbon chemical shifts in order to obtain a zzso zzso zzso J spectrum, which allows us to measure zzso and doubly labeled compounds in the same zzso
