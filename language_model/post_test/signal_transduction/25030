Light signaling via the zzso A zzso zzso controls basic plant zzso processes including zzso and zzso zzso We have identified a new zzso zzso pat zzso A signal zzso which shows strongly reduced responses in continuous zzso zzso zzso and molecular data indicate that this zzso is disrupted at an early step of zzso signal zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso protein of zzso zzso acids with sequence zzso to the zzso zzso regulatory protein zzso In the zzso zzso a zzso zzso introduces a premature stop zzso which likely results in the production of a truncated zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of this zzso can be zzso by zzso of an appropriately truncated zzso gene in the wild zzso The results indicate that the truncated zzso protein acts in a zzso fashion to inhibit zzso zzso
