The involvement of the zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso in the molecular mechanisms of zzso drugs like zzso has been previously shown by our zzso Additionally, it is known that the zzso of zzso by zzso channel opening should be the final target for several zzso drugs including zzso oxide donors and zzso zzso zzso zzso In our previous study, we demonstrated that zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso peripheral zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the current study, we assessed whether zzso is capable to activate zzso channels zzso zzso zzso zzso 40 and 50 zzso zzso reversed the zzso induced in the rat paw by local injection of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso (2 zzso measured by the paw pressure zzso Using the selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 200 zzso it was confirmed that zzso zzso zzso acts specifically on the zzso receptors present at peripheral zzso Prior treatment with the zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso 80 and 160 zzso and zzso zzso 80 and 160 zzso did not zzso the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso The same results were obtained when we used zzso zzso (2 zzso as the zzso zzso The supposed participation of other types of zzso channels was tested using the zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso 25 and 50 zzso and zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso and different types of the zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso 50 and 100 zzso and zzso zzso 25 and 50 zzso None of the zzso channel zzso reversed the zzso effect of zzso On the basis of these results, we suggest that zzso channels are not involved in the peripheral zzso effect of zzso although this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
