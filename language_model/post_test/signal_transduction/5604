Human zzso including zzso and zzso are zzso immune cells that capture and engulf pathogens and subsequently destroy them in zzso zzso To accomplish this vital task, these zzso zzso two basic cell zzso for chasing down infectious pathogens and zzso for destroying zzso The molecular mechanisms controlling these behaviors are not well understood for immune zzso Interestingly, a soil zzso zzso zzso uses these same behaviors to pursue and zzso its bacterial food source and to organize its zzso zzso zzso studies of this model system have provided and will continue to provide us with zzso insights into the zzso and zzso of immune zzso Here, we review recent research in these areas that have been conducted in the zzso Signal Section of zzso Laboratory of zzso
