Experimental work in various prostate cancer models revealed that the zzso zzso is frequently zzso and implicated in tumor zzso However, little attention has been paid to the zzso zzso zzso in the development of therapy resistance in patients who receive chronic treatment with a zzso zzso 

We have generated a novel zzso zzso after prolonged treatment with zzso and zzso in zzso zzso of zzso cells in the absence or presence of zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso was assessed by cell zzso zzso zzso expression was determined by Western zzso zzso activity was measured in cells zzso with an zzso zzso 

In zzso conditions, proliferation of zzso cells increased more than zzso over that of control zzso zzso Neither synthetic zzso zzso nor zzso showed any effect on zzso growth in zzso zzso zzso expression did not differ between the cell zzso generated in the presence of zzso and parental zzso zzso The ability of zzso to induce reporter gene activity in zzso cells was reduced by zzso zzso zzso caused zzso of proliferation only in the parental cell line although the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were down regulated by the vitamin E zzso in both parental zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso signal transaction is not enhanced in cells selected in the presence of zzso Our data may suggest that a more differentiated approach in targeting the zzso zzso is needed in prostate zzso that become resistant to classic zzso zzso
