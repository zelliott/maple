A model for the evolution of zzso tumors from a zzso precursor is exemplified by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso tumor lines developed in zzso zzso In zzso the zzso tumor grows rapidly in virgin mice and is more zzso than the zzso tumor which, in virgin mice, grows as a zzso zzso zzso from which tumors arise only during zzso The regulation of the proliferation of these two tumors was compared in primary culture using a zzso zzso collagen gel cell culture zzso In medium containing insulin, the growth of cell zzso from zzso tumors was zzso by the same factors that stimulate the growth of normal zzso zzso cells from virgin or pregnant zzso These factors include zzso and zzso (but not zzso zzso growth factor, basic zzso growth factor, zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, and zzso Most of these tumors (about zzso could not grow in medium with only insulin zzso of those that did, growth was slow and was zzso further by the above zzso zzso tumor cells formed zzso colonies in the collagen zzso similar to those of normal zzso These findings show that the growth regulation of zzso tumor cells is, in all aspects zzso similar to that of normal zzso In addition, the capacity for growth in the presence of only insulin (more autonomous zzso is not necessarily accompanied by deletions in responses to growth factors or hormones, or in zzso response zzso In contrast, zzso from zzso tumors needed only insulin for zzso The growth of some of these tumors was zzso further by only basic zzso growth factor and zzso zzso zzso zzso and agents that elevate zzso zzso zzso inhibited growth, the opposite of the response seen in normal or zzso zzso zzso zzso grew as cell masses rather than as zzso zzso These data show that while zzso tumors are remarkably similar to normal cells in the regulation of their zzso zzso tumors have incurred multiple defects in zzso pathways possibly including the production of zzso growth zzso In addition, the ability of zzso tumor cells to adhere to the collagen gel zzso and undergo normal zzso is zzso These results may highlight specific events required for the progression from zzso dependency to zzso zzso related to the hormonal regulation of zzso
