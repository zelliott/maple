The regular organization of the zzso lattice in the zzso eye originates in the precise regulation of the zzso gene zzso zzso which is responsible for the zzso of the zzso founder cells zzso Here we show that zzso eye zzso a dominant zzso zzso by severe zzso of the adult eye surface, causes defects in zzso assembly and zzso zzso The zzso spacing zzso can be ascribed to the irregular distribution of zzso cells caused by a disruption of the patterning of zzso zzso zzso in the recruitment of other zzso and excess zzso production in zzso cells may further contribute to the defects in zzso zzso Our molecular characterization of the zzso locus demonstrates that it is a zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso that results from a zzso zzso We show that zzso can rescue the retinal zzso zzso of zzso zzso and speculate that zzso zzso for some of zzso function in the eye or activates a residual function of the zzso zzso
