Nuclear factor zzso B zzso is an important factor linking inflammation and zzso In this study we zzso demonstrated through a zzso zzso reporter screen that zzso signaling can be directly targeted by nearly 29 zzso zzso Many of these zzso can directly target zzso signaling zzso by binding to their 3' untranslated region zzso zzso a member of the zzso family, is frequently zzso in gastrointestinal zzso especially in zzso zzso zzso The expression level of zzso is zzso correlated with zzso tumor zzso We further show that zzso suppresses cancer cell proliferation and migration in zzso and reduces zzso and zzso in zzso Additionally, zzso may exert its tumor zzso function by decreasing the expression of multiple zzso downstream zzso by way of the direct targeting of zzso and zzso 

Multiple zzso are involved in the zzso signaling zzso and zzso plays important zzso roles in cancer progression and may be a potential therapeutic zzso
