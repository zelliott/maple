zzso zzso zzso was selected as zzso The zzso distribution of soluble calcium at different zzso was shown by the zzso method and transmission electron zzso The results showed that the deposits of calcium zzso as the indicator for zzso zzso were mainly concentrated within the zzso and zzso spaces without zzso zzso zzso when the leaf was treated with zzso the zzso level increased remarkably in the zzso but considerably decreased in zzso and zzso zzso Meanwhile, the level of zzso also increased in zzso and zzso When the treatment continued, the level of zzso in zzso and nucleus continued to increase and some cells and zzso finally zzso showing that there is a relationship between the distribution of zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso plays a role in the plant drought zzso The changes of zzso zzso zzso in cells treated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso were investigated zzso The increase of zzso calcium induced by zzso was mainly caused by calcium zzso zzso participated in zzso signal zzso which was indicated by the variation of zzso zzso concentration change induced by zzso The above results provided a direct evidence for calcium zzso as an important signal at the experimental cellular zzso
