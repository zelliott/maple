Cold zzso and zzso by zzso plants are energetically expensive and are dependent on functional zzso zzso To understand how the zzso and the zzso zzso adapt to low temperatures, we have taken a zzso approach zzso gel zzso to identify proteins that changed in abundance in zzso zzso during cold shock (1 zzso and zzso (10 zzso and long-term (40 zzso zzso to 5 degrees zzso We show that cold shock (1 day) results in minimal change in the zzso zzso while short-term (10 zzso zzso results in major changes in the zzso but few changes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso (40 zzso results in zzso of the zzso of both zzso with new proteins appearing in the zzso and further zzso in protein abundance occurring in the zzso We identify 43 zzso displayed proteins that participate in photosynthesis, other zzso zzso functions, hormone zzso and stress sensing and signal zzso These findings not only provide new insights into the cold response and zzso of zzso but also demonstrate the importance of studying changes in protein abundance within the relevant cellular zzso
