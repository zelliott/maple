zzso zzso is a significant cause of hospital and community acquired pneumonia and causes secondary infection after influenza zzso Recently, patients with zzso syndrome, who often present with zzso zzso infections of the lung and skin, were found to have zzso in zzso required for zzso zzso suggesting a potential critical role for zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso Indeed, zzso and zzso mice displayed impaired bacterial clearance of zzso zzso compared with that of zzso zzso Mice challenged with influenza A zzso zzso and subsequently with zzso zzso had increased inflammation and decreased clearance of both virus and zzso zzso resulted in greater type I and II zzso production in the lung compared with that with virus infection zzso zzso influenza A zzso resulted in substantially decreased zzso zzso and zzso production after zzso zzso zzso The decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was independent of type II zzso but required type I zzso production in influenza zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso in influenza A, zzso zzso mice rescued the induction of zzso and zzso and markedly improved bacterial zzso These data indicate a novel mechanism by which influenza zzso type I zzso inhibit zzso immunity and increase zzso to secondary bacterial zzso
