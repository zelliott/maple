The immune response to cancer is critically determined by the way in which tumor cells zzso As zzso zzso death can be associated with zzso of zzso zzso whole tumor cell zzso loading strategies for zzso cell zzso vaccination have commonly used zzso zzso zzso as an zzso source of zzso zzso In this study, the effect of such zzso on the ability of zzso to mature in response to well-established maturation stimuli was zzso and methods to enhance zzso DC zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared from zzso tumor cell lines and their effects on bone zzso DC maturation and function zzso zzso zzso tumor cell zzso inhibited the zzso zzso maturation and function of bone zzso zzso preventing zzso of zzso zzso and major zzso complex class II, and reducing zzso of inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso and zzso Although zzso zzso was increased by zzso zzso this was not responsible for the observed suppression of zzso Although zzso of the nuclear zzso zzso remained intact, the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was inhibited in zzso zzso zzso DC suppression was partially reversed in zzso by induction of tumor cell stress before zzso and only zzso loaded with stressed zzso afforded protection against tumor challenge in zzso These data suggest that ex zzso zzso of tumor cells does not effectively mimic in zzso zzso zzso and advocates careful characterization and zzso of tumor zzso vaccine sources for cancer zzso
