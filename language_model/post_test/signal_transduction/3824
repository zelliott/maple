In an attempt to better define molecular influences on rat zzso zzso gene expression in cartilage, the promoter function was characterized using transient zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso and genetic analysis in isolated growth plate zzso Data from zzso deletion and selected zzso suggest that multiple zzso elements in both the zzso and zzso regions of the promoter were important in the regulation of promoter zzso A zzso tumor response element zzso was shown to be necessary for zzso and zzso zzso zzso reporter gene zzso zzso zzso by zzso beta (1 zzso 18 zzso had elevated zzso binding activity, and one of the factors involved was identified as the nuclear zzso zzso Indeed, zzso directed zzso zzso reduced rat zzso zzso zzso A sense zzso was zzso zzso of promoter activity was susceptible to zzso signaling as expression of dominant negative zzso of Ras zzso zzso reduced reporter gene zzso In a comparison of zzso promoter reporter zzso activity between zzso and zzso cells, zzso of zzso signaling was less effective in the later cell zzso This study suggests that the zzso of nuclear binding proteins that bind zzso may be a common event with zzso beta zzso Moreover, these data suggest that the regulation of rat zzso zzso gene expression is a zzso process and multiple zzso regulatory sites may interact to exert different effects dependent on the stage of zzso zzso
