zzso is the main zzso stored and released from zzso under zzso and pathological zzso zzso and functional evidence suggest that besides zzso zzso zzso zzso release zzso However, the molecular mechanisms involved in zzso zzso fusion remain still zzso 

In the present study, we identify zzso zzso zzso membrane protein zzso also called zzso as the zzso zzso which mediates zzso zzso zzso contributing to release of both zzso and zzso B from zzso zzso We also demonstrate that fusion of zzso zzso is triggered by slow and locally restricted calcium zzso distinct from calcium spikes which induce the fusion of zzso clear zzso zzso of zzso expression inhibited the fusion of zzso zzso and zzso calcium wave zzso zzso zzso also significantly reduced zzso of zzso B from zzso 

Given that sustained zzso release from zzso upon injury greatly contributes to secondary brain damage and zzso B plays a critical role in zzso zzso zzso zzso can represent a novel strategy to control zzso fusion in pathological zzso
