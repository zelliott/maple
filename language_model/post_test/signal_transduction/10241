The zzso 4 zzso is expressed in virtually all brain regions of zzso and plays an important role in energy zzso zzso in this gene may thus be related to growth and zzso In zzso a zzso zzso site was described zzso and demonstrated to affect zzso production and to alter zzso zzso zzso Association studies revealed significant linkage of this zzso with production trait in zzso In this study, zzso Lithuanian White pigs were zzso at the zzso locus and zzso on relationships between zzso and breeding values for several performance zzso The observed zzso and zzso zzso did not zzso significantly from zzso equilibrium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and are comparable with those described in other Large White zzso The zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was significantly associated with increased test daily gain, higher lean meat percentage and lower zzso zzso There was a trend towards an improved feed conversion ratio zzso zzso zzso in animals with the zzso zzso whereas no significant effect was found on lifetime daily zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso should be integrated in selection zzso in the Lithuanian White to improve carcass zzso
