zzso of zzso proteins zzso has been proposed to be the common basis for the anemia observed in zzso anemia zzso and zzso syndrome with loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso We have modeled zzso and zzso zzso in zzso using zzso zzso to zzso and zzso respectively, and have demonstrated that, as in humans, zzso levels of these proteins lead to a profound zzso To address the hypothesis that zzso loss results in impaired zzso translation, we treated zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso acid zzso a known zzso of zzso zzso This resulted in a striking improvement of the anemia associated with zzso zzso We confirmed our findings in primary human zzso cells, after zzso zzso of zzso and zzso Furthermore, we showed that loss of zzso or zzso activates the zzso pathway, and this is zzso by zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso This effect could be zzso by zzso suggesting that zzso signaling may be responsible for the improvement in anemia associated with zzso Our studies support the rationale for ongoing clinical trials of zzso as a therapeutic agent for zzso and potentially for patients with zzso zzso
