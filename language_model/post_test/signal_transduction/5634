The nuclear hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso functions as the zzso zzso in zzso development and is important in regulating zzso zzso zzso is rapidly zzso in zzso by the zzso zzso zzso under zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso increases zzso activity, indicating disposal of zzso by the zzso zzso system regulates zzso zzso However, the signals and factors required for recognition of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso are zzso To begin understanding how the zzso zzso interacts with zzso we designed a series of zzso containing each zzso domain expressed as a fusion protein with the zzso zzso zzso The ability of each zzso domain to alter the stability of the zzso zzso domain and to undergo zzso was assessed via western zzso zzso In addition, zzso reporter zzso were used to zzso zzso zzso zzso Using this approach, we determined that the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso are targeted to the zzso for zzso However, only the zzso is zzso to zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso is required for maximum zzso but is not essential for zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso reporter zzso show a fully functional zzso system is required for zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso is an integral zzso of zzso activity, targeting zzso for zzso degradation via zzso independent and zzso dependent zzso
