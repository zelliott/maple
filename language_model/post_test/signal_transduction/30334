There has been a rapid growth in appreciation of the diverse array of zzso factors, growth factors and other biological molecules that have the capacity to support adult zzso and direct zzso processes after injury to the nervous zzso zzso the mechanisms by which these factors operate offers the opportunity to use either the factors themselves or other agents that manipulate relevant signal zzso pathways as zzso for a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases, including diabetic zzso In this review, we aim to zzso current knowledge of the extent to which loss of zzso support contributes to the zzso of diabetic zzso present zzso evidence that supports the potential efficacy of growth factors or their zzso against zzso of diabetic zzso and highlight the emerging approaches to manipulating zzso support mechanisms that show potential for translation to clinical zzso Recent advances in directly assessing the progression of nerve damage in diabetic patients will hopefully facilitate renewed clinical evaluation of treatments for degenerative diabetic zzso and provide the framework for advancing the potential of growth factors as a therapy for this widespread and currently zzso zzso
