zzso in the zzso domain of zzso are associated with severe zzso dominant forms of peripheral zzso In this study, we show that one such zzso zzso zzso zzso when expressed in zzso cells in zzso is not zzso inactive but retains residual zzso zzso functions, including zzso of transforming growth zzso zzso cell death and an ability to induce the zzso protein zzso More importantly, this zzso zzso has zzso effects in zzso cells, enhancing DNA synthesis both in the presence and absence of the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso This is in stark contrast to zzso zzso which causes withdrawal from the cell zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso D1 and reduces levels of the cell cycle zzso zzso These observations add significant new evidence to explain how this zzso leads to zzso zzso zzso in zzso
