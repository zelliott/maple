This article provides the first extensive documentation of mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso The mechanisms selected were principally those zzso via zzso and/or cell signaling zzso zzso are reported for greater than 100 agents affecting nearly 400 zzso responses from a wide range of chemical classes, affecting a broad range of cell types and zzso Regardless of the model zzso in zzso or in zzso inducing agent, zzso or zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso the quantitative features of the zzso zzso responses are similar, suggesting that the magnitude of the response is a measure of biological zzso within a broad range of biological zzso These findings represent an important advance in the understanding of the zzso zzso response, its zzso and potential biomedical applications, including drug zzso assessment and the risk assessment zzso
