There are numerous examples of zzso zzso controlling long range zzso in zzso and cellular zzso The prospect of two such interacting zzso zzso long range zzso in biological systems via a Turing zzso has been zzso zzso or implicated in the context of numerous zzso zzso However, zzso investigations of cellular systems typically neglect the influence of gene expression on such zzso even though zzso and translation are observed to be important in zzso zzso In particular, the influence of gene expression on a large class of Turing zzso models, namely those with pure zzso such as the zzso system, is zzso Our investigations demonstrate that the zzso of the zzso model profoundly changes on the inclusion of gene expression dynamics and is sensitive to the zzso details of gene zzso Features such as concentration blow up, zzso zzso and radical sensitivities to the duration of gene expression are observed and, at best, severely restrict the possible zzso spaces for feasible biological zzso These results also indicate that the zzso of Turing pattern formation systems on the inclusion of gene expression time delays may provide a means of distinguishing between possible forms of interaction zzso Finally, this study also zzso that zzso and gene expression dynamics should not be simply neglected in models of long range biological pattern formation via zzso
