We previously reported that zzso a zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso response zzso by zzso stimulation through the protein zzso C zzso signaling zzso In the present study, we examined whether the same zzso induced the zzso zzso supporting the hypothesis that zzso is a feedback negative regulator of this zzso We zzso cultured zzso rat cardiac zzso with a zzso reporter gene driven by the zzso human zzso promoter and progressively shorter segments of this promoter zzso deleted from the zzso zzso We identified a basic promoter essential for zzso spanning 162 zzso upstream of the zzso initiation site and positive (at zzso and zzso and negative (at zzso zzso regulatory zzso We showed that the basic and zzso zzso promoters were activated specifically by zzso zzso through the zzso zzso but not by any other zzso hormonal zzso The zzso of the zzso promoter was zzso through the zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and related to zzso zzso influenced zzso from the zzso but not the zzso promoter implicating active zzso elements upstream from the basic zzso Acting in opposing fashions, zzso zzso the zzso promoter and zzso zzso the zzso Our results suggest that zzso stimulation zzso the zzso gene after zzso zzso through the zzso signaling zzso and that this induction is modulated by zzso and zzso
