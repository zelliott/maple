zzso protein zzso zzso form a zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso which require binding to a regulatory zzso for zzso zzso are organized in several gene families and are involved in different aspects of cell biology, such as gene transcription, cell proliferation and zzso In this study, we present the characteristics of the rice zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene was expressed in all zzso of the plant and relatively high amounts of its transcript were detected in mature leaves and zzso This indicated a putative role during later stages of leaf and zzso zzso Using zzso zzso analysis, we identified zzso as an zzso with zzso The expression profiles of the new zzso in response to various factors from rice cells were compared with those of previously described zzso and zzso The zzso transcript was induced by salt stress and zzso treatments, but was unaffected by zzso In addition, the zzso zzso activity associated with zzso zzso was induced under salt zzso We propose that zzso may be involved in zzso programs, as well as in the zzso and zzso zzso
