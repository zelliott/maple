zzso hormones and their nuclear receptors drive zzso transitions in diverse organisms, including zzso In this study, we show that the zzso steroid hormone zzso zzso and its nuclear zzso directly activate zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These small zzso zzso regulate the expression of target zzso and are required for the zzso of the zzso zzso during the zzso zzso zzso of three zzso responsive elements located in the zzso locus results in reduced levels of zzso zzso leading to zzso and behavioral defects in zzso Given the evolutionary conservation of zzso zzso sequences and zzso expression profiles, these findings indicate that steroid zzso control of zzso zzso is part of an ancestral zzso controlling the transition from zzso animal zzso
