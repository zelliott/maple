We have previously demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso human central nervous zzso zzso cells zzso to produce and zzso the zzso zzso 8 zzso In the present study, we use specific zzso and zzso to zzso the signal zzso pathways involved in this zzso zzso zzso production was blocked by zzso zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso zzso is initiated by zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is blocked by the protein zzso C inhibitor zzso or protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso establishing the involvement of the protein zzso C and protein zzso zzso pathways in the zzso zzso The zzso factor, zzso is involved in zzso zzso as determined by specific zzso of zzso and direct analysis of zzso zzso Neither zzso nor zzso of zzso protein zzso affected zzso production in the absence or presence of zzso Similarly, no effect was observed upon zzso of protein zzso by zzso zzso Thus, the signal zzso process induced by zzso in zzso leading to increased zzso zzso zzso is initiated by zzso binding to zzso zzso followed by subsequent zzso of protein zzso C, protein zzso zzso and zzso Because increased expression of zzso is associated with hypertension and stroke and zzso is likely to be involved in the zzso of zzso causing tissue damage in zzso injury, identification of the mechanism involved in the zzso increase in zzso production may have significant therapeutic zzso
