The efficiency of zzso effect zzso for zzso II zzso zzso and zzso 540 zzso was compared against zzso zzso zzso state lifetimes and zzso molecular oxygen quantum yields were correlated with biological zzso zzso zzso lifetime was two times longer than that of zzso however, its zzso molecular oxygen quantum yield was two times lower in comparison with zzso High zzso molecular oxygen quantum yield of zzso resulted in high biological zzso To achieve 50% mortality of cells four times lower light dose and five times lower concentration of zzso were applied in comparison with zzso The same level of cell damage was reached using 10 times higher light dose and two times higher concentration of zzso in comparison with zzso Our results confirm that zzso molecular oxygen based zzso prevalent for zzso and zzso was highly effective against melanoma zzso zzso can be used at small doses with high cellular damage zzso
