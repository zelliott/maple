A zzso method for molecular imaging of zzso activity in zzso would be of considerable zzso It would aid in understanding the role of specific genes and signal zzso pathways in the course of normal and zzso immune responses, and could zzso zzso dynamics and immune regulation at different stages of disease and following zzso We developed and assessed a novel method for monitoring the zzso zzso zzso nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso zzso of T cells by optical zzso imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso fluorescent protein zzso zzso dual reporter gene was used to monitor zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso A zzso zzso bearing the zzso reporter system was constructed in which the zzso reporter gene was placed under control of an artificial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were used to establish subcutaneous infiltrates in nude zzso We demonstrated that zzso zzso and nuclear imaging of zzso zzso is feasible using the zzso reporter zzso PET imaging with zzso using the zzso reporter system is sufficiently sensitive to detect zzso zzso in zzso PET images were confirmed by independent zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and induction of zzso zzso PET imaging of zzso zzso zzso activity may be useful in the assessment of T cell responses, zzso adoptive therapies, vaccination strategies and zzso zzso
