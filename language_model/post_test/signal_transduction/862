Early brain zzso involves the zzso of genes coding for zzso factors in distinct zzso of the neural zzso The limits of these zzso often prefigure zzso zzso In the zzso zzso patterning depends on a zzso process that leads to the formation of seven zzso called zzso zzso The molecular cues involved in the early subdivision of the zzso and in zzso formation are not well zzso We show that zzso a zzso gene coding for a zzso factor of the zzso family, is expressed at the end of zzso in the future zzso and zzso territories up to the prospective zzso zzso This territory is strictly complementary to the expression domain of another zzso zzso zzso in the zzso neural zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso expression anterior to their common border and that, conversely, zzso zzso zzso expression zzso to zzso This suggests that the zzso boundary is positioned by mutual repression between these two zzso zzso In addition, zzso is involved in the zzso of primary zzso in the zzso zzso In particular, it is essential for the formation of the zzso zzso in zzso We propose that zzso has a dual function in the zzso of the zzso zzso it is required for the proper positioning of the prospective zzso boundary and it promotes zzso in the anterior zzso
