zzso zzso is a central component of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, which has been shown to be activated in zzso of human zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso by binding to the two zzso zzso binding sites surrounding zzso and zzso zzso proteins can bind two target sequences located on one zzso chain zzso thereby increasing binding affinity compared to zzso binding and possibly allowing regulated zzso binding through gatekeeper zzso To date, it was unclear whether zzso proteins can bind the two zzso zzso binding sites of zzso zzso Fluorescence polarization using zzso peptides demonstrated that zzso is the zzso and zzso is the zzso binding site, while simultaneous engagement of both sites by zzso enhances affinity compared to zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso for the zzso zzso binding to one zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso was supported by the crystal structure of the zzso zzso Cellular zzso studies validate the significance of these sites for zzso retention of zzso suggesting an extended mechanism of zzso regulation by zzso zzso
