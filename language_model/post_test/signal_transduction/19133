zzso and their coat zzso zzso zzso multiple signaling zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that is deficient in limb zzso muscular zzso type 1 C zzso Paradoxically, zzso of this protein also causes muscle zzso in zzso We zzso that altered membrane expression of zzso in muscle cells causes a degenerative zzso by zzso the zzso of signaling pathways that are critical to the maintenance of cell zzso Here, we show for the first time that, in normal muscle cells subjected to zzso stress, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso associate with zzso where they bind to zzso and that normal zzso of this zzso promotes cell zzso Either increased or decreased expression of zzso at the membrane caused an increased zzso to zzso stress, and zzso survival was markedly improved by zzso zzso zzso This occurred zzso with altered zzso of the zzso proteins zzso and zzso despite normal levels of zzso zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that altered zzso expression can change the outcome of zzso zzso zzso from cell survival to cell zzso These findings indicate that normal expression and zzso of zzso are required to appropriately zzso zzso zzso cell survival zzso and suggest that this zzso may be an effective therapeutic target for the treatment of muscular zzso associated with zzso zzso
