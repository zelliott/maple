Single cell network profiling zzso is used to simultaneously measure the effects of zzso on signaling networks at the single cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of response to induction therapy and zzso risk in acute zzso leukemia zzso patients are being zzso Such zzso have typically used bone zzso zzso as the sample source of zzso Because circulating peripheral blasts are zzso in zzso of zzso patients and peripheral blood zzso sampling is less invasive than zzso zzso this study was performed to assess the effect of sample source on zzso blasts signaling as measured in zzso zzso 

zzso using zzso flow zzso was used to evaluate the zzso state of zzso signaling molecules in zzso blasts under zzso conditions and after treatment with zzso in 46 pairs of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The relationship between zzso of modulated zzso proteins zzso was measured using linear regression, zzso method, and Lin's zzso correlation zzso 

The majority zzso of signaling zzso show strong correlations between paired zzso and zzso samples independently from the statistical method zzso zzso exceptions were two zzso samples with almost zzso levels of circulating blasts compared with paired zzso zzso 

Our results demonstrate that zzso source zzso or zzso does not significantly affect zzso signaling in patients with zzso and circulating zzso The ability to use zzso as a sample source will facilitate the monitoring of cellular signaling effects following administration of targeted therapies and at time points when zzso zzso are not clinically zzso
