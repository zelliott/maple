zzso stress has been shown to increase the expression of zzso proteins in vascular smooth muscle cells zzso from spontaneously zzso zzso The present study was undertaken to examine if zzso which zzso zzso stress, could also enhance the expression of zzso proteins in zzso and to further explore the underlying signaling pathways responsible for this zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso increased the expression of zzso proteins and not of zzso protein in a zzso and zzso zzso A zzso increase of zzso was observed at 100 zzso and 1 h and was restored to control levels by zzso and zzso zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso respectively, and zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso inhibitor VIII, zzso of zzso zzso In addition, zzso also increased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso which was attenuated by the respective zzso whereas the zzso of zzso and zzso also inhibited the enhanced zzso of zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso of cells with short interfering zzso of zzso and zzso restored the zzso enhanced expression of zzso proteins to control zzso The increased expression of zzso proteins was reflected in enhanced zzso functions as demonstrated by enhanced zzso of zzso zzso by zzso hormones and zzso zzso zzso activity by a low concentration of zzso whereas zzso zzso of zzso were significantly zzso Furthermore, zzso enhanced proliferation of zzso was attenuated by zzso These results suggest that zzso increases the expression of zzso proteins in zzso through the zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso
