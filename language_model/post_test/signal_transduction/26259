zzso of zzso zzso effectively suppresses localized zzso growth but zzso zzso zzso and zzso by unknown zzso To study the dynamic and zzso interactions between zzso cells and their zzso during these zzso we established a zzso model by injecting zzso cells into the blood circulation of transparent zzso zzso This zzso results in rapid simultaneous formation of a localized zzso and experimental zzso allowing zzso imaging of both processes at zzso resolution within 1 zzso The zzso zzso was initiated de zzso by zzso of primitive zzso cells into a functional zzso zzso of zzso cells in critical zzso steps such as zzso and invasion were revealed by genetic and pharmaceutical zzso We discovered that the zzso migration of zzso controlled zzso invasion by conditioning the collagen zzso and forming the zzso zzso as detected by zzso zzso zzso and second harmonic zzso Administration of zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso and a localized zzso growth but enhanced migration of zzso which in turn promoted zzso invasion and formation of zzso This demonstrates the in zzso cooperation between zzso zzso and zzso cells in zzso and provides a new mechanism underlying the recent findings that zzso targeting can promote zzso zzso
