zzso belongs to the zzso zzso zzso family of zzso associated zzso zzso characterized by a large zzso region, a zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso It was previously shown that zzso contributes to zzso zzso signaling not only zzso but also as an essential zzso component of the zzso complex, being required for high affinity binding of zzso For this function the zzso zzso domain was found to be zzso Here, it is shown that zzso cells lacking zzso have significantly reduced zzso zzso 1 zzso protein level, whereas the zzso level is zzso zzso of the zzso region of zzso in these cells zzso zzso zzso level, but did not restore the binding activity of the zzso Studies of zzso zzso forms deleted at the N zzso indicated that the integrity of the zzso region is required to sustain zzso These studies also showed that the zzso region does not directly zzso the zzso zzso activity of zzso but it is required for efficient in zzso zzso zzso and for rendering the zzso zzso by zzso Overall, these results indicate that distinct zzso zzso provide different functions to the zzso zzso the zzso region sustains zzso level, whereas the zzso domain provides a function toward high affinity zzso zzso
