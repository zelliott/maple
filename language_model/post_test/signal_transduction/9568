zzso gas zzso exposure during accidents or in the military setting results primarily in injury to the zzso However, the potential for zzso exposure to promote injury to the systemic zzso leading to compromised vascular function has not been zzso We hypothesized that zzso promotes zzso zzso dysfunction characterized by a loss of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso Male Sprague zzso rats were exposed to zzso for 30 minutes, and zzso zzso of zzso as a function of zzso dose zzso zzso and time after exposure zzso zzso were zzso Exposure to zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso by zzso at 24 to 48 hours after exposure without affecting zzso responses to zzso or zzso responses to an NO zzso suggesting decreased NO zzso zzso with this hypothesis, zzso protein expression was significantly decreased zzso zzso in zzso isolated from zzso versus zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso was zzso in circulating zzso and zzso isolated 24 hours after zzso exposure, suggesting stimulation of inflammation in the systemic zzso Despite decreased zzso expression and activity, no changes in mean zzso blood pressure were zzso However, injection of zzso a selective inhibitor of zzso increased mean zzso blood pressure only in zzso animals, suggesting that zzso NO compensates for decreased zzso zzso These results highlight the potential for zzso exposure to promote zzso systemic zzso dysfunction via disruption of vascular NO zzso zzso
