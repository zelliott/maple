zzso zzso cells zzso are a population of zzso cells present in the bone zzso and most zzso zzso capable of differentiation into zzso zzso such as bone and zzso zzso are attractive candidates for biological zzso tissue repair approaches because of their extensive zzso ability in culture while retaining their zzso zzso differentiation zzso In addition to its zzso scientific interest, the prospect of monitoring and controlling zzso differentiation is a crucial regulatory and clinical zzso zzso the molecular regulation of zzso differentiation has been extensively zzso Most of the studies are in zzso because the identity of zzso in their zzso of origin in zzso remains zzso This review addresses the current knowledge of the molecular basis of differentiation of cultured zzso with a particular focus on zzso and zzso Building on the information coming from zzso biology studies of embryonic zzso several signaling pathways and zzso factors have been investigated and shown to play critical roles in zzso zzso In particular, the zzso and transforming growth zzso zzso protein signaling pathways are well known to zzso in zzso the molecular differentiation into cartilage and zzso zzso to the emerging concept of stem cell niches is the demonstration that physical factors can also participate in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso of the regulation of zzso differentiation will be critical in the design of three-dimensional culture systems and zzso for automated zzso through mathematical models applied to systems biology and network zzso
