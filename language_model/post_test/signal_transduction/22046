zzso signaling is essential for proper cardiac zzso We recently identified zzso zzso in the zzso zzso in patients with diverse left zzso zzso tract zzso zzso zzso and zzso that reduce zzso zzso zzso Here, we examine the molecular mechanisms that contribute to reduced signaling and zzso zzso We find that zzso exhibits reduced zzso zzso due to impaired trafficking through the zzso zzso zzso This observation is consistent with improper zzso of the zzso zzso to the zzso and decreased presentation at the cell zzso In contrast, the nearby zzso zzso exhibits reduced zzso presentation in the absence of overt folding or trafficking zzso To examine the implications of these zzso in disease zzso we investigated their effect on zzso transition zzso a critical process for development of the zzso zzso We find that these zzso zzso zzso can contribute to defective zzso in zzso cell lines through impaired induction of Snail and zzso family zzso These data represent the first description of a molecular mechanism underlying zzso zzso in individuals with zzso zzso and have important implications regarding the functional contribution of these zzso to a complex set of zzso zzso
