zzso zzso zzso is a major global health problem, which has a grave morbidity and zzso Over the past few decades, no effective systemic therapeutic zzso have been established for patients with the zzso zzso in advanced zzso zzso is a small zzso that blocks cancer cell proliferation by targeting the zzso signaling zzso at the level of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and exerts an zzso effect by targeting the vascular zzso growth factor zzso 2 and 3, and zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso Recently, two clinical successful applications, zzso and zzso trial, of zzso inhibitor zzso represent a significant advance in the treatment of advanced zzso patients without a zzso zzso However, because the results of clinical trials show diverse responses in a subset of zzso patients, a molecular zzso of zzso through the zzso of specific zzso related to its biological behavior is necessary for sorting zzso patients to each group with a biological zzso ultimately leading to the most suitable zzso of molecular targeted therapy in zzso
