zzso lateral sclerosis zzso is characterized by the selective zzso of specific populations of zzso and spinal motor zzso In this study, we examined the expression of the high affinity functional zzso for zzso zzso and assessed the functional state of zzso by examining the level of zzso on zzso zzso in ALS spinal zzso The data showed that zzso prepared from zzso zzso of ALS spinal cords by use of an zzso zzso contained much more zzso protein than from zzso These zzso proteins expressed in ALS spinal zzso however, are much less zzso on zzso zzso than those of zzso Moreover, zzso analysis of zzso zzso in ALS spinal cords demonstrated that the expression of zzso B zzso is also zzso in ALS spinal cords compared with those of zzso These data strongly suggest that there exists an zzso in zzso zzso signaling in ALS spinal cords and shed a light on the possibility of the therapeutic intervention by zzso this zzso zzso
