The high activity of the zzso zzso contributes to the enhanced zzso stimulation of translation initiation in skeletal muscle of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a negative regulator of the zzso zzso of the insulin zzso zzso and insulin zzso zzso 1 zzso The activity of zzso is determined mainly by its association with zzso and zzso We examined the level of zzso activity, zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and the association of zzso with zzso and zzso in skeletal muscle and liver of zzso and fed 7- and zzso zzso zzso activity in skeletal muscle was lower zzso zzso zzso in 7- compared with zzso pigs but in liver was similar in the two age zzso zzso zzso were similar in muscle but lower zzso zzso zzso in liver of 7- compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in muscle was lower zzso zzso zzso in 7- than in zzso zzso The associations of zzso with zzso and with zzso were lower zzso zzso zzso at 7 than at 26 days of age in muscle, but there were no age effects in zzso Finally, in both age groups, zzso did not have any effect on these zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso is zzso regulated in skeletal muscle of zzso zzso consistent with the zzso changes in the zzso of the zzso zzso reported zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso muscle likely contributes to the enhanced insulin sensitivity of skeletal muscle in zzso zzso
