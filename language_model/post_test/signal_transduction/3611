zzso zzso zzso have been developed to reduce zzso zzso production for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease by zzso the zzso of zzso precursor protein zzso However, zzso activity on the processing of zzso can cause adverse zzso To avoid these zzso effects, zzso zzso zzso are being developed to selectively reduce toxic zzso production without zzso zzso zzso As it is also known that zzso can cause a paradoxical increase of plasma zzso over the baseline after a transient reduction zzso as zzso we asked if zzso would cause a similar rebound and what the potential mechanism might zzso Our studies were performed with one zzso zzso and two chemically distinct zzso Although zzso caused zzso as expected in rat zzso the two zzso did zzso zzso of zzso processing by zzso induced an zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso fragments of zzso but neither zzso caused such an zzso In conclusion, we discover that zzso unlike zzso do not cause zzso possibly because of the lack of zzso of zzso zzso zzso may be superior to zzso in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease not only by sparing zzso signaling but also by avoiding zzso
