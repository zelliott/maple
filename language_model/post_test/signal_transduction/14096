zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso requires zzso at two zzso The first zzso is independent of insulin stimulation and zzso by an unknown zzso The second zzso is zzso by zzso in insulin dependent zzso In this study, we identified zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) as a zzso in the first zzso zzso protein was zzso by zzso at zzso and zzso in the zzso terminal zzso zzso The zzso was observed in zzso zzso with zzso zzso as a zzso and in cells after zzso zzso by zzso or zzso zzso The zzso was detected in zzso zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso cells after zzso zzso When zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso the zzso was blocked in zzso The zzso led to zzso protein degradation in zzso deficient zzso The degradation was blocked by zzso of zzso activity with zzso In wide type cells, the zzso did not promote zzso degradation when zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Instead, the zzso allowed zzso zzso by zzso which zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells or cells treated by zzso zzso the zzso led to zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso is zzso by zzso and the zzso makes zzso protein unstable in the absence of zzso zzso This study provides a mechanism for regulation of zzso protein zzso
