zzso zzso zzso and inflammation play an important role in zzso formation and vascular zzso The present study was aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of zzso regulator zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso 

Fifty rabbits fed a zzso diet were randomly divided into a normal control group zzso and experimental group zzso All rabbits in the experimental group underwent zzso placement around the abdominal zzso and zzso injection of zzso zzso to induce zzso inflammation and they were further divided into model control group, zzso group, green zzso protein zzso group and zzso gene zzso group, zzso Four weeks after treatment, the model control group, zzso group and zzso group showed thickened zzso and zzso reduced zzso size and increased zzso and zzso index of the abdominal zzso in comparison with the normal control group, whereas zzso group exhibited attenuated zzso formation and vascular zzso zzso zzso vascular expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vascular cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and nuclear factor zzso B zzso were significantly higher in the model control group, zzso group and zzso group than those in the normal control group zzso In contrast, the local expression levels of these zzso were substantially reduced by zzso gene transfer zzso Similarly, the serum levels of inflammatory zzso including zzso protein zzso transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly higher in the model control group, zzso group and zzso group than those of the zzso group zzso In zzso studies showed that zzso zzso diminished inflammatory zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso inflammation zzso vascular zzso via the interactions of multiple inflammatory zzso and local zzso gene transfer in zzso can significantly inhibit these interactions and thereby zzso local inflammation and vascular zzso
