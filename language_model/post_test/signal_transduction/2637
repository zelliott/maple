zzso are plasma membrane zzso which have been implicated in zzso zzso zzso zzso and signal zzso In addition to their zzso zzso zzso are characterized by the presence of an integral membrane protein termed zzso We have recently observed that zzso have no zzso zzso and lack plasma membrane zzso resembling zzso Here we zzso express zzso in a zzso cell line using the zzso Forest virus expression system and show de zzso formation of plasma membrane zzso containing zzso These zzso appear homogeneous in size and zzso indistinguishable from zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso patched by zzso redistributes to the newly formed zzso Our results show that zzso is a key structural component required for zzso zzso
