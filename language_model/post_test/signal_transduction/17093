zzso zzso factors zzso are downstream targets of the zzso zzso protein zzso B zzso signaling cascade and play a pivotal role in cell zzso cell cycle and zzso We found that cells from zzso zzso zzso leukemia zzso patients showed zzso zzso of zzso in comparison to zzso patients suggesting its zzso To determine the impact of zzso zzso cells were infected with a zzso zzso zzso zzso After zzso these cells undergo zzso zzso zzso zzso the death zzso TRAIL and the zzso protein zzso implicating zzso as well as intrinsic death zzso Whereas zzso partially inhibited cell death, zzso and zzso efficiently rescued ALL cells after zzso zzso suggesting a zzso amplifying feedback loop downstream of zzso zzso of TRAIL and zzso reduced zzso zzso implicating that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the cell cycle inhibitor zzso which zzso ALL cells to zzso cell death, zzso zzso protein levels and reduces the dependency of these leukemia cells on zzso zzso This suggests that if zzso is deleted during leukemia development, zzso levels elevate and zzso has to be zzso by deregulation of the zzso zzso to prevent zzso cell zzso
