zzso dominant zzso kidney disease, a common inherited disease affecting about zzso and zzso live zzso is characterized by massive enlargement of zzso zzso and eventually causes zzso zzso The purpose of this study is to identify the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso development and to investigate the zzso zzso zzso canine kidney zzso zzso model and zzso embryonic kidney zzso model were used to evaluate zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso zzso function and zzso and signaling pathways in zzso cells were determined to explore the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso was found to significantly inhibit zzso zzso zzso At maximum dose zzso caused zzso zzso of the zzso formation zzso was zzso zzso zzso slowed zzso enlargement in both zzso zzso model and embryonic kidney zzso model with zzso zzso zzso neither induced zzso nor zzso in zzso cells at zzso zzso zzso failed to affect the zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso Interestingly, zzso inhibited zzso cell proliferation and promoted the zzso formation in zzso cells, which indicates zzso promotes zzso cell zzso Furthermore, zzso reduced the zzso signaling proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but increased zzso and zzso in zzso cells exposed to zzso These results define that zzso zzso zzso zzso formation and enlargement and suggest that zzso might be developed as a candidate drug for zzso kidney zzso
