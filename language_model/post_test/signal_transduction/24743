We have previously reported that zzso factor zzso zzso zzso free calcium concentration zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso To confirm that this increase in zzso is a result of zzso zzso of zzso C, we investigated zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a rapid and transient formation of zzso zzso In zzso experiments, zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The secondary zzso in zzso was zzso with a rise in zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso stimulates delayed zzso activities which zzso alternate zzso besides the zzso This zzso zzso in zzso soluble zzso was seen at 5 zzso but not at 15 zzso suggesting that the initial rise in zzso as well as the initial zzso in zzso are due primarily to zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso as well as zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso zzso We suggest that zzso released specifically from zzso via zzso zzso is a source of this zzso zzso It has been zzso that zzso zzso may antagonize the zzso and zzso effects of zzso via zzso of zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso reduced zzso and zzso zzso concentration indicating that zzso zzso signaling pathways may oppose zzso zzso of zzso zzso We have taken advantage of the different sensitivities of zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso and zzso toxin to zzso zzso zzso and C zzso Acute zzso enhanced zzso zzso formation, reduced zzso zzso in zzso and had no effect upon zzso zzso We have also demonstrated that zzso zzso but not zzso zzso C, was sensitive to external calcium zzso The role of a zzso protein to couple zzso to the zzso zzso C was confirmed as zzso gamma S zzso elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso We also demonstrated that zzso toxin zzso a single protein of an apparent 42 zzso mass and that zzso zzso reduced subsequent zzso in a zzso zzso However, zzso toxin had no effect upon zzso zzso water soluble zzso or zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activities were sensitive to zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
