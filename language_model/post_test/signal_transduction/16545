Three kinds of networks were summarily described in this review including the small zzso molecular networks, the zzso networks of zzso zzso axis and the large network, zzso zzso network, covering the whole zzso and linking multiple systems zzso The hypothesis was expressed that the zzso or zzso formed in the human body by the intervention from outside world is based on the changes of zzso zzso In this paper, the pattern and ability of signal zzso channel and the methods of studying changes in it were also zzso and raised, zzso zzso determine syndrome by drug effects zzso is the intervention means for studying syndrome in the light of systemic biological zzso We found zzso zzso syndrome covered the zzso network and the regulating center located in zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By intervention with zzso an effective component of zzso it was found that zzso can activate the immune system and the three networks, including growth zzso sex hormone axis and zzso zzso network in zzso axis through the downward zzso of zzso network to play its efficiency of molecular zzso There are many regulation patterns of zzso on zzso For example, in the network mechanism of zzso zzso and zzso zzso can reconstruct the balance of the opposite zzso related genes and proliferation related zzso zzso can assemble and integrate zzso zzso transform growth factors zzso and several zzso to form an upstream factor network for initiating the proliferation and zzso zzso zzso can simultaneously zzso the two opposite genes expression of zzso and zzso in zzso signal zzso channel, which could not only control the rising of zzso in a moderate range, but also guarantee its zzso status to exert its hinge role in zzso regulating network, by which gene network regulation zzso in zzso axis of zzso syndrome was zzso
