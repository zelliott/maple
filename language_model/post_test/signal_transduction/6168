Upon viral infection, the major defense mounted by the host immune system is the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to complete their life cycle, viruses that are obligatory zzso zzso must zzso the host zzso immune zzso zzso zzso 68 zzso zzso a wide range of cell types and establishes zzso infections in zzso Here we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso protein has a zzso zzso zzso zzso is present in the zzso and plasma membrane in zzso whereas it is present primarily in the nucleus in zzso and zzso zzso A zzso analysis indicated that the internal positively charged zzso acids of zzso are required for its nuclear zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso complex showed that zzso specifically interacts with the cellular zzso zzso protein through its central positively charged region and that this interaction recruits the cellular zzso protein to the nucleus in zzso Regardless of its zzso zzso expression effectively induced the zzso of zzso and/or zzso in both zzso B zzso and zzso zzso zzso resulting in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Finally, the zzso interaction with the zzso protein appeared to contribute to its ability to inhibit zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso harbors a zzso zzso gene that zzso zzso host innate immunity and thus could play an important role in the establishment and maintenance of viral zzso in infected zzso
