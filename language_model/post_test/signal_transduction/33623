The development of zzso zzso including zzso zzso and teeth starts from zzso zzso and is regulated by interplay of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are high in hierarchy of zzso zzso To identify direct targets of zzso pathway, we performed zzso profiling of genes zzso regulated by short exposure to zzso zzso in embryonic zzso skin zzso Surprisingly, there were only two genes with obvious involvement in zzso zzso zzso (most highly induced gene in the zzso and zzso Both genes zzso with zzso zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso They were zzso upon zzso zzso while several other zzso associated genes previously suggested as zzso targets were zzso However, low zzso and zzso expression was retained in the absence of zzso zzso in zzso hair zzso We provide evidence that this expression was dependent on zzso activity present prior to zzso zzso zzso was recently suggested as a key zzso zzso regulating lateral zzso essential for correct patterning of hair zzso Several pieces of evidence suggest zzso as a zzso zzso as zzso The finding that zzso zzso zzso zzso was unexpected, and zzso the importance of delicate zzso of zzso during zzso zzso
