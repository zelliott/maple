The regulation of synaptic zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso A zzso levels is a key component of synaptic zzso Most forms of zzso plasticity are associated with the induction of the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso it is predicted that zzso may regulate zzso of genes associated with zzso receptors and/or zzso It turns out that zzso regulation by zzso tends to be zzso zzso of zzso in zzso leads to altered expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso thereby changing the capacity of the zzso to degrade synaptic zzso including receptors and zzso zzso In addition, zzso alters the zzso of genes associated with zzso expression and trafficking, such as zzso and zzso This indirect regulation of zzso turnover is likely to contribute to the delayed, but long-lasting, zzso of synaptic plasticity and also to the synaptic dysfunction associated with diseases such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, where zzso expression is zzso
