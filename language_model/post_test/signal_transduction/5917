Although zzso zzso zzso receptors have been characterized by zzso binding studies, pathways of zzso signaling by activated zzso receptors remain zzso We employed zzso binding studies and fluorescent zzso of zzso zzso concentration zzso and pH to identify zzso receptors and mechanisms of zzso signaling in cultured human zzso zzso zzso cells expressed a single class of zzso specific binding sites for zzso zzso competition, and zzso analyses gave an average zzso of approximately zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with high affinity for zzso binding sites, as did zzso but with much lower zzso zzso binding was blocked by a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso also evoked a rapid zzso zzso transient increase in zzso zzso followed by a second, sustained zzso The transient phase was independent of zzso zzso whereas the sustained phase was dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso was unaffected by zzso The zzso zzso zzso were dose dependent (1 zzso zzso and, similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso were inhibited by zzso zzso zzso We also report evidence that zzso affects zzso pH and activates zzso zzso Specifically, zzso induced an initial zzso within 1-2 zzso followed by net zzso at 5 zzso zzso was due to zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors were apparently not coupled to zzso zzso or zzso zzso as we detected no changes of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Thus we conclude that zzso binding sites on human zzso cells are coupled to a zzso system and zzso zzso zzso zzso a potent inflammatory mediator, failed to stimulate zzso or zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso that preserve normal zzso zzso
