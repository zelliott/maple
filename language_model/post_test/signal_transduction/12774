The relation between zzso of zzso free calcium and zzso of membrane zzso has been studied in single zzso cells of the rat zzso zzso and inward currents are activated by calcium zzso and zzso in phase with zzso of zzso zzso The outward current results from zzso of a large zzso zzso and zzso zzso channel, whereas the inward current is most likely carried predominantly by zzso Both these zzso have been previously described in zzso zzso zzso calcium at resting levels eliminated current responses to zzso zzso suggesting that calcium is the only significant second zzso involved in the short-term control of this zzso by zzso
