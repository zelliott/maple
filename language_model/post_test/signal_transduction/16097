zzso synaptic transmission and zzso synaptic plasticity were evaluated in superior cervical sympathetic zzso zzso of zzso rat model of Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso using zzso and molecular zzso zzso were administered zzso peptides (a mixture of zzso zzso and zzso by chronic zzso infusion via zzso zzso pumps zzso zzso Control rats received zzso zzso reverse zzso 300 zzso zzso compound action zzso were recorded before zzso and after repetitive zzso In isolated zzso zzso long-term zzso zzso was generated by a brief train of stimuli zzso for zzso and zzso long-term depression zzso was produced with trains of paired zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso from zzso rats showed a marked downward shift along all stimulus zzso compared to those of zzso from control animals, indicating impaired zzso synaptic zzso In addition, repetitive stimulation induced robust zzso and zzso in zzso isolated from control animals, but, the same protocols failed to induce zzso or zzso in zzso from zzso rats indicating impairment of zzso synaptic plasticity in these zzso Western zzso of zzso zzso from zzso rats revealed reduction in the ratio of zzso and in zzso protein zzso Although other mechanisms could be involved, these changes in signaling molecules could represent an important molecular mechanism linked to the failure to express synaptic plasticity in zzso rat zzso zzso of the current study could explain some of the peripheral nervous system manifestations of Alzheimer's zzso
