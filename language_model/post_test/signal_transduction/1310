zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso signaling led to a turnover of focal zzso zzso required for cell spreading and zzso We used yellow zzso zzso a fluorescent zzso zzso sensor fused to zzso or to a zzso zzso domain, to measure simultaneously local zzso variations at zzso sites and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso initiate both zzso and zzso zzso waves in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs when the zzso wave reaches individual zzso indicating that local but not global zzso increases trigger zzso zzso An unexpectedly rapid flux of zzso between zzso and zzso compartments was revealed by zzso recovery after zzso zzso The zzso recovery zzso (17 zzso at zzso was slowed (to 29 zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had a faster, zzso recovery zzso (11 zzso which is consistent with the effect of zzso on zzso dynamics not being due to a general modification of the dynamics of zzso zzso Because zzso association at zzso was prolonged by zzso and zzso zzso was correlated to zzso zzso levels, we propose that local zzso zzso increase the residency of zzso at zzso possibly by means of zzso zzso of zzso thereby leading to increased zzso of its zzso involved in zzso zzso
