zzso is a zzso zzso protein that has been implicated in several biological zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso Likewise, zzso has been identified as a protein associated with zzso structures, including zzso and nuclear zzso cap zzso Using a variety of zzso methods, we found that the vast majority of cellular zzso is associated with free zzso zzso zzso and zzso In its association with zzso zzso interacts in an zzso complex with both zzso zzso and is not associated with zzso zzso targeted disruption of the zzso gene results in zzso hypersensitivity and a zzso in recovery following nitrogen zzso and zzso These effects coincide with severe zzso depletion and reduced total protein zzso Taken together, our data indicate that zzso plays a critical role in zzso translation under zzso stress conditions and suggest that zzso acts in concert with the target of zzso zzso signaling zzso
