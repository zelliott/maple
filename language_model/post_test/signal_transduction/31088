zzso of zzso signaling can lead to several zzso such as zzso defects and zzso Here, we show that zzso signaling is active in zzso zzso cells and decreases during zzso zzso Interestingly, this is paralleled by a decrease in Indian zzso zzso We then tested if this zzso was sufficient to induce zzso zzso To this end, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso induced a decrease in zzso zzso similar to the one observed during zzso zzso However, zzso did not induce nor zzso zzso zzso as monitored by zzso zzso and by the expression of several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso cannot substitute for other components of the differentiation zzso insulin, zzso or zzso These results indicate that although zzso signaling decreases during zzso zzso this zzso is not sufficient to trigger zzso zzso This suggests that zzso signaling is an inadequate pharmacological target for patient suffering from syndromes associated with a decrease in fat mass, such as the ones observed in zzso
