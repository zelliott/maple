The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso plays a role in regulating the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cancer, but zzso also accumulate in zzso areas of the tumors where there is little zzso expression zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regions are likely to be zzso In this study we show that zzso zzso zzso migration of zzso zzso cells and human zzso In contrast, zzso from peripheral blood migrate normally to an zzso zzso in hypoxic zzso The zzso of zzso migration by zzso is rapid and zzso At the exposure times studied zzso zzso zzso does not affect expression of the zzso zzso zzso and cells exposed to zzso still respond to zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso Although zzso is known to zzso gene zzso the zzso of migration reported here was not due to the production of soluble factors, and zzso expression of zzso migration zzso factor was zzso zzso zzso of zzso was not limited to zzso zzso also inhibited the zzso response to zzso inflammatory zzso zzso and the zzso zzso but hypoxic cells were still able to zzso zzso red blood zzso We suggest that zzso of migration by zzso is not due to gene regulation but is a reflection of zzso changes in the zzso zzso zzso may regulate the distribution of zzso in tumors and other inflammatory zzso
