zzso are genetically zzso zzso that contain their own subset of zzso genes coding for zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, the great majority of the zzso proteins are zzso in the nucleus and must be imported into the zzso after their translation in the zzso This arrangement requires a high degree of coordination between the gene expression zzso in zzso and nucleus, which is achieved by a permanent exchange of information between both zzso The existence of such zzso signals has long been zzso however, the underlying molecular mechanisms and signaling routes are not zzso The present data indicate that the expression of zzso zzso proteins is coupled to the functional state of the zzso zzso which is the major function of zzso plays a crucial role in this zzso Changes in the zzso zzso state of components of the zzso machinery act as signals, which regulate the expression of zzso proteins in both zzso and nucleus and help to coordinate the expression both in zzso Recent advances in understanding zzso zzso regulation of nuclear gene expression are zzso and the importance for zzso signaling is zzso
