The aims of the present study were to examine the effect of zzso on zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and to determine the signaling mechanism zzso We demonstrate that zzso treatment resulted in a decreased number and surface area of zzso zzso accompanied by release of zzso The zzso effect of zzso was not zzso by zzso based on the facts that zzso did not induce an zzso of zzso zzso levels, and protein zzso A zzso inhibitor zzso did not block zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was involved in this signaling pathway, since zzso a transient rise of zzso zzso and zzso influx across the plasma zzso and zzso inhibitor significantly abolished zzso zzso Moreover, zzso increased the relative levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In support of the involvement zzso we demonstrated that zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso an inhibitor of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso reversed zzso zzso zzso Further, the relationship between zzso and zzso was connected by the finding that zzso inhibitor also blocked zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso zzso is both zzso and zzso and this zzso signaling zzso is distinct from the traditional zzso zzso zzso zzso is reported to enhance zzso by direct zzso of hormone sensitive zzso zzso thus zzso may likely activate zzso through zzso and increase zzso of zzso
