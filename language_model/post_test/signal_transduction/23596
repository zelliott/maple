zzso transfer protein zzso is a zzso protein that is enriched in liver and that interacts with zzso zzso member 2 zzso Mice lacking either protein exhibit improved zzso zzso zzso and are resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso target of zzso complex 1 zzso are key zzso of insulin zzso which is attenuated in zzso We found that zzso inhibited zzso as evidenced by zzso zzso zzso after zzso genetic zzso or chemical zzso of zzso In addition, zzso was activated after zzso of zzso providing support for a role for the interaction of zzso with zzso in suppressing insulin zzso Additionally, we showed that zzso bound to zzso sclerosis complex 2 zzso and stabilized the components of the zzso complex, which functions to inhibit zzso Preventing zzso from binding to zzso disrupted interactions of zzso with zzso and zzso and disruption of the zzso complex was associated with increased zzso of both zzso and zzso In zzso of mice with genetic zzso of zzso or that had been treated with a zzso zzso zzso amounts of zzso were increased, whereas those of zzso were zzso These findings reveal a zzso mechanism that suppresses insulin signaling downstream of its zzso
