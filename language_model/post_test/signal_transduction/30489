zzso zzso 3 zzso one of the three zzso of the zzso family, is highly expressed in the brain and is involved in the maintenance of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, whereas the function of zzso under zzso conditions has been determined, its role under zzso is still zzso To assess zzso role in cerebral zzso we exposed zzso mice to transient middle cerebral artery zzso followed by zzso In addition, to evaluate the effect of zzso zzso on zzso survival, zzso zzso cultures and primary cortical zzso from zzso mice were subjected to oxygen zzso deprivation zzso plus zzso Here we report that zzso gene suppression leads to a worsening of brain damage after focal zzso and to a massive zzso death in all the zzso fields of zzso cultures as well as in cortical zzso from zzso mice exposed to zzso plus zzso In addition, in zzso cortical zzso exposed to zzso zzso zzso recorded in the reverse mode of operation, were significantly lower than those detected in zzso From these results, zzso protein emerges as a new molecular target that may have a potential therapeutic value in modulating cerebral zzso
