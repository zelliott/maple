Stem cell factor zzso and zzso zzso have been reported to be zzso at the protein and gene levels in human zzso after ultraviolet B zzso zzso and to play central roles in zzso zzso However, little is known about the time sequence of zzso and zzso expression in zzso human zzso and the coordination of their roles during zzso zzso To clarify such parameters in zzso human skin, we measured the expression patterns of zzso and zzso (as well as of their corresponding zzso at the gene level at various times during zzso human zzso When human zzso skin was exposed to zzso radiation at two minimal zzso doses, the expression of zzso zzso transcripts was significantly enhanced at 3 days after zzso with an early decrease and subsequently constant expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso and zzso B zzso zzso zzso expression was synchronized at 5 to 10 days after zzso in concert with an increased expression of zzso zzso transcripts and the increase in zzso In parallel the expression of zzso and zzso proteins as well as zzso was zzso at 7 to 10 days after zzso whereas zzso protein decreased at 3 days after zzso and returned to the zzso control level at 5 days after zzso When cultured human zzso were treated with human zzso zzso zzso protein expression and the binding of zzso zzso to the zzso were significantly increased, further suggesting the preferential and coordinated role of early expression of zzso in zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso signaling is predominantly involved in the early phase of zzso human pigmentation during which it stimulates the zzso linkage that is associated with the later phase of zzso zzso
