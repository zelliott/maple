zzso zzso and zzso are scaffold proteins of the tight junction zzso that belong to the zzso protein family characterized for exhibiting zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins are present only in zzso organisms, being the zzso the first to have zzso zzso proteins associate among themselves and with other integral and zzso proteins of the zzso of the zzso and of gap zzso as with numerous signaling proteins and the zzso zzso zzso proteins are also present at the nucleus of zzso zzso 

zzso stress zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso stress alters zzso proteins expression and zzso in conditions like zzso bacterial and viral infections, vitamin deficiencies, age-related diseases, diabetes and zzso alcohol and tobacco zzso 

zzso present in the signaling pathways triggered by zzso stress can be targets for therapeutic zzso
