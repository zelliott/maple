Application of differential display to the comparison of zzso and zzso human prostate zzso cell line zzso identified zzso induction of the zzso zzso which encodes an zzso protein zzso Further investigation demonstrated that zzso expression in zzso cells is zzso by both zzso and zzso This induction of expression is detected as early as 2 hours after addition of steroids to the cell zzso zzso expression is also detected in other prostate zzso cell lines by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction and zzso but not in the single normal adult prostate zzso cell line that is available to zzso Analysis of multiple primary zzso tumor zzso as well as normal and tumor zzso of the same prostate zzso showed that tumor zzso exhibit a higher level of expression as compared with the normal zzso zzso study using zzso zzso on normal and zzso prostate zzso showed a very striking difference in the zzso zzso Positive zzso was seen in the zzso zzso in normal zzso but not in the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, strong zzso was seen predominantly within the zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the expression of zzso in zzso zzso cells is linked to the zzso state and that, once expressed in zzso its expression is regulated by steroid hormone zzso
