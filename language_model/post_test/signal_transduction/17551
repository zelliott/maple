A1 zzso receptors in coated zzso have been characterized by zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso experiments with the zzso zzso zzso gave a zzso value of zzso zzso and a zzso value of 82 zzso 13 zzso zzso For the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso value of zzso zzso and a zzso value of 72 zzso 29 zzso protein was zzso Competition of zzso for zzso binding gave a pharmacological profile with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is identical to brain zzso The competition zzso were best fitted according to a zzso model, suggesting the existence of two affinity zzso zzso shifted the competition curve for zzso to the right and only one affinity state similar to the low affinity state in the absence of zzso was zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso a single protein with an apparent molecular weight of 35,000 in coated zzso which is identical to A1 receptors zzso in brain zzso zzso coated zzso contain A1 zzso receptors with similar binding characteristics as zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data suggest that A1 receptors in these zzso are not a processed zzso zzso These results confirm that A1 receptors in coated zzso are coupled to a zzso and it appears that the A1 zzso systems in coated zzso and in plasma zzso are zzso
