While there is circumstantial evidence to suggest a requirement for zzso zzso zzso in zzso reorganization and cell migration, few studies have examined the direct mechanisms that link regulators of the zzso zzso with this crucial signaling zzso This study was aimed to examine the role that zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso play in migration in zzso and zzso zzso cell lines that zzso or zzso express human zzso zzso as well as zzso growth factor zzso cell migration was accompanied by zzso zzso of zzso and its association with zzso zzso of zzso zzso prevented zzso complex formation as well as zzso cell zzso The absolute requirement for zzso in zzso cell migration was demonstrated by measuring cell zzso in zzso cells and by zzso of zzso zzso zzso direct interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso domain 2 domain of zzso at the plasma membrane was demonstrated in living cells by using zzso resonance energy zzso These results demonstrate that zzso provides an important link between the zzso of zzso signal zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso
