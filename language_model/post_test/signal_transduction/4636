The provision of T cell zzso via members of the zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso provides critical signals that promote T cell survival and zzso Recent studies have demonstrated that zzso of zzso can augment T zzso zzso immunity in zzso models and more importantly, zzso zzso are under clinical development for cancer zzso zzso is of particular interest as a therapeutic target as it is not expressed on zzso T cells but rather, is zzso zzso following zzso zzso Although zzso engagement is necessary for inducing zzso zzso the downstream signals that regulate zzso itself remain zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso expression is regulated through a zzso and common gamma chain zzso signaling cascade that requires zzso zzso of the downstream zzso factors zzso and zzso Furthermore, combined treatment with an zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso tumor zzso against multiple tumor zzso zzso therapy was also able to restore the function of zzso zzso zzso T cells in mice with long-term well-established zzso zzso tumors, leading to increased survival of the zzso zzso Together, these data reveal the ability of zzso gamma chain zzso signaling to regulate zzso expression and demonstrate a novel means of zzso cancer zzso by providing dual zzso gamma chain zzso zzso
