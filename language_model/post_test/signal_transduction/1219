The zzso zzso zzso has been shown to function in different skeletal muscle zzso The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of endurance training on the functioning of the zzso in the zzso The experiments were carried out on two groups of male zzso zzso sedentary and trained for six zzso zzso after zzso of the training rats were zzso and samples of the zzso red and white section of the zzso were zzso The content and composition of zzso acids and zzso - fatty acids was determined by means of zzso zzso The content of zzso and zzso was determined by means of zzso liquid zzso The activity of neutral zzso zzso was determined zzso using zzso as the zzso It has been found that training reduces the total content of zzso and zzso zzso increases the content of zzso and does not affect the content of zzso in individual muscle zzso The activity of the zzso in the muscles is also zzso It is concluded that training affects functioning of the zzso zzso zzso in skeletal zzso The reduction in the content of zzso may contribute to zzso in zzso zzso in skeletal muscles observed after zzso
