A common property of signal zzso systems is that they rapidly lose their ability to respond to a given zzso For instance in zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is activated and zzso within minutes, even when the zzso stimulus is zzso 

Here, we used a combination of experimental and zzso analyses to investigate the dynamic behavior of zzso zzso in zzso zzso modeling suggested that a zzso loop operates early in the zzso and leads to rapid zzso of zzso zzso Experimental analysis revealed that the zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso and that zzso occurs on zzso Moreover, zzso exists in a zzso complex, and zzso by zzso promotes a transition from the zzso to zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso diminishes the formation of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso growth in zzso or zzso zzso 

These findings reveal a novel zzso feedback loop leading to diminished cellular responses to an zzso zzso
