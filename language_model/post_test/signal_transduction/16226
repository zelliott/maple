In plants and animals, the zzso family of receptors perceives zzso and zzso molecules inside host cells and mediates innate immune responses to microbial zzso Despite their similar biological functions and protein architecture, animal zzso are normally activated by zzso zzso or zzso molecular patterns, whereas plant zzso typically detect zzso pathogen zzso Plant zzso recognize either the zzso structure or zzso modifications of host zzso The latter indirect mechanism for the perception of zzso as well as the zzso diversification of plant zzso maximize the capacity to recognize zzso through the use of a finite number of innate zzso We discuss recent insights into zzso zzso signal initiation through the zzso association of zzso zzso and zzso zzso dynamics in plants and compare those with zzso functions in zzso
