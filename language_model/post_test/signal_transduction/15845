A series of pharmacological and zzso studies have demonstrated the functional zzso between zzso and zzso These receptors coexist at zzso sites in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an area implicated in the zzso effects of zzso like zzso In this study, we found that the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso is essential for maintaining the connection between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso tolerance is prevented and even rescued by zzso zzso or by zzso zzso However, in the absence of zzso the zzso becomes zzso to zzso before suffering a profound and lasting zzso that is zzso to zzso zzso or zzso zzso Thus, zzso emerges as a key protein that is critical for sustaining zzso regulation of zzso signaling zzso Thus, zzso zzso may contribute to zzso pain syndromes by causing long-term zzso zzso via mechanisms independent of zzso
