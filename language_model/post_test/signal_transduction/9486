zzso agents are commonly used as zzso zzso Unfortunately, such drugs induced DNA damages as well as DNA repair are important in zzso drug resistance to cancer zzso To evaluate changes in DNA repair proteins that occur in DNA damage agent treatment, we challenged human zzso lung zzso cells with zzso zzso an accessory protein involved in zzso repair zzso at an early zzso step, was zzso by zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso zzso was accompanied by an increase in zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso interference decreased DNA repair activity, cell survival, and induction of zzso and zzso following treatment with zzso zzso zzso of zzso enhanced repair activity towards zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways attenuated zzso zzso zzso indicating that these pathways are involved in the zzso The increase in zzso protein expression zzso by zzso signaling was due to increased zzso efficiency resulting from zzso of the zzso factor zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso increases in zzso levels are regulated by zzso signaling pathways and important for DNA zzso
