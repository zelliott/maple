Local circuits in the spinal zzso that generate locomotion are termed central pattern generators zzso These provide coordinated bilateral control over the normal limb zzso that zzso zzso The molecules that organize the zzso zzso are zzso zzso spinal cords from mice lacking either the zzso zzso or its zzso zzso have lost zzso limb zzso and instead exhibit zzso We identified zzso zzso as an zzso component of the locomotor zzso Our study shows that dramatic locomotor changes can occur as a consequence of local genetic zzso and identifies genes required for the development of normal locomotor zzso
