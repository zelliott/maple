zzso dysfunction is associated with diverse cardiovascular zzso Here, we show a previously unappreciated role for the zzso zzso family zzso zzso and zzso in zzso function and the regulation of zzso factor pathways important for vascular zzso zzso zzso deletion in zzso mice led to late-stage embryonic and zzso zzso with zzso mice displaying focal loss of zzso and tissue zzso Loss of zzso zzso led to increased zzso cell zzso both in zzso and in zzso contributing to vascular dysfunction, zzso and tissue zzso zzso we identify a unique dual role for zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso cell zzso These findings reveal a critical requirement for the zzso zzso in vascular development and function, which may have important implications for the clinical use of zzso zzso zzso
