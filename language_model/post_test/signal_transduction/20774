zzso zzso zzso zzso for the alpha zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso were prepared and the distribution of A alpha 1 and A alpha 2 zzso has been studied in rat brain using in zzso zzso zzso Clear regional differences have been observed for the A alpha 1 and A alpha 2 zzso The zzso form, A alpha 1, was found to be zzso expressed in the zzso zzso the zzso cell layer of the zzso specific cortical cell zzso the zzso zzso cell layer and some other brain zzso On the other hand, the A alpha 2 zzso although being generally less abundant than A alpha 1, gave an intense zzso signal in the zzso zzso of the zzso and was the major transcript in the amygdala, the superior and the inferior zzso the central gray matter and the zzso zzso These regional differences might reflect specific functions exerted by the two alternatively spliced zzso in the zzso and opens the perspective of interfering with defined zzso signal zzso pathways using zzso zzso
