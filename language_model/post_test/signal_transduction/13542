zzso The effect of zzso on zzso turnover in rat zzso was investigated by measuring the generation of zzso zzso following zzso zzso zzso In the presence of 10 zzso zzso zzso caused zzso increases in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were zzso at zzso zzso zzso The zzso relationship was similar in right and left zzso but right zzso showed a higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produced a rapid and transient stimulation of zzso zzso zzso which peaked at 15 s followed by a slower increase which continued zzso past 20 zzso zzso The time course of zzso zzso release under zzso stimulation showed a similar profile but the maximum stimulation was smaller than zzso zzso As with zzso responses to zzso also were higher in right zzso compared with left zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso receptors in rat zzso are coupled to the stimulation of the zzso turnover zzso in an essentially similar manner to alpha zzso The zzso zzso may be important in zzso the reported cardiac actions of zzso
