zzso zzso 3 zzso a newly identified soluble protein belonging to the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso is a zzso for zzso zzso zzso LIGHT and zzso It has been demonstrated that zzso is frequently zzso by zzso tumors arising from zzso gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Recently, we demonstrated that zzso is able to zzso the differentiation and zzso of zzso cells zzso and that zzso zzso skew zzso T cell differentiation towards a zzso zzso In this study, we further demonstrate that zzso is able to induce zzso reorganization and enhance the zzso of zzso and zzso cells by zzso multiple signaling zzso such as protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso focal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This provides the first evidence that the soluble zzso like other immobilized members of zzso zzso is able to trigger zzso zzso to zzso cell zzso
