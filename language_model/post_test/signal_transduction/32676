The ability to detect changes in load is important for effective use of a leg in posture and zzso While a number of limb receptors have been shown to zzso increases in load, few zzso have been demonstrated to signal leg zzso which occurs zzso during walking and is indicative of slipping or zzso We applied mechanical forces to the zzso leg at controlled rates and recorded activities of the zzso group of zzso zzso zzso that zzso forces through the strains they produce in the zzso zzso responses were zzso from the group to decreasing as well as increasing levels of leg zzso zzso of individual zzso depended on the direction of force application, and unit responses were correlated zzso with the orientation of the zzso zzso zzso No units responded zzso Although zzso to decreasing levels of load were zzso we found that these bursts could effectively zzso the rate of force zzso These zzso may be important in indicating leg unloading in the step cycle during walking and could rapidly signal force decreases during zzso or loss of ground zzso
