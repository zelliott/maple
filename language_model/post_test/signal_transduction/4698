Plant growth and development are strongly affected by small differences in zzso Current climate change has already altered global plant zzso and distribution, and projected increases in temperature pose a significant challenge to zzso Despite the important role of temperature on plant development, the underlying pathways are zzso It has previously been shown that zzso acceleration of flowering is dependent on the zzso zzso zzso T zzso How this occurs is, however, not zzso because the major zzso known to zzso zzso the zzso pathway, is not required for zzso acceleration of zzso Here we demonstrate a direct mechanism by which increasing temperature causes the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso to activate zzso Our findings provide a new understanding of how plants control their timing of reproduction in response to zzso zzso time is an important trait in crops as well as affecting the life cycles of zzso zzso A molecular understanding of how temperature affects flowering will be important for zzso the effects of climate zzso
