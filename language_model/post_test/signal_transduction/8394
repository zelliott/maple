The recognition and pairing of specific DNA zzso though crucial for a plenty of important cellular zzso are produced by still mysterious physical zzso We propose the first quantitative model from zzso zzso able to clarify the interaction allowing such zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which bind some DNA recognition zzso produce an effective attraction between distant DNA zzso if their zzso their zzso and the relative DNA binding sites number exceed given zzso DNA zzso occurs as a result of a zzso phase zzso In this paper, after a concise report on some of the most recent experimental results, we introduce our model and carry out a detailed zzso zzso analysis of it, by means of zzso Carlo zzso Our studies, while zzso several experimental zzso result in very interesting and testable zzso
