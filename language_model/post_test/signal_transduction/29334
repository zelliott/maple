zzso gastric acid zzso involves a transient zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso A zzso cascade through zzso the actions of which ultimately result in the fusion of zzso containing zzso zzso zzso to the zzso plasma membrane of zzso zzso To dissect the signaling events underlying gastric acid zzso we have developed a zzso gastric zzso model using zzso O zzso The advantage of this model is its ability to retain zzso components that are required for the zzso machinery while granting accessibility for the introduction of zzso into the zzso Our studies showed that acid zzso in zzso zzso is a zzso process and involves the recruitment of zzso zzso into the zzso plasma membrane as judged by zzso zzso These studies established a functional zzso zzso model in which the zzso transition can be triggered by second zzso while the manipulation of the zzso environment can be achieved with zzso
