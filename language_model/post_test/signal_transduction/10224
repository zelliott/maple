Both zzso and normal prostate zzso cells produce zzso zzso a critical factor in prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso a key component of the zzso signaling pathway, is also implicated in zzso progression via zzso cell factor zzso zzso We recently demonstrated that zzso regulates zzso of zzso in colon cancer zzso In the present study, we found that zzso specifically bound to and activated the zzso promoter in zzso in human zzso cells and mouse prostate zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells was zzso by knocking down zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling significantly elevated expression of zzso in zzso zzso In addition, genetic zzso of zzso significantly inhibited zzso of zzso in primary prostate zzso zzso Meanwhile, zzso zzso enhanced zzso signaling and zzso expression in zzso cells, which was blocked by both selective zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of either zzso or zzso substantially reduced cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, which largely were rescued by treatment with zzso zzso Together, our results suggest that zzso signaling zzso activates zzso in zzso zzso meanwhile, zzso enhances zzso signaling and in turn further increases zzso expression in a zzso zzso The positive zzso between zzso signaling and zzso signaling zzso proliferation and survival of zzso cells, thereby representing a novel mechanism that contributes to zzso zzso
