zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso that target zzso and zzso zzso a zzso agent that incorporates both zzso allows zzso binding of zzso receptors and zzso This study was designed to characterize zzso forms of these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for inflammation zzso 

The zzso zzso were labeled with zzso by a direct approach via zzso zzso reduction at various zzso zzso zzso In zzso inflammation targeting studies were carried out in a mouse ear zzso model created by topical application of zzso zzso on the right ear of zzso zzso 

zzso yields increased with increasing amounts of zzso When the zzso ratio reached zzso the zzso yield was greater than zzso without significant zzso zzso zzso ears showed high zzso zzso which was clearly detected by zzso and zzso zzso The activities zzso in the inflamed and control ears at zzso after injection were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed significantly higher zzso in the inflamed ears compared to zzso and IF zzso zzso study results indicated specificity of zzso binding with decreased radioactive zzso in the inflamed zzso Western zzso and zzso analysis further confirmed a high expression of zzso and zzso in the inflamed zzso 

zzso zzso zzso are a promising approach for detecting and understanding the inflammatory zzso zzso may be more useful than the zzso zzso for zzso detection of inflammatory zzso
