Recent molecular cloning of the zzso sodium channel zzso provides the opportunity to identify zzso proteins that function in regulating its cell surface expression and zzso We have examined whether zzso is associated with zzso zzso protein zzso and the zzso membrane zzso in zzso A6 zzso zzso zzso We have also addressed whether zzso is required for the expression of zzso zzso currents by cloned zzso zzso density zzso zzso of A6 cell zzso extracts showed zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of proteins zzso under high stringency conditions from peak zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate that zzso zzso and zzso are associated in a zzso zzso To examine whether zzso is required for the functional expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso into zzso zzso with zzso sense or zzso zzso The zzso zzso clamp technique showed there was a marked reduction in zzso current in zzso zzso with zzso zzso when to compared with zzso zzso with sense zzso These studies indicate that zzso is associated in a zzso complex with zzso and zzso in A6 cells and suggest that zzso is required for the functional expression of zzso in zzso zzso
