The zzso signaling zzso plays a critical role in cell proliferation and zzso It has been found to be chronically activated in a variety of human zzso including head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso Previously, we have found that the zzso of the zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we extended our studies to determine whether the zzso signaling zzso inhibited death zzso zzso in zzso zzso We found that zzso inhibited not only tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso but also cell zzso zzso zzso which is dependent on the death zzso signaling zzso Interestingly, we also observed that the zzso signaling zzso induced zzso cell scattering and promoted cell invasion in the zzso both of which are hallmarks for the invasive growth of zzso zzso the zzso of zzso promoted zzso tumor growth in nude zzso Taken together, our results suggest that the zzso signaling zzso plays dual functions in zzso development: promoting both cell survival and invasive growth of zzso zzso
