Alzheimer's disease zzso is characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive dysfunction that probably due to a deficit in synaptic zzso One member of zzso zzso zzso factor zzso is known to be involved in the zzso long-term zzso zzso a cellular model for learning and zzso Moreover, zzso zzso gene zzso an immediate early zzso is found to be a downstream zzso of the zzso signaling zzso zzso of Arc protein synthesis zzso both the maintenance of zzso and the consolidation of long-term zzso In addition, the formation of senile plaques is a pathological feature in zzso and mainly consists of the deposition of zzso zzso a zzso product of zzso precursor zzso Several studies concerning zzso performance have suggested that zzso at zzso levels interfere with the signaling zzso critical for synaptic plasticity and thus lead to the cognitive impairment in early stage of zzso Whether the zzso Arc synthesis is impaired by zzso zzso in early zzso is still zzso zzso in the present study, primary cultures of zzso rat cortical zzso were used to evaluate the effect of zzso zzso on the zzso Arc protein zzso zzso with the literature, zzso an indicator of synaptic zzso was induced by zzso zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso After treating cultures with zzso zzso (5 zzso a significant suppression was observed on the level of zzso Arc protein zzso This result indicates that zzso at zzso level zzso the zzso signaling in cortical zzso and thus zzso the deficits of synaptic plasticity occurred at the early stage of zzso before significant zzso zzso
