zzso growth factor zzso zzso plays a key role in early embryonic development and cell migration in zzso and in zzso To gain novel insights into zzso zzso in an zzso we characterized the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso that is not represented in the zzso zzso We found that zzso dependent zzso organizes the anterior to zzso axis of the early zzso The loss of zzso function in zzso by zzso interference resulted in the reduction of the zzso zzso fate, in an anterior shift of embryonic fate and in the loss or zzso of anterior embryonic zzso Without intact zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso did not undergo zzso movements and remained zzso localized throughout zzso Only zzso affected zzso developed into a zzso that show zzso curved bodies with head defects and a zzso zzso Except for the zzso zzso zzso the overall zzso of the zzso axis seemed zzso Moreover, zzso zzso was not required for the onset of zzso formation but for zzso this tissue during later zzso We also show that in affected zzso the zzso zzso was expanded and expressed zzso at a higher zzso We conclude that in the zzso zzso zzso zzso organizes patterning along the zzso and also balances the expression level of zzso in the zzso zzso a tissue critically involved in zzso zzso
