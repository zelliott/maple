It has been shown that zzso zzso which is consistently zzso in human zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in zzso of zzso However, the underlying mechanism remains zzso Here, we demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells induced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso During zzso stress, zzso enhances the unfolded protein response, promotes zzso recovery from zzso repression, and thereby zzso cell's ability to cope with the stress zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso protein 78 zzso a key zzso zzso zzso which subsequently enhances the zzso folding capacity and promotes recovery from zzso zzso We also demonstrated that zzso increases zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso and zzso nuclear factor zzso B zzso zzso under zzso stress, which in turn contributes to zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, at least in part, by enhancing the zzso response and zzso zzso We propose that zzso has potential implications for zzso progression under the zzso stress zzso
