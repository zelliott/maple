Treatment of rat zzso zzso cells with a zzso zzso leads to a rise in zzso level and a subsequent change in cell zzso from an zzso to an zzso type of zzso This zzso change is reverted by the addition of zzso In zzso zzso the cells acquire their normal zzso zzso The zzso by zzso is inhibited by zzso but not by zzso III (an inhibitor of the zzso action of zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso we observed that the addition of zzso to the zzso cells generated a zzso which was inhibited by zzso of the cells with zzso or with 1 zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso uses the zzso zzso to counteract the zzso response, which was induced by zzso of the zzso zzso
