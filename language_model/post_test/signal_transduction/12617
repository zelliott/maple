The zzso systems zzso or zzso zzso are zzso zzso common signal zzso mechanisms that are implicated in a wide variety of cellular responses to environmental stimuli in both zzso and zzso including zzso Among higher plants, zzso including zzso zzso have a unique ability to engage in beneficial zzso with zzso zzso We previously presented a zzso compiled list of zzso components of zzso zzso which is a zzso specific to zzso zzso zzso et zzso 2004, DNA zzso 11, zzso To gain both general and specific insights into zzso of this currently attractive model zzso here we compiled zzso components as many as possible from a zzso viewpoint by taking advantage that the efforts of whole zzso sequencing of zzso zzso are almost at final zzso In the current database zzso it was found that zzso zzso has, at least, 14 genes each zzso a zzso zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso response regulator zzso zzso 11 zzso zzso zzso and also 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggested that most of the zzso zzso zzso genes have already been uncovered in this zzso analysis, if not zzso Here, characteristics of these zzso components of zzso zzso were inspected, one by one, in comparison with those of zzso zzso In addition, some critical experiments were also done to gain further insights into the functions of zzso zzso zzso genes with special reference to zzso signal zzso and zzso zzso
