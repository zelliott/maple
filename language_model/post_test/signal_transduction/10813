The zzso function of zzso recently has been exploited as a therapeutic advantage for cancer zzso agents zzso the zzso activity of zzso are shown to prevent zzso zzso To explore the mechanisms of zzso protection from zzso zzso we have established stable clones of zzso lung zzso cells expressing a zzso zzso zzso zzso At the zzso temperature of 32 degrees C, the zzso cells were arrested in zzso phase without the occurrence of zzso consistent with this is the preferential induction of genes related to growth arrest and DNA damage zzso Previous expression of functional zzso for zzso or zzso hours inhibited the release of zzso molecules from zzso and protected the cells from zzso zzso moreover, it suppressed the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling and relieved the effect of zzso on zzso target gene zzso zzso associated with zzso and inhibited its zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso cells, we showed that zzso of zzso blocked the zzso zzso death signaling and zzso zzso Our results suggest that the ability of zzso to bind and zzso zzso together with the zzso of the zzso target genes related to cell cycle arrest and DNA damage repair, is responsible for its protection of cells against zzso zzso
