zzso oxygen zzso generated by zzso kill bacteria and are implicated in inflammatory tissue injury, but precise molecular targets are zzso We demonstrate that zzso use zzso zzso to convert zzso zzso of zzso zzso coli to zzso zzso in high zzso zzso deficient in individual components of the zzso system zzso zzso zzso exhibited impaired zzso activity and impaired capacity to zzso zzso zzso the principal zzso product of the zzso system, is a highly efficient zzso for zzso and its zzso effects were found to zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso in bacterial zzso and inner membrane zzso In contrast, outer envelope proteins were initially oxidized without associated zzso zzso zzso of bacterial zzso zzso repair systems rendered zzso coli more susceptible to killing by zzso whereas zzso of a repair zzso zzso zzso zzso A, rendered them zzso suggesting a direct role for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso among oxidized bacterial proteins were those engaged in synthesis and zzso of peptides to the cell zzso an essential zzso zzso Moreover, zzso impaired protein zzso early in the course of bacterial zzso Together, our findings indicate that zzso zzso zzso contributes to bacterial killing by zzso The findings further suggest that protein zzso to the cell envelope is one important zzso targeted for zzso
