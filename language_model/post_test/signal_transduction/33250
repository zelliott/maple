We compared conducted zzso responses in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and spontaneously zzso rats zzso The goals of the study were as zzso 1) decide whether zzso zzso is facilitated by conducted zzso zzso 2) determine whether the magnitude of induced zzso decreases with increasing distance from the stimulation zzso and 3) determine whether the response is stronger in zzso than in zzso zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso caused local zzso that was rapidly conducted zzso zzso zzso zzso into the cortical zzso artery and neighboring zzso zzso in zzso and zzso The strength of the response was significantly greater zzso zzso P zzso zzso in zzso than zzso and the magnitude decreased zzso with increasing distance from the stimulation site in both zzso Mechanical length zzso were similar in zzso and zzso zzso 325 zzso indicating that the signal responsible for the effect zzso at the same rate in both zzso We conclude that zzso zzso strength is significantly greater in zzso and that zzso zzso is due to vascular events conducted along the zzso zzso
