zzso OF zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso is a master regulator of systemic acquired resistance zzso zzso is induced by salicylic acid zzso leading to the expression of zzso zzso zzso Current evidence suggests that zzso is part of a zzso complex zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso elements in zzso gene promoters through zzso zzso factors, and that zzso zzso gene expression is regulated by zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso is active only after zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity has been proposed to comprise zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange, and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso does not zzso these zzso To understand the function of tobacco zzso we zzso its zzso capabilities in a zzso system: zzso zzso zzso differs from zzso zzso in its zzso zzso and its zzso zzso Yet, both tobacco and zzso zzso as well as tobacco zzso alter some of their zzso activities in response to zzso Whereas the addition of zzso to zzso growth medium zzso zzso activity in tobacco zzso its interaction with zzso proteins is zzso The effects of zzso are specific, sensitive and occur zzso They are abolished completely by zzso of the zzso zzso within the zzso zzso acid motif zzso as present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso proteins with the zzso domain zzso zzso a broad and strongly zzso zzso binding zzso Our data suggest that zzso and some zzso proteins are sensitive to the plant hormone zzso altering some of their zzso capabilities to enable zzso gene zzso The sensitivity of zzso proteins to zzso together with their differential interaction with diverse zzso zzso seems a plausible molecular basis for the timely and coordinated zzso of zzso genes during zzso
