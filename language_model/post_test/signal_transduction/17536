The role of zzso zzso zzso regulatory proteins zzso zzso in the signal zzso processes involved in zzso vascular alpha zzso zzso has been investigated in the zzso rat using two chemical classes of zzso zzso the zzso and zzso in order to determine if they zzso different signal zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 days prior to zzso slightly inhibited the zzso response to the full alpha zzso zzso of the zzso class zzso (in the presence of zzso 1 zzso zzso whereas it markedly inhibited the zzso response to the partial alpha zzso zzso of the zzso class zzso (in the presence of zzso 1 zzso zzso However, after elimination of the alpha zzso reserve for zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso response to this zzso became sensitive to zzso by zzso toxin zzso The pattern of zzso of alpha zzso zzso responses produced by zzso toxin was similar to that produced by the calcium channel zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso The results support the hypothesis that vascular alpha zzso may be coupled to a G protein which is sensitive to zzso toxin and which couples the alpha zzso to the influx of zzso zzso which possibly another G protein that is insensitive to zzso toxin that couples the alpha zzso to the release of zzso zzso The intrinsic efficacy of the zzso and not its chemical class, determines which signal zzso mechanisms will be zzso
