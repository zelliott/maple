The zzso zzso zzso region 2 binds to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso may interact with zzso molecules and zzso proteins for zzso proteins (the small zzso proteins related to zzso The recently cloned zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso composed entirely of zzso and zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which communicates between a zzso protein zzso zzso and a Ras zzso In the present study the function of zzso was investigated by zzso cells with an zzso zzso The zzso abolished both S phase entry and the reorganization of zzso assembly to ruffle formation upon stimulation with zzso growth factor zzso and zzso growth factor zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso had no effect on S phase entry or zzso stress fiber formation induced by either serum or zzso zzso Since the induction of DNA zzso ruffle induction and stress fiber formation involve a function of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, the findings strongly suggest that Ash plays a critical role in the signaling of both pathways downstream from growth factor receptors to Ras and zzso zzso with this, Ash zzso with zzso zzso from zzso zzso Other proteins of approximately 21, 29, 135 and 160 zzso were also detected in the zzso zzso zzso suggesting a role of Ash as a zzso zzso in signal zzso downstream of growth factor zzso
