After lengthy exploration of zzso zzso zzso were defined as compounds that inhibit plant zzso and zzso responses and the polar transport of the hormone zzso Their common structural theme is that zzso acid is zzso to a second aromatic ring zzso zzso acid zzso is a zzso zzso but zzso acid is the most active synthetic zzso Not all polar zzso transport zzso zzso are zzso as zzso zzso acid and the zzso such as zzso acid are the best established zzso zzso can bind to the zzso zzso which is located on the plasma zzso This leads to zzso of an zzso zzso carrier that is considered to play a fundamental role in polar zzso The molecular properties of the zzso zzso are not fully zzso and the mechanism of its interaction with the zzso carrier is not zzso zzso mapping has indicated that the two aromatic ring structures of zzso may have zzso binding zzso oriented at an angle of about 110 zzso The question arises of whether there are zzso regulators of zzso transport that act via the zzso zzso Recent evidence suggests that certain zzso zzso zzso compounds, such as the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso are candidates for such a zzso They have zzso effects on zzso and polar zzso transport and can inhibit zzso binding to the zzso zzso studies showed that simple zzso like zzso and zzso acids are not zzso the active zzso appear to require zzso groups on both A and B rings of the zzso structure, linked by a zzso zzso The only exceptions so far found to a generally good correlation between binding and transport effects are the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso where the B ring is moved from C2 to zzso of the central zzso zzso Both these compounds are more active as zzso binding zzso Only zzso and not zzso zzso are zzso zzso are widely distributed in plants and are present in zzso capable of polar zzso zzso Their synthesis is under environmental control, as is zzso zzso
