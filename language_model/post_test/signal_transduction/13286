zzso zzso coli zzso is a zzso member of the family of related zzso and zzso zzso pathogens that induce zzso disease, especially to the young that can be zzso of a wide range of zzso zzso Disease is correlated with the loss of zzso gut zzso zzso and the zzso of host zzso proteins into zzso structures beneath the adherent zzso These zzso are dependent on a zzso island zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso a type III zzso system, zzso zzso zzso zzso regulatory proteins and the bacterial outer membrane protein zzso The type III zzso apparatus directs the transfer of specific proteins across the bacterial zzso with a subset zzso zzso proteins - zzso zzso and zzso functioning to transfer zzso proteins into host zzso These zzso molecules zzso cellular processes that undoubtedly benefit the pathogen and contribute to zzso Three zzso zzso zzso molecules have so far been identified with one, zzso zzso zzso zzso being transferred into host cells where it is modified by host zzso and becomes inserted into the plasma membrane to orchestrate zzso zzso linked to zzso This activity is dependent on its interaction with zzso and on zzso zzso with zzso interaction essential for zzso A second zzso zzso zzso zzso is targeted to zzso where it has zzso zzso zzso The third, zzso zzso zzso barrier function and can induce host cell death by unknown zzso Recent data relating to the mechanism by which zzso and zzso function within host cells is zzso
