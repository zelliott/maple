zzso are critical participants in zzso development and function, but their role in synaptic plasticity is zzso zzso receptors and their zzso zzso have been suggested to regulate zzso zzso and zzso zzso reverse signaling is required for synaptic plasticity in the zzso Here we show that long-term zzso zzso at the zzso zzso is modulated by zzso in the zzso zzso cell and by zzso a zzso of zzso that is found in zzso Lack of zzso increased the abundance of zzso zzso zzso and zzso modulated zzso currents in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso rescued the zzso defects in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso reduces zzso zzso levels and produces focal zzso zzso possibly caused by zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso signaling is a critical mechanism for zzso to regulate synaptic function and zzso
