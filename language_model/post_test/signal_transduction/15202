zzso experiments produce expression patterns for thousands of genes at zzso On the other hand, biomedical literature contains large amounts of gene regulation relationship information accumulated over the zzso One obvious requirement is an automated way of comparing zzso data with the collection of known gene regulation zzso Such an automated comparison is imperative because it can help biologists rapidly understand the context of a given zzso zzso In addition, the consistency measure can be used to either validate or zzso the hypothesis being tested using the zzso zzso In this paper we present a systematic way of examining the consistency between a given set of zzso data and known gene regulation zzso We first introduce a simple gene regulation network model with two separate zzso designed to isolate a zzso consistent zzso zzso we extend the model to take into account multiple regulating factors for a single gene while highlighting both zzso and zzso We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach with two practical examples, one that picks the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as highly consistent from multiple pathways of zzso encyclopedia of genes and zzso zzso and another that zzso key regulatory relationships involving zzso and others known for zzso counter response to zzso
