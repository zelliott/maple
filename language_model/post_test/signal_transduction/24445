zzso of zzso zzso zzso on mast cells and zzso leads to zzso and increased activity of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso We investigated the roles of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso motifs zzso on the beta and gamma zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso itself in the zzso of zzso Our approach was to build a detailed mathematical model of reactions involving zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso that zzso zzso We applied the model to experiments in which zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulate rat zzso leukemia zzso The model makes it possible to test the consistency of zzso assumptions with data that alone provide limited zzso zzso For example, the model helps sort out mechanisms that jointly control zzso of zzso zzso In addition, interpreted in the context of the model, zzso observed differences between the zzso and zzso with respect to levels of zzso and rates of zzso indicate that most cellular zzso but only a small fraction of zzso is available to interact with zzso We also show that although the beta zzso acts to amplify signaling in experimental systems where its role has been investigated, there are conditions under which the beta zzso will act as an zzso
