A series of T cell lines zzso to zzso express zzso envelope zzso zzso were analyzed for viability and for T cell zzso One zzso was distinguished by its stable expression of zzso and zzso whereas the remainder of the T cell lines were similar to previously reported zzso T cells in zzso predominantly zzso zzso zzso zzso All of the zzso were additionally constructed to express zzso and rev zzso None of these cell lines displayed growth abnormalities or spontaneous cell fusion, although the cell line zzso zzso zzso could be induced to fuse and die when zzso with a second cell expressing surface zzso A cell line expressing only zzso and the zzso expressing zzso zzso and zzso could be triggered normally via zzso as measured by protein zzso zzso and by the induction of the zzso zzso zzso At levels of zzso protein expression sufficient to mediate zzso formation and to kill cells, these zzso zzso zzso displayed no intrinsic T cell signaling zzso suggesting that mechanisms other than a direct zzso action of the zzso or zzso proteins may be contributing to the deficit in zzso T cell zzso described subsequent to zzso infection in zzso and in zzso
