The retinal determination gene zzso is zzso related to the family of zzso zzso and influences the development of a wide range of zzso including the embryonic head, zzso zzso brain, central nervous system as well as the zzso leg, wing, zzso and zzso zzso We were interested in the regulatory mechanisms that control the dynamic expression pattern of zzso and in this report we set out to ascertain how the zzso of zzso is modulated in the embryonic head and developing zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso signaling zzso the zzso factor zzso and several other patterning genes prevent zzso from being expressed inappropriately within the embryonic zzso Additionally, we show that several members of the eye zzso cascade influence the zzso of zzso during normal and zzso eye zzso Our results suggest that zzso is regulated by a complex zzso code of zzso factors and signaling zzso zzso this code may lead to an understanding of how zzso regulates the development of many diverse tissue types including the zzso
