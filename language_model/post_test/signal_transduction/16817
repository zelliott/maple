The distribution of zzso zzso zzso zzso in most zzso species shows remarkably constant zzso in zzso species such as humans, an zzso tends to implant in the zzso zzso in zzso species such as zzso zzso implant evenly along the zzso zzso These long-time evolved patterns bear great biological significance because disruption of these patterns can have adverse effects on zzso However, lack of suitable models and in zzso monitoring techniques has zzso the progress in understanding the mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso These obstacles are being overcome by genetically engineered mouse models and newly developed high-resolution zzso It has been revealed that zzso zzso distribution involves multiple events including zzso sensing of an zzso fine-tuned zzso zzso movements, zzso zzso fluid zzso and zzso zzso closure, as well as zzso zzso zzso molecular factors, such as steroid hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channels, and potentially embryonic signaling are actively involved in zzso zzso zzso This review covers the zzso and molecular aspects of zzso zzso distribution zzso spacing at the zzso axis and zzso orientation at the vertical zzso as well as its zzso roles in human zzso zzso Future progress requires zzso research efforts that will integrate in zzso animal models, clinical cases, zzso relevant in zzso models, and zzso zzso zzso the mechanisms for zzso zzso distribution could potentially lead to development of zzso for treating related conditions in zzso zzso
