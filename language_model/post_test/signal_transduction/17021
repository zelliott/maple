zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling plays crucial functions in the regulation of zzso development, including zzso Here, we have identified zzso tissue growth factor zzso as a downstream target of the zzso signaling zzso in zzso The pattern of zzso expression in zzso zzso suggests that it may be involved in key processes during zzso zzso We found that zzso expression is zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression is associated with zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso whereas loss of function of zzso itself leads to zzso of zzso zzso We also found that zzso regulates its own expression via zzso zzso zzso zzso mice exhibit a zzso in cell proliferation similar to that of zzso zzso mice, as well as zzso zzso We detected no zzso in bone zzso protein zzso downstream targets in zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the reduction in cell proliferation is due to defective zzso of zzso signaling via decreased zzso zzso zzso an zzso source of zzso was able to rescue the cell proliferation zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso regulates proliferation as a zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso signaling during zzso
