zzso of microbial challenges leads to enhanced immunity at both the local and systemic zzso In zzso zzso and zzso act as the zzso for the bacterial zzso factor zzso zzso zzso and for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso has been described to mediate zzso zzso following microbial zzso Here we show that zzso induction upon pathogen challenges is robust against zzso zzso or zzso zzso Comparative zzso profiling between zzso and zzso plants points to zzso of otherwise zzso zzso and zzso immune branches as a key output of zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso against zzso zzso systemic immunity is reduced in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induction is essentially restricted to the pathogen challenge sites during zzso systemic zzso zzso zzso application activates genetically zzso zzso and zzso branches in systemic leaves without significant zzso zzso Our results suggest that local zzso zzso provides a critical step in connecting local to systemic immunity by reinforcing separate zzso zzso zzso
