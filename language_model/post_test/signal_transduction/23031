zzso family zzso have been implicated in the regulation of the zzso zzso in response to zzso cues and in the zzso of signals from the membrane to the zzso Their role in development and cell zzso however, is little zzso Here we show that the transient expression of zzso active zzso and zzso in zzso avian zzso is sufficient to cause zzso of zzso expression and block of the transition to the zzso zzso whereas activated zzso affects zzso differentiation only zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso appears not to be essential for block of differentiation because, although zzso and zzso zzso modestly activate zzso in quail zzso a zzso zzso defective for zzso zzso can still inhibit zzso zzso zzso expression of active zzso attained by infection with a zzso zzso is zzso for terminal zzso but the resulting zzso accumulate severely reduced levels of zzso zzso This zzso is the consequence of zzso events and suggests the presence of a novel level of regulation of zzso We also show that zzso expressing zzso active zzso fail to assemble ordered zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso maturation and zzso zzso selective zzso of zzso zzso zzso our findings provide a role for zzso during skeletal muscle differentiation and strongly suggest that zzso is required downstream of zzso in the signaling pathways responsible for the dismantling of zzso zzso zzso
