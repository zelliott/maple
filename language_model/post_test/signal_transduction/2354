zzso signaling to B cells is important for generating an effective zzso immune zzso zzso zzso leads to B cell zzso events such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of cell surface zzso as well as the generation of memory B zzso Many of these events are dependent upon the ability of zzso to activate the zzso factor zzso B zzso zzso To define the zzso signaling components upstream of zzso B zzso and the functional consequences downstream of zzso B zzso we examined mouse B cell zzso expressing zzso or zzso human zzso Analysis of zzso zzso domain zzso and point zzso defined a zzso acid zzso zzso signaling zzso required for zzso B zzso A zzso zzso at position zzso previously shown to be important for zzso association with zzso zzso factor 2 zzso zzso and zzso was not required for zzso B zzso This suggests that in B cells, zzso zzso B zzso can occur independently of zzso and zzso zzso zzso B zzso was independent of the zzso domain of zzso suggesting that it is independent of zzso a zzso that associates with zzso in a region other than the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B alpha (I zzso B zzso and I zzso B beta degradation occurred downstream of zzso zzso and preceded zzso zzso B nuclear zzso zzso or zzso I zzso B zzso zzso was not zzso zzso B zzso correlated with the ability of zzso to induce zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso and zzso However, zzso B zzso was insufficient for zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso
