zzso zzso is implicated mainly in zzso zzso Some zzso associates with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso their zzso zzso through interaction of zzso zzso zzso in zzso with zzso motifs in zzso zzso of function of zzso leads to zzso zzso in the diseases zzso zzso type 2 zzso and zzso lateral sclerosis zzso zzso zzso knockout zzso mice show zzso and insulin zzso To zzso the influence of zzso on zzso regulation, we surveyed interactions of zzso with zzso motifs from numerous proteins and observed a novel interaction with zzso zzso binding in zzso zzso zzso pull-down zzso and zzso of the zzso proteins indicated a zzso relevant zzso In zzso patient zzso zzso more than zzso protein levels were diminished, with an zzso of both transcripts suggesting enhanced protein zzso In zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso the protein levels of zzso and zzso were zzso zzso absence by itself was insufficient to significantly change zzso signaling for zzso Ras levels, zzso levels, and zzso as well as zzso zzso suggesting that other factors compensate for proliferation zzso In zzso tissue with zzso zzso a significant decrease of zzso protein levels is prominent rather than zzso zzso zzso zzso the levels of several components of the zzso zzso complex and may thus contribute to alter cell proliferation as well as translation and zzso
