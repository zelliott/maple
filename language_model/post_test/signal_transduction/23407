The maturation and folding of G zzso receptors are governed by mechanisms that remain poorly zzso In an effort to characterize these biological events, we zzso a novel, zzso zzso approach to identify partners of the zzso zzso zzso In addition to a number of known interacting proteins such as zzso G protein zzso this allowed us to identify proteins involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso Among zzso proteins is Ring finger protein 5 zzso an zzso zzso zzso anchored to the outer membrane of the zzso zzso zzso confirmed, in a cellular context, the interaction between zzso and the zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso with zzso at the zzso zzso of zzso with either zzso increased levels of their zzso whereas small interfering zzso zzso of zzso zzso promoted the zzso zzso did not zzso the zzso state of zzso or zzso Instead, zzso zzso zzso membrane protein zzso a protein that recruits the zzso to the zzso membrane and that is zzso regulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso with both zzso and zzso and decreased total zzso protein levels through zzso zzso zzso of zzso a zzso largely retained in the zzso promoted zzso recruitment by zzso zzso of both receptors via zzso was increased when zzso was zzso Our data suggest that zzso regulates the turnover of specific G zzso receptors by zzso zzso and preventing zzso zzso
