The repair of the zzso zzso damaged by zzso physical, or chemical insult requires zzso cell migration over a provisional zzso composed of complexes of zzso zzso zzso including zzso and zzso These zzso molecules support migration and enhance cell zzso When cells adhere too tightly to their zzso they fail to move; but if they adhere too little, they are unable to develop the traction force necessary for zzso Thus, we investigated the relative contributions of zzso and zzso to zzso cell zzso and migration using the immortalized zzso lung zzso cell line zzso and normal human zzso zzso zzso cells, both of which assemble a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells migrate significantly faster on an zzso zzso than on zzso Moreover, addition of zzso to zzso zzso suppresses zzso of both cell zzso Finally, zzso enhances the zzso of both zzso and zzso cells to zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso fine tunes zzso migration by boosting zzso cell zzso to zzso We suggest that, during zzso wound healing of the injured zzso zzso plays an important adhesive role for zzso zzso cell zzso by promoting a stable cellular interaction with the provisional zzso
