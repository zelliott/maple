zzso interactions are thought to regulate the differential zzso of secondary zzso cells zzso and zzso in the sea zzso zzso The molecular bases of these zzso however, are zzso We have previously shown that the sea zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso displays dynamic patterns of expression within both the zzso zzso and zzso during the zzso stage, the time at which these two cell types are thought to be zzso specified zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1997) Development zzso zzso The zzso signaling zzso has been shown to mediate the segregation of numerous cell types in both zzso and zzso zzso To directly examine whether zzso signaling has a role in the differential zzso of zzso and zzso we have zzso activated and dominant negative forms of zzso during early sea zzso zzso We show that zzso of zzso signaling increases zzso zzso while loss or reduction of zzso signaling eliminates or significantly decreases zzso zzso Furthermore, results from a mosaic analysis of zzso function as well as zzso zzso expression strongly suggest that zzso signaling acts autonomously within the zzso zzso to mediate zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrate that the expansion of zzso seen with zzso of zzso signaling comes at the expense of zzso zzso cells, while loss of zzso zzso results in the zzso expanding into territory where zzso usually zzso Taken together, these results offer compelling evidence that zzso signaling directly specifies the zzso fate, and that this signaling is critical for the differential zzso of zzso and zzso in the sea zzso zzso
