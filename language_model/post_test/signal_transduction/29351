Human zzso receptors zzso rapidly activate zzso signaling zzso in addition to their classical function as zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso breast cancer cells, we zzso the role of zzso rapid zzso signaling in the zzso regulation of target genes involved in breast cancer cell zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso was rapidly activated after a zzso treatment with zzso zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso on the zzso consensus site, zzso zzso zzso receptors strongly associated with specificity protein 1 zzso zzso factors to regulate zzso cell cycle zzso and zzso zzso target genes whose promoters lack zzso zzso response element zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso activities blocked zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors defective for zzso binding zzso were not zzso on zzso in response to zzso and failed to interact with zzso zzso complexes containing zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso were recruited to zzso sites within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso entry was attenuated in zzso cells containing zzso zzso and treated with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso or in zzso cells zzso expressing zzso or zzso zzso domain zzso In sum, rapid zzso zzso signaling leads to zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso These events are critical for zzso regulation of zzso target genes and breast cancer cell zzso Our data demonstrate the therapeutic potential for zzso breast cancer treatment by exploiting multiple zzso along the zzso signaling pathway, including zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso
