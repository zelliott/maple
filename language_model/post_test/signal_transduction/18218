zzso zzso development and the tissue response to cardiac stress are accompanied by marked changes in gene zzso however, the extent of these changes and their significance remain to be fully zzso We used zzso zzso for gene expression profiling in rat cardiac tissue samples to study zzso transitions and the response to zzso zzso zzso 

zzso with rat zzso for 86 known genes and zzso anonymous zzso obtained by molecular zzso zzso difference zzso of zzso from zzso and zzso zzso samples were used in zzso zzso zzso Twelve known genes previously associated with zzso development were identified together with 10 zzso expressed sequence tags and 36 genes not previously associated with cardiac zzso After zzso genes associated with zzso stress and wound healing exhibited differences in magnitude and expression zzso and 14 genes not previously associated with zzso were zzso In zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso characteristic of wound healing and vascular and zzso zzso 

zzso analysis of gene expression with zzso zzso provides a measure of zzso or zzso regulation and cellular zzso Our results demonstrate the complexity of gene regulation in the developing zzso and show that zzso zzso can be used to monitor the evolution of the cardiac zzso zzso
