The zzso effects of the green tea compound zzso zzso have not been studied in detail previously in head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso occurs frequently in zzso which is an adverse zzso zzso zzso we examined in detail the molecular effects of zzso on two human zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso focusing on the zzso signaling zzso The zzso lethal dose zzso of zzso for both cell lines was 10 zzso Treatment with zzso increased the proportion of cells in the zzso phase of the cell cycle and induced zzso In cells treated with zzso there was a decrease in the zzso D1 zzso an increase in the zzso and zzso zzso and a reduction in the zzso form of zzso changes that may account for the arrest in zzso zzso also caused a decrease in the zzso and zzso zzso an increase in the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso 9, suggesting that zzso zzso zzso via a zzso zzso Treatment with zzso inhibited zzso of the zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso regulated zzso zzso proteins and also inhibited zzso and transforming growth zzso zzso and zzso D1 promoter zzso zzso at zzso zzso (a concentration found in serum after oral zzso markedly enhanced the zzso effects of zzso Taken together, these findings provide insights into molecular mechanisms of growth zzso by zzso and suggest that this naturally occurring compound may be useful, when used alone or in combination with other agents, in the zzso and/or treatment of zzso
