In the zzso zzso stem cells with prolonged zzso capacities reside in the most peripheral region, the zzso marginal zone zzso and they persist even after the functional eye has zzso These stem cells contribute to the formation of the retinal structures during the zzso period in zzso or can expand as zzso in zzso Despite the wealth of anatomical descriptions of the characteristics of zzso cells, molecular mechanisms for their zzso or maintenance have long been zzso Recent studies provide evidence that certain zzso signaling molecules act as key regulators at multiple steps during these zzso In this review, we discuss the molecular basis for the regulation of retinal stem cells and their related cell types, especially focusing on the role of zzso zzso
