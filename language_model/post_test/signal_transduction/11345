As an important zzso of the immune system, zzso zzso can induce the expression of various zzso one of which is the tumor necrosis zzso zzso However, the induction mechanism of zzso remains to be fully zzso We have previously shown zzso zzso mediates zzso gene induction upon zzso stimulation through an upstream zzso zzso In this study, we further demonstrated that there is another essential zzso element in zzso gene promoter zzso Using zzso cell line zzso we found that this zzso element can form a specific complex with nuclear zzso which contained a novel zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, using zzso zzso we revealed that zzso zzso zzso is involved in the formation of zzso complex and the subsequent zzso zzso of zzso gene in response to zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggested that the complicated zzso induction of zzso gene expression requires not only the zzso of zzso zzso on the zzso element, but also the cooperation of another signal zzso on the zzso zzso
