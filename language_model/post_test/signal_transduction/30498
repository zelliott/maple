The tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso death domain protein zzso mediates induction of zzso as well as zzso of zzso by cellular zzso 1 zzso zzso is also recruited by the zzso membrane protein 1 zzso zzso of zzso virus, but its role in zzso signaling has remained zzso In human B zzso we have generated, to our knowledge, the first genetic knockout of zzso to investigate zzso role in zzso signal zzso Our data from zzso cells demonstrate that zzso is a critical signaling zzso of zzso that is required for zzso to recruit and activate zzso zzso beta zzso However, in contrast to zzso zzso zzso signaling does not induce zzso zzso for the molecular basis for this zzso we characterized the 16 zzso zzso acids of zzso as an autonomous and unique zzso zzso zzso zzso the death domain of zzso by zzso zzso domain converts zzso into a zzso zzso that activates zzso through a zzso pathway, like zzso but unlike zzso zzso Thus, the unique interaction of zzso with zzso encodes the transforming zzso of viral zzso signaling and masks zzso zzso zzso
