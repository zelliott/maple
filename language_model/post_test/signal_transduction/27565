zzso zzso and zzso play important roles in regulating zzso zzso We recently identified a discrete cluster of zzso cells in the zzso zzso nucleus that we zzso plays a central role in sleep zzso These zzso zzso nucleus zzso are zzso and zzso and zzso the zzso cell groups that contribute to the ascending zzso zzso To determine whether there are retinal zzso to zzso zzso zzso nucleus zzso we injected 5 zzso of zzso zzso toxin B zzso into one eye in a series of zzso We found zzso labeled zzso in the zzso zzso nucleus zzso with a zzso zzso Using zzso to identify zzso zzso we found that the zzso toxin B zzso retinal fibers gave rise to terminals that were distributed among the zzso zzso zzso zzso nucleus zzso Combining zzso toxin B zzso zzso with zzso zzso we found that the retinal terminals formed zzso with the cell bodies and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso nucleus zzso Following zzso injection into the zzso zzso nucleus region, we found zzso labeled zzso in the superior part of the peripheral zzso zzso to the injection site and in the superior zzso zzso of the peripheral zzso zzso to the injection zzso The size of labeled retinal zzso cells suggested that they belonged to the type III or W type, which provide zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso The retinal projection to the zzso zzso nucleus may provide an anatomical zzso by which zzso levels may directly influence zzso
