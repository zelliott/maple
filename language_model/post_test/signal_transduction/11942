To observe the effect of zzso on the zzso of zzso and its zzso zzso in human zzso zzso cells zzso under high zzso zzso 

zzso cells were incubated with different zzso of zzso zzso zzso for indicated time zzso zzso Then the zzso expressions of zzso and zzso and the zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined by real-time zzso chain reaction zzso and Western zzso analysis zzso In addition, the effect of zzso inhibitor on the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells exposed to zzso was also zzso zzso cells were divided into 3 groups of 5 zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso and 30 zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso and Western zzso were used to observe the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso 

Both zzso expression and zzso level of zzso and zzso significantly increased in zzso cells after exposure to zzso zzso 30, 45 zzso And it was in a zzso and zzso manner as compared with control group zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in protein of zzso respectively (all P zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso dramatically inhibited the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso induced by zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso folds in protein of zzso in zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso increases the zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso And zzso may zzso the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso under zzso
