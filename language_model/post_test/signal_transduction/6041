In most human zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso coli gene zzso or zzso zzso activate the zzso factor zzso zzso factor zzso signaling zzso Here, we show that the zzso factor zzso protein zzso inhibited a zzso reporter in human embryonic kidney zzso cells and in two human zzso cancer lines, despite the fact that zzso and zzso protein levels were unchanged in the zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso formed a complex with zzso and zzso and that zzso disrupted zzso interactions in the zzso Thus, zzso complex formation appears to suppress zzso zzso by shifting the pool of nuclear zzso toward an inactive form, having reduced binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pull-down zzso showed that zzso physically associated with zzso rather than with zzso and the zzso binding site was identified in the N zzso of zzso involving both the zzso and zzso repeat zzso whereas the zzso binding site in zzso was in the basic region of the zzso DNA binding zzso These findings provide the first evidence for a specific interaction between the tumor zzso protein zzso and the zzso factor zzso and they suggest a link between the zzso signaling zzso and various other pathways of development and differentiation associated with zzso
