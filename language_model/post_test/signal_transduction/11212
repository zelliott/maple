The zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso has been highly zzso in animal evolution and, in zzso and zzso plays a key role in embryonic growth and development, with the IGF-1 zzso zzso being a crucial regulator of the zzso zzso Here we report the first functional role for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso coding for a dominant negative zzso resulted in zzso that were small in size compared to controls and had disrupted head and zzso zzso At its most extreme, this zzso was characterized by a complete loss of head and eye structures, an absence of zzso and the presence of abnormal zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso following injection of IGF-1 zzso resulted in a greatly expanded development of anterior structures at the expense of trunk and zzso zzso zzso caused a significant decrease in the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso while excess zzso zzso expanded zzso expression in zzso zzso tissue and widened the zzso expression domain in the developing zzso The observation that zzso zzso reduced expression of two key organizer genes zzso and zzso suggests that zzso zzso plays a role in regulating zzso organizer zzso This is supported by the expression of IGF-1, zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso and the demonstration that zzso zzso influences expression of zzso a gene that plays an important role in zzso pattern zzso Our data is consistent with a common zzso for integration of zzso zzso and zzso in early zzso zzso
