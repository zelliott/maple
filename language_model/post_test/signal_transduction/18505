Two distinct cell signals have been isolated from the sponge host of the tropical zzso symbiotic association zzso zzso zzso These water soluble cell signals zzso between 500 and zzso modify separate steps in the carbon metabolism in both zzso zzso and the zzso zzso from the coral zzso zzso The first zzso host release factor zzso stimulates the release of compounds derived from zzso zzso the second zzso photosynthesis zzso factor zzso partially zzso zzso Both zzso from the sponge zzso zzso and zzso from the coral zzso zzso zzso the release of zzso from zzso suggesting that they act at a similar step in the metabolism of this zzso This is the first time that such cell signals have been isolated from a zzso We suggest that they belong to a family of similar cell signals from symbiotic zzso that modify zzso carbon zzso
