The induction of zzso zzso differentiation is a potent strategy for the clinical treatment of diseases related to blood zzso zzso zzso zzso is an inhibitor of protein zzso C zzso with an zzso effect on cancer cells through zzso zzso However, the exact mechanism of zzso on zzso differentiation is still zzso The present study assessed the regulatory effect of zzso on zzso differentiation in both human leukemia cells and mouse bone zzso stem zzso zzso not only inhibited the proliferation of both zzso and zzso cell lines, but also induced the cell differentiation into zzso zzso resulting in zzso formation, zzso markers zzso and zzso zzso and zzso factor 4 zzso zzso of zzso The induction effect of zzso was zzso through the expression of zzso but not zzso The level of zzso zzso showed an increased zzso zzso to the nucleus, and enhanced the zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso and its upstream zzso zzso by zzso inhibitor VI and zzso inhibitor I, respectively, demonstrated that the cells obviously reduced the percentage of zzso zzso zzso Further investigation of the cells with zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso and zzso differentiation was markedly zzso indicating that zzso is an important zzso in inducing zzso zzso Additionally, the ex zzso zzso also confirmed that zzso effectively zzso zzso colony formation and zzso expression in bone zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso is a potent zzso for zzso differentiation through the zzso of zzso signaling zzso and zzso nuclear zzso
