We have zzso in parental and zzso rat liver zzso zzso cells, the capacity of the zzso growth factors zzso and 2) to stimulate growth under zzso dependent and independent conditions and the role of the zzso protein in the response to these zzso Although the increase of the proliferation of cells in zzso was similar for the two lines, only the zzso cells formed colonies in soft zzso after zzso zzso We showed that zzso and 2 did not modify the expression of zzso or zzso proteins during zzso zzso but both factors enhanced zzso zzso which suggests that this phenomenon could be involved in zzso gene zzso Moreover, we showed that both the zzso and the increase of zzso status of zzso protein were necessary to transform zzso zzso
