The liver is the central regulator of iron metabolism and zzso chronic liver diseases often lead to systemic iron overload due to diminished expression of the zzso hormone zzso To study the largely unknown regulation of iron metabolism in the context of zzso disease, we used two established models of chronic liver injury, zzso repeated carbon zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso To determine the impact of zzso protein zzso protein zzso on zzso production, the effect of a single zzso injection was determined in zzso and zzso knockout zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso expression was assessed in control subjects and patients with alcoholic liver zzso Both chronic injury models developed a distinct iron overload in zzso zzso but not zzso - injected mice displayed additional iron zzso in zzso resulting in a significant zzso and systemic iron overload which was due to suppressed zzso zzso zzso zzso a known zzso zzso was markedly inhibited in zzso mice, due to lower zzso levels and zzso of zzso a zzso zzso A single zzso injection resulted in a long-lasting zzso 6 zzso suppression of zzso levels and zzso zzso zzso to zzso displayed significantly attenuated zzso zzso in response to acute zzso zzso zzso zzso levels increased zzso in alcoholic liver disease patients versus controls zzso zzso zzso and zzso correlated with zzso zzso Our results establish zzso as an important regulator of zzso zzso expression in chronic liver zzso The differences in iron metabolism between the two widely used zzso models likely reflect the differential regulation of zzso expression in human liver zzso
