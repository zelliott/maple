The Bad signaling zzso contributes to the regulation of zzso after a variety of cell death zzso and Bad plays a key role in determining cell death or zzso We have reported that zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso reduces zzso cell death after transient focal cerebral zzso zzso However, both the role of the Bad zzso after zzso and the role of oxygen free zzso in the regulation of zzso remain zzso To clarify these issues, we used an in zzso zzso model of zzso transgenic mice and zzso zzso Moreover, to examine the role of protein zzso A zzso in the Bad zzso after zzso we administered the zzso zzso zzso into the mouse brain after zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis showed that zzso and zzso of Bad were detected early after zzso and that they were promoted by zzso treatment but prevented by zzso zzso revealed that the zzso of Bad progressed with zzso zzso and with zzso zzso after zzso Moreover, zzso was prevented by zzso treatment but promoted by zzso zzso was prevented by zzso but promoted by zzso zzso A cell death zzso revealed that zzso DNA fragmentation was aggravated by zzso treatment but reduced by zzso These results suggest that the Bad zzso zzso by zzso is involved in zzso cell death after zzso and that zzso of zzso may zzso this zzso cell zzso
