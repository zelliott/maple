zzso in components of the zzso transport zzso machinery required for assembly and function of the primary zzso cause a subset of human zzso characterized primarily by skeletal zzso Recently, zzso in the zzso gene zzso have been described in patients with zzso and zzso zzso which are associated with short ribs and zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we describe an zzso mouse zzso with a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso a number of the skeletal and zzso anomalies seen in patients with human skeletal zzso Like other zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso display a generalized zzso expansion of zzso zzso zzso in spite of defective zzso and an zzso of the ability of zzso cells to respond to upstream stimulation of the zzso This enhanced zzso zzso is consistent with zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso although extensive rib zzso fusion and zzso zzso correlate with defects in early zzso patterning and may reflect contributions from multiple zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso a second zzso of zzso which represents a functional zzso revealed a zzso effect on limb outgrowth consistent with the zzso zzso characteristic of these zzso This zzso series of mouse zzso provides a unique opportunity to uncover the underlying zzso basis of this intriguing subset of zzso
