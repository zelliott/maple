zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso whose zzso stimulates zzso We recently generated a zzso zzso in which the zzso domain of zzso was replaced with the zzso domain of human colony stimulating zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso To study the contribution of the zzso zzso to zzso of zzso we created a panel of truncated receptors in which the zzso zzso of zzso was progressively zzso zzso of the entire zzso zzso eliminated zzso of zzso its ability to activate signaling zzso and its ability to stimulate cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso exhibited impaired zzso zzso and inhibited the zzso of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Furthermore, introducing the zzso zzso of another zzso zzso zzso restored the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and its ability to stimulate cell zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso zzso of zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso its ability to activate signaling zzso and its ability to induce biological zzso The presence of at least 57 zzso acids at the zzso zzso of zzso are required for zzso zzso Thus, we propose that the zzso zzso is required for zzso of zzso and absence of the zzso zzso renders zzso zzso
