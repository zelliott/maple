zzso cells and peripheral blood zzso cells were treated with hydrogen zzso zzso to determine the expression of zzso factor zzso zzso A full-length complementary DNA or an zzso zzso of zzso was zzso into cells, and expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso X zzso proteins were zzso The results showed that zzso treatment of cells resulted in an increase in zzso zzso zzso induced zzso and slowed cell growth, potentially resulting from zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso activities on zzso and zzso were promoted following zzso zzso potentially through zzso binding sites on corresponding zzso All results indicate that zzso zzso zzso in leukemia cells involving the zzso zzso during zzso zzso suggesting a potential mechanism for research on drug-induced zzso
