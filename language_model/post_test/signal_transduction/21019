In zzso the zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso genes have been proposed to act in separate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso alter various zzso processes during seed development, whereas the dominant zzso zzso zzso zzso responses largely in zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene was zzso expressed in the zzso zzso of transgenic zzso plants carrying a zzso fusion between the zzso zzso promoter and the zzso zzso zzso interactions between the zzso expressed zzso and zzso zzso genes were investigated by monitoring diverse zzso responses in zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso to zzso the ability to accumulate the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in response to zzso and the zzso zzso inhibited this zzso induction of zzso by zzso Furthermore, zzso expression of zzso also influenced zzso responses that occur in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased zzso induction of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of root growth, and both responses were sensitive to the zzso zzso in the presence as in the absence of zzso Finally, although zzso is thought to be a zzso zzso and zzso regulation is not known to involve zzso events, the zzso expressed zzso gene suppressed the effect of the zzso zzso on zzso zzso The present data demonstrate that zzso and zzso genetically interact in controlling diverse zzso responses in transgenic zzso zzso The possibility that the zzso zzso and zzso genes may similarly act in a common zzso zzso zzso in seed is discussed with previous zzso studies of the zzso and zzso zzso
