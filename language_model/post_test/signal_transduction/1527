To gain insight into the regulatory mechanisms of sugar signaling in plants, the effect of derivatives of the transport sugar zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso analog zzso were zzso zzso suspension culture cells of tomato zzso zzso were used to study their effect on the regulation of marker genes of source and sink zzso photosynthesis, and the zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso resulted in reverse regulation of source and sink zzso Whereas the zzso level of zzso zzso zzso was zzso the transcript level of small zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and zzso only rapidly induced zzso zzso level, whereas the transcript level of zzso was not zzso The differential effect of the zzso and zzso zzso on zzso zzso regulation was reflected by the fact that only zzso and zzso inhibited photosynthesis and zzso zzso The zzso of different signal zzso pathways by zzso was further supported by the analysis of the zzso of zzso zzso activity was found to be strongly activated by zzso zzso and zzso but not by zzso and zzso To analyze the role of zzso in relation to pathogen perception, an zzso preparation of zzso zzso zzso was zzso The strong zzso of zzso and the fast and transient induction of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso resembles the effect of zzso zzso and zzso and indicates that zzso zzso are sensed as stress-related zzso
