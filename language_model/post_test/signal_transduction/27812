The expression patterns of zzso genes were determined during ozone zzso exposure in zzso zzso were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso for 6 h zzso for 14 zzso zzso leaves began to yellow after 10 d of exposure, whereas zzso was not apparent in control leaves until d zzso zzso levels for eight of 12 zzso related genes characterized showed induction by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso responsive to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were induced within 2 to 4 d of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were induced within 4 to 6 zzso and zzso zzso zzso was induced within 6 to 8 zzso In contrast, levels of zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and cab zzso zzso zzso declined after 6 zzso Other markers of natural zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not show enhanced transcript zzso When zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso transgenic plants were treated with zzso zzso activity was induced in zzso plants after 2 d but was not detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was located throughout zzso leaves, whereas control leaves generally showed activity along the zzso The acceleration of leaf zzso induced by zzso is a regulated event involving many genes associated with natural zzso
