The present study was carried out to investigate the effect of zzso zzso zzso on the in zzso growth of human cervical zzso zzso zzso A series of 11 zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso zzso groups, at various zzso These compounds were zzso to identify which zzso and position induced the strongest zzso effect in cancer zzso Among these zzso analog 9, which contains zzso groups, had the most significant zzso effect on zzso cells, and its zzso value was less than 13 zzso A zzso zzso also showed that analog 9 inhibited the proliferation of zzso zzso By using DNA content analysis, we found that analog 9 induced zzso and zzso phase arrest in a zzso zzso A zzso incorporation zzso suggested that analog 9 inhibited DNA replication in zzso zzso On performing light zzso zzso changes such as cellular shrinkage and zzso which are zzso features, were observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso double zzso and zzso zzso showed that analog 9 induced zzso and disrupted the zzso zzso membrane potential in zzso zzso The western zzso analysis results suggested that analog 9 induced zzso zzso In addition, we have shown that analog 9 may play a role in the zzso signaling zzso zzso
