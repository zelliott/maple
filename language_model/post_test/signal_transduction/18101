The zzso zzso gene zzso at a given locus is tightly regulated with respect to cell lineage and zzso stage by an zzso zzso To study the possible role of precursor B cell zzso zzso zzso signaling in the regulation of the ordered zzso zzso gene zzso during B cell zzso a newly developed system using zzso heavy zzso chain membrane zzso zzso mice was zzso In this system, the zzso zzso of zzso on zzso arrested zzso B zzso cells zzso zzso signaling to induce early B cell differentiation in zzso zzso with zzso zzso chain reaction revealed that the zzso zzso induced the zzso of zzso gene zzso zzso the suppression of ongoing zzso at the H chain locus and the zzso of zzso at the light zzso chain zzso Upon the zzso the zzso chain zzso zzso was found to be zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso was promptly zzso zzso this zzso of the accessibility at the H and L chain zzso was detected even before the induction of cellular differentiation became zzso by the change of surface zzso Thus, the zzso signaling through zzso appears to regulate the ordered zzso gene zzso by altering the zzso locus zzso
