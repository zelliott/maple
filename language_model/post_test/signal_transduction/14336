The liver is a central organ that controls systemic energy zzso and zzso zzso zzso carbohydrates and zzso and fatty acids derived from zzso tissue are delivered to the liver, and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso which are tightly regulated by hormonal and neural zzso zzso zzso is activated primarily by insulin that is zzso from the zzso after a zzso zzso zzso regulatory element binding zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso are major zzso regulators that induce key zzso zzso to promote zzso in the zzso zzso regulatory element binding zzso is activated by insulin through complex signaling zzso that control zzso at both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein is activated by zzso independently of zzso Here, the authors attempt to zzso the current understanding of the molecular mechanism for the zzso regulation of zzso zzso focusing on recent studies that explore the signaling pathways controlling zzso and zzso
