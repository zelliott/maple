The cellular content of zzso generated by zzso of zzso zzso through the zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso of a cell's response to zzso zzso We tested the hypothesis that increased zzso content, independently of zzso number, increases responsiveness to zzso stimulation in zzso 

zzso mice with zzso expression of zzso showed increased zzso zzso expression but no change in zzso zzso number or zzso zzso When zzso through the zzso cardiac function was increased, and cardiac zzso showed increased zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and cardiac function were normal, and long-term zzso expression was not associated with abnormal zzso findings or deleterious changes in cardiac zzso 

The amount of zzso sets a limit on cardiac zzso signaling in zzso and increased zzso independent of zzso number and zzso content, provides a means to regulate cardiac responsiveness to zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso does not alter zzso signaling except when receptors are zzso in contrast to zzso zzso which yields continuous zzso and has zzso zzso Our findings establish the importance of zzso content in modulating zzso signaling in the heart, suggesting a new target for safely increasing cardiac responsiveness to zzso zzso
