We previously observed a stronger effect of knockout of zzso zzso zzso than that of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso on zzso body weight and zzso zzso Two experiments were conducted to determine how zzso zzso profiles and key zzso regulators were correlated with this zzso zzso and zzso mice and their respective zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso were fed a zzso zzso zzso diet and killed at 6 months of age to collect liver zzso In zzso 1, zzso zzso mice displayed zzso intolerance and a zzso decrease zzso in liver zzso compared with their zzso zzso The former had lower zzso activities of zzso zzso total protein zzso and protein zzso zzso but a higher zzso activity of zzso in the liver than the zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of total cholesterol, zzso and zzso fatty acids were increased by 11 to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Meanwhile, these mice had elevated zzso zzso protein levels of zzso element binding proteins 1 and 2, zzso zzso total and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso In zzso 2, zzso mice and their zzso zzso were zzso but showed no difference in any of the zzso In conclusion, knockout of zzso but not zzso led to a decreased liver zzso storage synchronized with zzso intolerance and elevated zzso zzso profiles in adult zzso This striking comparison was possibly due to unique impacts of these two zzso on zzso tone of zzso and key regulators of liver zzso zzso and zzso
