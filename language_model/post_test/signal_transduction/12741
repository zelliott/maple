For zzso zzso zzso zzso ethanol yield and productivity is substantially lower on zzso than on zzso In contrast to zzso zzso is a novel zzso for zzso zzso and it is not known how this zzso is recognized on a molecular zzso Failure to activate appropriate genes during zzso has the potential to result in zzso metabolism and decreased zzso zzso Certain differences in zzso performance between the two zzso have thus been ascribed to variations in regulatory zzso In this study differences in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was analyzed in the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso Continuous cultures were performed with zzso and zzso under zzso and zzso zzso Whereas biomass yield and zzso zzso rate were similar during zzso conditions, the zzso profile was highly zzso dependent under zzso zzso While zzso production occurred in both cases, ethanol production was only observed for zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso to a zzso culture was able to stimulate transient overflow metabolism and ethanol zzso Application of zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso rate under restricted zzso zzso zzso are discussed in relation to regulation of sugar metabolism in zzso and zzso zzso
