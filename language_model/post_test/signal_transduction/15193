It is zzso that zzso zzso cells zzso can develop into zzso cells that zzso zzso zzso proteins and contribute to liver zzso Recently, molecular markers of zzso cells were discovered in zzso of zzso Moreover, the cells displayed the capacity to differentiate and to participate in liver zzso In addition, zzso cells possess signaling pathways important for maintenance of zzso and cell differentiation such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso All these properties are zzso found in zzso zzso Stem cells require a special zzso the so-called stem cell zzso to maintain their zzso Thus, we investigated if the space of zzso where zzso cells reside in the liver zzso by the sympathetic nervous system and surrounded by zzso zzso cells and zzso cells, exhibits similarities with known stem cell zzso The present study describes the niche of zzso cells within the liver of rats that is composed of zzso zzso cells, which release zzso zzso zzso to attract zzso cells via the zzso zzso 4, zzso zzso proteins zzso and collagen type zzso and zzso cells, which zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

The space of zzso shows analogies to typical stem cell niches zzso of zzso zzso zzso sympathetic zzso and adjacent cells that constitute a milieu by zzso factors and direct physical interactions to retain zzso at this site and to influence their cellular zzso The space of zzso serves as a niche of zzso cells, which is a novel function of this unique organ zzso
