zzso zzso 4 zzso especially expressed on zzso connects microbial and sterile innate immune zzso zzso zzso from zzso bacteria and several zzso zzso among others saturated fatty acids zzso are able to induce zzso through this zzso zzso inflammatory zzso orchestrate the immune zzso Our aim was to investigate how long-lasting zzso stress affects zzso zzso and search for possible correlations between zzso production and zzso expression or zzso zzso 

Eight healthy males were studied during a zzso zzso course with zzso physical strain, together with energy and sleep zzso Blood drawn on days 0, 3, 5 and 7 was incubated ex zzso for 6 h with or without zzso 10 zzso zzso surface expression of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso of inflammatory zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso In addition, plasma free fatty acids were zzso 

zzso zzso expression was elevated throughout the course zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results were found for zzso The concentration of zzso increased significantly on day 3 and thereafter zzso and a similar pattern was seen for zzso No correlations were found between zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression or plasma zzso 

zzso stress significantly affected ex zzso production of zzso and zzso surface expression of zzso In addition, zzso of fat resulted in increased plasma zzso of zzso No associations between inflammatory zzso and zzso zzso expression or zzso were zzso
