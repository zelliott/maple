zzso growth factors zzso play a role in biological processes such as cell growth and development, zzso and wound zzso Several genes have been shown to be induced by zzso but the underlying mechanisms have not been zzso We investigated the effect of zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso We found that the zzso gene is zzso induced by zzso as well as by zzso zzso involving a zzso element located zzso zzso upstream of the zzso initiation zzso neither induction requires ongoing protein zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso induction was not impaired by protein zzso C zzso zzso of various signaling molecules by Western zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity zzso and transient zzso zzso zzso of a zzso gene construct with expression zzso for zzso or dominant negative type of these molecules or for zzso protein zzso zzso showed that a zzso zzso is induced by zzso and zzso leading to the zzso of the zzso zzso
