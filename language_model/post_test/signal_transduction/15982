The condition of zzso stress arises when zzso production exceeds zzso activity in cells and zzso The overabundance of zzso is mechanistically connected to the zzso zzso of insulin resistance, primarily in skeletal muscle zzso and the subsequent development of type 2 zzso Two important mechanisms for this zzso excess are zzso the zzso overproduction of hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso under conditions of energy surplus and zzso the enhanced zzso of cellular zzso zzso via zzso II zzso Several recent studies are reviewed that support the concept that direct exposure of zzso skeletal muscle to an zzso stress (including hydrogen zzso results in stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and that the engagement of this zzso zzso zzso signaling is mechanistically associated with diminished zzso stimulation of insulin signaling elements and zzso transport zzso The beneficial interactions between the zzso zzso acid and the advanced zzso zzso inhibitor zzso that zzso zzso zzso defects in zzso and zzso insulin action in the obese zzso zzso a model of zzso are also zzso Overall, this review highlights the importance of zzso stress in the development of insulin resistance in zzso skeletal muscle zzso at least in part via a zzso zzso and indicates that interventions that reduce this zzso stress and zzso damage can improve insulin action in zzso animal zzso Strategies to prevent and zzso zzso stress remain important in the overall treatment of insulin resistance and type 2 zzso
