The zzso protein zzso zzso is a sensor of cellular energy status, and a regulator of energy balance at both the cellular and whole body zzso Although zzso zzso its function is best understood in skeletal zzso zzso contains sites that zzso bind zzso or zzso with an increase in cellular zzso ratio zzso a fall in cellular energy zzso switching on the zzso In muscle, zzso zzso is therefore triggered by sustained contraction, and appears to be particularly important in the zzso changes that occur in the transition from resistance to endurance zzso Once zzso zzso switches on zzso processes that generate zzso while switching off zzso processes not essential in the short zzso Thus, it acutely activates zzso zzso (by promoting zzso of the zzso zzso to the zzso and fatty acid zzso while switching off zzso synthesis and protein synthesis (the later via zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also causes some of the chronic adaptations to endurance exercise, such as increased zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso domain that causes a zzso to bind to the surface of the zzso zzso and it can inhibit zzso synthesis by zzso zzso zzso We have shown that zzso is inhibited by exposed zzso ends in zzso We are working on the hypothesis that this ensures that zzso synthesis is rapidly activated when zzso becomes depleted after exercise, but is switched off again as soon as zzso stores are zzso
