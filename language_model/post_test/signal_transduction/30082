Recent research on the zzso signaling zzso warrants a reassessment of the basic mechanism that zzso signal from the zzso zzso to the zzso This article incorporates these findings into a revised model for zzso zzso We propose that the control of zzso stability, rather than the control of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is the key step in zzso zzso degradation is controlled by a stabilizing effect of zzso zzso and a zzso effect of active zzso zzso zzso enables zzso to accumulate and zzso to the zzso We argue that nuclear zzso of zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso Finally, we speculate on the effects this revision will have on the major questions facing the zzso field of zzso
