zzso regulation of zzso channels by members of the ABC transport protein zzso has been implicated in zzso zzso and in excessive zzso zzso by airway zzso in zzso zzso zzso How ABC proteins regulate zzso zzso is unknown, but must generally involve either the number or activity of specific zzso zzso Here we report that the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso which is defective in zzso reverses the regulation of the activity of single zzso sodium channels zzso by zzso zzso expressed alone in zzso responded to zzso of zzso protein zzso with increased open probability zzso and mean open time, whereas zzso zzso with zzso exhibited decreased zzso and mean open time under conditions optimal for zzso protein zzso Thus, zzso regulates zzso at the level of single channel zzso by switching the response of single channel zzso to zzso from an increase to a zzso
