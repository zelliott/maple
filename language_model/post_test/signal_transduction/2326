The rapid decrease of a response to a persistent zzso often termed zzso is a widespread biological zzso Signal zzso by numerous G zzso receptors appears to be terminated by a zzso uniform zzso zzso most extensively characterized for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The model predicts that activated zzso is initially zzso and then tightly binds an zzso protein that effectively blocks further G protein zzso Here we report that complexes of zzso and zzso zzso have a higher affinity for zzso (but not zzso than do receptors not zzso with zzso The percentage of zzso zzso in this high affinity state in the presence of full zzso varied with different zzso and was enhanced by selective zzso in zzso The percentage of high affinity sites also was zzso to the intrinsic activity of an zzso and the zzso of zzso varies for different zzso zzso Certain zzso zzso can form these high affinity complexes with zzso zzso zzso that enhance formation of the zzso complexes should provide useful tools for manipulating both the efficiency of signaling and rate and specificity of zzso zzso
