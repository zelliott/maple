In zzso zzso rats, zzso zzso zzso is responsible for both a deficit of energy expenditure and zzso which lead to massive obesity and insulin resistance in zzso This obesity is also zzso by zzso of the zzso signaling zzso 

To determine whether zzso in zzso zzso could occur at the onset of obesity when zzso rats are not yet zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (from zzso lean zzso female and zzso obese zzso male zzso 

zzso were prepared from isolated zzso after zzso treatment of zzso zzso zzso The response of zzso activity to stimulation by zzso zzso or zzso was zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and of zzso zzso were measured using zzso zzso binding zzso zzso concentration of zzso and zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso by Western zzso and zzso protein by zzso 

Despite an almost normal body weight, zzso fat pad weight was increased zzso by the expression of zzso zzso This increase was entirely accounted for by fat cell zzso zzso in zzso In zzso compared to zzso zzso response of zzso zzso to zzso was decreased zzso but responses to zzso or zzso were zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was not affected by the zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso 

Response of zzso fat cells to catecholamines was decreased without any quantitative modifications of the different elements of the zzso zzso zzso This suggests an zzso in the zzso between zzso and G zzso Due to the important increase in fat cell volume we zzso that changes in the physical properties of plasma zzso and/or changes in zzso interactions could disturb the zzso zzso zzso In addition to the excess of zzso storage, which occurs very early at the onset of zzso the impairment of the responsiveness to catecholamines reported in this study might zzso the obesity zzso
