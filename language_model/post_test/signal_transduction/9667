Clinical data suggest that zzso have zzso properties in the development of zzso zzso We set out to examine a potential protective effect of zzso and zzso signaling on colon cancer zzso In normal and zzso zzso zzso we found that the zzso zzso zzso is not zzso zzso was confined to sporadic zzso zzso To analyze the influence of systemic zzso zzso zzso we crossed mice that lacked the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso a model for spontaneous zzso zzso zzso mice exhibited no change in zzso number, size or zzso compared to zzso To examine effects of zzso on the zzso zzso that are independent of the zzso we treated mice with zzso We found no effects of either zzso or zzso on gross zzso zzso or zzso zzso Also, in rats treated with zzso injection with the zzso zzso did not result in a difference in the number or size of zzso zzso zzso a surrogate zzso for zzso zzso We conclude that expression of the zzso zzso is limited to cells in the zzso zzso We did not observe any effect of zzso zzso signaling or of zzso treatment in zzso models of zzso zzso
