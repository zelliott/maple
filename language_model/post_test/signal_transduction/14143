The zzso zzso zzso system, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is the major zzso zzso of the cell and has numerous zzso Besides the active site zzso human zzso contains three zzso site zzso zzso at positions 62, 69, and zzso A zzso form of zzso containing an active site zzso between zzso and zzso and a zzso site zzso between zzso and zzso is inactive either as a zzso zzso or as a zzso for zzso zzso This could possibly provide a structural switch affecting zzso function during zzso stress and zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso was generated in zzso cells under zzso zzso In zzso data showed that zzso zzso was generated from zzso of zzso zzso by zzso 1 in the presence of zzso The zzso Western zzso data indicated that the zzso system protected zzso in zzso cells from zzso caused by zzso a zzso zzso for zzso Our results also showed that zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso reduced the zzso site zzso in zzso This reaction was zzso by zzso 1 via the so-called zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso of the zzso site zzso of zzso is suggested to play an important role in zzso regulation and cell signaling via zzso zzso of its zzso zzso activity for the transmission of zzso signals under zzso zzso
