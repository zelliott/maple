The zzso of the complexity of networks is, today, a fundamental problem in the physics of complex zzso A possible zzso to solve the problem is via extending key concepts of information theory to zzso In this Rapid Communication we propose how to define the Shannon zzso of a network ensemble and how it relates to the Gibbs and von Neumann zzso of network zzso The quantities we introduce here will play a crucial role for the zzso of zzso models of networks through zzso arguments and will contribute to zzso problems emerging in the field of complex zzso
