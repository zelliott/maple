zzso growth zzso zzso elicits a potent growth zzso effect on many normal cells by binding to specific zzso zzso receptors and zzso specific zzso zzso which regulate the expression of cell cycle zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Interestingly, cancer cells are often insensitive to the zzso effects of zzso for which the molecular mechanisms are not well zzso In this study, we found that the candidate prostate cancer zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso associates with activated zzso the zzso zzso domain of zzso interacts with the zzso region of zzso Small interfering zzso zzso of zzso in prostate cells suppressed zzso growth zzso Moreover, zzso was shown to specifically associate with the nuclear zzso partner, zzso and to zzso the interaction of activated zzso with zzso factor zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso zzso inhibitor promoter by zzso is zzso by zzso Taken together our data indicate an important zzso scaffold function for zzso in zzso signaling zzso growth zzso
