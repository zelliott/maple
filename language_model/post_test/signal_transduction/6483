zzso zzso zzso across the zzso fluid barrier is an essential step in the zzso of bacterial zzso We have previously shown that invasion of human brain zzso zzso cells zzso by zzso is zzso by bacterial outer membrane protein zzso that binds zzso thereby zzso the zzso to the zzso alpha 5 beta zzso on the zzso cell zzso However, subsequent signal zzso mechanisms essential for or regulated by zzso zzso zzso and invasion, or zzso responses to zzso zzso are zzso In this report we investigated the role of zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso and activated zzso and zzso and zzso zzso as well as their direct zzso zzso and zzso zzso activated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strains lacking zzso gene zzso zzso and sequence type 11 complex zzso still activated zzso zzso however, failed to activate zzso zzso of zzso and zzso significantly reduced zzso of zzso zzso by zzso without affecting its zzso zzso the zzso zzso alpha 5 beta 1 also decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso These findings indicate the crucial role of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso invasion in zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso was important for the control of zzso zzso and zzso release by zzso zzso a protein zzso zzso zzso decreased both invasion of zzso zzso into zzso and zzso and zzso release, indicating that protein zzso zzso which link signals from zzso to zzso zzso pathways are essential for both bacterial zzso and zzso zzso by zzso
