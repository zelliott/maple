This study was designed to investigate the role of protein zzso C zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso signaling in tamoxifen zzso zzso and drug resistance in human breast cancer zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso human breast zzso cells zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were treated with doses of zzso for various periods of zzso Cell viability and zzso were assessed using cell zzso DNA fragmentation and flow zzso zzso We found that zzso administration caused a significant increase in zzso of zzso cells but not zzso zzso Western zzso analysis revealed enhanced expression of zzso but decreased expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso cells had decreased levels of zzso and increased levels of zzso Interestingly, we observed that in zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso by promoting rapid zzso of zzso zzso downstream signaling of zzso zzso while in zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso which promoted zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso enhances zzso in zzso zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso while the zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso drug resistance by zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso The combination of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso could promote zzso zzso in breast cancer zzso
