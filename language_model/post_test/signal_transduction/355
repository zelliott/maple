To investigate the role of zzso in regulation of cortical zzso activity, especially in zzso II zzso zzso and zzso II were simultaneously expressed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso II zzso at the zzso of zzso cells and zzso region of dividing zzso In suspension culture, zzso knockout zzso cells became zzso and zzso II significantly decreased in amount at the zzso During zzso zzso and cell aspiration by zzso zzso accumulated at the tips of zzso and zzso zzso prior to the zzso of zzso zzso In zzso cells, only a small amount of zzso II accumulated at the retracting zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso accumulated at the retracting zzso and zzso zzso even in zzso II zzso cells and zzso zzso cells though in reduced zzso indicating that zzso accumulates partially depending on zzso II and cortical zzso zzso of zzso prior to zzso II suggests that zzso is an upstream component in signaling zzso to zzso zzso II, possibly with zzso signaling loop where zzso contraction further zzso zzso of zzso and zzso II by a positive feedback zzso
