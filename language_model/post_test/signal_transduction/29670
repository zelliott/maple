zzso in zzso signaling and altered expression of downstream targets such as zzso zzso factor zzso have been zzso in patients with bipolar disorder zzso 

The zzso activity and levels of zzso binding to zzso R regulatory zzso were measured in zzso from 10 BD and 10 control zzso In addition, the possibility that zzso expression could be altered in these cells has been zzso 

zzso indicate that zzso activity significantly increased zzso zzso whereas the zzso binding to zzso R zzso decreased in cells from BD zzso zzso The presence of 10 zzso zzso in culture 24 h before cell harvesting induced an increase in zzso activity and a decrease in zzso binding sites zzso zzso with a significant difference between BD and controls zzso zzso This presence of zzso also results in increased zzso expression zzso zzso but neither in resting cells, nor in zzso cells, was any difference observed in zzso expression between BD and controls zzso zzso 

This study was conducted on a peripheral model cell, whose importance of zzso is zzso 

These data suggest that the zzso of zzso signaling observed in BD patients results in the zzso of the zzso zzso Studies on signal zzso gene expression and zzso have implications for development of novel zzso
