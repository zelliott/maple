The steroid hormone 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates through its widely distributed nuclear zzso zzso regulation of gene zzso zzso zzso and through a putative membrane zzso zzso a variety of rapid zzso Rapid responses studied in our laboratories include opening of zzso calcium and zzso channels in zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso of zzso in human leukemia zzso cells and chick zzso cells, release of insulin by rat pancreatic zzso and in chick zzso zzso (the rapid hormonal stimulation of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is zzso flexible zzso chain, zzso zzso and zzso and accordingly is able to generate a large array of different shapes to serve as zzso for available receptors zzso and zzso in the vitamin D zzso zzso Our laboratories have zzso a number of zzso restricted zzso of 1 zzso (from a library of several hundred zzso to evaluate the preferred shape of the zzso for rapid and zzso zzso The determination of the X-ray structure of the 1 zzso zzso revealed that the preferred zzso shape was a twisted zzso bowl shape zzso Cell 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso responses include 1 zzso and other side chain zzso flexible zzso such as zzso zzso zzso equal to zzso more potent than 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso analog with two side zzso all which can achieve the preferred zzso zzso In contrast, rapid responses require a zzso shape of the zzso zzso such as can be achieved by the natural hormone 1 zzso or by zzso permanently locked in the zzso shape such as 1 zzso or 1 zzso Additionally, we have discovered zzso that are specific in their zzso properties for either rapid or zzso zzso Thus, 1 zzso is an zzso of only rapid responses zzso the zzso while zzso zzso is an zzso of only nuclear responses zzso the zzso In conclusion, we have presented evidence that 1 zzso zzso rapid response and zzso response signal zzso pathways zzso differing shapes of zzso both as zzso and zzso
