zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso mediate many pathways including the zzso signaling zzso The zzso zzso in the gene coding for the zzso zzso of G proteins zzso has been shown to be associated with several zzso such as hypertension, zzso and diabetes zzso zzso the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso may therefore be associated with many zzso zzso On these zzso we studied the zzso zzso in relation to zzso zzso in a large Japanese zzso zzso in general linear models showed that T carriers had a significantly wider pulse pressure zzso as well as a significantly higher zzso blood pressure zzso In contrast, analyses in zzso zzso models showed that the zzso zzso was not significantly associated with each of the four major classical risk factors for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease zzso hypertension, zzso and diabetes zzso However, a significantly higher percentage of subjects had none of the four disorders in zzso zzso than in T carriers zzso Thus, the zzso zzso was significantly associated with zzso of these four risk zzso Although the effect of the gene on each zzso appears to be weak, considering the combined impact of the effects of the zzso zzso on risk factors, the zzso gene may be an important gene for human zzso
