It has been shown that zzso of free zzso leads to mobility shift of zzso zzso coli zzso protein and that zzso zzso this zzso Here we show that the zzso mobility shift of zzso is due to zzso of two zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and unknown zzso zzso Interestingly, our results suggest that this process does not require zzso The zzso zzso showed higher affinity to zzso in zzso and fragments of zzso containing the zzso zzso can inhibit zzso reporter activity regardless of their ability to reduce the level of zzso From our data we propose a new role of zzso zzso of excessive zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso retains zzso in zzso to prevent excessive zzso zzso The retained zzso in zzso by zzso may be zzso by zzso 2, which is induced by zzso zzso
