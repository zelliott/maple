Small molecules are important not only as zzso to treat disease but also as chemical tools to probe complex biological zzso The discovery of novel zzso small molecules has largely been zzso by screening diverse chemical libraries for zzso in specific activities in pure proteins zzso or in generating zzso zzso New approaches are needed to close the vast gap between the ability to study either single proteins or whole cellular zzso This Review focuses on the growing number of studies aimed at understanding in more detail how small molecules zzso particular signaling pathways and larger networks to yield distinct cellular zzso This type of zzso analysis and zzso profiling provides valuable insight into zzso action of small molecules and can reveal zzso effects and improve our understanding of how proteins within a zzso regulate zzso
