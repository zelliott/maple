The short zzso F zzso a zzso in the central nervous system zzso of zzso zzso is expressed in a large population of diverse zzso of zzso Most of these zzso are intrinsic zzso of the mushroom bodies, which are the most prominent insect bilateral zzso structures that regulate memory and zzso However, its role in sleep regulation still remains zzso Here, we showed that zzso female and male flies exhibit sleep enhancement with an increase of sleep bout zzso Loss of function of zzso and zzso also elevated zzso Moreover, the zzso regulation of flies after sleep deprivation was disrupted by zzso zzso zzso since sleep deprivation increased zzso of zzso and zzso at night in control flies but not in the zzso zzso flies, suggesting that zzso zzso plays an important role in sleep zzso We further verified that zzso signal elevated zzso levels, and subsequently activated the downstream zzso zzso zzso The duration of sleep was found to be zzso related to zzso signaling and zzso activity in the mushroom zzso Thus, we concluded that sleep might be regulated by zzso through modulating the zzso signal zzso zzso
