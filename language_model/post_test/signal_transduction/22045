The molecular motor zzso is regulated by the zzso zzso and zzso disease zzso zzso of zzso disrupt zzso motor zzso Besides abnormalities in the central nervous system, HD animal models develop prominent peripheral pathology, with defective brown tissue zzso and dysfunctional white zzso but whether this peripheral zzso is zzso by zzso dysfunction is zzso Here, we observed prominently increased zzso in mice harboring the legs at odd angles zzso or the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso heavy chain zzso In zzso mice, zzso occurred in the absence of energy imbalance and was the result of impaired zzso zzso A similar zzso was observed in zzso zzso upon chemical zzso of zzso showing that loss of functional zzso leads to impairment of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue displayed increased zzso oxygen species production that was, at least zzso responsible for the decreased cellular responses to zzso and subsequent zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso also affected zzso efficacy to elicit a zzso response and led to zzso abnormalities in brown zzso tissue and cold intolerance in zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, protein levels of zzso were decreased in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso our results provide genetic evidence that zzso plays a key role in zzso metabolism and zzso through a zzso of zzso stress zzso by zzso This peripheral zzso of zzso zzso mice is similar to that observed in various animal models of zzso lending further support for a functional link between zzso and zzso
