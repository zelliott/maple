zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso cell zzso Although three zzso are known in zzso zzso roles of each zzso are still zzso Furthermore, our recent findings show that zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso 

To determine which zzso is responsible for the zzso signal zzso in human zzso and whether zzso is capable to regulate zzso activity of a specific zzso 

zzso zzso of each zzso zzso was investigated after zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso Effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso activity was also zzso 

zzso for zzso 2 and 3 demonstrated marked zzso of zzso in zzso to zzso cells of zzso skin, whereas they were expressed zzso in upper zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In cultured zzso only zzso is zzso into nucleus after zzso zzso zzso which localized in the zzso or zzso which was confined in nucleus, remained in the same compartment after zzso zzso We confirmed that only zzso zzso was zzso after zzso zzso in cultured zzso In addition, zzso zzso suppressed zzso activity of zzso but did not affect zzso or zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is associated with zzso signal zzso in human zzso and zzso is a zzso of this zzso
