zzso (also called zzso is a tumor zzso in the zzso signaling zzso that is genetically zzso in approximately zzso of all pancreatic zzso We investigated whether prognosis after surgical zzso for invasive pancreatic zzso is influenced by zzso zzso 

Using zzso we characterized the zzso protein status of zzso pancreatic zzso zzso from patients who underwent zzso zzso zzso at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD, between 1990 and zzso The zzso gene status of 56 of zzso zzso pancreatic zzso was also zzso A zzso Cox zzso hazards model assessed the relative risk of mortality associated with zzso status, adjusting for known zzso zzso 

Patients with pancreatic zzso with zzso protein expression had significantly longer survival zzso median survival was zzso months as compared with zzso months in patients with pancreatic zzso lacking zzso protein zzso P zzso zzso This zzso survival benefit persisted after adjustment for zzso factors including tumor size, margins, zzso zzso status, pathological stage, blood loss, and use of zzso zzso The relative hazard of mortality for zzso lacking zzso after adjusting for other zzso factors was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Patients undergoing zzso zzso for pancreatic zzso survive longer if their zzso express zzso
