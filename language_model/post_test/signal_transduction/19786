The mechanism of zzso effects on seed zzso and zzso growth was investigated in wheat zzso zzso 2 subjected to different zzso zzso High zzso of lead and zzso zzso significantly inhibited seed zzso and the growth of roots and zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso could reverse zzso effects on seed zzso zzso elevated zzso generation was observed in zzso seeds exposed to zzso Analysis using fluorescent dye zzso zzso showed significantly increased zzso level in the root tissue in response to lead zzso zzso oxide zzso donor sodium zzso could alleviate the zzso effects on seed zzso and shoot growth, which was blocked by zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso generation of zzso zzso is responsible for zzso effect on seed zzso the protection of zzso NO against lead toxicity involved in seed zzso and zzso shoot growth may be associated with zzso signaling zzso
