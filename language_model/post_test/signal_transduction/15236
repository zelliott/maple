zzso zzso zzso and zzso are industrially zzso strains that produce moderate and high levels of the zzso zzso zzso zzso A, respectively, in an zzso zzso zzso The possibility that these strains could be used for high zzso production of a zzso zzso product was investigated by expression of the entire zzso zzso zzso zzso using an zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso led to stable production of approximately zzso zzso zzso C (the final zzso zzso and approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso (the penultimate zzso zzso and resulted in a zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso in the zzso led to higher levels of zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso C and approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso without any zzso decrease in the higher zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso production in this strain through deletion of the corresponding zzso genes did not lead to higher levels of zzso zzso In the case of the zzso host, zzso of the zzso C and virtually all of the zzso zzso were zzso suggesting feedback zzso leads to the zzso of the final zzso zzso These observations contrast those made for the native producer zzso zzso where the zzso product is zzso C and zzso zzso are significantly lower levels zzso zzso zzso and demonstrate the potential utility of zzso zzso strains as zzso hosts for high level expression of a variety of zzso zzso derived zzso
