The presence of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso cells has by now been well established, as has the presence of the zzso responsible for their zzso However, our understanding of the role of these nuclear zzso in regulating cellular events has lagged far behind that for its zzso zzso It is clear, though, that the nuclear zzso pool is independent of the zzso pool and is, therefore, likely to be regulating a unique set of cellular zzso As with its zzso zzso many nuclear zzso and their zzso zzso are located at distinct zzso zzso This arrangement zzso limits the production and activity of zzso zzso and is believed to be a major mechanism for regulating their zzso Here, we will introduce the components of nuclear zzso zzso signal zzso and discuss how their spatial arrangement may dictate which nuclear functions they are zzso
