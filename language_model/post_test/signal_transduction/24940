zzso zzso and zzso of zzso targets this inhibitor of zzso for zzso degradation, thus permitting the release of active zzso Upon cell zzso zzso zzso results in zzso and zzso of its own zzso zzso As reported earlier, the zzso inhibitor is then accumulated in the nucleus, where it rapidly binds to and zzso the function of nuclear zzso upon withdrawal of the zzso The present work was aimed at understanding how zzso activity is preserved while stimuli persist, despite intense, simultaneous zzso zzso which would be expected to end zzso zzso We here show that incoming zzso in the nucleus represents a target for resident nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation of zzso and zzso zzso occurs in the nucleus, thus permitting the onset and persistence of zzso activity as long as stimulation is zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso is necessarily required to avoid zzso of zzso activity during cell zzso
