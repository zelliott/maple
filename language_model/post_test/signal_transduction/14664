We examined the impact of zzso flow obstruction in large zzso zzso vessels in zzso A silk zzso was placed 2 zzso downstream from the zzso or zzso zzso zzso and tightened to interrupt zzso At 6, 12 and 16 weeks after zzso flow zzso a network of small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso could be observed in the vicinity of the zzso These were identified using zzso to the zzso zzso markers zzso or zzso or zzso with the upstream zzso injection of the zzso cell dye zzso The observed zzso coincided with increased levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso In the zzso zzso saline was infused into the zzso ducts upstream of the zzso zzso The slopes of the inflow pressure versus flow relationships were zzso immediately after vessel zzso zzso at 6 weeks and zzso at zzso zzso For comparison, the average slope in a completely intact zzso system was zzso (from a previous zzso The resistance to flow remained high up to zzso weeks after flow obstruction suggesting that normal flow parameters had not been achieved over this zzso The zzso zzso appeared to have some role in limiting the impact of zzso zzso zzso a function that appeared to be compromised by zzso zzso
