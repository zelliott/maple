The zzso surface of the zzso zzso is formed by the migration of the lateral zzso cells to cover the zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for this zzso zzso in zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso lead to incomplete zzso closure, resulting in a hole in the zzso zzso The molecules downstream of zzso in this signaling zzso have not been zzso Here we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso of zzso causes decreased interaction with zzso zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso in the leading edge of the zzso zzso is identified as a genetic target of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso of zzso is able to rescue the zzso closure zzso of zzso and restores zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso the defects in zzso closure caused by zzso These data indicate that the interaction of zzso with zzso contributes to the zzso closure signaling zzso and targets zzso zzso
