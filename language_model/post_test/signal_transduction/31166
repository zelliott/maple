zzso diabetes zzso is one of the most frequent complications after kidney zzso It is considered to be one cause of chronic zzso zzso This study sought to investigate the effects of high zzso on the expression and nuclear zzso of zzso which is an important signal zzso involved in the zzso signal zzso 

The established rat zzso zzso cell line zzso was cultured in medium with various zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso which was collected at 7, 14, or 21 zzso The total expression of zzso including both inner and outer nucleus proteins was examined by Western zzso zzso The nuclear zzso zzso representing only the inner nucleus zzso was detected by zzso zzso observed under a laser zzso scanning zzso 

No significant difference in the total zzso expression was demonstrated by Western zzso analysis among the three groups of zzso cells at various concentration of zzso after 7, 14, or 21 zzso There was no zzso detected in the nucleus at day 7 by zzso zzso however, robust positive expression of zzso was detected at days 14 and zzso 

As a restricted zzso member, zzso protein might not be zzso in the presence of high zzso However, with prolonged culture time, zzso zzso from zzso to nucleus, which may be a pivotal step in the zzso signal zzso
