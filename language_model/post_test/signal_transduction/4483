Recent findings have suggested that zzso oxygen species zzso are important signaling molecules for regulating plant responses to zzso and zzso stress and that there exist zzso and zzso pathways for zzso zzso In plant cells, a major source of zzso is zzso in which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a role in the regulation of zzso zzso Here, to clarify the signaling function of zzso derived from the zzso we created a conditional system for producing zzso in the zzso by zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso When the expression of zzso was silenced in leaves, levels of oxidized protein in zzso increased in the absence of zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso affects the expression of a large set of zzso some of which are involved in the response to chilling and zzso In response to zzso zzso the transcript levels of zzso binding factor zzso a central regulator for cold zzso was zzso resulting in a high sensitivity of zzso plants to zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso enhanced the levels of salicylic acid zzso and the response to zzso Interestingly, we found that zzso zzso genes were zzso or zzso by high light zzso and that zzso zzso had a negative effect on expression of zzso genes under zzso suggesting synergistic and zzso roles of zzso zzso in zzso zzso These findings provide a new insight into the role of zzso retrograde signaling from zzso in the response to stress in zzso
