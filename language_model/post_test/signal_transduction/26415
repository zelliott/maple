Tight regulation of cell numbers by controlling cell proliferation and zzso is important during zzso Recently, the zzso zzso has been shown to regulate tissue growth and organ size in zzso In zzso cells, it also affects cell proliferation and differentiation in various zzso including the nervous zzso zzso of several signaling zzso such as zzso zzso and Sonic zzso zzso zzso control cell proliferation during zzso zzso However, it remains unclear whether the zzso zzso coordinates with other signaling zzso in regulating zzso zzso Here, we used zzso cells, a mouse embryonic zzso cell line, as a model to study roles of zzso a core component of the zzso pathway, in zzso zzso zzso cells can be induced to differentiate into zzso by expressing a neural zzso zzso factor gene zzso Our results showed that zzso promoted cell proliferation and inhibited zzso zzso zzso of zzso activated zzso but not zzso or zzso signaling activity during zzso zzso Furthermore, expression of zzso increased the expression of zzso zzso 1 zzso a downstream target of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso a zzso factor of the zzso pathway, promoted zzso differentiation even when zzso was zzso We further demonstrated that zzso of zzso inhibited zzso differentiation in primary mouse cortical zzso and zzso zzso rescued the differentiation zzso in zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, our study reveals that zzso signaling acts downstream of zzso in regulating zzso zzso
