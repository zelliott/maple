Each type of zzso develops a unique zzso critical to its function, but almost all start with the basic plan of one long zzso and multiple short, zzso zzso Though zzso signals are known to direct many steps in the development of zzso structure, little is understood about the initiation of zzso particularly zzso We find that zzso retinal zzso cells zzso zzso early will extend zzso and not zzso in zzso zzso If zzso develop longer in zzso prior to zzso many now extend zzso processes in zzso suggesting that an zzso factor is required to stimulate zzso zzso Members of the transforming growth factor beta zzso zzso bone zzso protein 2 zzso and growth and differentiation factor 11 zzso can signal cultured zzso to form zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso have an zzso zzso blocking zzso signaling with a zzso zzso or zzso receptors reduces the number of primary zzso extended in zzso
