Adult stem cells are set aside during development in order to provide a source for zzso of tissue over time in response to damage or simply wear and zzso The literature suggests that stem cells can be found in most major organ systems, and that they possess defining zzso namely the ability to both zzso and differentiate down one or more specific zzso Many groups have sought to define stem cell specific physiology in a molecular fashion by identifying those genes specifically expressed in stem zzso Although these data suggest that there are genes frequently found to be zzso in stem cells from various zzso they do not definitively demonstrate that these cells all function zzso There is also considerable data showing how various signaling pathways influence stem cell growth and zzso A review of this literature suggests that many of the zzso pathways affect adult zzso stem cells from different zzso similarly, and that these effects are sometimes unique to stem cells as opposed to their zzso In this review we zzso the effects of well-known signaling pathways on several of the most well defined stem cells and argue that the similarity with which unique stem cells from different zzso respond to external stimuli suggests that they share functional zzso
