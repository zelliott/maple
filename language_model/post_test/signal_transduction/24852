In the brain, zzso zzso is terminated predominantly by the rapid zzso of zzso released zzso into zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and its subsequent conversion into zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso To date, several factors have been identified that rapidly alter zzso zzso zzso by zzso modification of zzso zzso The only condition known to affect the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso is the zzso of zzso with zzso We now demonstrate that zzso regulate zzso zzso turnover via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the cerebral zzso zzso is zzso by zzso and acts on the zzso of zzso involved in zzso zzso Exposure of zzso to zzso increased the zzso zzso of zzso zzso by promoting the expression of zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, the zzso effects of zzso medium on zzso zzso zzso expression were attenuated in the presence of zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso zzso promoted zzso zzso expression only at distinctly higher zzso suggesting that zzso exerts its effects on zzso zzso turnover via zzso zzso Although zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso A zzso was sufficient to promote the expression of zzso the zzso of both zzso and protein zzso C zzso was required to promote zzso expression zzso Given the existence of various zzso zzso zzso that activate zzso and zzso to different levels, these findings point to a complex mechanism by which zzso regulates zzso zzso transport and zzso zzso of these regulatory mechanisms could represent a major cause for zzso neurological and psychiatric zzso
