zzso immunity provides the first line of host defense against invading microbial zzso This defense involves zzso zzso zzso receptors that detect viral zzso and activate the zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso leading to zzso of the innate zzso immune zzso The mechanisms by which the zzso zzso assembles on zzso are only partially zzso Here, we identify zzso motif 14 zzso as a zzso in the immune response against viral zzso zzso zzso to the outer membrane of zzso and interacts with zzso Upon viral infection, zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso and recruits zzso essential zzso to the zzso zzso leading to the zzso of both the zzso regulatory factor 3 and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the association between zzso essential zzso and zzso and zzso the zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso is a component of the zzso zzso immunity that zzso the immune response zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso
