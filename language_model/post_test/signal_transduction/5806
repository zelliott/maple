zzso studies suggest that zzso events such as prolonged seizures, stroke, or head trauma increase the risk of developing zzso later in zzso The process of zzso development, known as zzso is associated with changes in the expression of a myriad of zzso One of the major challenges for the zzso research community has been to determine which of these changes contributes to zzso which may be zzso and which may be zzso zzso this for any given gene is essential if it is to be considered a therapeutic target for the prevention or treatment of zzso Our laboratories have examined zzso in gene expression related to zzso zzso that have been proposed as contributing factors in zzso The zzso zzso mediates most fast synaptic zzso and changes in zzso zzso zzso expression and function have been reported in adult animals beginning immediately after prolonged zzso zzso zzso zzso and continue as animals become chronically zzso Prevention of zzso zzso zzso changes after zzso using viral gene transfer zzso development of zzso in an animal model, suggesting that these changes directly contribute to zzso The mechanisms that regulate differential expression of zzso zzso zzso in zzso after zzso have recently been identified, and include the zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso signaling pathways that alter the expression of genes involved in zzso may provide novel therapeutic approaches for preventing or zzso the development of zzso after a zzso zzso
