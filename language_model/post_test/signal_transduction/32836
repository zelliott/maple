zzso of zzso under zzso increases binding of translation initiation factor zzso to its zzso regulator zzso and this zzso with zzso of zzso zzso induced the same effect in zzso cells but no additive effect was observed when hypoxic cells were treated with zzso This enhanced association of zzso with zzso might be zzso by zzso Nevertheless, only zzso produces a rapid zzso of protein zzso Although zzso might be zzso via the zzso zzso by changing zzso zzso such a zzso is unlikely to be responsible for the depression in overall protein synthesis under zzso
