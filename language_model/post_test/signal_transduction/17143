zzso zzso can zzso their zzso During limb zzso zzso zzso are transformed into zzso cells called zzso zzso These zzso cells show zzso Such so-called zzso zzso of cell differentiation is one of the main targets of zzso limb zzso zzso It is well recognized that nerve presence controls the initiation of limb zzso zzso nerve factors have been sought in zzso limb zzso To investigate it, a relatively new study system called the accessory limb model zzso was zzso Using zzso two signaling zzso zzso and zzso zzso came under zzso In the present study, Growth and differentiation zzso zzso application to wounded skin initiated limb zzso responses and resulted in induction of a zzso structure in the absence of a zzso However, the zzso structure showed defects as a zzso zzso such as absence of zzso zzso expression by in zzso zzso The defects could be zzso by additional zzso growth factor zzso zzso These two zzso zzso and zzso were sufficient to substitute for the nerve functions in the induction of limb zzso Indeed, zzso zzso and zzso applications with the zzso skin graft resulted in limb formation without nerve zzso Furthermore, acquisition of cartilage differentiation potential of zzso zzso was tested in an in zzso and in zzso combination zzso zzso zzso cultured with zzso were difficult to participate in cartilage formation when the cultured cells were grafted into cartilage forming zzso In contrast, zzso zzso cultured with zzso and zzso became easier to participate into cartilage formation in the same zzso These results contribute to our understanding of molecular mechanisms of the early phase of zzso limb zzso
