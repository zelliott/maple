The recent discoveries in the field of human small heat shock proteins zzso clearly point to the important roles played by these zzso zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of a large spectrum of vital cellular processes and in pathological zzso These proteins are therefore considered as very attractive therapeutic zzso 

To understand the functions of the zzso members of the zzso family, zzso zzso and zzso and be able to zzso zzso their activities, researchers are faced with the complex zzso and zzso properties of these proteins and with their ability to interact with each other and with specific protein zzso Here, we have zzso in a functionally zzso way, the up-to-date literature data concerning zzso zzso and zzso protein interactions which reflect their numerous crucial cellular zzso We also present data supporting the idea that specific zzso zzso of zzso are involved in the interaction with particular client zzso 

More information concerning the interactions between client protein targets and zzso or the multiple zzso zzso zzso complexes formed by different zzso are urgently required to elaborate a comprehensive zzso protein zzso and propose efficient and zzso therapeutic zzso
