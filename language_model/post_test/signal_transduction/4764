Native and non-native zzso of the T cell zzso zzso including zzso have been proposed to induce signaling in T cells via zzso or zzso zzso zzso within the zzso regions of zzso zzso We have investigated whether any signatures can be found for such zzso structural changes during zzso triggering induced by zzso using zzso and zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso enabled the first direct structural comparisons of zzso and zzso forms of zzso from a single species, which revealed that zzso binding does not induce any substantial zzso within zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso coupled with zzso of zzso signaling by the zzso complexes, suggests a new zzso for the complex within which zzso is highly exposed and reveals that no large new zzso zzso are required to form during zzso zzso The zzso complex therefore appears to be a structure that is capable of initiating zzso signaling in T cells without substantial structural zzso within or between the component zzso Our findings raise the possibility that signaling by native zzso might also be initiated in the absence of large structural zzso in the zzso
