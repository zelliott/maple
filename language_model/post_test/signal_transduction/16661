zzso of zzso zzso sets has recently emerged as an important step for building zzso and dynamic models of gene network from DNA zzso We present an zzso approach in which dynamic programming zzso is embedded into a genetic zzso zzso for fitness function evaluation of small zzso sets (with m zzso within a large-scale genetic network of zzso zzso where zzso zzso zzso This approach reduces a zzso optimal problem of high dimension into a zzso search problem on zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso closure forms the basic fitness evaluation for selecting candidate zzso generated by zzso zzso By introducing bounded zzso and zzso crossover operators to zzso the feasible solution domain, small zzso zzso sets for large genetic networks can be found with much reduced zzso zzso zzso results have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of our zzso approach for offering highly efficient solutions to large scale zzso zzso zzso zzso We also describe dedicated zzso hardware using field zzso gate zzso zzso in which significant zzso could be obtained over software zzso
