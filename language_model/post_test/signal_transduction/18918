Feeding promotes protein synthesis in cardiac muscle through a stimulation of the zzso translation initiation phase of protein synthesis either secondary to zzso rises in insulin or because of direct effects of nutrients zzso The present set of experiments establishes the effects of meal feeding on the potential signal zzso pathways that may be important in accelerating zzso translation zzso Hearts were obtained from male Sprague zzso rats that had been trained to consume a meal consisting of zzso diet prior to, zzso and following the test zzso zzso feeding raised the extent of zzso of zzso initiation factor zzso zzso which returned to zzso levels within 3 h of removal of zzso Likewise, meal feeding was associated with an increase in zzso of zzso binding zzso in the zzso during zzso zzso of zzso target of zzso zzso on zzso or zzso or zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso on zzso was not affected by meal feeding or following removal of zzso Likewise, the extent of zzso of zzso a potential upstream regulator of zzso was not significantly altered during meal zzso zzso of protein zzso B zzso zzso was elevated at all time points after initiating meal zzso Similarly, the zzso of protein zzso zzso but not zzso was elevated at all time points after initiating meal zzso We conclude from these studies that meal feeding stimulates at least 2 signal pathways in cardiac muscle that raises zzso of zzso and zzso during meal feeding and results in sustained increases in zzso of zzso and zzso
