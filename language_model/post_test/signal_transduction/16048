zzso zzso is a synthetic zzso zzso zzso of the zzso family currently in phase II clinical zzso The mechanisms of cell death induced by zzso remain zzso 

Human zzso lung cancer zzso cell lines zzso and zzso were used to evaluate zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as effects on cell zzso signaling zzso 

zzso at clinically achievable zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso and zzso cells but did not cause nuclear zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso suggesting that classical zzso is not its main mechanism of cell zzso In contrast, zzso cell death was associated with several characteristics of zzso including an increase in zzso zzso zzso content, levels of zzso zzso zzso of the levels of zzso and zzso and an associated compromise of the zzso flux resulting in increased number of zzso and/or zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso of zzso gene expression by zzso partially inhibited zzso cell zzso zzso caused zzso of zzso signaling pathways and zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso or with the zzso inhibitor zzso led to a significant increase in zzso cell zzso Furthermore, zzso caused the zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso by zzso at zzso and zzso of zzso expression with zzso caused also a partial but significant reduction of zzso cell zzso In zzso zzso significantly inhibited subcutaneous zzso tumor growth in nude mice zzso zzso zzso in association with induction of zzso 

Our data indicate that zzso causes cell death by a complex mechanism that involves increased zzso content, due for the most part to impairment of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso pathway, and zzso of zzso This unique mechanism of action justifies the continued development of this agent for the treatment of zzso
