zzso zzso cells are a transient cell population of the zzso that is critical for brain zzso In the zzso zzso cells zzso zzso to instruct the zzso migration of projection zzso It has remained zzso however, whether zzso cells provide additional molecular cues important for brain zzso Here, we show that zzso cells express the zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso projection zzso express its preferred binding partner, zzso We demonstrate that zzso and zzso interactions between zzso cells and zzso zzso are critical for zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso signaling to zzso promotes zzso zzso function via zzso and zzso thus directing the broadly expressed zzso cell zzso zzso zzso toward zzso zzso zzso interactions between zzso and zzso zzso Our findings identify zzso and zzso as components of the zzso signaling zzso and demonstrate that coincidence signaling between zzso zzso zzso and short-range guidance cues direct zzso zzso
