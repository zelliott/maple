We have begun to explore the downstream signaling pathways of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso that control zzso guidance decisions in the zzso central nervous zzso We have focused our studies on the zzso zzso zzso zzso which binds directly to and is an in zzso zzso for the zzso zzso Here we show that zzso and zzso form stable complexes in zzso Schneider 2 zzso cells and in zzso zzso zzso We also demonstrate that the zzso zzso domain is sufficient to zzso binding to zzso zzso has a short zzso domain containing four zzso all found within sequences similar to zzso family zzso zzso motifs zzso We demonstrate that zzso is zzso zzso in zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso becomes zzso zzso following incubation with zzso zzso or upon zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an unknown zzso zzso form stable complexes with zzso thereby implicating them in a putative zzso signaling zzso When zzso with zzso either full-length zzso or its zzso domain mediates zzso zzso whereas a zzso inactive zzso zzso domain does zzso The neural zzso zzso can also induce zzso zzso but does not zzso with zzso Taken together, the results suggest that zzso zzso signals via zzso of its zzso zzso zzso on zzso might function as binding sites for downstream signaling zzso thereby initiating a signaling cascade that could be modulated in zzso by zzso such as zzso
