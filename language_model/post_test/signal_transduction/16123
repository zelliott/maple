Our previous study on zzso changes in the aged liver described immune cell zzso and zzso of inflammation with zzso zzso of zzso zzso a known cell cycle zzso were elevated in the aging zzso Here, we determine the role played by zzso in the delayed zzso response observed in the aged zzso We observed elevated zzso signaling in both aged zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso deletion of the major zzso zzso zzso and the natural killer cells, leads to a reduction in the zzso levels accompanied with the restoration of the DNA synthesis zzso in the aged zzso zzso zzso mice zzso upon zzso exhibited an earlier entry into the cell cycle compared with zzso zzso Thus, our study strongly suggests that an age-related zzso in inflammatory conditions in the liver often dubbed as zzso has a zzso effect on the zzso zzso
