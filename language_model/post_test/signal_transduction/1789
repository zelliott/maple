zzso fluid basic calcium zzso zzso zzso are common in zzso and are often associated with destructive zzso involving cartilage zzso These zzso are zzso and induce zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso synthesis and zzso in human zzso To date, zzso zzso signal zzso pathways have not been completely zzso Because protein zzso C zzso is known to play an important role in signal zzso we investigated the participation of this zzso in the zzso crystal induction of zzso and zzso zzso and protein expressions in human zzso Using reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and Northern and Western zzso techniques, we show here that zzso crystal stimulation of zzso and zzso zzso and protein expressions in human zzso is dependent upon the zzso zzso signal zzso zzso and that the zzso alpha zzso is specifically involved in the zzso We have previously shown that zzso crystal induction of zzso and zzso is also dependent on the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso We now show that these two pathways operate independently and seem to complement each zzso This leads to our hypothesis that the two pathways initially function zzso ultimately leading to an increase in zzso and zzso zzso and may zzso downstream of zzso and zzso zzso to mediate zzso zzso cellular zzso
