To clarify the zzso mechanisms of action of zzso zzso we determined the effects of zzso on zzso synaptic transmission associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso in cultured zzso and transmission in both direct and indirect pathways of zzso zzso using zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso releases of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined by extreme zzso with zzso zzso among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso transmission was examined by zzso with extreme zzso zzso zzso transfer zzso Acute and chronic zzso administration increased zzso release of zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso administration increased the release of zzso zzso zzso and zzso but had minimal zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso administration increased zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso but enhanced zzso that of zzso zzso rises in zzso and zzso were inhibited by zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso transmission via zzso of groups II and III zzso zzso enhanced zzso release of zzso zzso of group II zzso zzso and group III zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited transmission in direct and indirect pathways of zzso zzso These mechanisms contribute to effectiveness and well zzso of zzso as an adjunct treatment for Parkinson's disease during zzso zzso This article is part of the Special zzso entitled 'The zzso zzso of zzso zzso
