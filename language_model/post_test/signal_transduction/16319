zzso and zzso differentiate from a common precursor cell, the zzso stem cell zzso zzso is known to signal via four zzso zzso zzso and significantly, recent findings indicate that these may play a role in zzso zzso We therefore investigated zzso zzso expression and zzso during the differentiation of zzso to zzso and zzso The zzso R was dominant in zzso and its expression and activity were zzso zzso at early stages of zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso of zzso R induced the expression of zzso genes zzso and alkaline zzso zzso as well as zzso activity, and stimulation increased zzso zzso The expression of zzso R was zzso during later stages of zzso zzso when its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso was accompanied by significant increases in zzso R and zzso R zzso and their zzso was associated with increased zzso zzso zzso R expression was sufficient to promote expression of zzso genes zzso and zzso and its zzso resulted in increased zzso differentiation and zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso R was involved mainly in zzso activity of zzso rather than in their zzso These results show that zzso receptors are zzso expressed and involved in zzso differentiation of zzso We zzso therefore, that fruitful strategies for treating diseases associated with an imbalance in the differentiation and function of these lineages should include targeting zzso zzso signal zzso Specifically, these research avenues will be useful in preventing or treating conditions with insufficient bone or excessive zzso zzso
