Central release of zzso zzso by the zzso neuroendocrine cells zzso responsible for systemic VP release is believed to be important in modulating the activity of these zzso during zzso Central VP release from zzso zzso and zzso is zzso by both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso is expressed in zzso its potential role in the zzso response to zzso is zzso The current study demonstrates that prolonged zzso increases zzso for zzso zzso and the type I zzso zzso in the zzso nucleus zzso of the zzso In addition, zzso stimulates local VP release in the zzso rat zzso in zzso and this effect is reduced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting the participation of zzso zzso zzso with its effects on local VP release, zzso also reduces zzso zzso and zzso release in the zzso rat zzso Furthermore, zzso VP release zzso by acute zzso is blocked by zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso in this zzso zzso with this, zzso revealed that local zzso release within the zzso is significantly elevated during acute zzso These results suggest that prolonged zzso of zzso zzso is accompanied by zzso of zzso and the type I zzso zzso in these cells and that zzso VP release in response to acute zzso is zzso by zzso of zzso receptors by zzso zzso released within the zzso A potential role for zzso in promoting efficient, but not zzso systemic release of VP from zzso during zzso challenge is zzso
