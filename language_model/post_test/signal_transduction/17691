In both zzso the zzso zzso disc comprises three zzso zzso the female zzso zzso derived from segment zzso the male zzso zzso derived from segment A9 and the zzso zzso derived from segments zzso Each zzso zzso has an anterior zzso and a zzso zzso zzso the P cells of the three segments being zzso at the lateral edges of the zzso We show that zzso zzso expressed in the P compartment zzso signals A cells at the zzso compartment border and A cells at the zzso zzso As in the wing zzso disc, cell lineage restriction of the zzso compartment border is defined by zzso zzso There is also a lineage restriction barrier at the zzso borders, even though the P compartment cells of the three segments zzso in the lateral areas of the zzso zzso restriction between segments A9 and zzso depends on factors other than the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso borders, however, can be permeable to some zzso zzso Furthermore, cell zzso experiments show that the presence of all zzso zzso the zzso or the zzso zzso during development are required for normal development of zzso zzso zzso these findings suggest that interaction between zzso zzso is required for the normal development of the zzso zzso
