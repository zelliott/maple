zzso zzso zzso technologies and zzso Association Studies zzso generate millions of reads and hundreds of zzso and there is an urgent need for a better way to accurately interpret and zzso such large amounts of zzso zzso zzso and network analysis allow for the discovery of highly significant pathways from a set of disease zzso healthy samples in the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso of these processes will lead to zzso of the complex biological pathways affected by drug treatment, to patient zzso studies of new and existing drug treatments, and to understanding the underlying zzso drug zzso There are approximately 141 biological human zzso resources as of Jan 2012 according to the zzso zzso However, most currently available resources do not contain disease, drug or organ specificity information such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, disease, drug and organ specificity together becomes increasingly crucial for understanding the zzso between zzso zzso and regulatory pathway, drug action, disease zzso and organ specificity from zzso zzso data zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

We designed the Integrated zzso Analysis Database for zzso zzso Analysis zzso zzso defining zzso between pathway, disease, drug and organ zzso based on six criteria: 1) comprehensive zzso zzso 2) zzso to zzso zzso 3) zzso between pathway, disease, drug, and zzso 4) multiple and quantitative measurement of enrichment and zzso 5) assessment of enrichment and zzso analysis with the context of the existing biological knowledge and a zzso zzso constructed from zzso and reliable zzso and 6) zzso of multiple available data zzso is a comprehensive database covering about zzso zzso zzso zzso 1956 zzso zzso diseases, zzso drugs, and 52 zzso integrated from databases including the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The database has a zzso user interface that allows users to perform enrichment analysis from zzso and zzso analysis from a pathway, disease, drug, and zzso the quality of the database was validated with the context of the existing biological knowledge and a zzso zzso constructed from zzso and reliable zzso Two case studies were also presented to zzso 1) zzso of enrichment analysis and zzso analysis on zzso zzso and 2) identification of previously undiscovered components by the enrichment analysis from a prostate cancer zzso 

zzso is a new resource for zzso zzso and zzso pathway, disease, drug, organ specificity and their zzso The statistical method we developed for enrichment and similarity measurement and the two criteria we described for setting the threshold parameters can be extended to other enrichment zzso Enriched zzso diseases, drugs, zzso and their zzso can be zzso displayed, and downloaded from our online user zzso The current zzso database can help users address a wide range of biological zzso zzso disease zzso zzso drug target related and organ specificity related questions in human disease zzso
