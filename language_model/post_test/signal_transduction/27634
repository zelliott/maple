In the zzso acute zzso zzso zzso all zzso zzso treatment zzso maturation leading to clinically complete but not durable zzso as zzso resistance develops in the treated patients as well as in zzso zzso and zzso zzso are known zzso of proliferation in various cells including those from zzso In this report, we show that they can act zzso to inhibit growth and to induce differentiation of zzso cells but not of two zzso zzso derived cell lines, zzso and zzso However, the resistant cell lines respond to zzso In zzso cells, zzso increases the expression of zzso zzso and zzso three zzso factors playing a central role in the zzso response and zzso the synthesis and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha seems to play a role in zzso of zzso cell growth but not in their zzso In the resistant cells, zzso and zzso both the induction of zzso and the increase of zzso and zzso expression by zzso are completely zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and protein expressions are induced in the three cell zzso This suggests that increase of zzso expression is not sufficient for zzso zzso Our results identify some defects linked to zzso in zzso and support the hypothesis that zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso may be one of the mechanisms zzso growth zzso by zzso
