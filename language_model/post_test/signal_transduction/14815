In the zzso zone of the adult zzso brain, neural zzso migrate into niches zzso by zzso processes and differentiate into zzso zzso In the present study, we report a modulating role for the scaffolding protein zzso in neural zzso zzso We have identified zzso as a new marker of amplifying neural zzso and zzso precursor cells of the zzso zone zzso and the zzso migratory stream zzso in the adult mouse zzso To determine functions for zzso in neural zzso we compared the properties of neural zzso cells from zzso and zzso zzso mice in zzso and in zzso The in zzso studies reveal a delay in the transition of de zzso neural zzso into zzso precursor cells in zzso zzso In zzso we demonstrated that zzso acts as a downstream zzso in the vascular zzso growth factor zzso migratory response of neural zzso that also impacts on their zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso are major partners of zzso in this migratory zzso Finally, zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso are shown to express zzso We propose that zzso zzso by zzso could be involved in the guidance of neural zzso to zzso niches and that zzso is an zzso of the zzso migratory zzso
