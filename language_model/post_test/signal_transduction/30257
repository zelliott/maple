zzso zzso mobility group box 1 zzso is a nuclear protein that can also act as an zzso trigger of zzso proliferation and migration, mainly through zzso (the zzso for advanced zzso end zzso zzso interactions have been found to be important in a number of zzso We investigated whether zzso is an zzso factor in human zzso zzso Western blots showed zzso and zzso expression in human zzso zzso cell zzso zzso induced a zzso increase in cell zzso which was found to be zzso and involved the zzso zzso Moreover, in a wounding model, it induced a significant increase in cell migration, and zzso zzso of zzso was crucial in giving the zzso cells a zzso zzso The fact that blocking DNA replication with zzso agents did not reduce the distance migrated suggests the independence of the zzso and migratory zzso We also found that zzso cells contain zzso predominantly in the nucleus, and cannot zzso it zzso or upon zzso however, zzso zzso cells can release zzso after it has zzso from the nucleus to zzso These findings provide the first evidence supporting the existence of zzso zzso pathways in human zzso cells, and suggest that zzso may play an important role in the relationship between necrosis and zzso in zzso zzso by acting as an zzso factor that is capable of promoting the growth and migration of zzso zzso
