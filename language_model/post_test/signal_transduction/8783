zzso zzso zzso deposits and zzso zzso are key hallmarks in Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso stimulates many signal zzso involved in the zzso zzso However, many mechanisms remain to be zzso because no definitive therapy of zzso zzso Some studies have focused on the control of translation which involves zzso and zzso main zzso factors of zzso The availability of these factors depends on the zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and the zzso target of zzso zzso zzso zzso positively regulates the translation while zzso results in a protein synthesis zzso Many studies demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso is zzso in cellular and animal models of zzso and in the brain of zzso zzso Interestingly, our results showed that zzso zzso and zzso levels were significantly increased in zzso of zzso zzso These modifications were significantly correlated with cognitive and memory test scores performed in zzso zzso On the contrary, the zzso zzso zzso is zzso in cellular and animal models of zzso Recently, we showed that zzso regulated protein in development and DNA damage response 1 and zzso sclerosis complex 2 could represent molecular links between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso could be an early zzso of the zzso death and a critical target for a therapeutic zzso in zzso
