Large zzso zzso zzso zzso channels are critical components of the zzso zzso cascade in a number of cells, including the carotid body and central zzso Although the nature of the BK channel zzso sensor is still unknown, evidence suggests zzso zzso might form part of the zzso sensing channel zzso By zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could act as such an zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso revealed high zzso expression in zzso cells expressing the zzso and zzso of human zzso BK and zzso zzso with zzso zzso blockade of zzso zzso inhibited BK channels, suggesting that this zzso protein partner contributes to zzso channel zzso However, zzso of zzso using zzso had no effect on hypoxic BK channel zzso Together, these data indicate that zzso is a zzso protein partner, that its activity regulates BK channels but that it is not the BK zzso zzso
