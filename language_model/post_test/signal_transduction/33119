The human CT zzso zzso which is found as three zzso belongs to a small, recently described zzso of G zzso receptors zzso Several zzso zzso have been shown to exhibit zzso (or zzso signaling activity and cause disease in humans, but only a few zzso have been identified with zzso activity in the zzso (or zzso zzso In the zzso zzso no zzso zzso has been shown to exhibit zzso activity and only one, a zzso zzso for zzso zzso has been found with zzso activity to cause disease in zzso We demonstrate that two zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso exhibit zzso activity by showing that they cause zzso of zzso and induction of a zzso gene in two cell types in culture in the absence of zzso The identical zzso that caused the zzso zzso zzso to be zzso active was made in zzso and shown to have no effect on zzso We suggest that zzso activity of zzso zzso and zzso may reflect an adaptation of their signaling properties to exert their regulatory function in the absence of zzso in some cell zzso
