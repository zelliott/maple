zzso is a zzso protein critically involved in signal zzso Recently, it is also identified as a nuclear zzso regulator, but the underlying mechanisms and zzso significance remain to be zzso Here, we identified zzso as an zzso zzso protein essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso depleted of zzso displayed severe zzso defects and especially failed to undergo zzso In addition, the expression of zzso a critical regulator of embryonic blood formation, and its downstream zzso genes were zzso by depletion of zzso while injection of zzso zzso or zzso zzso rescued the zzso zzso Further zzso studies revealed that zzso bound to and zzso the zzso group zzso zzso zzso and relieved zzso repression of zzso pathway, thus regulating zzso lineage zzso Taken together, this study demonstrated a critical role of zzso during zzso primitive zzso as well as an important regulator of zzso proteins and zzso zzso
