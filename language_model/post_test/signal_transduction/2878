Various forms of zzso between the zzso and zzso signal zzso systems can occur in animal cells depending upon the types of zzso zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso can be generated by hormone stimulation of type III zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso These zzso zzso are apparently due to the unique regulatory features of type III zzso zzso which is zzso by hormones and inhibited by elevated zzso in zzso zzso zzso were generated by zzso zzso or zzso stimulation of type III zzso zzso and were dependent upon the activity of zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso were not solely dependent upon zzso increases since zzso zzso or zzso did not stimulate zzso zzso We zzso that stimulation of type III zzso zzso leads to increased zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso As free zzso increases, type III zzso zzso activity is attenuated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels zzso When zzso levels drop below a threshold level, the zzso zzso zzso is zzso and zzso is zzso This cycle is repeated if type III zzso zzso is chronically exposed to an zzso This unique mechanism for generation of zzso zzso in cells is distinct from others documented in the zzso
