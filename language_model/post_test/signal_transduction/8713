zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso in almost half of all drug-resistant focal zzso Little is known about the gene expression profile of zzso As such information may help target zzso more zzso our aim was to perform a gene expression analysis of an animal model of cortical zzso induced by in zzso zzso 

Nine offspring from zzso animals, and nine zzso controls were sacrificed at zzso day zzso zzso and zzso regions were zzso and total zzso acid zzso was extracted using a commercially available kit zzso zzso was then subjected to a gene expression analysis using an zzso zzso platform zzso After statistical analysis, genes were considered zzso expressed when a p value less than zzso was zzso zzso quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso was used to confirm zzso results for three genes via the zzso zzso 

Twenty three genes from cortical tissue met criteria for altered gene zzso Six genes from zzso seemed relevant to the zzso of zzso Two genes that promoted cell survival zzso tissue growth factor and zzso were zzso One gene that promoted zzso zzso zzso was zzso Two genes involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso recycling zzso were zzso One zzso zzso involved in the control of zzso zzso was zzso 

Gene expression analysis in this animal model revealed some of the potential mechanisms by which CD may lead to the zzso of intractable zzso The zzso of genes that are involved in zzso and zzso zzso recycling may lead to increased zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso resulting from a zzso of zzso may also result in an increase in zzso zzso and/or zzso Finally, genes promoting cell survival, either directly zzso tissue growth factor, zzso or indirectly zzso may allow CD tissue to survive the zzso injury that it zzso thus allowing it to perpetuate the zzso condition over zzso
