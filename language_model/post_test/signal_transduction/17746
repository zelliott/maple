zzso plays a pathological role in cardiac zzso by directly affecting cardiac zzso zzso of the cellular mechanisms of zzso action in cardiac zzso however, is zzso One possibility is that zzso promotes proliferation of cardiac zzso by zzso specific cellular signaling zzso The current study tests whether zzso stimulates proliferation of isolated adult rat cardiac zzso zzso by zzso Kirsten Ras zzso and its zzso the zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso significantly increased zzso zzso This action was sensitive to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of MR in zzso and the whole rat heart was confirmed by zzso zzso significantly increased absolute and active zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso in addition, significantly increased zzso and zzso The effects of zzso on zzso and zzso proteins were inhibited by zzso but not zzso suggesting that zzso acts via zzso zzso of zzso and zzso prevented zzso zzso of zzso and zzso These results show that zzso directly increases zzso proliferation through zzso zzso of zzso and its zzso the zzso zzso zzso of cardiac zzso through such a cascade may play a role in the pathological actions exerted by zzso on the zzso
