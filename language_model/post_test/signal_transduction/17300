To investigate the effects of zzso on proliferation of zzso rat zzso and the zzso 

Ten 24 hours old zzso rats were executed by zzso The zzso of rats were removed and cut into blocks of 1 zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso After zzso by zzso for 15 zzso the zzso were zzso by type I zzso for one hour two zzso The mixed cells were cultured in thermostat incubator with zzso CO2 under the condition of 37 degrees zzso To identify the cells, zzso zzso and zzso red zzso were performed after cultured 48 h and 28 zzso The zzso were randomly divided into five zzso zzso were treated with zzso at zzso of 100, 50, 25, zzso 0 zzso zzso method was used to evaluate the proliferation after 24 zzso h and 72 zzso The expression of zzso and zzso protein were detected through the method of Western zzso after one zzso 

The cells had irregular shapes and showed typical features of zzso The results of zzso zzso and zzso red zzso were both zzso zzso detection showed that the zzso with final concentration of 100 zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso after 24 zzso while the zzso with final zzso of 50 zzso and 25 zzso displayed the zzso effect after 48 zzso The zzso of zzso zzso had no obvious influence on the proliferation of zzso The result of Western zzso showed that zzso reduced the expression of zzso and zzso protein in a zzso zzso 

The zzso with final zzso of 100, 50, 25 zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso with final zzso of zzso zzso had no obvious influence on the proliferation of zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso may inhibit the proliferation of zzso by regulating the zzso signaling in zzso
