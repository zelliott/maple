zzso zzso zzso mice have been shown to have a zzso in negative selection of zzso T cells during zzso zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso promotes deletion of zzso zzso has not yet been zzso We have studied negative selection in response to zzso zzso in zzso mice and, consistent with previous reports, have found a zzso in negative selection in these zzso To test the requirement for expression of zzso on T cells undergoing negative selection, we have generated zzso mice in which zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We find that both zzso zzso and zzso zzso undergo equivalent and efficient negative selection when these populations coexist in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso can function in a zzso manner during negative zzso zzso of zzso zzso was normal in zzso zzso mice, indicating that zzso negative selection is not solely zzso by B7 zzso and zzso of zzso T cell zzso Finally, although the absence of zzso interactions zzso negative selection of zzso zzso and zzso cells during zzso development, we find that zzso T cells are deleted in the mature zzso population through a zzso zzso
