In a series of publications, the author used the correlation hypothesis to explain the main mechanisms of functioning of bat and zzso echo zzso A good fit of calculated parameters to experimental data was zzso In this work, by the example of zzso of the recognition problem, the use by the brain of correlation methods for solving more general problems independently on the zzso of sensor signals was zzso In favor of the hypothesis that correlation methods are widely used in brain functioning are the data presented in the paper, which prove that an zzso zzso is a suitable analog zzso It is suited for rapid zzso of the zzso function of discrete input and reference zzso The set of weighting zzso of zzso synaptic zzso serve as such zzso The pool of zzso zzso determines the values on the correlation function in the required range by changing the zzso of zzso from zzso to zzso at which discrete signals zzso
