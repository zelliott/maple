The earliest visible indications for the transition to zzso in zzso eggs, known as egg zzso are cortical zzso zzso zzso and resumption of zzso zzso these events are triggered by the zzso zzso through a series of zzso zzso The zzso within the egg, leading to the zzso zzso release and to the downstream cellular events, are currently under intensive zzso The involvement of zzso family zzso zzso in zzso release at zzso is well supported in marine zzso eggs but not in zzso zzso In a previous study we have shown the expression and zzso of zzso the first zzso member demonstrated in the zzso zzso The purpose of the current study was to identify other common zzso and resolve their function during zzso of zzso zzso All three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are distributed throughout the egg zzso However, zzso and zzso tend to concentrate at the egg cortex, though only zzso is localized to the zzso as zzso The different zzso of the various zzso imply the possibility of their different functions within the zzso To examine whether zzso participate in the signal zzso pathways during egg zzso we employed selective zzso of the zzso activity zzso and zzso The results demonstrate that zzso which is triggered by zzso zzso is an zzso process, while zzso triggered by either zzso zzso or protein zzso C zzso is zzso The possible involvement of zzso in the signal zzso pathways that lead from the zzso fusion site downstream of the zzso release remains zzso
