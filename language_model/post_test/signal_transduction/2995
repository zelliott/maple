zzso cells are best known as central zzso cells in zzso type I allergic diseases including asthma and hay zzso An increasing amount of evidence, however, has demonstrated that mast cells are zzso cells playing a critical role in host defense against invading zzso zzso cells are located immediately beneath the zzso surfaces exposed to the outer environment, such as zzso and gastrointestinal zzso skin, and zzso This review discusses recent studies on the critical roles of mast cells in host defense against zzso bacterial zzso zzso cells are equipped with multiple receptors detecting the invading zzso bacteria in both direct zzso and indirect zzso zzso The former includes zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso while the latter includes zzso receptors zzso and complement zzso In addition to the detecting systems, mast cells are also armed with versatile tools to combat and kill zzso zzso In response to the recognition of the zzso bacterial infection, mast cells zzso various types of zzso which either regulate host immune system or directly attack the zzso zzso cells can also zzso and subsequently display the bacterial zzso on their cell zzso Moreover, recent findings have revealed the formation of zzso traps by mast zzso Finally this review will especially focus on recent findings on zzso signaling in mast cells, both the functional outcome and the molecular zzso
