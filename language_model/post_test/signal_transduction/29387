zzso zzso signaling regulates zzso zzso orientation of cells or groups of cells within whole zzso Although zzso signaling has been analyzed in several zzso little is known about nuclear events acting downstream of zzso signaling in the zzso cell fate decision in the zzso eye or in other zzso Here we demonstrate a specific requirement for zzso and the zzso factors zzso zzso Yan and zzso in zzso dependent zzso zzso Loss and zzso zzso suggest that the zzso factors integrate input from zzso and zzso and that the zzso factors zzso and Yan cooperate with zzso (and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso downstream of zzso signaling or parallel to it) and Yan are required in zzso to specify its fate zzso or inhibit zzso fate zzso and that zzso is required in zzso via zzso for its fate zzso Taken together with previous work establishing a zzso zzso function in zzso we conclude that zzso zzso zzso and zzso integrate zzso zzso and zzso signaling input in zzso or zzso to establish cell fate and zzso zzso
