The target of zzso zzso is a highly zzso protein zzso and a central controller of zzso zzso zzso complex 2 zzso regulates zzso zzso family members and is implicated in various disorders, including cancer and zzso Here we report that zzso is localized to the zzso zzso zzso zzso termed zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso to zzso was growth zzso and zzso at zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso channel 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso disrupted zzso causing zzso defects including increases in zzso membrane potential, zzso production, and calcium zzso zzso controlled zzso integrity and zzso function via zzso zzso zzso of the zzso associated proteins zzso zzso 2, and zzso zzso cluster sorting protein zzso Thus, zzso is at the core of a zzso signaling hub that controls growth and zzso
