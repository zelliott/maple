The cellular protein synthesis machinery is tightly regulated and capable of rapid reaction to a variety of zzso zzso critical in zzso cell cycle control, cancer biology, and virus zzso One important strategy for stimulating protein synthesis involves the zzso zzso zzso which subsequently triggers zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso by an zzso protein complex zzso A recent paper demonstrated that zzso zzso virus zzso a remarkable tactic to activate zzso in infected zzso Instead of using the cellular zzso the virus produces a zzso zzso zzso zzso called zzso that doesn't look like zzso but zzso as zzso By making the zzso protein zzso this disguise allows it to bypass the strict limits normally imposed on the real cellular zzso zzso preventing the virus zzso from triggering zzso inhibited viral growth, suggesting a new way to block zzso zzso zzso This study also raises the possibility that other zzso may zzso hidden in our own zzso possibly contributing to diseases ranging from diabetes to zzso
