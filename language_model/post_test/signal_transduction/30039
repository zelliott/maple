We have previously observed zzso and zzso increases in zzso zzso 2 zzso protein levels in rat zzso zzso cells zzso after zzso However, the zzso involved remains zzso In the present study, irradiating zzso cells with zzso zzso gamma rays was associated with zzso and zzso increases in zzso zzso Studies using the zzso inhibitor zzso D zzso added 24 h after zzso revealed the zzso of zzso zzso to be approximately 8 h in control zzso In contrast, the increase in zzso zzso levels in zzso cells was essentially unchanged after incubation with zzso for up to 12 zzso zzso cells with the antioxidants zzso or zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso prior to zzso abolished the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells led to zzso oxygen zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso prevented the zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso cells with a zzso zzso zzso completely inhibited zzso zzso zzso and abolished the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Thus the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is due in part to increased zzso stability and is zzso by zzso the zzso zzso signaling zzso may be zzso
