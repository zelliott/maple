The zzso zzso and zzso family zzso have been implicated in zzso zzso associated with zzso development and several neurodegenerative zzso However, the mechanisms by which these zzso pathways regulate zzso remain zzso In this study we have investigated the role of these zzso in zzso cell death using an established model of zzso factor deprivation induced zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso family proteins are known to be central regulators of zzso and we have determined that the zzso family member zzso is zzso zzso in zzso factor deprived zzso and that zzso induction is required for zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso induction is dependent on both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is known to regulate a number of downstream zzso however we have determined that zzso zzso zzso zzso expression through a zzso zzso Finally we demonstrate that the zzso and zzso pathways zzso to regulate zzso zzso zzso of zzso In summary we have identified a novel and critical link between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the regulation of zzso induction and suggest that this may be pivotal to the regulation of zzso zzso in neurodegenerative zzso
