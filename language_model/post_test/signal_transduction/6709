Stem cell survival and retention in zzso after injury following adoptive transfer is zzso zzso zzso levels coinciding with zzso injury adversely affect cardiac zzso cell zzso zzso The G zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso enhance zzso zzso survival, and zzso the zzso axis in failing heart, however zzso effects of zzso on zzso survival and proliferation are zzso zzso we investigated whether the protective effects of zzso expression seen in the failing heart relate to zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso enhanced zzso signaling through protective zzso receptors zzso In addition, to the actions of zzso expression on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso also increased zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso zzso but had limited effects in zzso engineered zzso providing evidence for the strength of the zzso in zzso zzso in these zzso Increased proliferation and zzso activity were observed in zzso zzso following zzso stimulation indicating improved zzso zzso zzso modification of zzso increased survival and proliferation following adoptive transfer in an acute zzso zzso model zzso with increased expression of zzso Thus, zzso engineering of zzso promotes survival and proliferation of injected cells following zzso zzso which includes improved zzso tolerance essential for stem cell zzso
