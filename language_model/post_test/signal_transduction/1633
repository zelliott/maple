The zzso T cell receptors zzso and zzso zzso are similar in both sequence and zzso however, zzso and zzso T cells are not merely similar zzso with subtly different zzso These cell types differ in several ways, including the types of zzso zzso the mechanism of zzso presentation and recognition and the mechanism and zzso of downstream signaling zzso zzso zzso can directly recognize zzso in the form of intact proteins or zzso compounds, unlike zzso zzso which recognize zzso zzso bound to major zzso complex molecules zzso One of the major classes of human zzso T cells expresses zzso zzso which recognize zzso zzso and zzso zzso This review focuses on the recently determined structure of a zzso zzso with emphasis on zzso recognition and zzso zzso
