DNA zzso in gene promoters is an zzso mechanism regulating gene expression in cellular zzso an important step in zzso Previously, we studied the genes zzso during zzso using spontaneously immortalized zzso from patients with zzso syndrome zzso who carry a zzso zzso in the tumor zzso gene zzso We found that multiple zzso zzso signaling zzso genes were regulated by zzso zzso In this study we focused on a key regulator of that pathway, the signal zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso Although zzso is zzso after cellular zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cells after zzso zzso treatment, we detected no zzso of the zzso promoter region in these cells before or after zzso To analyze the function of zzso in zzso we expressed zzso in zzso zzso cells by stable infection, expecting to induce zzso genes or cellular zzso or zzso However, the zzso of zzso alone was not sufficient to repress the proliferation rate of zzso zzso cells or induce zzso in zzso zzso zzso We concluded that zzso additional to zzso zzso zzso dependent or zzso are required for the zzso of zzso zzso
