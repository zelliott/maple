zzso cancer is one of the most deadly zzso affecting the Western zzso Because the disease is highly zzso and difficult to diagnosis until late zzso the zzso survival rate is around zzso The identification of molecular cancer drivers is critical for zzso our understanding of the disease and development of improved diagnostic tools and zzso We have conducted a zzso screen using Sleeping Beauty zzso in mice to identify new candidate cancer genes in pancreatic zzso By combining zzso with an zzso zzso zzso we observed highly zzso pancreatic zzso Using two independent statistical methods to identify zzso commonly zzso by zzso in these tumors, we identified zzso zzso that comprise zzso candidate cancer genes zzso 75 of these zzso including zzso and zzso have known zzso in human pancreatic zzso We identified point zzso in human pancreatic patient samples for another 11 zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso are involved in zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso and all zzso tumors have at least one zzso gene involved in this process; 20 zzso including zzso zzso and zzso are also significantly associated with poor patient zzso zzso zzso provides a rich resource of zzso in potential cancer drivers for zzso analyses with ongoing sequencing efforts in human pancreatic zzso
