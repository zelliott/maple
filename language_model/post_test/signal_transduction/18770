The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso factor critically involved in human prostate zzso zzso zzso control of zzso genes by zzso may require complex interaction among multiple zzso zzso We have previously shown that the zzso zzso zzso can interact with human zzso zzso In this study, we uncover important new functional zzso for zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso and enhances zzso zzso with a dynamic pattern of recruitment to zzso response elements in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with the zzso zzso zzso leading to reduced zzso protein levels and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for optimal zzso zzso and zzso zzso is involved in prostate cancer cell zzso In addition, zzso of zzso protein was detected in 73 of 82 zzso zzso prostate zzso with a strong correlation between increased zzso expression and aggressive disease, as zzso by high zzso sum scores and the presence of zzso disease zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso our data establish zzso as a key zzso of zzso function, opening a new direction for targeted therapy in aggressive human prostate zzso
