Fluorescent proteins have been used to generate a variety of zzso to zzso monitor biological phenomena in living zzso Among this class of genetically zzso zzso reporters for membrane potential have been a particular zzso The use of presently known zzso sensor proteins is limited by incorrect zzso zzso and small or absent zzso responses in zzso zzso 

Here we report on a fluorescent protein zzso sensor with superior targeting to the zzso plasma membrane and high responsiveness to membrane potential signaling in excitable zzso 

This zzso which we termed zzso is likely to lead to new methods of monitoring zzso active cells with cell type zzso zzso and in large numbers, zzso
