We investigated the regulation of zzso a zzso factor known to play a role in zzso by bone zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins in order to better understand their signaling function in zzso bone zzso The zzso zzso cell line zzso was zzso with zzso zzso expression levels were measured by quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction and Northern zzso We found that zzso was zzso by zzso in a zzso zzso The expression of zzso a downstream response gene of zzso was also significantly increased upon zzso zzso We also monitored zzso expression after the addition of zzso to zzso cell zzso zzso treatment increased zzso zzso levels in zzso considered to be early zzso but not in human zzso zzso zzso cells, which are thought to be more advanced in the zzso zzso This response seems to be influenced by differences in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells express zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso cells express zzso and zzso We also saw an increase in zzso zzso levels in zzso primary human bone cells zzso derived from zzso zzso We found that in addition to zzso Sonic and Indian zzso can increase zzso expression in zzso and primary zzso Time course studies with zzso cells after zzso stimulation showed increasing expression of cartilage zzso decrease of collagen I zzso and a late induction of zzso zzso Moreover, the treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso is a downstream zzso of zzso affecting the expression of zzso and zzso marker zzso Our data show that zzso is an important downstream zzso of the zzso and zzso signaling pathways in zzso zzso
