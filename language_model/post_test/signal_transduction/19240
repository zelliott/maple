Although zzso zzso is a major zzso zzso resident zzso it can also appear on the surface of various types of cells and it functions as an zzso zzso However, molecular mechanisms underlying the potent zzso activity of cell surface zzso are still zzso In the present study, a zzso zzso zzso covering the zzso N domain and partial P domain of zzso zzso has been expressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso assembles into zzso and zzso in solution and exhibits high binding affinity to various zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is capable of driving the zzso and maturation of B cells and zzso production by zzso in a zzso manner in zzso It specifically binds zzso mouse zzso but not zzso and zzso It is also able to trigger zzso class switching by B cells in the absence of T cell help both in zzso and in zzso Furthermore, this zzso of zzso exhibits strong zzso when zzso to zzso or expressed as part of a fusion zzso zzso zzso can be detected in the zzso of patients with zzso arthritis or systemic lupus zzso but not in healthy zzso We argue that zzso either on the membrane surface of cells or in soluble form, is a potent zzso zzso to B cells and zzso via the zzso zzso and plays important roles in the zzso of zzso zzso
