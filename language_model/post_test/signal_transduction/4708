An important challenge in statistical zzso concerns zzso experimental data with zzso information about gene zzso A number of statistical methods are available to address this challenge, but most do not accommodate complexities in the functional zzso To zzso activity of a functional category zzso a gene zzso zzso most methods use zzso data on that category, but do not use other functional properties of the same zzso Not doing so creates undue errors in zzso Recent developments in zzso category analysis aim to overcome this difficulty, but in attempting to do so they are faced with serious zzso zzso This paper investigates statistical properties and the structure of zzso zzso in one such model for the analysis of functional category zzso We examine the zzso structures underlying zzso zzso in the original zzso and in a new zzso aimed at leveraging elements of the zzso We characterize zzso of the underlying zzso states, describe a new prior distribution, and introduce approximations that aim to support zzso methods for zzso zzso
