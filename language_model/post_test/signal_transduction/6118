zzso regulate numerous cell zzso including zzso expression and gap zzso zzso In this study, we examined the effect of zzso zzso factor zzso on zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso in zzso zzso cortical zzso matured in zzso were treated with zzso (20 zzso soluble zzso zzso factor zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso or zzso Although zzso and zzso alone had no effect on zzso zzso the zzso zzso significantly increased both zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso correlated with increased zzso zzso as determined by dye transfer zzso By using the pharmacological inhibitor zzso zzso the increase in zzso was found to be dependent on the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso treatment produced nuclear zzso of zzso zzso whereas zzso treatment alone did zzso zzso zzso of zzso containing various sequences of the zzso promoter zzso to a zzso reporter into zzso zzso cells confirmed that the promoter region between zzso to zzso was deemed necessary for zzso to induce heightened zzso zzso did not alter zzso zzso levels, suggesting selectivity of zzso for zzso zzso Together in the presence of soluble zzso zzso activates the zzso zzso leading to enhanced zzso expression and zzso zzso
