In addition to establishing zzso coverage of the receptive field, zzso need to adjust their zzso zzso to match changes of the receptive zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso sensory zzso establish zzso coverage of the body wall early in zzso zzso development and then grow in precise proportion to their zzso the underlying body wall zzso as the zzso more than zzso in zzso This phenomenon, referred to as zzso growth of zzso requires the function of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cells rather than the da zzso zzso We further show that ban in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso activity in adjacent zzso to influence zzso zzso This signaling between zzso cells and zzso receiving sensory input from the body wall zzso their growth to ensure proper zzso coverage of the receptive zzso
