Mechanical stress on the heart can lead to zzso different zzso zzso stimuli such as exercise cause zzso cardiac zzso characterized by a normal cardiac structure and normal or enhanced cardiac zzso zzso stimuli such as hypertension and zzso zzso zzso cause zzso cardiac zzso and ultimately heart zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is known to be involved in pathological cardiac zzso but it has not been determined whether zzso pathways coordinate the signaling cascade leading to zzso type cardiac zzso 

To evaluate the role of zzso in the zzso form of cardiac growth, mice lacking zzso zzso were exercised by swimming for 4 zzso zzso mice showed exaggerated growth of the heart accompanied by typical characteristics of zzso zzso Their zzso zzso of zzso a key zzso in the signaling cascade of zzso zzso increased more than that seen in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso a downstream zzso of zzso was suppressed selectively in the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso or zzso activity enhanced zzso growth factor zzso protein synthesis in rat zzso zzso zzso and the treatment with a specific inhibitor of zzso resulted in enhancement of zzso zzso and suppression of protein zzso 2A zzso The zzso zzso mice developed an exacerbated form of cardiac zzso in response to swimming zzso 

These results indicate that the zzso signaling zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso
