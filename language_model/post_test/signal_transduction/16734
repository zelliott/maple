Large zzso of different molecules and zzso zzso structures, have been proposed to be the units of an intermediate level of zzso in zzso Here we propose a model for zzso in zzso coli in which zzso the size and functioning of the zzso zzso depends not only on the protein constituents but also on zzso and zzso the coupled transcription, translation and zzso of nascent proteins zzso is a potentially powerful influence in determining the size of the zzso zzso and therefore in affecting its function, and zzso a single zzso zzso is jointly responsible for the synthesis of zzso and zzso proteins so as to divorce the size of the zzso zzso from the zzso of its zzso
