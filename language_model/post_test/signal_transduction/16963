zzso machine zzso has previously been demonstrated to restore damaged warm zzso zzso to zzso condition in animal zzso However, the mechanisms of recovery are zzso preventing rational zzso of zzso systems and slowing clinical translation of machine zzso In this study, organ recovery time and major zzso shortcomings were evaluated using a comprehensive zzso analysis of organ function in zzso prior to successful zzso Two groups, Fresh zzso and zzso subjected to 1 zzso of warm zzso zzso received zzso for a total preservation time of 6 zzso followed by successful zzso 24 zzso zzso were directly measured and 38 zzso zzso were estimated via a mass balance model of the major pathways of energy zzso This analysis revealed stable metabolism in Fresh zzso throughout zzso while identifying two distinct zzso states in zzso zzso separated at zzso zzso 2 zzso coinciding with recovery of oxygen zzso rates to Fresh liver zzso This finding strongly suggests successful organ resuscitation within 2 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso regulated metabolism of zzso zzso according to their zzso needs, despite zzso levels of some zzso This study establishes the first zzso zzso basis for the dynamics of recovery during zzso treatment of marginal zzso Our initial findings support enhanced oxygen delivery for both timely recovery and long-term zzso These results are expected to lead the zzso of the treatment protocols and zzso media from a zzso perspective, zzso translation to clinical zzso
