zzso can deliver DNA efficiently and safely to zzso in live animals, including the lung where it causes little inflammation or lung zzso In contrast, zzso zzso gene transfer has been shown to induce an inflammatory response caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso which activate the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso As zzso is located in the zzso zzso we hypothesized that plasmids do not activate zzso during zzso because they enter the zzso directly through transient pores in the plasma zzso To test this, plasmids were zzso into kidney zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and cells lacking zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an indicator of zzso zzso increased more than zzso at 24 h zzso zzso in zzso cells, but showed no significant increase in zzso cells, compared with zzso zzso In zzso zzso gene transfer caused increases in zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor alpha and zzso gamma in mouse zzso zzso zzso fluid, whereas the levels of these zzso were more than zzso lower by comparison following zzso zzso of zzso zzso suggested that this inflammatory response is zzso by resident pulmonary zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso gene transfer zzso the zzso pathway, thus accounting for the low levels of inflammation seen with this zzso
