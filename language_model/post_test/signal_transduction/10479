The zzso zzso zzso is zzso for human liver zzso which may be beneficial for the treatment of liver zzso However, its mechanism of action is ill zzso Here, we have studied how zzso zzso with signaling pathways used by zzso or zzso growth factors to induce the proliferation of these zzso We found that zzso inhibited zzso growth factor or zzso growth zzso DNA zzso zzso did not, however, decrease zzso growth factor zzso zzso or zzso of zzso regulated zzso but strongly inhibited the zzso of zzso and of its zzso zzso related zzso zzso This suggested that zzso inhibited zzso growth zzso zzso signaling through zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso also, inhibited zzso growth zzso DNA synthesis and zzso zzso but did not decrease zzso regulated zzso zzso In contrast, zzso inhibited zzso growth zzso zzso zzso and every subsequent signaling zzso zzso did not directly inhibit zzso zzso activity measured on zzso from zzso growth zzso zzso but it strongly reduced the zzso of the zzso zzso downstream target zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso thus, show that zzso has growth zzso zzso it zzso zzso growth factor signaling via reduced zzso zzso whereas it reduces zzso growth zzso DNA synthesis via zzso of the zzso zzso pathway, possibly through zzso of zzso zzso zzso
