zzso growth zzso zzso signaling is dependent on the zzso of the type II zzso zzso zzso with the type I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso then mediates zzso signals by inducing the zzso of zzso and/or zzso which separately zzso with zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso by activated zzso is inhibited by two newly discovered members of the zzso family, zzso and zzso We now report that zzso zzso levels are increased in human pancreatic cancer by comparison with the normal zzso and that by in zzso zzso zzso is zzso in the cancer cells within the tumor zzso zzso zzso of zzso human pancreatic cancer cells with a full-length zzso construct leads to complete loss of the growth zzso response to zzso without altering zzso induction of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso cells display enhanced zzso growth and accelerated growth in nude zzso These findings point to a previously zzso mechanism for selective suppression of zzso growth zzso in cancer cells that allows for continued zzso of the zzso promoter by zzso which may act to enhance the zzso of certain cancer zzso
