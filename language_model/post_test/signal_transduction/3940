zzso and their specific zzso members of the zzso family of zzso zzso have been implicated in the control of growth and development of zzso cells, specialized cells that wrap around nerve zzso to provide electrical zzso Here we use gene targeting to generate mice that lack zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lack zzso precursors and zzso cells that accompany peripheral zzso of sensory and motor zzso The initial development of motor zzso and sensory zzso of zzso root zzso occurs as it should, but at later stages most motor zzso zzso and sensory zzso in zzso root zzso zzso undergo cell death in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the peripheral nervous system in zzso zzso zzso is thus much more severe than the cell death in mice that lack zzso or zzso zzso We also show that zzso functions in a zzso way during the development of zzso cells, but not in the survival of sensory or motor zzso Our results indicate that sensory and motor zzso require factors for their survival that are provided by developing zzso zzso
