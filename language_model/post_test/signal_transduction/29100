zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso pathways plays an important role in the progression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are principal zzso within this zzso signaling zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso of zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso will affect tumor growth and zzso of zzso 

Human zzso cell lines, zzso cells zzso and vascular smooth muscle cells zzso were zzso For blocking zzso zzso and zzso the small zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso of signaling zzso was assessed by Western zzso and changes in cell zzso were evaluated in migration zzso zzso of zzso on zzso growth were determined in a subcutaneous tumor zzso 

zzso disrupted zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso cells and reduced cancer cell zzso In addition, the migration of zzso and zzso was also significantly zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was diminished by zzso zzso In zzso zzso significantly reduced tumor growth, zzso area, and numbers of zzso zzso tumor zzso 

Combined zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling and efficiently reduces tumor growth and zzso of zzso zzso this strategy could prove valuable for therapy of zzso
