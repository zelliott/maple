zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso This regulator controls its own expression and that of the zzso zzso which encodes an zzso zzso zzso zzso has two zzso a zzso domain harboring the zzso pocket and a zzso zzso zzso domain, which are linked by a long extended zzso When zzso is bound to DNA, a zzso at zzso 86 in the extended zzso gives rise to 2 zzso zzso contacts DNA mainly through a zzso recognition zzso but its three-dimensional structure bound to DNA revealed that two zzso zzso and zzso outside the zzso zzso directly contact zzso zzso binding to zzso releases it from zzso when this occurs, the zzso at zzso is lost and zzso zzso and zzso are displaced due to the reorganization of the turn involving zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso were generated at positions 19, 35, 44, 46, and 86 by zzso zzso to further analyze their zzso zzso proteins were zzso to zzso and differential scanning zzso zzso studies revealed that all zzso except the zzso zzso unfold in a single event, suggesting conservation of the three-dimensional zzso All zzso zzso bound zzso with an affinity similar to that of the parental zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not bind zzso The zzso zzso was able to bind to DNA but was only partially released from its target operator in response to zzso These results are discussed in the context of zzso signal transmission from the zzso binding pocket to the DNA binding zzso
