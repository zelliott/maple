The cellular mechanisms underlying functional zzso zzso of zzso zzso to cerebral blood vessel zzso not yet zzso Here we show in rat cortical slices that the zzso of zzso triggered by zzso activity is dependent on zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso of these zzso responses resulted in the impairment of zzso zzso whereas selective zzso patch zzso single zzso that were in contact with zzso triggered vessel zzso We also found that a zzso product is centrally involved in this zzso control of zzso In zzso blockade of zzso zzso zzso in zzso reduced the blood flow increase in the zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our findings show that zzso signaling is a key mechanism in functional zzso
