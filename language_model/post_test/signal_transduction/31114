zzso acid zzso is an embryonic signaling zzso regulating a wide array of target zzso thereby being a master regulator of patterning and differentiation in a variety of zzso Here we show that mouse zzso deficient for the zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso if rescued from early zzso by maternal zzso supplementation between zzso and zzso lack active zzso signaling in the zzso zzso The resulting zzso completely fail to develop zzso Development of more zzso zzso derivatives zzso and zzso as well as liver growth, is also severely zzso A primary lung bud is specified in the zzso zzso which fails to zzso due to defective zzso signaling and lack of zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes may mediate these zzso regulatory zzso Development of zzso derivatives can be partly restored in zzso by extending the zzso supplementation until at least zzso but lung growth and branching remain defective and a zzso lung develops on the right side zzso Such conditions poorly restore zzso signaling in the lung zzso zzso culture of zzso zzso show a capacity to undergo lung budding and early branching in the presence of zzso or zzso Our data zzso zzso as a regulator of gene expression in the early embryonic lung and stomach region upstream of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
