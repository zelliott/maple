The zzso zzso regulator zzso of zzso zzso zzso activates gene expression in response to zzso oxide zzso The zzso domain of zzso is thought to be involved in signal zzso A zzso exchange within this domain abolished promoter zzso by the zzso zzso indicating that zzso is essential for the zzso mechanism of zzso The DNA region recognized by zzso contains three copies of a zzso element termed the zzso zzso of bases within any of the zzso resulted in a significant decrease in promoter zzso Therefore all three boxes have to be recognized by zzso to activate its target zzso zzso controls expression of an zzso that encodes a zzso zzso protein zzso and an NO zzso zzso zzso exerts a negative effect on zzso promoter zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso indicates that the reduced protein can react with NO to form a zzso zzso zzso zzso NO binding by zzso opens up the possibility that zzso and zzso compete for NO in the zzso
