The overall power of zzso zzso is substantially overshadowed by the acquisition of drug zzso To address this issue, we systematically assessed the potential of zzso proteins to induce resistance to zzso zzso To this end, we developed a zzso platform for screening a zzso library zzso zzso zzso proteins in cellular zzso Using cancer cells originally dependent on either zzso zzso or zzso we observed a bypass of dependence through zzso zzso of alternative zzso zzso zzso zzso Our findings indicate a broad and versatile potential for zzso from the zzso and zzso families as well as zzso to compensate for loss of each zzso We further provide evidence that combined zzso of simultaneously active zzso can lead to an added zzso zzso
