zzso in a variety of species, both zzso and zzso zzso the zzso of objects approaching on a collision course through a zzso firing rate profile that initially increases, then peaks, and eventually zzso as collision becomes zzso In this zzso profile, the peak firing rate signals when the approaching zzso zzso size reaches an angular zzso an event which has been related to the timing of escape zzso In a locust zzso called the zzso giant motion detector zzso the zzso basis of this angular threshold zzso relies on a zzso combination of the zzso angular size and speed, achieved through a zzso zzso To understand how this transform is zzso we modeled the zzso of angular zzso along the zzso leading to the zzso based on the zzso determined zzso pattern of its zzso zzso These simulations show that the zzso transform of angular speed occurs between the synaptic zzso activated by the approaching object onto the zzso zzso tree and its membrane potential at the spike initiation zzso Thus, we demonstrate an example of how a single zzso zzso tree zzso a mathematical step in a neural zzso important for natural zzso
