zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is implicated in the proliferation of zzso cells, and deficiencies in zzso results in pathological conditions such as zzso abnormalities and zzso Tight regulation of zzso zzso is therefore critical for zzso an appropriate type and level of response to external zzso The aim of this work is to compare different zzso zzso mechanisms, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by protein zzso zzso zzso We choose zzso growth factor zzso zzso in zzso cells as a model of zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso could be mainly considered as a positive signaling system, as it is involved in zzso zzso rather than a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso does not result in regulation of zzso zzso zzso and does not lead to variation of zzso zzso zzso The overall zzso protein degradation upon zzso stimulation does not exceed zzso of the total zzso thus the zzso remains functionally active for further zzso On the contrary, zzso zzso of the activated receptors appears to play a crucial zzso In fact, zzso of zzso upon zzso stimulation results in zzso of zzso zzso level, of zzso recruitment and zzso and of cell cycle zzso On the contrary, zzso zzso does not affect the zzso pool of activated zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso zzso by means of zzso zzso is important for both short term (2 zzso and long-lasting (up to 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso we propose a revisited model of zzso zzso in which zzso zzso retains a major role, zzso on zzso zzso a signal zzso zzso
