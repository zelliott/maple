The effect of zzso ordering on the zzso and extent of zzso II zzso zzso formation was evaluated in bovine zzso which had been zzso into zzso zzso containing 0, 15, and 30 zzso zzso The rate of establishment of the dynamic equilibrium between zzso I zzso I) and the two zzso distinguished forms of zzso II in the zzso zzso II model zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Mitchell, zzso zzso Miller, zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso paper in this zzso is derived from kinetic zzso of zzso zzso in these zzso systems at several zzso zzso of the zzso I in equilibrium with zzso zzso equilibrium constant, zzso are calculated from the derived zzso rate constants, and are shown to be equivalent to those derived from rapidly acquired zzso zzso The presence of 30 zzso cholesterol reduces zzso by approximately 50% between 10 and 37 degrees zzso Analysis of the zzso parameters in terms of delta H and delta S reveals that cholesterol raises the free energy of zzso zzso relative to zzso I, by increasing delta H whereas it raises the relative free energy of zzso zzso by making delta S zzso zzso relative to zzso I less zzso The reduction in zzso by both temperature and cholesterol is found to be directly correlated with a zzso that reflects the free volume available for molecular motion in the zzso core of the zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1988) zzso 27, zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
