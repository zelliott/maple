The B cell zzso zzso composed of membrane zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso plays a critical role in zzso B cell development and responses to zzso The zzso tails of zzso and zzso differ substantially but have been well zzso in zzso zzso experiments have revealed that, while these tails share an zzso zzso zzso motif zzso they perform differently in some but not all zzso and have been proposed to recruit distinct downstream zzso We have created transgenic mouse lines expressing zzso receptors zzso an zzso fused to the zzso domain of each of the sheath zzso zzso and zzso zzso (but not an zzso with zzso zzso are each independently sufficient to mediate zzso zzso rescue B cell development in zzso zzso mice that lack zzso zzso zzso as well as signal for B7 zzso While the zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse revealed somewhat more efficient zzso zzso our data indicate that each of the sheath zzso is sufficient to mediate many of the essential functions of the B cell zzso zzso even if the combination gives optimal zzso
