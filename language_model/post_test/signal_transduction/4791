zzso zzso is controlled by a complex signal zzso and gene regulatory network, containing multiple layers of zzso and zzso While numerous individual components of this network have been identified, understanding how these elements are coordinated to regulate heart growth remains a zzso Past approaches to measure cardiac zzso zzso have been manual and often zzso hindering the ability to systematically characterize the network's zzso control structure and identify therapeutic zzso Here, we develop and validate an automated image analysis approach for zzso zzso multiple zzso zzso from zzso zzso This approach incorporates cardiac zzso zzso and provides quantitative measures of zzso size, zzso zzso zzso organization, and zzso zzso As a zzso we examined the zzso response to zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso growth zzso zzso and fetal bovine serum zzso While all five zzso pathways increased zzso size, other zzso metrics were zzso zzso forming a distinct zzso signature for each zzso zzso organization was uniquely enhanced by zzso zzso zzso and zzso pathways markedly decreased cell zzso due to increased zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso and IGF-1 pathways zzso regulated zzso zzso potentially forming a zzso loop that regulates zzso zzso image analysis zzso a range of new quantitative zzso data, aiding dissection of the complex zzso signaling network and enabling zzso zzso drug zzso
