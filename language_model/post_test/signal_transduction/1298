zzso zzso is a ubiquitous zzso zzso pathogen capable of infecting a wide range of zzso To identify genes involved in zzso development and zzso we generated zzso expressed sequence tags zzso from two zzso libraries constructed using either zzso grown in zzso medium or zzso from infected zzso zzso zzso A total of zzso individual zzso genes were identified of which 39 were represented only among the infected plant zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was possible following the categories applied to zzso zzso and the Universal Gene zzso zzso zzso were identified that zzso potential zzso factors including four zzso two zzso and several zzso zzso The potential role of these zzso as well as those zzso signal zzso factors, in the infection process is zzso
