zzso zzso is a potent zzso of zzso differentiation stimulating the expression of zzso regulatory zzso To understand the mechanism of its effect on zzso we investigated the early signals induced by zzso in zzso target zzso In the rat skeletal muscle cell line zzso zzso selectively stimulates zzso zzso and zzso zzso breakdown, through the zzso of zzso C and D zzso zzso as shown by the generation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso increase of zzso zzso consisting in a rapid peak followed by a sustained phase, and the zzso generation of zzso acid zzso zzso (a PA zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso abolish the sustained phase of zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso activity is mainly responsible for the rapid phase of zzso zzso generation, whereas the sustained phase is dependent upon zzso activity and PA zzso ruling out any significant role of zzso zzso zzso of PA level correlate with parallel changes of zzso activity, indicating a possible zzso between the two signal zzso pathways in the intact zzso zzso zzso is zzso at zzso zzso two orders of magnitude lower than those required for zzso zzso The differentiation of zzso zzso into zzso fibers is zzso significantly by zzso at zzso at which zzso but not zzso is zzso These data provide the first evidence for an important role of zzso in the mechanism of zzso muscle zzso
