Two zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso lymphoma, rarely have zzso in the zzso tumor zzso zzso suggesting that a viral protein interferes with zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of the cellular zzso genes zzso and zzso and could in this way interfere with zzso zzso Two derivatives of the zzso zzso cell line zzso were prepared, one of which zzso zzso expressed a zzso zzso zzso zzso and another zzso which zzso expressed both zzso and zzso membrane protein 1 zzso At the zzso temperature, the zzso protein in the zzso cell line zzso activated two of its target zzso the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso gene product, in an zzso zzso Upon serum withdrawal at the zzso temperature, zzso zzso was induced in 50 to zzso of the zzso In the zzso cell line which zzso expressed zzso however, only 20 to zzso of the cells underwent zzso While stable expression of zzso did not affect levels of zzso family members in these cells, it did induce expression of zzso zzso expression of zzso in the zzso cell line inhibited zzso zzso equivalent to zzso by zzso The induction of zzso may zzso the ability of zzso to protect zzso zzso cells from zzso zzso
