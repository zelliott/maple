An important step in the zzso transformation of zzso cells and the subsequent development of leukemia is the proliferation of tumor cells in the absence of zzso growth zzso In most cases of chronic zzso leukemia and in some cases of acute zzso leukemia and acute zzso zzso the zzso zzso is involved in this zzso Although the zzso zzso demonstrates enhanced zzso zzso activity in zzso cells, the mechanism by which this leads to growth factor independence remains poorly zzso One proposed mechanism is the zzso of zzso signal zzso zzso possibly by an zzso loop involving zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso of several different cell lines expressing zzso demonstrates that some of these cells have zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso We have found the zzso zzso of zzso in most, but not all, cell lines expressing zzso This zzso zzso of zzso is zzso associated with a corresponding zzso of zzso zzso zzso blocking studies show that the zzso of zzso in these cell lines cannot be attributed to the zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, samples of peripheral blood cells derived from patients with acute zzso leukemia and chronic zzso zzso which express zzso demonstrate zzso zzso of zzso family zzso These studies suggest that in a variety of zzso states, zzso may use a bypass mechanism to activate zzso signal zzso zzso
