zzso plays a pivotal role in zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso in zzso However, mechanisms for functional regulation of zzso remain zzso Previous studies indicated that zzso zzso by tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso family, which activates zzso zzso associated factor zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso signals activate zzso zzso with zzso of zzso sites in zzso cell line zzso suggesting existence of an alternative zzso zzso zzso In this study, we have characterized the signal zzso zzso of zzso other than that leading to zzso using zzso cell line, and its zzso zzso which is chronically infected by zzso We show that signals downstream of zzso and zzso activate zzso zzso which directly zzso zzso and that zzso of zzso zzso zzso activates zzso induction of zzso gene zzso We also show zzso and zzso are expressed in zzso of zzso samples from zzso infected zzso Identification of zzso zzso zzso provides a new target for controlling zzso of zzso zzso in zzso
