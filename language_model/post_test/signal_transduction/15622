The zzso family of proteins consists of at least four members implicated in the regulation of diverse cellular processes such as cell zzso zzso zzso and cancer cell zzso zzso family members have zzso zzso that mediate zzso zzso interactions with members of a different group of zzso the zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso proteins have zzso zzso that mediate zzso interactions with other zzso zzso Signaling zzso assembled by these proteins in turn regulate signal zzso downstream of a variety of receptors including zzso zzso and zzso zzso T zzso express the zzso protein zzso and the zzso protein zzso which are found in a zzso complex in zzso T zzso We recently showed that zzso and zzso regulate zzso zzso and promote zzso migration and trafficking downstream of activated zzso zzso It is currently unclear if the zzso module also plays a role in zzso zzso zzso Here we review our current knowledge of how zzso and zzso regulate zzso physiology and whether this protein complex plays a functional role downstream of zzso zzso zzso
