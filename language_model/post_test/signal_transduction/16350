zzso zzso protein 1 zzso is thought to act mainly as a scaffold for protein complexes, which together silence zzso by triggering the formation of zzso Using small interfering zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso zzso regulated zzso zzso production in zzso zzso zzso is likely to zzso the binding of zzso to the zzso promoter because zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso activity, but not zzso zzso Of importance, we found negative regulatory effects of zzso on the zzso zzso of zzso the zzso of zzso by zzso and the nuclear zzso of zzso In addition, zzso associated with zzso and inhibited the binding between zzso and zzso Thus, zzso is likely to zzso control the zzso of zzso which is critical for its nuclear zzso Taken together, zzso modulated the zzso of zzso by interfering with the interactions among zzso zzso and zzso resulting in reduced zzso production after zzso zzso Our findings that zzso directly interacts with zzso factors are new, and will inform further research to zzso zzso zzso
