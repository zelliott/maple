zzso zzso zzso of the zzso factor 1 gene zzso zzso zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso were identified in 50% of zzso zzso zzso zzso characterized by a striking zzso To understand the molecular basis of this zzso zzso storage, we performed a zzso zzso analysis validated by quantitative reverse zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso we showed a repression of zzso coordinated with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso and fatty acid synthesis predicting elevated rates of zzso Moreover, the strong zzso of liver fatty zzso protein suggests that impaired fatty acid trafficking may also contribute to the fatty zzso In addition, zzso profile analysis of the observed zzso genes in zzso zzso as well as in zzso zzso allowed us to define a specific signature of the zzso zzso In these tumors, zzso composition was dramatically modified according to the zzso zzso identified in the fatty acid synthetic zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso did not operate through zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso that were zzso We conclude that zzso in zzso zzso results mainly from an zzso promotion of zzso that is linked to zzso zzso and that is independent of both zzso and zzso zzso Finally, our findings have potential clinical implications since zzso can be efficiently inhibited by targeted zzso
