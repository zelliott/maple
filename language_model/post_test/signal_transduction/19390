To investigate the distribution and expression of zzso releasing factor zzso in spinal cord, zzso and third zzso of zzso of the hypersensitive zzso rats, and to research on the mechanism of zzso in the hypersensitive zzso signal zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and to investigate possible active mechanisms of zzso prescription on zzso 

Forty zzso rats were divided randomly into three zzso The rats of model zzso 1 were zzso by injecting egg zzso into abdominal zzso The rats of model zzso 2 were zzso by conditional stimulus and unconditional zzso The two model groups were both divided randomly into two zzso The five groups were given zzso administration with zzso prescription or normal saline for four zzso Then quantitative analysis of zzso in the zzso spinal zzso and brain of rats were achieved by zzso method and computerized image zzso 

The sensitivity of the groups being treated with zzso prescription were much lower than the model groups zzso zzso zzso The zzso method showed that zzso was expressed in the zzso zzso of spinal cord, zzso and the zzso surface of third zzso of zzso The zzso positive index of the model groups was higher than that of the blank group zzso zzso zzso The zzso positive index of the healing groups was lower than that of the model groups zzso zzso zzso The zzso positive index of the healing groups was higher than that of the blank group zzso zzso zzso 

The two model rats evoked by two different stimulation both appeared visceral hypersensitivity zzso zzso is related to zzso The increase of zzso expression in the zzso zzso of spinal cord, zzso and the zzso surface of third zzso of zzso showed that zzso is critical to the introduce of stimulus signal of zzso zzso prescription can significantly decrease zzso zzso This is one mechanism to decrease sensitivity of hypersensitive zzso zzso
