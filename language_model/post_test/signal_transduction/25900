Despite their relatively simple appearance, roots are incredibly complex zzso that are highly adapted to differing zzso Many aspects of root development are zzso by subtle spatial differences in the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso Events from the formation of a root during zzso to the determination of the network of lateral roots are controlled by interactions between these zzso Recently, interactions have been defined where zzso signaling promotes the expression of zzso signaling zzso zzso signaling promotes the expression of zzso signaling zzso and finally where zzso signaling regulates the complex network of zzso transport proteins to position zones of high zzso zzso We are witnessing a period of discovery in which we are beginning to understand how these hormonal pathways communicate to regulate root zzso
