The zzso zzso the zzso is formed by a zzso zzso interaction between two precursor zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso bud zzso the zzso zzso to differentiate into the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that form colonies upon zzso stimulation and strongly express zzso exist in the zzso zzso these cells can partially zzso a three-dimensional structure in an organ culture zzso zzso maintains this zzso zzso population by opposing zzso zzso Upon zzso tube formation, zzso is required for the differentiation of zzso zzso structures zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the induction methods of the intermediate zzso the precursor of the zzso zzso begin to be zzso If derivation of zzso zzso becomes possible, we will be closer to the generation and manipulation of multiple cell lineages in the zzso
