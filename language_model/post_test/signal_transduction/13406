Type 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of impaired insulin zzso and, to a greater extent, resistance of target zzso to insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in insulin signaling and has been shown to be blunted in zzso of type 2 diabetes zzso There is emerging zzso and, particularly, genetic evidence suggesting that insulin resistance can potentially be treated via zzso of zzso by targeting zzso itself or its up and zzso zzso These potential targets include zzso zzso 2 domain containing zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso ten zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso There is evidence suggesting that their zzso affects zzso activity and improves insulin sensitivity in zzso In the current review, we will discuss the role of these molecules in zzso zzso of zzso the rational for targeting these molecules for diabetes treatment, and some critical issues in terms of drug zzso
