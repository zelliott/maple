Babies born at lower zzso ages or smaller zzso have a greater risk of poorer health in later zzso Both the causes of these zzso birth outcomes and the mechanism by which the effects are transmitted over decades are the subject of extensive zzso We investigated whether a zzso signature of either zzso or zzso age could be detected in zzso zzso zzso 

The gene expression patterns of 32 zzso cords from zzso babies of Chinese ethnicity across a range of zzso zzso zzso and zzso ages zzso weeks) were zzso We confirmed the differential expression pattern by zzso age for 12 genes in a series of zzso zzso cords of Chinese, Malay and Indian zzso 

We found that the zzso is substantially influenced by zzso zzso but less so by zzso We show that some of the expression changes dependent on zzso age are enriched in signal zzso zzso such as zzso and in genes with roles in zzso zzso and zzso We show that some of the gene expression changes we report are reflected in the zzso 

We studied the zzso zzso which is peripheral to disease susceptible zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso changes, preserved at the zzso level, may be a mechanism zzso birth outcomes are linked to the risk of adult zzso and zzso disease and suggest that greater attention be given to the association between premature birth and later disease zzso
