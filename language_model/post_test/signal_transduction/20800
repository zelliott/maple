This review article briefly summarizes aspects of our current understanding of the zzso sugar zzso transport system in enteric bacteria, particularly the mode of genetic regulation of its zzso This regulation occurs by a process that involves an example of the very widespread and ever-growing group of so-called zzso bacterial regulatory systems, a mechanism of response to environmental signals that employs zzso transfer reactions between constituent zzso Of emphasis here is the unusual involvement in zzso signaling of the zzso protein which is related in sequence and structure to some transport zzso including the very protein whose synthesis it helps zzso
