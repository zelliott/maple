A well-balanced activity of the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso is necessary for normal zzso zzso As known from zzso zzso zzso zzso models, the zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso proliferation of zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso lead to a blockade of zzso zzso zzso degradation and reduction of zzso zzso zzso synthesis is a typical function of zzso cells and essential for normal zzso and zzso We employed the human zzso cell line zzso to further characterize zzso zzso and zzso function in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of the target genes zzso and zzso and reporter gene zzso after stimulation with zzso or zzso zzso or zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso demonstrated zzso activity and functionality of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso protein was exclusively detected in the nuclear zzso zzso stimulation affected the zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso Additionally, the zzso activated zzso suppressed zzso expression and zzso synthesis zzso zzso zzso and enhanced proliferation zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso by zzso did not override this zzso effect on zzso synthesis or zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso is zzso activated and functional in human zzso zzso zzso It is a potential target for zzso disruption by zzso zzso and subsequent dysfunction of zzso zzso
