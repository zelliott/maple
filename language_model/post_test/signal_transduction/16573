The human T cell leukemia virus type 1 zzso zzso Tax interacts with numerous cellular pathways promoting both the survival and zzso of the virus in the human zzso Tax has been studied extensively with respect to its role in zzso zzso and its involvement in the zzso of a number of cellular genes during the process of zzso zzso These processes are dependent on Tax zzso to the nucleus where it interacts with a number of cellular zzso factors during its course of nuclear zzso However, there is mounting evidence suggesting that Tax may shuttle between the nucleus and zzso zzso to several zzso zzso with subsequent zzso from both zzso cells as well as zzso zzso In addition, the presence of zzso Tax in cerebral spinal fluid zzso was recently demonstrated to occur during all stages of zzso This has brought about an increased interest in the zzso zzso of Tax and the implications this zzso may have with respect to the progression of zzso disease zzso This review addresses the functional implications relevant to the zzso and zzso of Tax in the zzso including the Tax zzso acid signals and cellular protein interactions that may regulate this zzso Specifically, we have discussed three important processes associated with the zzso zzso of zzso First, the process of Tax shuttling between the nucleus and zzso will be described and how this process may be involved in regulating different zzso zzso zzso Second, zzso zzso of Tax will be discussed with relevance to Tax zzso and the interaction of Tax with proteins in the cellular zzso zzso Finally, the zzso of Tax and the effects of zzso Tax on zzso zzso will be zzso
