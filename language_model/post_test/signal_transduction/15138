zzso are the most common and most lethal primary brain zzso Recent studies zzso an important role for a restricted population of zzso cells zzso stem cells zzso in zzso maintenance and zzso We now demonstrate that zzso zzso express two zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso and zzso 130 zzso zzso zzso alpha or zzso zzso expression in zzso with the use of short hairpin zzso zzso significantly reduces growth and zzso formation capacity while increasing zzso zzso of zzso signaling in zzso zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso three zzso zzso and small zzso zzso of zzso zzso induce zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso is a downstream zzso of zzso zzso signals in zzso zzso of zzso alpha or zzso expression in zzso increases the survival of mice bearing zzso human zzso zzso zzso is clinically significant because elevated zzso zzso and zzso expression are associated with poor zzso patient zzso The potential utility of zzso therapies is demonstrated by decreased growth of subcutaneous human zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso Together, our data indicate that zzso signaling contributes to zzso zzso through the promotion of zzso growth and survival, and that targeting zzso may offer benefit for zzso zzso
