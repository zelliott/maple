Using zzso zzso and zzso selective zzso in barley leaves action zzso zzso have been measured, which zzso zzso as well as zzso from leaf to leaf or from root to leaf following the application of mild salt stress zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso or zzso acids zzso 1 zzso zzso acid or 5 zzso zzso zzso changes were zzso followed an zzso zzso and zzso at zzso zzso zzso irrespective of the zzso With the zzso zzso a strong initial zzso is the main zzso factor that first causes zzso influx and then zzso zzso zzso influx zzso with an initial slower zzso the rapid zzso zzso causes the typical zzso zzso zzso zzso starts after the zzso zzso has passed the zzso equilibrium potential zzso of the zzso driving zzso zzso acid and zzso induce zzso not through membrane zzso but presumably by binding to a putative zzso or to zzso zzso channels, respectively, followed by zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso zzso are accompanied by transient zzso pH increase (about 1 zzso and by zzso pH decrease (about zzso zzso The zzso pH change is interpreted as an indicator of stress, the zzso pH change as a prerequisite for zzso related gene zzso Since zzso are released by agents added in a moderate concentration range, it is suggested that they may serve as first and fast systemic signals following attack from zzso
