The interplay between hormone signaling and gene regulatory networks is instrumental in promoting the development of living zzso In particular, plants have evolved mechanisms to sense gravity and orient themselves zzso Here, we present a mathematical model that reproduces plant zzso responses based on known molecular genetic interactions for zzso signaling coupled with a physical description of plant zzso The model allows one to analyze the zzso dynamics of the system, triggered by an zzso zzso that zzso differential growth of the plant with respect to the gravity zzso Our model predicts two important features with strong biological zzso 1), zzso of the regulatory circuit as a consequence of integral zzso and zzso a higher degree of plasticity generated by the molecular interplay between two classes of zzso Our model also predicts the ability of zzso to zzso the zzso response and supports the integration of the hormonal role at the level of gene zzso
