zzso To observe the effect of intermittent zzso zzso on the expression of transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso collagen I zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso and on the changes in the zzso structure of SPF zzso zzso zzso 

zzso were placed in normal environment or intermittent zzso zzso (101 zzso zzso zzso 8 h every day) zzso At the 3rd, 7th, 14th, 21st day, 5 rats from each group were killed and zzso and zzso stain zzso zzso was applied to observe the pathological change in the lung of rats, zzso zzso was used to detect the protein level of zzso Col zzso zzso was performed to detect the zzso levels of zzso and Col zzso Western zzso to detect the expression of zzso Besides, the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso were determined by zzso 

zzso of HE stain demonstrated that the mild zzso and inflammatory cell zzso appeared in the lung tissue at the 3rd day, and gradually aggravated inflammation were observed as the treated time zzso meanwhile the zzso zzso become thicker and thicker as the time of exposing to zzso zzso zzso Compared with the zzso group, not only the protein expression of zzso zzso and Col I, but also the zzso expression of zzso and Col I were elevated zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso group as the treatment time zzso Besides, a positive correlation zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso between the protein level of zzso and zzso was observed and an zzso zzso in the zzso was also zzso 

zzso zzso could cause pulmonary zzso and inflammation by zzso expression of zzso zzso the zzso Signaling zzso and increasing the zzso of Col I, the deposition of zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso
