Pulmonary zzso hypertension zzso is a lethal syndrome characterized by vascular obstruction and right zzso zzso Although the fundamental cause remains zzso many zzso and zzso abnormalities occur, including zzso zzso bone zzso protein zzso gene zzso decreased expression of the zzso zzso channel zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso T zzso de zzso expression of zzso and increased zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso Together, these abnormalities create a zzso zzso zzso zzso in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells zzso A possible unifying mechanism for zzso comes from studies of zzso rats, which manifest spontaneous zzso and impaired zzso zzso zzso zzso normally produce zzso zzso species zzso in proportion to zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso converts zzso zzso to zzso zzso which serves as a zzso zzso regulating pulmonary vascular tone and structure through effects on zzso and zzso zzso zzso sensing is zzso by this zzso zzso In zzso and cancer, zzso metabolism and zzso signaling are zzso zzso creating a zzso zzso state characterized by zzso decreases in zzso a shift from zzso to zzso metabolism and zzso zzso Three newly recognized zzso abnormalities disrupt the zzso zzso 1) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) zzso zzso and 3) fragmentation and/or zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso abnormalities in experimental models of zzso and human cancer, causing a zzso of both zzso zzso abnormalities that disturb the zzso zzso zzso contribute to the zzso of zzso and cancer and constitute promising therapeutic zzso
