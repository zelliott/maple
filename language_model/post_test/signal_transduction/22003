zzso is a zzso zzso zzso specific for the zzso zzso zzso Previous data have shown that the zzso axis exerts a zzso on its own signaling through zzso and zzso regulation of zzso We first confirm the key role of zzso in maintaining the levels of zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways had no significant zzso We further show that regulation of zzso zzso stability plays a critical role in zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso indicated that zzso signaling increased the zzso of zzso zzso in a zzso region zzso zzso In addition, zzso a hallmark of tumor growth, was found to increase both zzso levels of zzso zzso and the stability of the zzso reporter zzso containing its zzso in a zzso zzso Nevertheless, a zzso zzso activity was required for the response to zzso Finally, zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso zinc finger protein family, and zzso an zzso of zzso zzso two proteins regulating zzso stability reduced the levels of zzso zzso zzso and the activity of the zzso zzso reporter zzso This study shows that zzso regulation is a key process in the control of zzso zzso
