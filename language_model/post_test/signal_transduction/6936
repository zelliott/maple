Human zzso regulatory T zzso cells suppress immune responses in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso function and/or number of peripheral zzso cells has been previously reported in zzso zzso zzso cells represent the most actively replicating compartment within the zzso cells in zzso but they are zzso to classical T cell zzso zzso stimulation in zzso a condition that is secondary to their zzso zzso zzso Here we report that proliferation of zzso cells after zzso stimulation is impaired in subjects with zzso multiple sclerosis zzso because of altered zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso 5 zzso zzso This is associated with decreased expression of the zzso box zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso forms, zzso of zzso zzso protein (a downstream target of the zzso target of zzso zzso and altered activity of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso The impaired capacity of zzso cells to zzso in zzso zzso with the clinical state of the subject, where increasing disease severity is associated with a decline in zzso cell zzso These results suggest a previously zzso mechanism that may account for the progressive loss of zzso cells in zzso zzso
