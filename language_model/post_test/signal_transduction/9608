zzso zzso possesses 16 zzso systems zzso two of which zzso and zzso belong to the zzso zzso zzso zzso family, which is zzso within the zzso zzso has recently been documented as being important for zzso resistance in zzso zzso In this study, we present a characterization of zzso and reveal that, as with other zzso zzso it responds to disruptions in the cell zzso Analysis using a zzso zzso fusion demonstrated that zzso expression is zzso by a variety of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cyanide zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, we reveal that zzso regulates a downstream zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso also display a zzso decreased ability to develop resistance to the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis reveals that the zzso of 245 genes is altered in an zzso zzso with the vast majority being zzso Included within this list are genes involved in zzso drug resistance, cell envelope zzso zzso regulation, zzso acid metabolism and zzso Using zzso coupled zzso we observed a decrease in zzso zzso metal zzso in an zzso zzso when grown under low abundance zzso zzso of cells using electron zzso reveals that zzso zzso have zzso in cell envelope zzso Finally, a variety of zzso zzso are impaired in zzso zzso including zzso formation, resistance to killing by human zzso and survival in whole human zzso Thus, zzso is important in sensing cell damage in zzso zzso and functions to zzso gene expression to modify cell envelope architecture, zzso adaptation and zzso
