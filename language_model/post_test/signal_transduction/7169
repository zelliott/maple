zzso is well known as an zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we provided convincing evidence for the function of zzso in zzso outgrowth of cortical zzso We discovered that zzso treatment could promote the number of zzso mean process zzso and maximum process length of primary zzso which were inhibited by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso growth was related to the zzso zzso which was blocked by zzso zzso Overall, our results implied that zzso could mediate zzso outgrowth through zzso and zzso zzso
