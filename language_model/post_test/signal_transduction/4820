The zzso of transforming growth zzso zzso levels in eye tissue is considered as one of the major factors contributing to zzso capsule zzso zzso in patients undergoing cataract surgery, since zzso is known to stimulate the cell migration of residual human lens zzso cells zzso The present study aimed to test the potential effect of zzso zzso on zzso cell migration and the possible cellular mechanisms involved in this zzso zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso zzso in the presence or absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso cell migration was determined by the zzso Track zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso signaling pathways was determined by Western zzso using specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and activities were analyzed by zzso and gelatin zzso zzso zzso In cultured zzso cells, zzso largely inhibited zzso cell migration and zzso activity, probably by zzso the zzso zzso We suggest that the use of zzso may be of help in the prevention of zzso formation and zzso
