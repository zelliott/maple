zzso zzso are small zzso zzso that function as negative gene zzso zzso in the expression of zzso have been implicated in the zzso and development of most human zzso Recent data indicate that zzso and zzso are significantly elevated in zzso zzso zzso suggesting their role in the regulation of multiple genes associated with zzso In this study, zzso human zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso targeting zzso and zzso alone or in zzso The results showed that the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso with zzso inhibitor on zzso zzso The 50% zzso concentration values were dramatically decreased in cells treated with the combination of zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso combined, enhanced zzso significantly and reduced invasion ability assessed by flow zzso and zzso migration zzso Thus, the zzso inhibitor may interrupt the activity of zzso zzso increasing zzso and zzso expression and reducing zzso activities, independently of zzso zzso Meanwhile, zzso inhibitor reduced by Twist proceeds to inhibit translation of the zzso zzso zzso leading to the increase of the expression of the zzso zzso gene zzso Taken together, these data strongly suggest that a combination of zzso inhibitor and zzso inhibitor could be an effective therapeutic strategy for controlling the growth of zzso by zzso zzso expression and zzso tumor zzso zzso Moreover, a regulatory strategy based on the combination of zzso zzso may provide insights into the mechanisms of the zzso of signaling genes involved in tumor cell zzso and zzso
