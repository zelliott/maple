We investigated the involvement of the protein zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso in the mechanical hypersensitivity induced in rats by zzso zzso injection of zzso results in zzso of zzso in the zzso spinal cord, most prominently in the zzso horn, starting by 5 zzso after zzso injection and lasting at least zzso The activated zzso in the spinal zzso is in zzso since zzso zzso zzso with the zzso marker, zzso nuclear protein zzso The mechanical hypersensitivity is shown by the enhanced paw withdrawal frequency to applications of von Frey filaments with different zzso forces zzso 100, 200 zzso on the rat zzso zzso with several different zzso zzso including zzso zzso inhibitor IV, and zzso inhibitor zzso blocked the mechanical hypersensitivity induced by zzso injection of zzso a measure of spinal zzso central zzso Two structurally unrelated zzso zzso zzso upstream of zzso zzso zzso and zzso also prevented the mechanical hypersensitivity induced by zzso injection of zzso Furthermore, zzso with the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso inhibitor IV, and inhibitor V significantly reduced the established mechanical hypersensitivity induced by zzso The zzso signaling zzso in the spinal zzso is therefore involved in pain zzso
