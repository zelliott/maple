Muscle protein synthesis and zzso zzso are zzso zzso following muscle contraction in zzso In an effort to determine whether zzso zzso is essential for regulating muscle protein synthesis in humans, we treated subjects with a potent zzso inhibitor zzso prior to performing a series of high-intensity muscle zzso Here we show that zzso treatment blocks the early zzso zzso acute zzso increase ( approximately zzso in human muscle protein zzso In addition, several downstream components of the zzso zzso zzso were also blunted or blocked by zzso For instance, zzso zzso zzso was increased zzso zzso in the control group while being unchanged with zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso was reduced by approximately zzso zzso in the control group but zzso following zzso treatment was zzso indicating that translation zzso was zzso zzso administration prior to exercise also reduced the ability of zzso to associate with zzso during zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso treatment prior to resistance exercise completely blocked the zzso increase in the zzso of zzso zzso and blunted the increase in zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso of a known target of zzso zzso zzso was similar in both groups zzso zzso zzso which is consistent with the notion that zzso does not directly inhibit zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso is, in part, playing a key role in regulating the zzso stimulation of muscle protein synthesis in humans, while dual zzso of zzso and zzso stimulation may be required for full stimulation of human skeletal muscle protein zzso
