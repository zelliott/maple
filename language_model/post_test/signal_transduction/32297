zzso have emerged as key zzso regulators of gene expression during zzso zzso We show that the zzso family plays a crucial role for the proper generation and survival of zzso zzso populations in the zzso zzso region, including zzso zzso zzso by directly targeting the zzso factor zzso and the zzso regulator zzso in neural zzso zzso The lack of a negative regulation of zzso and zzso by zzso in conditional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and after zzso zzso in zzso leads to a strongly reduced zzso exit and zzso differentiation of zzso zzso zzso neural zzso whereas the opposite effect is seen after zzso zzso in primary zzso zzso zzso of zzso is in turn directly regulated by zzso and zzso thereby establishing a unilateral negative feedback loop required for the zzso exit and zzso differentiation of neural zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso regulation of zzso and zzso by zzso family members might be a general mechanism to control the transition from a zzso zzso cell to a zzso and more differentiated zzso
