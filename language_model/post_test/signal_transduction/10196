During liver development, liver zzso called zzso differentiate into zzso or zzso zzso Recently, we showed that the segregation between zzso and zzso cells is dependent on a zzso of zzso zzso and that zzso signaling is controlled in fetal liver by zzso factors of the zzso zzso Here, we discuss candidate factors possibly involved in the formation of the zzso signaling zzso how this zzso could integrate into a network of signaling pathways modulating zzso zzso and the implications for human liver disease and zzso
