Maintaining correct DNA and zzso zzso patterns is essential for the development of all zzso In zzso we identified zzso zzso zzso a novel protein involved in the control of gene zzso zzso contains both a zzso zzso zzso domain found in several zzso regulators and an zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso are associated with drastic zzso zzso The zzso zzso after few generations and are similar to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso IN zzso zzso zzso A zzso analysis of zzso zzso revealed a large number of gene bodies zzso in the zzso zzso context, associated with an increase in zzso of zzso 9 on zzso zzso tail zzso an zzso mark normally found in silenced zzso The zzso zzso is suppressed by zzso in genes zzso the DNA zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso functions zzso to zzso or zzso We further show that the zzso transcript is not correctly processed in zzso and that the functional zzso transcript zzso zzso Altogether, our results suggest a function for zzso in the maintenance of zzso integrity by regulating zzso
