The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso inhibitor zzso are among the first genes expressed when zzso zzso begin their zzso We used a series of zzso with defects in signal zzso to ask whether zzso receptors 1 and 3, G zzso G zzso zzso zzso zzso or the protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso are required for the initial appearance or later regulation of the zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso gene produces a zzso transcript during zzso growth and then a zzso transcript during the early hours of zzso zzso of the zzso transcript in zzso G zzso G zzso and zzso zzso is similar to that of zzso parental zzso although its level is reduced in strains that carry the zzso zzso zzso double zzso also produce less zzso transcript, but the zzso gene remains zzso by zzso The zzso zzso produces the zzso zzso transcript, but in this zzso the zzso transcript is retained in zzso zzso and zzso are not required for zzso of the zzso zzso but deleting zzso leads to overproduction of the zzso zzso zzso or repression of the zzso gene does not require G zzso G zzso or zzso zzso is required for synthesis of the zzso zzso The results suggest a zzso regulation of these early genes through a G zzso zzso mechanism and an absolute dependence of zzso on the zzso
