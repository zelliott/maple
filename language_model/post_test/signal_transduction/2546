Diversity of cell lineages within zzso zzso is generated zzso by differentiation of committed zzso zzso Fundamental regulatory aspects of this process are not zzso The mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso served as model to assess the role of zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling during emergence of cell lineage zzso zzso fluctuations in zzso zzso zzso levels zzso with crucial zzso cell lineage transitions were revealed by zzso protection zzso Between days 2 and 5, when zzso cells are maturing and zzso duct cells emerge, zzso zzso zzso levels were highest and all zzso cells exhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels then declined sharply and zzso became confined to zzso zzso At day 11 in male mice, and days 11 and 16 in zzso a second increase in zzso zzso zzso was detected zzso with emergence of zzso convoluted zzso zzso zzso With completion of zzso zzso cell differentiation at the onset of zzso zzso zzso zzso levels and intensity of zzso zzso zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso or zzso could not be zzso These temporally distinct patterns of zzso zzso expression suggest that this signaling zzso is a mechanism of potential importance in emergence of cell lineage diversity in a zzso zzso
