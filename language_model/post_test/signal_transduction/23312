The focal zzso zzso zzso signaling cascade in cancer cells was profoundly inhibited by zzso violet zzso identified with the zzso virtual zzso zzso violet zzso was shown to be a zzso inhibitor of full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso It turned out that zzso violet zzso possesses extremely high zzso selectivity in zzso zzso profiling using a large panel of zzso zzso activity measurement against several different cancer cells and Western zzso analysis showed that this substance is capable of suppressing significantly the proliferation of cancer cells and is able to strongly block zzso signaling pathways in a dose dependent manner at low zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso that is required for full zzso of zzso was nearly completely suppressed even with zzso of zzso violet zzso in zzso cancer zzso To the best of our knowledge, it has never been reported that zzso violet possesses zzso zzso Moreover, zzso violet zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso that activates zzso in zzso In addition, zzso violet zzso was found to induce cell zzso and to exhibit strong zzso effects on the focal zzso invasion, and migration of zzso cancer cells at low zzso zzso Taken together, these results show that zzso violet zzso is a novel, potent and selective blocker of zzso signaling zzso which displays strong zzso activities against a variety of human cancer cells and suppresses zzso of tumor zzso
