zzso small cell lung zzso zzso is a highly lethal zzso that often becomes resistant to zzso To determine whether zzso in zzso signaling might contribute to such resistance, we established in zzso and in zzso models for sensitive and resistant human zzso We found that resistance is due to multiple defects found in expression of zzso zzso and members of the zzso and zzso family, as well as zzso -9 and zzso as examined by zzso Western zzso analysis, gene array analysis and functional zzso Failure to activate death zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso points to a central role of zzso To restore zzso signaling we zzso zzso zzso on nude mice with zzso and zzso This treatment strongly induced zzso per zzso and zzso the tumors to zzso cell zzso Thus, these findings indicate that zzso of zzso might be an effective strategy to restore sensitivity for chemotherapy in zzso in zzso
