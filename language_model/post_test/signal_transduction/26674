zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso factor zzso response to zzso signaling play a critical role early in zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling is considered an attractive target for cancer zzso or zzso zzso Small molecules derived from the natural products were used in our zzso reporter gene zzso to identify potential zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso was identified as a promising candidate because it effectively inhibited zzso reporter gene zzso zzso zzso also suppressed zzso zzso zzso and subsequent target gene expression in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso To further investigate the precise mechanisms of action in the regulation of zzso signaling by zzso we performed Western zzso analysis, real-time reverse zzso chain zzso and an zzso mobility shift zzso in human colon cancer cells with zzso activated zzso zzso zzso inhibited the nuclear zzso of zzso and significantly suppressed the binding of zzso complexes onto their specific zzso sites in the zzso These events led to the zzso of zzso downstream genes such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso human colon cancer zzso In addition, zzso inhibited the invasion and zzso of tumor cells and exhibited zzso activity in a zzso nude mouse model bearing zzso zzso These findings suggest that the growth zzso of zzso against human colon cancer cells can be partly attributed to the regulation of the zzso signaling zzso
