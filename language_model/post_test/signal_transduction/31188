zzso oxygen species are believed to be the central zzso of zzso destruction that leads to type 1 and 2 diabetes, and calcium has been reported to be an important zzso of beta cell zzso In the present study, the authors investigated whether zzso plays a role in hydrogen zzso zzso zzso mouse beta cell zzso Treatment with low concentration zzso zzso zzso was found to be sufficient to reduce zzso cell viability by zzso largely via zzso However, this zzso cell death was near completely blocked by zzso with zzso (5 zzso a zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso calcium store channel blockers, such as, zzso c and zzso significant protected cells from 50 zzso zzso cell death and under zzso zzso conditions, 50 zzso zzso zzso transient zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso II were found to have a protective effect on zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso signals, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso c release, zzso 3 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were all zzso by the zzso zzso zzso These findings show that zzso zzso possibly due to release from zzso calcium stores and the subsequent zzso of zzso zzso signals, critically mediates low concentration zzso zzso cell zzso These findings suggest that a breakdown of calcium zzso by low level of zzso oxygen species may be involved in beta cell destruction during diabetes zzso
