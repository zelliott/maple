The zzso zzso receptors zzso are involved in the regulation of most of the pathways linked to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are known to regulate muscle fatty acid zzso and a zzso compensation of their function has been zzso zzso we investigated muscle zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and double zzso zzso zzso Heart and zzso muscle analyses show that the deletion of zzso zzso a decrease of the HAD activity zzso while zzso zzso zzso remains zzso A zzso deletion alone has no zzso However, these mild zzso are not due to a zzso compensation of zzso and zzso functions since double gene deletion zzso mostly reproduces the zzso zzso reduced zzso in addition to a shift from fast to slow zzso In conclusion, zzso is not required for maintaining skeletal muscle zzso activity and does not compensate the lack of zzso in zzso zzso zzso
