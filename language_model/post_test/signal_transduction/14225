zzso growth factor 10 zzso is required for embryonic zzso zzso including brain development, lung zzso and initiation of limb bud zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso as a lead induction factor for stem cell differentiation toward zzso zzso To this end, human zzso stem cell in zzso system was zzso Human zzso fluid stem cells were zzso with immortalized zzso cancer lines to induce directed differentiation into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso II, III, and zzso 8, were monitored by zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso stem cells began to express zzso II, III, and zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso from zzso cancer cells abolished the directed zzso In addition, when zzso downstream signaling was blocked with the zzso zzso the zzso system lost the capacity to induce zzso zzso zzso addition of zzso zzso protein promoted stem cell differentiation into zzso cell zzso Together, this report suggests that zzso zzso signaling stimulates the differentiation of human stem cell into zzso zzso Current study provides insight into the potential role of zzso as a lead growth factor for zzso zzso and its therapeutic application for zzso zzso
