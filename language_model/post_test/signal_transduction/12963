zzso acute zzso failure zzso is a relatively common disorder with major morbidity and zzso To study global gene expression during zzso 6-week-old zzso male mice underwent 30 zzso of bilateral zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso or sham zzso zzso zzso zzso with approximately 10,000 zzso zzso of which were present in mouse zzso were used to analyze zzso expression for up to 4 days following zzso zzso genes at day 1 and 40 at day 4 were zzso more than zzso zzso zzso genes at day 1 and 30 genes at day 4 were zzso to under zzso from baseline zzso zzso quantitative zzso confirmed changes in expression for 8 genes of zzso Most of the induced transcripts are involved in cell structure, zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso and cell zzso Our data identified several novel genes that may be important in zzso repair after zzso
