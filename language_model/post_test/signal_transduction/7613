zzso is linked to cell death, yet the associated mechanisms are largely zzso We discovered that melanoma, which is generally resistant to drug-induced zzso can undergo zzso cell death with the participation of orphan nuclear zzso zzso A sequence of molecular events leading to cellular demise is launched by a specific chemical compound, zzso newly acquired from screening a library of zzso zzso The zzso cascade comprises zzso zzso to zzso through interaction with the zzso outer membrane protein zzso crossing into the zzso inner membrane through zzso and zzso channel zzso dissipation of zzso membrane potential by the zzso transition pore complex zzso and induction of zzso This process leads to excessive zzso clearance and irreversible cell zzso It implicates a new approach to melanoma therapy through zzso of a zzso signaling zzso that zzso a nuclear zzso with zzso for cell zzso
