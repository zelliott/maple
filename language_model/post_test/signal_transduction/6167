A wide variety of otherwise unrelated zzso elicit a common set of behavioral defects centering around zzso contributions to cognitive zzso We zzso the developing chick to overcome confounds related to maternal effects and compared the actions of zzso zzso and heroin on zzso signaling in the zzso part of the zzso zzso zzso which controls zzso zzso Chicken eggs were injected with nicotine (10 zzso of zzso zzso (10 zzso of zzso or heroin (20 zzso of zzso all doses below the threshold for zzso on incubation days zzso 0 and 5, and then tests were conducted zzso All three compounds zzso significant deficits in zzso zzso We also found defects in zzso synaptic signaling specifically involving the zzso zzso membrane zzso of protein zzso C zzso and in the zzso levels of both zzso and zzso the two zzso known to be relevant to behavioral zzso In contrast, there were no zzso in the response of zzso an zzso that does not contribute to the behavior, nor were zzso levels of any of the zzso zzso Taken together with similar results obtained in zzso our findings suggest that disparate zzso all involve signaling defects centering on the ability of zzso receptors to elicit zzso zzso and that this effect is zzso zzso not zzso by maternal zzso The chick thus provides a suitable model for the rapid screening of zzso and zzso of the mechanisms underlying behavioral zzso
