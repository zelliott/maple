To specify the zzso zzso targeting signal type 1 zzso and the zzso zzso for higher plants, a maximum number of plant zzso and expressed sequence tags that are zzso to zzso and zzso plant proteins was retrieved from the public databases and the primary structure of their targeting zzso was analyzed for zzso zzso According to their high overall frequency in the zzso and their widespread zzso in different zzso groups, nine major zzso zzso zzso without zzso plus zzso and zzso and two major zzso zzso zzso were defined that are considered good indicators for zzso zzso if present in unknown zzso A lower but significant number of zzso contained 1 of 11 minor zzso zzso or of 9 minor zzso zzso many of which have not been identified before in plant zzso zzso The region adjacent to the zzso peptides was characterized by specific zzso properties as well, such as a pronounced zzso of basic and Pro zzso and a high positive net charge, which probably play an auxiliary role in zzso zzso By contrast, several peptides with assumed zzso targeting properties were not found in any of the 550 zzso and hence zzso at zzso a minor role in zzso zzso Based on the definition of these major and minor zzso and on the recognition of additional zzso properties, the accuracy of predicting zzso proteins can be raised and plant zzso can be screened for novel proteins of zzso more zzso
