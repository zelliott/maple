Resistance to potato zzso zzso zzso in tomato zzso zzso is zzso by zzso Early during both compatible and incompatible zzso potato zzso feeding zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we used genetic and zzso approaches to investigate the role of zzso signaling in zzso defense and zzso resistance to potato zzso in zzso The effect of potato zzso infestation on zzso zzso in susceptible and resistant plants was zzso zzso zzso were performed using plants impaired in zzso zzso or perception using zzso gene zzso the Never ripe zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A burst of zzso was observed after zzso feeding in both resistant and susceptible plants, correlated with an increase in the expression of zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso signaling or zzso did not compromise zzso resistance but it did decrease zzso to potato zzso in a compatible zzso zzso may not play a significant role in zzso resistance to potato zzso in tomato but zzso the host zzso defense, enhancing its zzso to the zzso
