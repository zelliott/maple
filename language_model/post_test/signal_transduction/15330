zzso plays multiple roles in the zzso including zzso functions and production of the zzso zzso and zzso It has been proposed to be taken up into zzso via a variety of membrane transport systems, including system A, which is a zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso In this study, we investigate zzso transport by application of zzso acids to individual principal zzso of the zzso nucleus of the trapezoid body zzso in acutely isolated rat brain zzso A zzso transport current was studied in zzso zzso which had the electrical and pharmacological properties of system zzso it was zzso had a zzso zzso relationship, was activated by zzso zzso by zzso acid zzso and was unaffected by zzso acid zzso Additionally, we examined the expression of different system A zzso zzso using zzso zzso with zzso raised against system A zzso 1 and 2 zzso and zzso Our results indicate that both zzso are expressed in zzso principal zzso and demonstrate that functional system A zzso are present in the plasma membrane of zzso Since system A transport is highly regulated by a number of cellular signaling mechanisms and zzso then goes on to activate other zzso the study of these zzso in zzso gives an indication of the mechanisms of zzso zzso supply as well as points of regulation of neurotransmitter production, cellular signaling and metabolism in the native zzso zzso
