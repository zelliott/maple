The factors limiting zzso and infant zzso zzso responses to zzso zzso are only partly zzso In this study, we assess how these B cell responses are influenced by the zzso development of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso When zzso mice were zzso with zzso zzso zzso at various stages of their immune development, a major functional maturation step for induction of serum zzso zzso cells, and zzso center zzso responses was identified between the second and the third week of zzso This correlated with the development of the zzso zzso cell zzso network, as mature zzso clusters only appeared at 2 zzso of zzso zzso transfer of zzso zzso into adult zzso mice rapidly induced B cell zzso and zzso precursor differentiation into mature zzso indicating effective recruitment and signaling capacity of zzso B zzso In contrast, adoptive transfer of adult zzso into zzso zzso mice induced primary B cell zzso without any differentiation of mature zzso and failed to correct limitations of zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso to zzso signals at the level of zzso zzso precursors delays zzso maturation and zzso zzso thus limiting primary zzso cell responses to zzso zzso in early zzso zzso
