zzso zzso is a zzso protein involved in tissue zzso zzso immunity and zzso zzso High zzso serum levels predict poor prognosis in zzso cell zzso and set patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso apart from zzso zzso zzso Yet neither the spectrum of tissue expression nor the zzso pathways of zzso in zzso and pulmonary zzso have been zzso although in zzso evidence links zzso to the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to address these zzso 

zzso expression was investigated zzso in 104 zzso and 38 zzso and correlated with zzso features, including zzso type, grade and proliferation and with expression of activated zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules zzso zzso zzso zzso and of zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso expression was widespread zzso and independent of the molecular parameters zzso In zzso high zzso expression was correlated with expression of zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso expression is typical of, but not specific for zzso whereas it appears to select zzso cases with zzso and zzso zzso suggesting a link with zzso zzso zzso
