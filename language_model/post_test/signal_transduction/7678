zzso exerts zzso effects at the cellular zzso Signaling via the two zzso of the insulin zzso zzso may explain the zzso of different signaling zzso while it remains to be explored how selectivity is achieved when utilizing the same zzso zzso We now demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso and zzso genes is activated simultaneously in the zzso zzso via zzso localized in different cellular zzso zzso activates the zzso gene from plasma zzso zzso while zzso gene zzso is dependent on zzso zzso and signaling from early zzso Moreover, zzso gene zzso requires the integrity of the zzso zzso zzso and signaling via zzso while zzso gene zzso requires the intact zzso zzso and signaling via zzso zzso By using zzso as an example it is thus possible to demonstrate how spatial segregation allows simultaneous and selective signaling via the same zzso zzso in the same zzso
