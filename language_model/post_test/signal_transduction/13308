The zzso processes are specified as at least two independent functional zzso two large lateral regions where zzso is dependent on zzso growth factor zzso zzso and a small zzso region where zzso is independent of zzso zzso To gain insight into signaling pathways that may be involved in zzso of the zzso region, we have examined the roles of pathways regulated by zzso and bone zzso proteins zzso in zzso of the zzso and lateral regions of the developing chick zzso Our results show that, unlike in the lateral region, the proliferation and growth of the zzso in the zzso region is dependent on signals derived from the zzso zzso We also show that zzso and lateral zzso zzso respond differently to zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso can mimic many of the effects of zzso zzso from the zzso region, including supporting the expression of zzso zzso outgrowth of the zzso processes and zzso of zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso placed zzso beads did not induce zzso expression of zzso genes and did not affect the growth of the zzso zzso These functional studies, together with our tissue distribution studies, suggest that zzso signaling zzso than zzso through interactions with zzso zzso and downstream target genes including zzso zzso is part of the signaling zzso that mediates the zzso interactions in the zzso region of the developing zzso Our observations also suggest that zzso play multiple zzso and zzso roles in zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso applied to the lateral region at early stages of development zzso zzso caused zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and inhibited outgrowth of the zzso processes and the formation of zzso zzso Our additional experiments suggest that the differences between the effects of zzso on lateral zzso zzso at stage 20 and previously reported results at stage 23 zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are related to differences in stages of differentiation in that zzso promotes zzso in zzso lateral zzso zzso whereas it promotes zzso at later stages of zzso We also showed that, unlike zzso zzso and zzso placed zzso zzso zzso placed zzso did not support outgrowth of the isolated zzso and at stage 20 induced the formation of a duplicated rod of cartilage extending from the body of zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso do not play essential roles in zzso interactions in the zzso region of the developing zzso However, zzso signaling is a part of the signaling pathways regulating zzso of the zzso zzso
