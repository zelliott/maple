zzso and zzso receptors expressed in zzso are an important part of a functional system for cell zzso While several aspects of this process are clearly dependent on zzso zzso less is known about the mechanisms controlling zzso entry during zzso zzso zzso We used zzso technique to study responses to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso human zzso Both zzso induced large currents zzso by zzso channels about three times more permeable to zzso than zzso suggesting that they play an important role in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso currents were inhibited by zzso a zzso C zzso zzso Investigation of the pathways downstream of zzso zzso revealed that zzso did not affect the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso a zzso analog of zzso zzso evoked a similar zzso zzso This action appears to be zzso since the effects of zzso or zzso of protein zzso C were comparatively zzso Finally, transient zzso potential zzso 7 zzso specific zzso by zzso zzso led to a decrease in zzso and zzso calcium entry, as well as zzso zzso We concluded that zzso of both zzso and zzso receptors via a common zzso link opens zzso zzso zzso
