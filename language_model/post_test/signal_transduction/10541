The zzso state of the zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in synaptic expression of the zzso channel properties, and synaptic zzso Several zzso receptors that couple to protein zzso A zzso readily recruit zzso of zzso at zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso readily recruits zzso of the same zzso site through zzso recruitment of zzso zzso In a zzso setting, zzso zzso often zzso and zzso between zzso of multiple signaling zzso can result in differential regulation of a given zzso After investigating the effect of zzso of the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso state, we have observed a novel signal that prevents zzso zzso of zzso at zzso site zzso This blockade of zzso zzso is dependent on cellular zzso recruited by either zzso or zzso zzso independent of zzso and independent of zzso protein zzso 1, and/or protein zzso 2A zzso Thus, in addition to the typical zzso rivalry zzso protein zzso state, we have identified a novel form of zzso regulation that occurs at zzso and may also occur at several other zzso zzso
