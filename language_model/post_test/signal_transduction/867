During development of the zzso sonic zzso zzso is directly responsible for the proliferation of zzso cell precursors in the external zzso zzso We have looked for signals able to regulate a switch from the zzso zzso response to one that directs differentiation of zzso zzso Bone zzso proteins zzso are expressed in distinct zzso populations within the developing zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in the zzso precursors and subsequently in differentiated zzso zzso of the internal zzso layer, whereas zzso is expressed by zzso zzso In primary cultures, zzso and zzso but not zzso are able to prevent zzso zzso thereby allowing zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment zzso components of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso the only known zzso zzso zzso capable of zzso the zzso are also zzso expressed in the developing zzso zzso in the external zzso layer and zzso in newly differentiated zzso zzso Among them, only zzso is zzso in zzso and in primary cultures treated with zzso and zzso of zzso is sufficient to induce zzso cell differentiation in the presence of zzso We propose a model in which zzso zzso zzso suppresses the zzso response to zzso by zzso of the pathway, and allows zzso cell precursor to enter their differentiation zzso
