zzso modifications of zzso tails regulate numerous biological processes including transcription, DNA repair, and zzso Although recent studies suggest that structural zzso in zzso are critical for triggering the DNA damage response, very little is known about the nature of DNA zzso zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso 14 zzso in the zzso tail of zzso zzso is rapidly zzso at sites of DNA zzso zzso At late time points after zzso the zzso form of zzso zzso accumulates into zzso zzso zzso zzso formation is not associated with the zzso zzso of zzso but is strictly dependent on the zzso zzso of zzso Our results broaden the spectrum of zzso modifications that constitute the DNA damage zzso zzso and suggest a model for the underlying zzso structure within zzso zzso
