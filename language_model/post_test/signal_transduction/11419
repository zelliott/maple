zzso proteins are bacterial zzso zzso and zzso zzso by a duplicated zzso domain involved in the regulation of zzso zzso Recent genetic and zzso studies have suggested how the activity of these regulators is positively or zzso controlled through the multiple zzso of zzso zzso zzso The regulation mode of these proteins has been examined in light of the recently determined first crystal structure of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso
