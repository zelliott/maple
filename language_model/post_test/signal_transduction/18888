The zzso of zzso zzso zzso possess zzso activities; however, their mode of molecular action in regulating each cellular subset in the immune system is still not zzso Here, we investigate the function of the main zzso fraction of zzso zzso in B zzso zzso We find that zzso causes mouse zzso B cell zzso and differentiation to zzso plasma cells, and the process depends on zzso induction of zzso a master regulator capable of triggering the changes of a cascade of gene expression during zzso zzso In human peripheral B zzso although zzso fails to induce their zzso it is able to enhance zzso zzso which is associated with zzso zzso zzso The function of zzso depends on the zzso receptors zzso as zzso zzso against zzso block zzso induction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have shown that interaction of zzso with zzso followed by signaling through zzso zzso is involved in the induction of zzso zzso whereas signaling through zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso complex is involved in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the differential mechanism of zzso in mouse and human B cell zzso is probably due to the presence of zzso regulatory site in human zzso zzso These results establish the signaling and molecular mechanisms of zzso on promoting zzso zzso
