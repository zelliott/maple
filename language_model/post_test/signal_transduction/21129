zzso release from the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso is regulated by zzso and zzso zzso Yet, these same zzso regulators do not stimulate expression of the zzso Since the gastric zzso expresses large quantities of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso we examined whether zzso zzso zzso stimulate zzso gene expression in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of primary cultures zzso zzso gene expression about zzso whereas zzso treatment of zzso G cell cultures zzso zzso release but not gene zzso zzso and zzso were weak stimulants of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso human gastric zzso cell line zzso zzso gene expression nearly zzso and zzso reporter zzso zzso into zzso cells were zzso more than fourfold by zzso zzso induction was zzso by the previously defined zzso zzso zzso response element zzso element located at zzso to zzso zzso upstream from the cap site since a zzso of the zzso element abolished both zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso treatment of zzso cells zzso binding of the zzso factor zzso to this zzso zzso these results demonstrate that zzso gene expression and zzso release are regulated by different signaling zzso gene expression by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso
