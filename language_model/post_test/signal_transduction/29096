zzso are the most abundant bone cells, playing important roles in tissue zzso Little is known of how they react in zzso to cancer zzso Here we present a comparative study of the effect of a zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso on zzso While no differences in zzso of the bone are seen, the changes in the zzso of zzso are specifically related to the zzso stress zzso zzso approximately 22 zzso genes in zzso prepared from zzso of native bone using zzso zzso we observed approximately zzso and approximately zzso gene expression differences between zzso dissected from normal bone compared with those associated with zzso and multiple zzso zzso The genes zzso due to the stress exerted by zzso were zzso by multiple myeloma and vice versa, indicating zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso the zzso seem to impose selective pressures on zzso pathways such as that of zzso a major player in bone zzso Our data show for the first time that the zzso of zzso in zzso becomes strongly affected by cancer stress, generating gene expression zzso which, in contrast to comparable zzso changes, appear to relate to the nature of cancer and might thus become helpful in distinguishing different bone zzso
