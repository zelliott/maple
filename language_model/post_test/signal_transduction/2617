Using a reverse zzso zzso we demonstrated that both brain and zzso type zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are expressed in the zzso mouse zzso The zzso zzso expression was zzso with the zzso of the embryonic zzso late in the zzso stage, whereas the zzso zzso was present from the zzso through the zzso zzso The major psychoactive component of marijuana zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso generation in the zzso and this zzso was prevented by zzso zzso However, the inactive zzso zzso zzso failed to influence this zzso These results suggest that zzso receptors in the zzso are coupled to zzso zzso zzso binding zzso Further, the zzso and zzso exhibited the zzso capacity to zzso the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and natural zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso or zzso acid, arrested the development of zzso zzso primarily between the zzso and eight-cell stages in zzso in a zzso zzso zzso also zzso with the development of eight-cell zzso to zzso in zzso The zzso studies readily detected binding of zzso in zzso at all stages of zzso Positive signals were present in zzso zzso and all zzso of zzso through zzso zzso However, most of the binding sites in eight-cell zzso and zzso were present in the outer zzso In the zzso these signals were primarily localized in the mural zzso with low levels of signals in the polar zzso while little or no signals were noted in inner cell mass zzso These results establish that the zzso mouse zzso is a target for zzso zzso zzso many of the adverse effects of cannabinoids observed during pregnancy could be zzso via these zzso zzso Although the zzso significance of the zzso zzso signaling in normal zzso zzso development is not yet clear, the regulation of embryonic zzso and/or zzso levels via this signaling zzso may be important for normal embryonic development and/or zzso
