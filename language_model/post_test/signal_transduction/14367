The discovery of the zzso system zzso has raised a large interest in the scientific community providing us with a zzso long list of apparently independent zzso organ zzso As a result, in most reviews on this issue the main function of the zzso is considered as zzso Unfortunately, this vision does not add much to our understanding of the specific biological function of the zzso Thus, zzso is what in general all biological systems are or should zzso In this review we will show that the apparent inconsistent puzzle of the very different tissue specific effects of zzso zzso can be reconstructed in one zzso zzso This picture clearly shows that all the different zzso effects of zzso zzso one major zzso zzso to facilitate and increase energy zzso We will also analyze the implications of this zzso vision of the zzso in different zzso First, in the context of the systems that regulate energy balance, introducing a new zzso based on two zzso zzso an zzso and an zzso zzso Second, in the context of evolution, showing how the function of the zzso has shifted from essential to survival to almost pathological in current zzso Finally, in a zzso context, introducing the new concept of zzso evolution zzso which can explain the current obesity epidemic and the role the zzso plays in zzso
