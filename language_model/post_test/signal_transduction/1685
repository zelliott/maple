zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso attachment of zzso to five zzso zzso in human zzso Multiple zzso zzso zzso is a life-threatening disease characterized by the lack of zzso activities because of zzso of zzso zzso Here, we report the obligatory participation of zzso in the zzso stimulation of the level of zzso zzso and those of zzso zzso and the alpha zzso of zzso zzso in human zzso zzso from patients with zzso are unable to increase zzso zzso in response to zzso unless the vitamin concentration is raised zzso in keeping with zzso that cause a reduced affinity for zzso by the zzso zzso The outcome is deficient synthesis of zzso the active form of the vitamin in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels in normal and zzso zzso and zzso cells can be restored by the addition of the zzso zzso zzso and can be abolished by the addition of zzso of the soluble form of zzso zzso We propose a regulatory role for zzso in the control of zzso and zzso zzso levels through a signaling cascade that requires zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso
