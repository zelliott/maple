zzso zzso zzso zzso is an aggressive zzso which mainly disseminates to zzso of the zzso zzso an event zzso by molecular mechanisms that remain zzso Here, we investigated the expression and functional role of neural cell zzso zzso zzso a cell surface zzso involved in brain development and zzso in zzso zzso is absent from normal zzso zzso but becomes highly expressed in a subset of human zzso in which zzso expression is associated with high zzso grade, suggesting a zzso role in cancer zzso We demonstrate that zzso stimulates zzso cell migration and invasion in zzso and promotes zzso dissemination in zzso This zzso function of zzso is zzso by its interaction with zzso growth factor zzso zzso Indeed, not only zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso cell zzso but targeting the zzso interplay with a zzso zzso zzso the zzso dissemination of zzso in zzso Our results point to zzso stimulation of zzso as a novel mechanism underlying zzso zzso and indicate that this interplay may represent a valuable therapeutic zzso
