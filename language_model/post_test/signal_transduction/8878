To assess the effects of zzso extract from zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso 

zzso was extracted from dry powder of zzso zzso Its zzso activity was evaluated in the mouse zzso zzso burn model after topical administration of zzso four times daily for up to seven zzso zzso samples were processed for zzso zzso and gene expression zzso The effects of zzso on zzso migration, tube formation, and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulated zzso zzso signaling levels in vascular zzso cells were determined using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso labeling zzso wound healing zzso zzso tube formation zzso and western zzso 

zzso application of zzso significantly inhibited zzso caused by zzso zzso zzso treated with zzso showed reduced levels of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor 1 zzso zzso reduced levels of vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso and an increased level of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso These are parameters that have all been related to zzso and/or zzso In human vascular zzso cells, zzso significantly inhibited zzso migration, and tube formation in a zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso also decreased the levels of activated zzso and zzso zzso 

These data suggest that zzso extract from zzso zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso and that it may be of benefit in the therapy of zzso diseases involving zzso and zzso
