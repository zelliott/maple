zzso zzso strain zzso is a human zzso isolate that has been extensively studied for its potential zzso effects in human and animal zzso The objective of this study was to determine the effect of zzso zzso zzso on gene expression responses in the zzso cell line to improve understanding of how the strain might zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Exposure of zzso cells to zzso led to the induction of several human genes zzso zzso and zzso that are negative regulators of inflammatory signaling zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso functions was also zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso causes reduced bacterial zzso to zzso zzso zzso of three zzso genes was reduced significantly when zzso cells were zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso compared to cells zzso with the wild type, but there was no significant change in the zzso levels of the zzso zzso zzso genes that were significantly zzso upon exposure to zzso cells were identified by bacterial zzso zzso and consisted primarily of two groups of genes connected with zzso metabolism and the zzso for synthesis of the zzso zzso Following incubation with zzso cells, the zzso synthesis genes were transcribed at higher levels in the wild type than in the zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso zzso influences zzso cells both through zzso of the inflammatory response and by zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso zzso cell surface proteins of zzso zzso zzso have a central role in promoting the interaction between the zzso and zzso zzso
