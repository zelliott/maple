zzso and zzso are used in the treatment of zzso Their chronic effects on zzso cells are not well zzso We have shown that sustained exposure of rat zzso cells to zzso increased their protein synthesis activity, while zzso caused an zzso The effect of zzso was attributed to an zzso of translation zzso This study examines whether both drugs interact at the level of protein translation in zzso zzso zzso rat zzso cells were cultured with and without zzso and zzso before measurement of protein and insulin zzso abundance of zzso translation factors, and cell zzso A zzso exposure to zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso suppressed zzso of translation zzso both the zzso target of zzso zzso also known as zzso target of zzso zzso ones zzso initiation factor zzso protein 1 and zzso protein zzso and the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and inhibited protein zzso a zzso exposure resulted in 50% dead zzso These effects were zzso by addition of zzso the action of which was blocked by the zzso inhibitor zzso and the protein zzso A zzso inhibitor zzso In conclusion, zzso activates zzso in zzso cells leading to suppression of protein translation through zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso these zzso effects through zzso of zzso and zzso signaling zzso
