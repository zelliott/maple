The origin of zzso in gastrointestinal zzso was long thought to involve the activity of zzso cells of zzso zzso that locate in close association with enteric zzso and smooth muscle zzso We have demonstrated that significant decrease in the number of cells zzso to zzso a type of zzso zzso zzso in the gastrointestinal tract of mice zzso at the zzso locus and zzso mice administered with zzso zzso zzso leads to the impaired zzso zzso of the gastrointestinal zzso It is also demonstrated that zzso express zzso which plays important roles in development and maintenance of the zzso network in the gastrointestinal zzso zzso derived from zzso cells, are classified into smooth muscle type and zzso type by their zzso and tissue zzso The zzso for zzso zzso factor zzso has shown to be expressed in enteric zzso and gastrointestinal smooth muscle zzso Studies with zzso mice and transgenic mice have suggested that functional zzso is required for the differentiation and proliferation of zzso as zzso and zzso of neural regulation in gastrointestinal zzso Here we review the genetic basis of zzso gastrointestinal zzso and the zzso zzso
