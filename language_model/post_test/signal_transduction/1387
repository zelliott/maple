The zzso cellular events involved in zzso zzso were investigated in a condition of acute zzso pain by means of the mouse zzso zzso zzso administration of the zzso C zzso zzso zzso and zzso antagonized the zzso induced by the selective zzso zzso zzso By contrast, zzso an analogue of zzso used as negative control, was unable to modify the reduction of the pain threshold induced by zzso In mice undergoing treatment with zzso which zzso zzso zzso or treatment with zzso an zzso zzso the zzso induced by the zzso zzso remained zzso Similarly, zzso with zzso zzso did not alter the zzso zzso zzso Neither zzso zzso with zzso a blocker of zzso release from zzso stores, nor zzso with zzso a zzso of zzso zzso stores, prevented the decrease of pain threshold induced by zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso with the selective protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso C and zzso resulted in a zzso prevention of the zzso zzso zzso The administration of zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso did not produce any effect on zzso zzso The pharmacological treatments employed did not produce any behavioral impairment of mice as revealed by the zzso and zzso zzso These results indicate a role for the zzso zzso in central zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso did not appear to play a major role in the zzso of pain perception by zzso zzso
