zzso of smooth muscle contraction involves a number of signaling mechanisms that include both zzso and zzso zzso The goal of the present study was to determine the role of one such zzso zzso zzso in vascular smooth muscle zzso zzso Using intact zzso strips of the zzso carotid artery, we found that zzso of zzso by zzso resulted in a zzso decrease in the zzso response to both zzso stimulation and membrane zzso zzso and a decrease in zzso zzso light chain zzso zzso the primary step in the initiation of smooth muscle zzso zzso of zzso also depressed zzso zzso zzso which are not dependent on either zzso or zzso zzso but are dependent on protein zzso zzso To determine the zzso site of action of zzso we determined the effect of several zzso of calcium metabolism on zzso zzso of zzso These zzso included zzso zzso and zzso Only zzso blocked the zzso zzso of zzso Interestingly, all compounds blocked the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso of zzso is involved in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso for contraction likely to involve protein zzso zzso In addition, our results also suggest that zzso of zzso is involved in zzso signaling at the level of zzso calcium zzso
