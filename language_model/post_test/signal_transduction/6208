The zzso protein zzso zzso cascade is a sensor of cellular energy zzso Whenever the cellular zzso ratio falls, zzso to a stress that zzso zzso production or increases zzso consumption, this is amplified by zzso zzso into a much larger increase in the zzso zzso zzso activates the system by binding to two tandem zzso on the gamma zzso of zzso and this is antagonized by high zzso of zzso zzso binding causes zzso by a sensitive mechanism involving zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso Once zzso zzso switches on zzso pathways that generate zzso while switching off zzso zzso As well as acting at the level of the individual cell, the system also regulates food intake and energy expenditure at the whole body level, in particular by zzso the effects of hormones and zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso A particularly interesting downstream target recently identified is zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso regulates the target of zzso zzso and this appears to be responsible for limiting protein synthesis and cell growth, and protecting against zzso during cellular stresses such as zzso zzso
