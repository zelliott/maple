The Syrian golden zzso zzso zzso is highly susceptible to a number of zzso zzso zzso zzso the primary zzso zzso plays a key role in the host defense against zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso encodes a 174 zzso acid protein that has an additional 17 zzso acids at the zzso compared to zzso of mice and zzso A zzso zzso tail is also found in other zzso zzso The biological activity of zzso zzso had not been investigated previously so we first demonstrated the activity of native zzso in zzso of zzso zzso signaling and zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso We then tested the hypothesis that the zzso tail of zzso zzso could influence its biological zzso A truncated zzso zzso in which the zzso 17 zzso were removed by zzso of a stop zzso at the position corresponding to the stop zzso in the mouse zzso had approximately zzso greater activity than the full length protein when measured in the two zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically inhibited this biological zzso zzso these data indicate that this unique structural feature influences the biological activity of zzso zzso
