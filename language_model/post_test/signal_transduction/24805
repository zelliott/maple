zzso virus zzso is a human zzso that interacts with various zzso cells that carry the zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso through its major envelope zzso 350 zzso Previously we had demonstrated that zzso and other human zzso are capable of modulating zzso synthesis through the zzso expression of zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we show that, in contrast to infectious zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression in human zzso zzso as well as in a zzso cell line, zzso Our results also demonstrate that this increased expression is due to both enhanced zzso and stability of zzso zzso in zzso zzso The specificity of this effect is evidenced by the fact that zzso of cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso which blocks binding of zzso to zzso zzso the above mentioned effects of zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso of zzso by zzso is zzso by zzso through signal zzso pathways involving zzso zzso and zzso zzso To our knowledge this is the first report describing the zzso of zzso gene expression by the zzso zzso following its interaction with the viral zzso zzso on cells of the zzso zzso
