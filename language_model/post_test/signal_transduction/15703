zzso zzso zzso has been discovered as a supplemental or alternative medication for type 2 diabetes, but its mechanism of action is not well zzso The purpose of this study was to explore the possible zzso mechanisms of zzso in zzso zzso zzso the insulin resistance was induced by treatment with high zzso and insulin for 24 zzso The effects of zzso on zzso metabolism and the zzso zzso activity of zzso were zzso Meanwhile, the effects of zzso on zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso In addition, its effects on insulin signaling pathways and zzso protein zzso zzso signaling zzso were assessed by zzso analysis and real-time zzso The results showed that zzso induced zzso metabolism and zzso as well as zzso zzso to plasma membrane zzso in both control and zzso zzso zzso without any changes in insulin zzso beta zzso protein zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso was able to increase the zzso and zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso in the control and zzso zzso zzso with the specific zzso zzso inhibitor zzso partially inhibited the zzso zzso zzso but zzso zzso of zzso was not inhibited by zzso This study provides an experimental evidence of the effects of zzso on zzso zzso through the zzso of zzso zzso and it is independent of the effect on zzso zzso The findings also suggest exciting new insights into the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
