zzso to social cues, such as zzso can be modified by zzso zzso or environmental zzso zzso bee queens produce a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which regulates aspects of worker bee behavior and zzso zzso bees are less responsive to zzso than young bees engaged in zzso care, suggesting that zzso changes associated with behavioral maturation zzso response to this zzso Since zzso zzso zzso zzso is a major regulator of behavioral maturation in workers, we examined its role in modulating worker responses to zzso Treatment with a zzso analog resulted in significant reductions in both behavioral and zzso responses to zzso in young zzso zzso Treatment significantly reduced attraction to zzso and inhibited the zzso increase in zzso zzso levels in the fat bodies of worker zzso zzso analysis of brain gene expression patterns demonstrated that zzso has a larger effect on expression levels than zzso and that zzso has specific effects in the presence of zzso suggesting that some responses to zzso may be dependent on an individual zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso processes play a role in modulating responses to zzso in honey bees at the zzso zzso and molecular zzso
