An in zzso model was developed for the study of signal zzso between a zzso zzso a neural signal source, and recording zzso on zzso silicon zzso zzso doped zzso were used to achieve an all silicon zzso The model was used to study signal zzso as a function of the spatial position, and distance to the signal zzso zzso of the signal zzso to neighboring zzso on the chips were zzso It was found that the zzso decreased by a factor of two at a distance of 50 zzso between the zzso surface and the signal zzso The chip zzso signal zzso was found to be 6 zzso using an external reference zzso zzso were accomplished with an on chip reference zzso giving a zzso suppression of 20 zzso zzso analysis showed that doped silicon zzso displayed similar characteristics as zzso at zzso above 3 zzso zzso zzso were implanted in the rat zzso nerve and following a zzso nerve zzso period the zzso and zzso zzso roots in the spinal zzso were zzso zzso action zzso were recorded via the zzso zzso the zzso zzso nerve via the sieve zzso also induced lower leg muscle contraction zzso
