zzso growth of cardiac muscle cells occurs by zzso rather than division and is associated with changes in gene expression and muscle fiber zzso We show here that the protein zzso zzso can induce reporter gene expression from the zzso zzso factor zzso promoter, a genetic marker that is activated during in zzso zzso zzso induced both zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso however, while the zzso cascade zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso cascade inhibited zzso zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of the small zzso zzso also inhibited both zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicating an additional requirement for zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso into the same cells did not disrupt zzso muscle fiber zzso indicating that zzso pathways do not regulate zzso zzso in cardiac muscle zzso While active zzso was a potent zzso of zzso gene zzso this zzso did not induce zzso organization and prevented zzso zzso These data suggest that multiple signals control zzso zzso Positive and negative signals zzso by parallel zzso zzso zzso interact with zzso pathways to regulate zzso gene expression while other signals induce muscle fiber zzso in cardiac muscle zzso
