zzso mediate many of their psychoactive effects by zzso zzso 2A receptors zzso Although zzso is the zzso zzso neurotransmitter and is not considered zzso zzso of zzso also have high affinity at zzso and can induce hallucinations in zzso Here we report that zzso differs from the psychoactive zzso by its ability to engage a zzso signaling cascade in the frontal zzso zzso and zzso zzso induce a zzso response in zzso zzso mice that is a behavioral proxy for zzso zzso The response in zzso zzso zzso mice is greatly attenuated until the doses are zzso at which point, zzso mice display a zzso response that can exceed that of zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso also produces a greater response in zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso blocks zzso head zzso in zzso mice, indicating that zzso rather than zzso primarily mediate this zzso zzso studies demonstrate that zzso stimulates zzso zzso in the frontal zzso and in primary cortical zzso through the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso do zzso Furthermore, disruption of any of the components of this cascade prevents zzso but not zzso head zzso We propose that there is a zzso of zzso signaling that is neurotransmitter and zzso zzso This demonstration of zzso zzso signaling in zzso may significantly impact drug discovery efforts for the treatment of disorders wherein hallucinations are part of the zzso such as zzso or manifest as side effects of treatment, such as zzso
