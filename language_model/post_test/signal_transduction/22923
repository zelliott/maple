zzso is present in the zzso in zzso and zzso area and is released from mast cells and zzso in the early stage of inflammation of the zzso Such release may contribute to common itching or intensify the inflammatory zzso zzso binds to its receptors and participate in regulation of the inflammatory responses by acting on zzso cells, nerve zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso has direct effects on zzso as zzso zzso zzso the proliferation of zzso The binding of zzso to the zzso on zzso membrane zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso C through zzso binding zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso transient increase in zzso zzso in cultured normal human zzso zzso zzso and normal zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors are widely distributed in many zzso and zzso In this study, we investigated which types of zzso receptors are related to the increase in zzso zzso by zzso stimulation in cultured human zzso zzso zzso were cultured in zzso zzso zzso With zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso responses were moderately but not statistically significantly zzso With zzso zzso zzso zzso response was significantly zzso zzso response was not affected by these zzso Thus, it is considered that zzso zzso specifically block zzso increase in zzso zzso of cultured normal human zzso
