zzso are zzso zzso signaling molecules that regulate the growth and development of both zzso and zzso zzso As zzso zzso organisms, plants zzso zzso as one of their major signaling zzso However, the details of other sugar signaling molecules and their regulatory factors have remained zzso due to the complexity of the zzso and hormone interactions that control zzso and zzso programs in zzso We combined information from a zzso zzso screen and a zzso zzso analysis to demonstrate that zzso acts as a signaling zzso in zzso zzso zzso signaling induced zzso zzso arrest and zzso with plant stress hormone signaling in a manner similar to that of zzso For zzso signaling responses, the plant zzso sensor zzso zzso was zzso while zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso played a crucial zzso Interestingly, zzso function in zzso signaling appeared to be independent of its zzso activity in sugar zzso zzso analysis further indicated that zzso zzso signaling may act downstream of the zzso acid pathway, in spite of the fact that zzso zzso signaling works upstream of hormone zzso Our findings revealed that multiple layers of controls by zzso zzso and zzso acid finely tune the plant zzso transition and zzso early zzso establishment after seed zzso
