We previously reported that zzso D3 zzso protects primary human zzso against ultraviolet zzso zzso Here, we confirmed the zzso effect of zzso in zzso using zzso and zzso as zzso zzso We further showed that zzso activates two survival pathways in zzso the zzso signal regulated zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso was zzso required a minimal dose of zzso M and could be blocked by zzso D and zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso or zzso activity with respectively a zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso partially or totally suppressed the zzso capacity of zzso Finally, zzso changed the expression of different zzso regulators belonging to the zzso zzso Indeed, zzso treatment increased levels of the zzso protein zzso and decreased levels of the zzso proteins zzso and Bad in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso was further shown to be zzso by zzso and, to a lesser extent, by zzso In conclusion, zzso clearly protects zzso against zzso zzso by zzso the zzso and the zzso survival pathways and zzso by increasing the zzso to zzso and Bad zzso
