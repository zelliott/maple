Nuclear zzso zzso is usually maintained in an inactive form in the zzso through its association with inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso and is activated upon stimulation of cells with a variety of zzso However, zzso zzso of zzso is observed in a number of zzso including breast zzso The signaling pathways that are involved in zzso zzso zzso remain largely zzso Using breast cancer cell lines derived from transgenic mice that zzso specific zzso factors in the zzso zzso we show that zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso plays a major role in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso reduced zzso zzso In contrast, zzso which blocks zzso of zzso by zzso failed to reduce zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso independent of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso A zzso and zzso zzso appear to be downstream signaling molecules involved in zzso zzso as specific zzso of these zzso but not zzso of zzso zzso or protein zzso C reduced zzso zzso zzso Based on these results, we propose that zzso increases the expression of zzso zzso and zzso genes in cancer cells through zzso zzso of zzso which leads to invasive and drug-resistant growth of breast zzso
