In addition to cancer zzso zzso plays an essential role in blocking signals stemming from zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso during eye development, but the underlying mechanisms have not been zzso We now show that without zzso zzso zzso in the eye results from enhanced zzso proliferation from embryonic day zzso zzso of mouse zzso Loss of zzso in the eye increases zzso zzso In cultured zzso and zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso enhances the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso also zzso primary zzso transcripts and a zzso driven by a minimal promoter, including one missing the zzso element required for high-level zzso zzso uses both zzso and zzso mechanisms to control zzso In zzso without zzso zzso zzso is elevated and eye development abnormalities resemble the zzso zzso zzso However, effects of zzso on zzso zzso do not appear to be due to direct zzso or zzso zzso II recruitment to the zzso Although zzso controls zzso zzso in a zzso manner, it also zzso zzso protein expression by blocking new protein synthesis in the absence of zzso Thus, our findings demonstrate a novel capacity for zzso to control zzso expression by zzso and zzso mechanisms involving zzso zzso and protein zzso respectively, to promote the vascular zzso needed for normal zzso
