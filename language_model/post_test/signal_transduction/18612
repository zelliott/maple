The early B zzso in zzso is regulated through close interactions with zzso cells and components of the zzso zzso in the bone zzso zzso zzso Although B zzso has been studied for decades, the factors that are implicated in this process, both zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso signaling is known to be involved in embryonic development and growth regulation of zzso and zzso zzso molecules are produced in the zzso and we here ask whether zzso zzso signaling has a role in regulating human zzso B zzso 

zzso of the zzso expression pattern of zzso zzso zzso receptors and zzso zzso revealed that zzso B zzso cells and zzso cells express a set of zzso and receptors available for induction of zzso signaling as well as zzso for fine tuning of this zzso Furthermore, different B zzso maturation stages showed differential expression of zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting zzso zzso signaling as a regulator of early B zzso zzso zzso induced stabilization and nuclear zzso of zzso in primary lineage restricted B zzso zzso Also, zzso inhibited B zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso B zzso cells in zzso zzso using a supportive layer of zzso zzso This effect was blocked by the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of early events in the zzso showed that zzso zzso cell division of B zzso zzso 

These results indicate that zzso zzso signaling is involved in human zzso B zzso where it acts as a negative regulator of cell proliferation in a direct or zzso dependent zzso
