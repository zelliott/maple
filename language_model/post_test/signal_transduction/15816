zzso are antioxidants found in zzso of leaves, and it is a matter of current debate whether or not they can affect signaling and gene expression in plant zzso For insight into the possible effects of altered zzso composition in zzso on gene expression in the nucleus, the expression of zzso zzso perception and signaling genes was investigated in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which are impaired in zzso zzso zzso zzso Changes in gene expression were measured in plants exposed to either salt or water stress, and in young and mature leaves of zzso and zzso zzso which lack zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso While transcript levels of zzso signaling genes in the zzso zzso and the wild type were similar in all tested conditions, major changes in gene expression occurred in the zzso zzso particularly in mature leaves zzso with young zzso and under salt zzso zzso of zzso instead of zzso in this zzso led to elevated transcript levels of zzso signaling zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in mature leaves of control zzso However, with salt treatment, transcript levels of most of these genes remained constant or dropped in the zzso zzso while they were dramatically induced in the wild type and the zzso zzso Furthermore, under salt stress, leaf zzso zzso acid accumulated in both the zzso zzso and the wild type, but not in the zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso acid and zzso signaling pathways are zzso in mature leaves of zzso zzso zzso
