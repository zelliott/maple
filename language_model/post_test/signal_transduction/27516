zzso architecture in zzso organisms is maintained through adhesive interactions between cells and their neighbors, and between cells and the underlying zzso zzso These interactions are important in the dynamic regulation of tissue organization as well as the control of cell zzso differentiation and zzso The ultimate goal of this regulation is to promote cell growth and differentiation only when the cell is in the correct location, and to delete cells that have become displaced from their proper zzso It therefore plays an important role in development and tissue zzso In this review we consider the molecular mechanisms by which zzso interactions contribute to cell survival, and discuss their role in zzso zzso development and zzso
