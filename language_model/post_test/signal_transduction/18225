The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of intramuscular injection with zzso zzso a well-established experimental model for muscle pain, on central processing of zzso input from jaw muscle zzso zzso zzso cells were recorded from the zzso edge of the zzso zzso zzso and the adjacent zzso zzso formation from 11 adult zzso These cells were characterized as central units receiving jaw muscle zzso input based on their responses to electrical stimulation of the zzso zzso muscle zzso and jaw zzso zzso cells, which were successfully tested with zzso zzso zzso were zzso as either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso based on their responses to different speeds and zzso of jaw zzso zzso percent of the cells tested with an zzso injection of zzso saline showed a significant zzso of mean firing rates zzso during opening and/or holding zzso The most remarkable zzso change was a significant reduction of zzso during the hold phase in S units zzso zzso zzso zzso percent of the zzso units zzso zzso also showed significant changes in zzso limited to the hold zzso However, in the zzso zzso the zzso increased in seven units and decreased in four zzso Finally, five zzso zzso showed significant changes of zzso during both opening and holding zzso zzso of zzso saline into the zzso zzso muscle had little effect, but zzso saline injections made into the zzso zzso muscle produced similar results to zzso injections with zzso zzso These results unequivocally demonstrate that intramuscular injection with an zzso substance, sufficient to produce muscle pain, produces significant changes in the zzso properties of the jaw zzso zzso Potential mechanisms involved in zzso changes in the zzso signals and functional implications of the changes are zzso
