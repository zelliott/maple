zzso proteins belong to a highly zzso family of zzso signal zzso systems involved in global regulation in the zzso they were first identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as essential for zzso This paper reports on the identification of genes regulated by zzso and/or zzso in zzso zzso To do this, random zzso zzso were created in zzso zzso to follow gene zzso in an zzso zzso knockout zzso containing zzso zzso zzso borne zzso was cured from the zzso and zzso zzso activity compared between the different genetic zzso We detected zzso regulation of the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso is involved in regulating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and required for low pH and zzso induction of the nitrogen fixation regulators zzso and zzso In particular, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso of zzso is regulated by zzso through zzso
