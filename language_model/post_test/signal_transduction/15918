Current zzso and experimental studies support a beneficial role of dietary zzso in several gastrointestinal diseases, including inflammatory zzso zzso The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of the effects of a naturally occurring zzso zzso acid, present in some fruits such as zzso zzso and nuts among others, in an experimental zzso model of Crohn's disease by zzso administration of zzso in zzso Analysis of the zzso were carried out by zzso and zzso zzso zzso response was assessed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso by zzso and zzso nuclear zzso factor in zzso zzso cells thus, we determined the expression of zzso zzso and the involvement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the protective effect of zzso by western zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso diminished the severity and extension of the zzso injuries induced by zzso although there was no observed a significant zzso In addition, zzso increased zzso production in zzso cells in colon zzso decreased zzso zzso and zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso Also zzso was capable of reducing the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso preventing the zzso protein zzso and inducing an zzso of the nuclear zzso level of zzso in zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso reduces the damage in a rat model of Crohn's disease, zzso the zzso events and returns zzso proteins expression to zzso levels probably through zzso and zzso zzso zzso
