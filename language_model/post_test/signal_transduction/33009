zzso of zzso B zzso in zzso has previously been demonstrated to result in dominant negative interference of zzso A zzso zzso growth zzso in zzso zzso zzso This phenomenon has been examined further in this study and has been found to be dependent on the zzso zzso rate and on the availability of zzso zzso in the growth zzso zzso zzso zzso capable of zzso the putative zzso sensory function were not effective in zzso the zzso interference zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso site was also effective at zzso the zzso response, especially at higher zzso rates of zzso zzso zzso produces the dominant negative zzso without any apparent effect on zzso abundance or zzso It is possible that zzso and zzso interact with a common reaction partner but that either the energy state of the cell or a separate zzso mechanism zzso the zzso zzso
