Whereas high zzso flows are known to induce zzso cell zzso we show here that very low zzso flow rates trigger zzso cell zzso in zzso zzso zzso flow is a functionally critical component of the zzso and we have recently observed that it plays a regulatory role in zzso here we investigate zzso flow as a powerful zzso zzso We exposed both zzso and blood zzso cells zzso and zzso to zzso flow in zzso collagen gels as well as simple zzso flow in zzso zzso We found that under zzso flow zzso 10 zzso for 6 zzso both cell types underwent drastic zzso changes from zzso conditions: zzso formed large zzso and long zzso while zzso formed zzso zzso zzso zzso Under zzso zzso (20 zzso for 24 zzso zzso zzso their zzso zzso compared to zzso but did not differ zzso both aligned with flow as zzso The significance of these findings is twofold: first, they identify an important role of zzso flow for in zzso zzso organization and stabilization, and second, they demonstrate for the first time notable differences between zzso and zzso response to the zzso environment, reflecting some of their functional differences in zzso
