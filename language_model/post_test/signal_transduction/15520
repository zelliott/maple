zzso evidence indicates that the zzso complex of the zzso zzso interacts with zzso brain regions in zzso zzso effects on memory zzso Here, we investigated whether zzso influences on the consolidation of memory for emotionally zzso training depend on functional interactions between the zzso and the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso a brain region involved in zzso cognitive and affective zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso administered unilaterally into the left zzso of male Sprague zzso rats immediately after zzso avoidance training enhanced 48 h retention zzso An zzso but not zzso zzso of the zzso blocked the memory zzso In a second experiment, zzso zzso infused into the zzso after zzso avoidance training increased zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso zzso of this zzso activity in the zzso with the zzso protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso prevented the memory enhancement, suggesting that zzso zzso administration into the zzso enhances memory consolidation via zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso infusions administered into the zzso zzso increased zzso levels in the zzso in regulating memory zzso Moreover, as assessed with a zzso zzso avoidance procedure designed to separate zzso influences on memory of context and zzso zzso zzso zzso infusions into either the zzso or zzso enhanced memory of the contextual as well as aversive information acquired during zzso avoidance zzso These findings indicate that zzso effects on memory consolidation depend on zzso interactions between the zzso and zzso
