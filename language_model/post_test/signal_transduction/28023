In this study we investigated the effect of zzso signaling blockade on zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso We first established effective blockade of zzso activity as tested by zzso mobility shift zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso precursor cells zzso bone zzso zzso was markedly reduced by zzso of the cells with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso I zzso This zzso of zzso activity was associated with blockade of zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso We then established a direct zzso zzso approach by utilizing a zzso zzso zzso zzso and demonstrated an zzso effect evidenced by decreased zzso DNA binding zzso Having established that these strategies zzso zzso zzso zzso effectively block zzso zzso we next investigated the effect of these agents on zzso zzso zzso zzso particle stimulation of mature zzso formation from zzso zzso precursor cells was blocked by all three zzso To further test the efficacy of zzso zzso experiments were performed with the zzso zzso zzso in whole bone zzso cultures that contain supporting zzso zzso Again, this inhibitor efficiently blocked zzso zzso Thus, we have shown that pharmaceutical and molecular blockade of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso
