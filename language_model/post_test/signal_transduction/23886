A central function of the tumor zzso zzso zzso is its ability to repress zzso zzso zzso Many zzso harbor zzso zzso and consequently zzso zzso zzso peptides inhibit zzso recruitment and zzso by zzso zzso Here we report that zzso peptides selectively kill tumor cells with zzso zzso D zzso We extend these observations to tumor models and demonstrate zzso of tumor growth in zzso large T transformed zzso zzso zzso and in zzso transgenic zzso Moreover, our observations reveal that zzso zzso tumors undergo zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso zzso will provide selective zzso agents with in zzso efficacy in tumors with zzso zzso D zzso
