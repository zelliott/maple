Heat shock of zzso cells causes protein damage and activates a number of signaling zzso Some of these pathways enhance the ability of cells to survive heat zzso zzso induction of molecular zzso zzso shock protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso On the other hand, heat shock can activate a stress zzso zzso zzso zzso thus triggering both zzso and zzso cell death zzso Recent data indicate that zzso activated by heat shock can regulate synthesis and functioning of the molecular zzso and these zzso zzso activity of the cell death and survival zzso zzso the overall balance of the pathways and their interplay determine whether a cell exposed to heat shock will die or survive and become stress zzso
