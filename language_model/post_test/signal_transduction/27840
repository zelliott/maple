zzso are widely expressed zzso zzso zzso that are essential for many biological zzso zzso signaling pathways are zzso in diverse cell types when specific zzso receptors bind to the ninth and tenth zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso involves zzso of signaling pathways of the growth zzso zzso small zzso proteins zzso and zzso and zzso of focal zzso zzso We have dissected the requirement of zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso activity and zzso of focal zzso zzso in zzso zzso and Swiss zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso supports cell attachment but does not induce zzso of focal zzso zzso In Swiss zzso cells, growth zzso zzso of focal zzso zzso and downstream zzso events are dependent upon the presence of zzso in the intact zzso pair, whereas zzso focal zzso zzso zzso requires a synergistic signal from growth zzso Furthermore, zzso is able to elicit cellular responses zzso by zzso but not zzso whereas zzso can elicit both zzso and zzso zzso We propose that zzso of specific zzso zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso elicits distinct signaling zzso This may represent a general molecular mechanism for zzso of zzso signaling pathways by a zzso zzso
