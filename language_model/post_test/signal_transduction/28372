The X zzso mental zzso genes have attained high interest in the zzso A rough zzso zzso zzso mental zzso zzso and zzso mental zzso zzso zzso The latter are suggested to be responsible for human specific development of cognitive zzso These genes have been shown to be engaged in zzso zzso or in zzso zzso During this analysis, we have compared the expression pattern in the mouse of four genes from the latter class of zzso zzso zzso zzso (also called zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso show a specific zzso expression pattern with a certain overlap that allows to assign these zzso molecules to the same functional zzso We noticed the highest expression of these genes in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso in structures engaged in learning and zzso A completely different expression pattern was observed for zzso In the zzso it is expressed in zzso zones, where zzso zzso cells are zzso But zzso expression is also found in other zzso zzso Our analysis provides evidence that these zzso molecules are involved in different zzso expression zzso of common zzso zzso and that for most zzso considerable functional zzso of zzso zzso pathways zzso
