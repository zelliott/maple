The zzso content of and feeding recommendations for milk zzso zzso vary widely in North America, and acceleration of growth through manipulation of protein and energy zzso can reduce rearing costs of dairy zzso The effects of varying the protein and energy intake of MR on zzso zzso in zzso liver, and muscle and the zzso activity of protein zzso B zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso cell signals in liver and muscle were zzso zzso newborn zzso calves were fed 1 of 4 MR for 9 zzso zzso zzso a zzso crude protein zzso zzso fat MR fed at zzso g of dry matter zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso MR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fed at zzso g of zzso zzso a zzso high-fat MR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fed at zzso g of zzso and zzso zzso fed at zzso g of zzso zzso Water and starter zzso zzso zzso zzso were offered ad zzso and calves were fed MR twice zzso Plasma samples were obtained at 1, 5, and 9 zzso of zzso zzso were not weaned and were slaughtered after the last blood zzso Liver and muscle zzso were collected and analyzed for zzso zzso and cell signaling zzso zzso fed all treatments had lower plasma zzso of zzso and zzso and a trend for lower zzso but greater zzso of zzso relative to calves fed zzso zzso fed all treatments had increased muscle zzso of Met and muscle to plasma ratios of zzso zzso and zzso zzso acids compared with zzso All treatments increased liver to plasma ratios of zzso and zzso but diminished the ratios of Met compared with zzso zzso of protein zzso B was not affected by zzso however, relative to calves fed zzso zzso and zzso diets increased zzso ratios of zzso protein zzso in the zzso zzso the changes in plasma and tissue zzso and plasma to tissue ratios of zzso acids were associated with enhanced growth zzso However, cell signaling activity was not consistent with accelerated growth in calves fed treatments with increased contents of energy and protein possibly due to zzso effects of diet zzso + zzso or zzso before tissue zzso Muscle zzso of Met might have a regulatory role in protein synthesis in rapidly growing calves fed high levels of zzso and zzso
