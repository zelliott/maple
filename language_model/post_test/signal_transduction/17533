The human zzso cell lines zzso and zzso were chosen as zzso zzso models for functional zzso When cultured in the presence of zzso beta these cell lines demonstrated a marked increase in zzso production and in zzso zzso The addition of zzso could mimic the first effect of zzso beta but at the same time suppressed cell zzso These results suggest that zzso beta possibly exerts one of its biological effects zzso zzso by means of the zzso zzso zzso
