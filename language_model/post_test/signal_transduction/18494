zzso infections are increasing worldwide due to the marked rise in zzso including zzso however, immune responses to zzso are poorly zzso zzso is the major zzso pattern recognition zzso for the zzso component zzso zzso represents the zzso of innate zzso receptors zzso containing zzso zzso zzso motifs zzso related to those of zzso zzso zzso Here we identify zzso as a key zzso of zzso zzso Although being zzso for zzso responses, zzso controls zzso zzso cell zzso zzso production and innate zzso zzso zzso couples to zzso and regulates zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso Yet, zzso is zzso for zzso zzso zzso that uses zzso as a link to zzso Thus, our results define a novel innate immune zzso and indicate that zzso distinct zzso receptors in innate and zzso immune cells use diverse zzso proteins to engage selectively the zzso zzso zzso
