During induction of the zzso program in the zzso fungus zzso zzso the cell cycle is arrested on the plant surface and it is not resumed until the fungus enters the zzso The mechanism of this cell cycle arrest is unknown, but it is thought that it is necessary for the correct zzso of the zzso zzso Here, we show that this arrest takes place in the zzso phase, as a result of an increase in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso seems to be one of the reasons for the increase in zzso zzso zzso we also report the zzso checkpoint zzso zzso appears to be involved in this zzso Our results support the emerging idea that checkpoint zzso have roles other than in the zzso response, by virtue of their ability to interact with the cell cycle zzso
