zzso zzso is zzso I inhibitor used in the treatment of zzso zzso zzso In colon cancer cells it zzso DNA damage which leads to zzso with ensuing zzso or premature zzso Despite its clinical use and efficiency in zzso zzso its effects in normal zzso cells are relatively zzso In this work we report that zzso zzso zzso zzso which results in zzso and premature zzso whose occurrence nevertheless varies in relation to the type of exposed zzso In normal zzso zzso cells zzso the prevailing type of response is zzso whereas in normal zzso zzso zzso it is premature zzso Further analyses showed that zzso induced in both types of cells DNA damage and activated stress response pathways including zzso and zzso but with varying activity of stress zzso zzso and selected zzso zzso zzso cells zzso the expression of zzso which was subsequently specifically zzso zzso activated zzso and initiated zzso zzso zzso These events occurred in the presence of moderately increased expression of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was only moderately zzso zzso as well as zzso expressions were zzso in the presence of increased expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was found only in a minority of treated cells and the premature zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso further proved that zzso as well as independent mechanisms might be responsible for these cell zzso zzso
