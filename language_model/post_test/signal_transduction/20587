zzso is a member of the zzso zzso family of zzso zzso Here, we describe a novel functional interaction between zzso and the tumor zzso zzso zzso was identified in a zzso zzso screen using zzso recently characterized as an indirect zzso zzso as zzso zzso interacts in zzso with both zzso and zzso and zzso expression zzso and activates zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso with zzso to enhance zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, partial depletion of zzso zzso diminishes zzso protein levels and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso effects on zzso signaling may zzso at least in part, an observed induction of zzso modifications in zzso known to prevent its zzso zzso expression protects zzso cells from zzso zzso cell zzso In addition, zzso expression zzso sensitivity to zzso a zzso zzso zzso Our study suggests that zzso may participate in the zzso of zzso tumor zzso zzso
