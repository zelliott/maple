zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contributes to the development of zzso but the complex roles of zzso in normal development are not fully zzso zzso zzso links neural zzso guidance receptors to the zzso Here we report a novel role for zzso zzso in zzso cells, where it is critical for zzso zzso completely lacking both maternal and zzso zzso die with defects in several zzso processes requiring cell shape changes and cell zzso We describe the cellular defects that zzso these problems, focusing on zzso closure as an zzso Further, we show that the zzso target zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso is involved with zzso in zzso We find that zzso zzso to zzso junctions of most zzso cells, and that it genetically interacts with the zzso junction protein zzso zzso during zzso The defects of zzso zzso are strongly enhanced by zzso for zzso which encodes zzso Finally, loss of zzso reduces zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso while having little or no effect on other components of the zzso or cell polarity zzso We discuss possible models for zzso function during zzso zzso in light of these zzso
