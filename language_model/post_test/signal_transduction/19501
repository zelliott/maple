The plant hormone zzso plays a role in virtually every aspect of plant growth and zzso zzso and spatial distribution of zzso largely depends on the dynamic expression and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso carrier zzso We show here that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene family, is required for coordinated cell division during zzso zzso promotes expression of several zzso zzso genes during embryonic and root zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals that zzso activity is sufficient for rapid and high level zzso and zzso zzso Genes of the zzso zzso family respond to zzso and direct zzso zzso but zzso genes were severely zzso in zzso zzso zzso controls embryonic patterning together with the zzso dependent zzso pathway, but is itself only mildly zzso zzso We further show that all known zzso responses in the root require zzso zzso We thereby identify zzso as a central regulator of zzso distribution and signaling throughout plant zzso
