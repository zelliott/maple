zzso the zzso agent of zzso zzso is capable of directing its movement within host cells by forming an zzso comet zzso The zzso zzso zzso expressed at one pole of the zzso recruits neural zzso syndrome protein zzso a member of the zzso family, which in turn stimulates zzso protein zzso 2/3 zzso zzso zzso As all the zzso family proteins induce zzso zzso by recruiting zzso complex, we investigated their involvement in zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso binds to zzso but not to the other zzso family zzso Using a series of zzso obtained by swapping zzso and zzso zzso we demonstrated that the specificity of zzso to interact with zzso lies in the zzso region containing the zzso zzso zzso domain and zzso zzso motif of zzso A zzso change in zzso was important for the zzso interaction, as elimination of the zzso zzso region, which is responsible for the zzso interaction with the central basic region of zzso affected the specific binding to zzso We observed that, in zzso cells such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was predominantly zzso whereas the expression of zzso was greatly zzso Indeed, unlike zzso zzso was unable to move in zzso at all, although the movement was restored as zzso was expressed zzso Thus, our findings demonstrate that zzso is a specific zzso of zzso which determines the host cell type allowing zzso spreading of zzso
