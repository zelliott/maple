Vitamin E zzso is a zzso zzso that is transported by plasma zzso in the zzso zzso taken up by the liver with zzso is thought to be zzso into the plasma in very low density zzso zzso zzso transfer protein zzso which was recently identified as a product of the zzso gene for familial isolated vitamin E zzso is a zzso liver protein and plays an important role in the efficient recycling of plasma vitamin zzso To throw light on the mechanism of zzso zzso transfer in the liver cell, we devised an zzso system using the zzso cell line zzso Using this system, we found that the zzso of zzso was more efficient in cells expressing zzso than in matched cells lacking zzso zzso A, which effectively zzso zzso zzso by zzso the zzso apparatus, had no effect on zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso zzso is not coupled to zzso zzso Among other agents tested, only zzso a zzso of cholesterol zzso inhibited zzso zzso This zzso is most likely zzso by zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso present in the liver zzso functions to stimulate zzso of cellular zzso into the zzso medium and that the reaction zzso a novel zzso zzso that may be linked to cellular cholesterol metabolism and/or zzso
