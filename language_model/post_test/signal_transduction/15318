zzso zzso type 2 zzso is the primary zzso agent of zzso zzso wasting syndrome, which is an emerging zzso zzso zzso To uncover cellular protein responses in zzso zzso cells, the comprehensive zzso profiles were analyzed utilizing two-dimensional gel zzso zzso coupled with zzso zzso Multiple comparisons of zzso revealed that the majority of changes in protein expression occurred at zzso h after zzso zzso A total of 34 zzso zzso including 15 zzso and 19 zzso zzso were identified by zzso zzso According to cellular function, the differential expression proteins could be sorted into several groups: zzso zzso stress response, zzso zzso energy zzso zzso pathway, signal zzso gene zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated the changes of alpha zzso beta zzso and zzso 8 during zzso zzso and zzso analyses confirmed that the cellular alpha zzso interacts with the Cap protein of zzso in the infected zzso zzso These identified cellular constituents have important implications for understanding the host interactions with zzso and brings us a step closer to defining the cellular requirements for the underlying mechanism of zzso replication and zzso
