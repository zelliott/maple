zzso zzso is involved in many cardiovascular diseases such as zzso heart zzso We have recently reported that zzso had a zzso effect in isolated cardiac zzso and that it activated zzso zzso activated protein zzso zzso This study was designed to characterize a possible mechanism involved in the zzso effect of zzso zzso rat cardiac zzso were exposed to zzso (10 zzso for up to 8 zzso and zzso zzso expression was measured by zzso Protection zzso and Western zzso The activity of zzso was analyzed by Western zzso Cell number was assessed by use of a Coulter zzso zzso zzso was increased by zzso in a zzso manner reaching 23 fold stimulation after 1 h compared to zzso zzso zzso to zzso was not found in zzso After 16 h of exposure to NE, zzso protein was zzso It further increased up to 48 zzso The effect of zzso on zzso zzso was abolished by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso suppressed the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso fashion after 5 zzso attenuated the zzso zzso expression after 2 zzso and suppressed the zzso effect of zzso from 53 to zzso after 48 zzso zzso zzso caused an increase in proliferation by zzso after 48 zzso zzso application of the zzso zzso reduced the zzso proliferation to zzso and completely prevented the zzso induced zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso proliferation of rat cardiac zzso in part by increasing the expression of zzso through regulation of zzso
