Sonic zzso zzso signaling plays an important role in many human zzso and cancer stem zzso Here we investigate the activity and functional role of zzso signaling in chronic zzso leukemia zzso and leukemia zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling was found in about 50% zzso chronic phase samples, about zzso of zzso accelerated phase samples, and zzso zzso blast crisis phase zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling was observed in zzso and zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling with zzso zzso zzso induced expansion of zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso blocking the zzso with signal inhibitor induced cell zzso zzso zzso zzso Low level of zzso protein was observed in zzso bone zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso cells are less sensitive to zzso zzso zzso and more sensitive to zzso than zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling play a zzso role in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso signaling was found in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Administration of zzso zzso or zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells induced cell zzso however, zzso zzso could salvage cell zzso while zzso zzso failed to zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also found to be downstream targets of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso cell cycle arrest of zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso signaling provides survival and zzso cues in zzso zzso cells through downstream zzso zzso suggesting a novel therapeutic approach in zzso
