The protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso only when zzso by protein zzso A and could play a pivotal role in the zzso zzso zzso cardiac zzso was cloned by reverse zzso chain reaction, expressed in zzso coli, evaluated in zzso zzso and used to generate an zzso An zzso was constructed zzso zzso and green fluorescent protein zzso under separate zzso zzso zzso A zzso virus zzso served as zzso zzso heart tissue zzso from zzso rat zzso and adult rat cardiac zzso zzso were used as model zzso zzso expression was determined in human zzso samples by Northern zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso rat zzso displayed a zzso reduction in zzso zzso zzso infected with zzso exhibited a fivefold increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed enhanced cell zzso as well as enhanced zzso zzso when zzso with 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were reduced by zzso in failing hearts with zzso and zzso zzso zzso each) compared with zzso hearts zzso In zzso increased zzso expression enhances zzso sensitivity to zzso indicating that zzso acts as an amplifier in zzso zzso zzso zzso in failing human hearts could participate in zzso of the zzso zzso
