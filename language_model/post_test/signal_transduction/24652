Recent studies of genetically isolated zzso in zzso zzso and zzso have revealed zzso functions in zzso pattern zzso The zzso proteins act as genetic switches to determine cell fates between two alternative choices during C zzso zzso development zzso versus zzso zzso and during zzso eye development zzso versus cone zzso In both cases, zzso proteins act downstream of a zzso zzso zzso in a signal zzso zzso that mediates zzso zzso These genetic systems may allow the further zzso of zzso zzso regulatory zzso
