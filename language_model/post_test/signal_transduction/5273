zzso zzso proteins contain targeting signals zzso to enable their import into zzso These targeting signals have been identified as zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and higher plant zzso however, no zzso zzso acid sequences have been observed in zzso from the zzso database of zzso zzso zzso a primitive red zzso In studies on the evolution of zzso it is important to know when their sequences came to be the zzso targeting signals for all living zzso To this end, we identified a number of genes in the zzso database of the green algae zzso zzso which contains zzso acid sequences similar to those found in plant zzso In order to determine whether these sequences function as zzso in green algae, we expressed modified green fluorescent proteins zzso fused to these putative zzso peptides under the cauliflower mosaic virus zzso zzso To confirm whether zzso structures containing zzso fusion proteins accumulated in the zzso of zzso zzso we observed these cells after the zzso were stained with 3, zzso Our results confirm that the zzso fusion proteins indeed accumulated in the zzso of these green zzso These findings suggest that the zzso transport system for zzso and zzso is zzso in green zzso cells and that our fusion proteins can be used to zzso zzso in live zzso
