zzso proliferation and differentiation of growth plate zzso is required for normal growth and development of the zzso zzso but little is known about the zzso signal zzso pathways regulating these zzso We have investigated the roles of the zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed throughout zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells results in increased proliferation and a marked delay of zzso zzso as shown by decreased induction of alkaline zzso activity, zzso and expression of the zzso markers collagen X, bone zzso and zzso zzso zzso These effects are accompanied by zzso of zzso D1 zzso and repression of the collagen X promoter by zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso signaling by the pharmacological inhibitor zzso zzso zzso proliferation and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso induction of the zzso D1 promoter by zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso treatment partially zzso the effects of zzso zzso In zzso we identify the zzso signaling zzso as a novel and important regulator of zzso proliferation and zzso
