zzso is a chronic condition involving the excessive zzso of zzso tissue that adversely affects all systems in the zzso The aim of the present study was to employ an zzso zzso assessment of transcript abundance in order to identify common gene expression pathways within zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso Following 20 weeks of zzso or high-fat feeding zzso zzso zzso mice underwent a zzso clamp to assess insulin zzso zzso animals were obese and highly insulin zzso disposing of zzso less zzso compared with their zzso zzso zzso were collected, and gene expression was examined by zzso in 4 zzso known to exhibit zzso zzso zzso white zzso zzso skeletal muscle, liver, and zzso A total of 463 genes were zzso expressed between zzso Analysis of individual zzso showed skeletal muscle to exhibit the largest number of zzso expressed genes zzso in response to high-fat zzso followed by zzso tissue zzso liver zzso and heart zzso zzso revealed that the response of individual genes to obesity is distinct and largely tissue specific, with less than zzso of transcripts being shared among zzso Although transcripts are largely tissue specific, a systems approach shows numerous commonly activated zzso including those involved in signal zzso zzso zzso stress, zzso zzso and zzso This suggests a coordinated attempt by zzso to limit zzso zzso occurring in zzso zzso Many identified genes were associated with a variety of disorders, thereby serving as potential links between obesity and its related health zzso
