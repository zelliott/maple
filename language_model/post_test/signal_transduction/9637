Human embryonic stem cells can form zzso when cultured under differentiation zzso Although the initiating step of zzso formation is well zzso the subsequent steps that promote for cardiac lineages are poorly understood and limit the yield of zzso 

Our aim was to develop a human embryonic stem zzso zzso screening zzso to discover small molecules that drive zzso differentiation after zzso is established to improve our understanding of the biology zzso zzso of libraries of zzso zzso zzso was predicted to provide insight into the cellular proteins and signaling pathways that control stem cell zzso 

zzso 550 known zzso zzso were screened in a zzso screening zzso with hits being called out by the appearance of a red fluorescent protein driven by the promoter of the zzso zzso zzso One potent small zzso was identified that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso response within the cell, which demonstrated that zzso zzso alone was sufficient to generate zzso from human embryonic stem zzso zzso zzso zzso profiling of zzso compared with zzso samples further indicated that zzso of zzso does not induce other zzso zzso zzso several other zzso zzso were very efficient in inducing zzso including a zzso that prevents zzso from being zzso by the cell, which confirmed that zzso zzso was the relevant biological zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso signaling is sufficient to drive human zzso cells to form zzso this could yield novel tools for the benefit of pharmaceutical and clinical zzso
