Spinal zzso injury results in neural loss and consequently motor and sensory impairment below the zzso zzso zzso contribute to formation of zzso scar, thus zzso zzso zzso through zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we analyze zzso site tissue to reveal the possible mechanism underlying the functional recovery after cell transplantation of human embryonic stem cell zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso and propose that transplanted cells increase zzso through the zzso signaling pathways activated in the host tissue that may crucial for restoring locomotor zzso We show that the transplantation of zzso zzso and zzso promotes zzso through zzso of zzso zzso and zzso signaling that support zzso zzso The transplanted cells in zzso with zzso zzso create zzso environment in which the expression of zzso genes zzso zzso and genes involved in zzso zzso was significantly decreased while expression of beneficial ones zzso and zzso was zzso According to our data, this mechanism is activated in all transplantation groups independently of the level of locomotor zzso These results indicate that zzso the beneficial function of zzso zzso could be a feasible therapeutic strategy for spinal zzso injury in zzso
