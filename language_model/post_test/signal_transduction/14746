zzso zzso growth factor zzso is a potent zzso zzso for tumor growth and zzso zzso zzso belongs to zzso aromatic zzso zzso and is known to cause zzso But the effects of zzso and its zzso on zzso and zzso expression remain to be zzso In this study, we found zzso zzso but not zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso expression in a zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso through zzso factor 1 zzso binding zzso zzso specifically decreased zzso but not zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso We found that zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso level, but inhibited its protein expression in a zzso zzso To further clarify the mechanism of zzso in regulating zzso stability, we found that zzso inhibited zzso protein expression by the increase of the zzso degradation, and by the disruption of zzso and zzso zzso
