zzso zzso communication between zzso and muscle tissue has been zzso To test the effect of muscle cells on zzso gene zzso we zzso an in zzso zzso system, in which fat zzso and muscle zzso cells were physically separated but chemically exposed each other via insert with zzso porous zzso When zzso and zzso cells reached at 80 and zzso zzso respectively in separate wells, zzso cells grown in insert were transferred onto zzso plates where zzso cells were being zzso When both cells were fully differentiated in zzso plates, zzso of zzso was examined by zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene expression including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding protein zzso were zzso The presence of muscle cells during zzso differentiation inhibited zzso zzso by suppressing zzso gene expression including zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso activity was also decreased zzso in zzso cells by the presence of zzso zzso These results suggest that presence of muscle cells suppresses zzso differentiation by zzso the zzso gene expression and zzso activity in the muscle and fat cell zzso zzso
