zzso in the mature central nervous system is zzso by zzso of zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso Both receptors belong to the same zzso of zzso zzso channels and share common zzso zzso and structural and functional zzso zzso receptors are zzso zzso zzso channels composed of two different zzso named alpha und zzso that assemble with a fixed zzso ratio of two alpha to three beta zzso Four genes zzso the alpha zzso exist, whereas only one gene zzso the beta zzso has been zzso zzso binding occurs at the interface of alpha and beta zzso The beta zzso which is unable to form zzso zzso is responsible for assembly and channel zzso Moreover, this zzso carries a binding motif for the zzso protein zzso which is believed to mediate synaptic zzso and zzso at zzso zzso by interacting with the zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to restrict the mobility of zzso receptors zzso in the plane of the plasma zzso thereby generating dynamic plasma membrane zzso contributing to the plasticity of zzso zzso zzso receptors are well established as playing important roles in controlling motor functions and sensory signaling in vision and audition and those in the zzso horn of the spinal zzso are now considered to be new targets for pain zzso Like zzso zzso zzso receptors have been shown to be zzso during zzso The functional meaning of the zzso switch from zzso to zzso zzso zzso action remains to be zzso
