Our previous studies demonstrated that zzso is the key signal in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso In particular, we have proposed that the zzso shock triggers water zzso from zzso via zzso This water zzso determines the cell volume reduction and, in turn, the rise in the zzso concentration of zzso This increase could lead to the zzso of zzso zzso and of the zzso pathway, causing the zzso of zzso proteins and then the initiation of zzso zzso This study confirms the important role of sea zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the beginning of zzso zzso In fact, when these proteins are inhibited by zzso the zzso of some proteins zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso 97 and 33 zzso proteins of zzso following the zzso zzso was inhibited zzso or zzso However, our results also suggest that more than one zzso pathways could be activated when sea zzso zzso were zzso in seawater, since numerous proteins showed an zzso zzso state after zzso zzso The role played by each different signal zzso pathways need to be zzso
