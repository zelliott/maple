Multiple myeloma zzso plasma cells, but not those from healthy donors and patients with zzso zzso of zzso significance or other plasma cell zzso involving the bone zzso express the zzso zzso zzso We previously reported that zzso of zzso by zzso cells likely contributes to zzso zzso in this disease by zzso zzso zzso which is essential for zzso differentiation and zzso The mechanisms responsible for zzso and regulation of zzso expression in zzso are not zzso zzso we could trace zzso expression changes in zzso cells to zzso in the zzso signaling zzso which is zzso modulated through zzso stress and interactions between zzso cells with zzso in zzso Despite its role as a tumor zzso and zzso of zzso in other cell types including zzso our data suggest that zzso a zzso gene in zzso does not mediate zzso zzso is not activated by zzso and its forced zzso could not inhibit cell growth or sensitize zzso cells to zzso following treatment with zzso or zzso We conclude that specific strategies to zzso persistent zzso of the zzso zzso may be beneficial in preventing disease progression and treating zzso bone disease by zzso zzso zzso
