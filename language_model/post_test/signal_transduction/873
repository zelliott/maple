The mechanisms by which zzso signaling contribute to the invasive potential of zzso remain to be fully zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso and/or zzso stimulation zzso zzso but has no effect on the related zzso zzso zzso a major zzso zzso has the ability to efficiently activate all zzso receptors and to bind directly to zzso and zzso zzso is commonly expressed in zzso cells and exerts the most potent effects in terms of zzso induction relative to other zzso zzso so far zzso In the present study, we explored the contribution of major downstream events triggered by zzso zzso signaling to the regulation of zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso zzso In human zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso treatment resulted in rapid zzso zzso of all zzso receptors whereas both zzso zzso and zzso zzso were predominantly zzso via zzso zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso zzso with differing zzso but not zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and zzso pathways occurred predominantly via zzso whereas zzso of the zzso zzso occurred via all 4 zzso zzso although again predominantly via zzso Selective zzso of zzso (by zzso or zzso and zzso (by zzso or zzso led to marked reduction of both zzso and zzso zzso activity and invasive ability of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso with zzso produced no such zzso A specific inhibitor of zzso B, BAY zzso also blocked the zzso effect of zzso No remarkable zzso of zzso and invasion was observed on targeting other cellular activities, such as zzso zzso and zzso Taken together, our data show that zzso zzso zzso production and invasion primarily through zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso
