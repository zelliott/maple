zzso zzso a diverse collection of zzso that regulate numerous zzso in plants and zzso Whereas the plant versions have proven zzso intractable for structural studies, the microbial forms have recently provided important insights into how these zzso work at the atomic zzso Here, we review the current understanding of these microbial zzso which shows that they have a modular zzso architecture that zzso zzso rotation of the zzso to zzso contacts between adjacent signal output zzso zzso features underpinning this signaling include: a deeply buried zzso a knot and hairpin loop that zzso the zzso zzso and an extended zzso spine that translates zzso changes in the zzso domain to the output zzso Conservation within the zzso both in modular construction and sequence strongly suggests that higher plant zzso work similarly as zzso zzso zzso
