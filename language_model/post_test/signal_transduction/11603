It is widely accepted that numerous cell types respond to mechanical zzso yet there is no general agreement as to whether particular cells respond directly to stress, strain, zzso zzso or other mechanical zzso By recalling the definitions of the mathematical (not zzso concepts of stress and strain, it is suggested zzso that cells cannot respond directly to these zzso metrics or to quantities derived from zzso models will need to be based on more fundamental zzso as, for example, zzso forces or zzso changes of the appropriate zzso Nonetheless, the concepts of stress and strain should continue to play an important role in zzso both in the identification of empirical correlations and in the development of zzso zzso models, each of which can contribute to our basic understanding as well as help in the design of future experiments and some clinical zzso It is important to remember, therefore, that empirical correlations and most zzso relations in zzso mechanics do not seek to model the actual zzso their utility is in their zzso zzso which is often achieved via different relations in terms of different metrics for the same material under different zzso zzso with regard to zzso cellular responses to mechanical zzso we must delineate between the identification of fundamental mechanisms and the zzso of zzso zzso the latter of which only requires convenient metrics that need not be unique or zzso
