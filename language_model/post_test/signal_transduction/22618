zzso zzso zzso engagement results in the zzso of zzso family zzso and zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso of multiple cellular zzso including the complex adapter protein zzso Moreover, zzso is zzso zzso upon engagement of growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso and functions as a negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso associates via its zzso binding zzso domain to the zzso zzso negative regulatory zzso We recently demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso requires its zzso domain to zzso zzso in zzso zzso T zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso but not zzso forms of zzso zzso and zzso block zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso does not zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The requirement for zzso zzso and zzso is not due to zzso zzso of zzso zzso as zzso of all zzso in, or deletion of, the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso acids 655 to zzso blocks zzso zzso zzso zzso but enhances zzso zzso zzso zzso Further, zzso zzso does not cooperate with zzso zzso to zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso and zzso do not activate parallel zzso zzso Finally, the zzso of zzso observed upon zzso zzso is blocked by zzso in a zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso acts as a dominant negative to block the zzso zzso negative regulatory role of zzso zzso on zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
