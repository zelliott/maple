We previously demonstrated that male mice deficient in the soluble zzso zzso zzso are sterile and produce zzso with deficits in progressive zzso and are unable to zzso zzso zzso Here, analyses of zzso zzso provide additional insights into the functions linked to zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso content are greatly diminished in crude preparations of zzso zzso and are zzso after zzso zzso zzso is unable to rapidly accelerate the zzso beat or facilitate evoked zzso entry into zzso zzso Moreover, the delayed zzso increases in protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso which occur late in zzso of zzso zzso do not develop in zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso fusion does not require zzso Although zzso levels are significantly reduced in zzso zzso zzso zzso increases zzso beat frequency, progressive zzso and alters the pattern of zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso coordinate cellular energy balance in zzso zzso and that the zzso generating machinery is not operating normally in zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso plays a critical role in zzso signaling in zzso and that defective zzso production prevents engagement of multiple components of zzso resulting in male zzso
