zzso are symbiotic zzso that form zzso with plant zzso Here we present evidence that at an early stage of the interaction, zzso prior to physical zzso zzso of the white truffle zzso zzso and the black truffle zzso zzso induce zzso in root zzso of the host Cistus zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso primary root zzso lateral root formation, root hair zzso This was most likely due to the production of zzso acid zzso and zzso by the zzso Application of a mixture of the zzso precursor zzso acid and zzso fully zzso the root zzso induced by the zzso for both host and zzso zzso Application of the single hormones only partially zzso zzso Furthermore, primary root growth was not inhibited in the zzso zzso transport zzso zzso by truffle zzso while root branching was less zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The double zzso zzso displayed reduced sensitivity to zzso primary root zzso and zzso In agreement with the signaling nature of truffle zzso increased expression of the zzso response reporter zzso in zzso root zzso subjected to the zzso could be observed, confirming that truffles modify the zzso hormonal balance of zzso zzso we demonstrate that truffles zzso zzso from zzso probably through the zzso acid zzso Taken together, these results establish the central role of zzso and zzso as signal molecules in zzso zzso
