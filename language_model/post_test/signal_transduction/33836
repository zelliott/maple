A conceptual obstacle for understanding zzso signaling is the issue of the zzso barrier zzso In the last 30 years, several pathways have been investigated to address the question of how peripheral immune signals are transmitted into the zzso These pathways can be zzso into two zzso zzso pathways and zzso zzso zzso pathways involve the zzso as a relay station or porous barrier, whereas zzso pathways use zzso routes that bypass the zzso Recently, a complete zzso ascending zzso for zzso signaling has been zzso Details of zzso pathways are still under zzso In this review, I will zzso the current progress in unraveling zzso signaling zzso In addition, I will provide a critical analysis of the literature to point to areas where our knowledge of the zzso zzso signaling to the central nervous system is still sorely zzso
