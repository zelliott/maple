zzso relevant peripheral zzso (such as diabetic and human zzso virus sensory zzso are characterized by zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso Here, we describe a novel, zzso zzso that prevents zzso zzso We show that in response to zzso injury, zzso zzso cells release zzso zzso which via EPO zzso binding on zzso prevents zzso zzso We demonstrate that the relevant zzso injury signal that stimulates EPO production from surrounding zzso cells is zzso zzso In addition, we show that this zzso zzso can be zzso exploited by administering zzso zzso In an animal model of zzso zzso systemic EPO administration prevents zzso zzso and this is associated with a reduction in limb weakness and zzso pain zzso Our in zzso and in zzso data suggest that EPO prevents zzso zzso and therefore may be zzso useful in a wide variety of human neurological diseases characterized by zzso
