zzso membrane fragments zzso were separated from the bulk of plasma zzso of human embryonic kidney zzso cells expressing a zzso zzso zzso fusion protein by drastic homogenization and zzso on equilibrium zzso density zzso The functional activity of zzso G proteins and capacity of the zzso zzso to stimulate both the fusion zzso zzso and zzso zzso sensitive G proteins was measured as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The maximum zzso zzso zzso zzso was two times higher in zzso membrane fragments than in bulk of plasma zzso 58 and 27 zzso zzso The same difference was obtained for zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso contained no more than half the zzso zzso binding sites zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso Thus, when corrected for expression levels of the zzso zzso zzso exhibited four times higher zzso zzso and zzso binding than the bulk plasma zzso The regulator of G protein signaling zzso enhanced further the G protein functional activity but did not remove the difference between zzso and plasma membrane pools of G zzso The potency of the zzso in functional studies and the affinity of specific zzso binding to the zzso were, however, the same in both types of zzso - zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso m for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso binding zzso Similar results were obtained when sodium zzso was used for alkaline isolation of membrane zzso By contrast, zzso membrane zzso isolated following treatment of cells with zzso zzso exhibited no zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso between the zzso zzso and zzso G proteins was also blocked by zzso ultrasound and repeated zzso Our data zzso for the first time, that membrane zzso isolated using zzso procedures exhibit higher efficiency of zzso between a G zzso zzso and its corresponding G zzso than bulk plasma zzso zzso diminishes these zzso even when the zzso and G proteins are physically zzso zzso
