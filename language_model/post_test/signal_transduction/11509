A major mechanism guiding neural development is through zzso and zzso zzso and signaling zzso by cell zzso molecules zzso The majority of zzso have been grouped into three families: the zzso the zzso and the members of the zzso zzso including zzso While the zzso of new receptors and zzso components has become a frequent zzso the zzso of the mechanisms by which they operate, and the function of those mechanisms in complex zzso events remains zzso Members of all three families participate in differential zzso signal zzso and zzso zzso Each of these modes of action is a potential target for zzso zzso In this brief review, the role of zzso in normal and abnormal zzso will be zzso zzso is a cell surface zzso zzso with a single copy gene on the X zzso There are two alternatively spliced zzso with the zzso containing form found only on zzso and growth cones of zzso zzso zzso mediates the following zzso zzso zzso extension, zzso migration, and zzso zzso zzso is critical for normal neural zzso humans with genetic defects in zzso termed corpus zzso zzso mental zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso syndrome, and mice lacking expression of zzso have extensive zzso and zzso zzso The observation that patients with fetal alcohol syndrome share similar features to patients with zzso has lead to the investigation of the effects of ethanol on zzso zzso zzso of ethanol have been shown to inhibit zzso zzso zzso outgrowth in zzso zzso zzso Such zzso may result from decreased zzso altered cell surface distribution, impaired signal zzso or impaired interaction with the zzso These data indicate that zzso and its associated signaling pathways are potentially targets for zzso zzso
