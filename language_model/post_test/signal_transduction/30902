zzso proteins of the zzso family are at the heart of many essential zzso zzso including box zzso and zzso small zzso zzso zzso small nuclear zzso zzso and zzso zzso coding for zzso In this study, we show that zzso and its zzso zzso zzso are key components of the machinery that assembles these zzso We observed that zzso and zzso bind several zzso proteins and zzso them to other core proteins in the immature zzso Surprisingly, zzso and zzso also link assembling zzso with the AAA + zzso zzso zzso and zzso and with the zzso zzso through two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in human cells prevents the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and decreases the levels of newly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thus, zzso may control the folding of these proteins during the formation of new zzso This suggests that zzso functions as a master regulator of cell proliferation by allowing simultaneous control of cell signaling and cell zzso
