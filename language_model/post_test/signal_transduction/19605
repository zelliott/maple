The zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed by immature zzso has a pivotal role in early zzso development, including zzso zzso survival and proliferation of zzso zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso lineage zzso Whereas zzso zzso by the zzso major zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs by means of a zzso zzso zzso The zzso comprises an zzso zzso zzso that pairs with any zzso zzso zzso following successful zzso zzso zzso Here we provide the basis of zzso assembly and zzso zzso The zzso chain comprised a single zzso domain that is structurally distinct from the constant zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso the mode of association between zzso and zzso mirrored that zzso by the zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso had a propensity to zzso in solution, and the molecular envelope of the zzso zzso correlated well with the observed zzso zzso zzso This mode of zzso zzso enabled the zzso domain to interact with the variable zzso zzso domain through zzso that are highly zzso across the zzso and joining zzso zzso gene families, thus mimicking the interactions at the core of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso zzso interface zzso zzso zzso in solution and impaired zzso expression on the cell zzso zzso we provide a mechanism of zzso zzso that allows the zzso chain to simultaneously zzso the correct folding of both the V and C zzso of any zzso zzso regardless of its ultimate zzso which represents a critical checkpoint in zzso zzso This unusual zzso sensing function of zzso represents a unique mechanism in nature zzso zzso quality control regulates the expression and zzso of an integral membrane zzso zzso
