zzso zzso zzso zzso of activated T cells via the zzso cascade but can also mediate zzso signals to zzso T cells at the time of zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso of zzso zzso T cells activated by zzso cells zzso death or zzso their proliferation and increases zzso zzso zzso To understand this zzso we investigated the roles of zzso and nuclear factor zzso in survival and proliferation of responding T zzso zzso zzso increased zzso and zzso activities during T cell zzso irrespective of cell zzso The accelerated proliferation induced by zzso zzso could be reduced by selective zzso of both zzso zzso of zzso simultaneously with zzso zzso inhibited the increased zzso production and caused uniform death of all responding T zzso Thus, zzso zzso of zzso zzso T cells is driven by active zzso and zzso acts as a dominant zzso factor of zzso cells containing high levels of activated zzso and zzso
