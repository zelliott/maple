zzso organisms adapt to changes in light quality by zzso light zzso energy between two zzso through state zzso This reorganization of antenna systems leads to an enhanced zzso zzso Using a genetic approach in zzso zzso to dissect the signal zzso zzso of state transition, we identified a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso that has zzso in land zzso zzso is required for the zzso of the major zzso protein zzso and for state zzso
