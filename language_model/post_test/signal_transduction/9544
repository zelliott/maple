zzso of the zzso zzso receptors zzso combined with strong membrane zzso zzso zzso induce a synergistic amplification of zzso zzso The molecular basis for the zzso is zzso Here, we investigated this zzso zzso release zzso phenomenon at the single cell level by monitoring zzso zzso release in zzso cells using zzso We found that the 60 zzso zzso zzso release in bovine zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso to zzso CA zzso zzso was independent of zzso influx through zzso calcium channels zzso but required zzso at the zzso medium and was abolished by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced in mouse zzso cells by BK and zzso was not observed in zzso cells prepared from zzso zzso mice and was restored by expressing zzso The zzso between strong zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso blockers, and the zzso of the zzso zzso cascade generates unique and fundamental amplified signaling zzso The concerted zzso of two independent cellular pathways could reinforce zzso signals that impinge on regulation of zzso events during repeated sequence of zzso zzso zzso and relief of zzso such as long-term zzso zzso that lead to zzso synaptic zzso
