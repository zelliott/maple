The skeleton has been shown recently to regulate zzso metabolism through an zzso hormone, zzso which favors zzso zzso insulin zzso insulin sensitivity, and energy zzso An implication of this finding is that a decrease in zzso numbers would compromise zzso metabolism in an zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, zzso were zzso zzso by zzso transgenic mice expressing a zzso zzso under the control of the zzso promoter with mice in which an inactive form of the diphtheria toxin A chain was introduced into a zzso expressed zzso zzso of zzso in adult mice profoundly affected zzso zzso In a manner similar to what is seen in the case of zzso zzso a partial zzso of this cell population resulted in zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreased insulin zzso However, and unlike what is seen in zzso mice, zzso zzso also decreased zzso fat and increased energy expenditure and the expression of zzso an zzso proposed to mediate insulin zzso While administration of zzso reversed zzso the zzso intolerance and reinstated normal blood zzso and insulin levels, it only partially restored insulin sensitivity and did not affect the improved zzso fat weight and energy expenditure in zzso zzso These observations not only strengthen the notion that zzso are necessary for zzso zzso and energy expenditure but also suggest that in addition to zzso other zzso hormones may contribute to the emerging function of the skeleton as a regulator of energy zzso
