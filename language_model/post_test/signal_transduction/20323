zzso with a low dose of harmful stimulus prior to injury zzso tolerance to a subsequent zzso challenge resulting in zzso against zzso Experimental models of zzso primarily focus on zzso as the cellular target of cerebral protection, while less attention has been paid to the cerebrovascular zzso whose role in the zzso of zzso brain injury is zzso We have shown that zzso with zzso zzso acid zzso protects against cerebral zzso zzso To delineate the mechanism of zzso protection, we investigated whether zzso zzso preserves the function of the zzso barrier zzso in response to zzso zzso Using an in zzso zzso model, we found that zzso treatment prior to exposure to zzso deprivation maintained the zzso and zzso transport across the zzso and attenuated the drop in zzso electric zzso We found that zzso treatment induced zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso and zzso and that type I zzso signaling in brain zzso zzso cells was required for zzso zzso this implicates a potential mechanism underlying zzso in our in zzso experimental stroke model, where type I zzso signaling is required for zzso zzso against zzso zzso In conclusion, we are the first to show that zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This mechanism is likely an important feature of zzso zzso and highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting zzso signaling pathways to protect the brain against zzso
