Here we show that zzso zzso zzso that depends for its therapeutic effectiveness on the zzso activity of the drug for T zzso zzso zzso is zzso for approximately zzso of zzso zzso mice bearing a large zzso zzso zzso but only for approximately zzso of zzso mice bearing a large zzso zzso zzso zzso examination of the zzso tumors of such mice on day 4 after the chemotherapy revealed that the low dose of zzso led to zzso of T zzso in both the zzso and the zzso zzso However, in the zzso treated tumor bearing zzso mice the T zzso were present throughout the tumor mass and in direct contact with tumor cells, but in the zzso treated tumor bearing zzso mice most of the T zzso remained in blood zzso In addition to being important for zzso zzso migration of T zzso into the tumor mass, we show here that signaling via the zzso is also important for zzso control of zzso tumor progression in the zzso and liver of the tumor bearing zzso Finally, zzso cured tumor bearing zzso mice were resistant to a subsequent challenge with zzso tumor cells, but the few zzso cured tumor bearing zzso mice were zzso Thus, signaling via the zzso on host cells in zzso tumor zzso is important for zzso zzso zzso migration of T zzso into the tumor mass and the zzso of the primary zzso zzso control of zzso tumor zzso and zzso resistance to a subsequent tumor zzso
