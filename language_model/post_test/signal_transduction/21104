zzso a dietary fiber zzso is a well-known zzso agent in cultured cell zzso In addition, its zzso activity toward zzso zzso has been documented both in zzso and in zzso Despite the large amount of information on the potential clinical efficacy of zzso its mechanism of action at the molecular level has only been partially zzso Here, we show that zzso protein zzso zzso is a target of zzso zzso In the human zzso cell line, zzso treated with 2 zzso sodium zzso zzso activity decreases 50% at 24 and 48 hours after drug zzso The zzso zzso is not due to changes in protein amount since the levels of the different zzso zzso remain constant during zzso zzso The data reported provide the first evidence that zzso zzso is involved in the signal zzso zzso started by zzso
