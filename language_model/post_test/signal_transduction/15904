The regulation of gene expression at the zzso level has revealed important control levels for genes important to the immune zzso zzso zzso are small zzso that regulate gene expression by zzso protein translation or by degrading the zzso zzso A single zzso can potentially regulate the expression of multiple genes and the proteins zzso zzso can influence molecular signaling pathways and regulate many biological processes including immune zzso Although the role of zzso in development and zzso has been well zzso their role in the immune system has only begun to zzso During the past few years, many zzso have been found to be important in the development, zzso survival, and function of B and T zzso zzso cells, zzso and other immune cell zzso We discuss here recent findings revealing important roles for zzso in immunity and how zzso can regulate innate and zzso immune zzso
