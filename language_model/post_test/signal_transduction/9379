zzso zzso a key regulator of stem cells, is frequently zzso in zzso It is often linked to aggressive forms of cancer, evading standard treatment highlighting zzso as an exciting therapeutic zzso zzso is in principle zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides and zzso but clinical use of zzso zzso is restricted by severe side effects and there is a demand for alternative zzso zzso Here, we present a novel approach, using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as vehicles for targeted delivery of zzso to block zzso zzso zzso particles zzso to targeting zzso induced zzso zzso of zzso activity in zzso and exhibited enhanced tumor zzso with significantly improved zzso zzso and therapeutic outcome in zzso zzso administration of zzso controlled zzso activity in zzso stem cells further supporting the in zzso zzso of zzso for zzso zzso zzso showed tumor zzso and targeting after systemic zzso zzso were zzso and particles not retained within the tumors, were zzso and eliminated mainly by zzso zzso The data highlights zzso as an attractive platform for targeted drug delivery of zzso drugs with otherwise restricted clinical application, and as interesting constituents in the quest for more refined zzso zzso
