The zzso zzso junction zzso is essential for zzso of zzso zzso including the liver, although the regulatory mechanism of zzso formation during development remains zzso Using a primary culture system of fetal zzso in which zzso M zzso zzso zzso we show here that zzso zzso zzso formation by altering the zzso zzso of zzso components including zzso and zzso By zzso expression of zzso forms of signaling zzso Ras was shown to be required for the zzso zzso zzso Fetal zzso derived from zzso knockout zzso mice failed to form zzso in response to zzso whereas zzso formation was induced normally by zzso in zzso zzso lacking both zzso and zzso Moreover, the defective zzso of zzso zzso was restored by expression of zzso but not by zzso and zzso Finally, pull-down zzso using the zzso domain of zzso demonstrated that zzso directly activates zzso in fetal zzso These results indicate that zzso specifically mediates zzso signaling for formation of zzso during liver zzso
