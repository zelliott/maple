The aim of the present study was to investigate a possible role of the zzso signaling cascade in the process of wasting associated with cancer zzso at the level of skeletal zzso The injection of virus containing the zzso protein (a blocker of the zzso zzso to the zzso muscle of zzso rats resulted in a significant recovery of the muscle mass (which is dramatically reduced as a result of zzso zzso therefore suggesting that zzso is certainly involved in the signaling associated with muscle protein zzso In conclusion, the gene therapy approach presented here clearly suggests an important role for zzso in muscle signaling during zzso zzso
