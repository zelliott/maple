In zzso zzso zzso zzso acids are sensed at the plasma membrane by the zzso zzso consisting of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso acid sensing results in zzso zzso of the zzso factors zzso and zzso followed by their relocation from the zzso to the nucleus, where they activate zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso We screened a zzso zzso library for zzso signaling zzso with the aim of identifying zzso components of the zzso zzso Three isolated zzso were carrying a zzso in the zzso zzso which encodes a regulatory zzso of protein zzso zzso We investigated the zzso activity of the zzso and zzso promoters in zzso cells and found increased zzso from these zzso as well as increased zzso processing, even in the absence of zzso zzso Based on our findings we propose that the zzso complex containing zzso keeps the zzso zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso acids by zzso a component of the zzso
