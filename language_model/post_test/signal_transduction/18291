zzso cell zzso zzso derives from zzso or zzso zzso zzso The process of zzso cell zzso has been investigated for the potential role of the zzso zzso zzso whose standard form zzso and zzso generated by alternative zzso of zzso zzso are known to display altered expression during zzso in other zzso We have zzso an in zzso correlate of zzso cell zzso in which progression stages from normal zzso zzso to zzso zzso and to SCC are represented by primary cultures of normal zzso by human zzso zzso zzso zzso and by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We investigated expression of zzso and of zzso zzso from zzso to zzso and surface protein levels, and found no relationship between expression of zzso and stages of zzso cell zzso However, when the function of zzso was analyzed as zzso zzso ability upon zzso zzso binding and zzso signal zzso via zzso was found only for the zzso stage zzso zzso zzso zzso was completely independent of density of surface zzso We have performed similar analyses in an in zzso model of SCC in which four zzso tumor cell lines and zzso cells were sorted according to increasing resistance to external zzso zzso zzso starving conditions, treatment with the zzso zzso and zzso activity of zzso zzso killer zzso No relationship between expression of zzso and level of cell resistance against external cell zzso stimuli was found, while zzso zzso zzso ability was restricted to the highly resistant tumor cell zzso Our results indicate that the zzso of zzso in zzso cell zzso disorders can be zzso from the functional features of the zzso rather than from its zzso zzso
