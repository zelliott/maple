To identify altered gene expression in the zzso prefrontal zzso obtained after death from subjects with zzso 

zzso zzso differential display zzso was used to measure levels of zzso in zzso area zzso 46 from schizophrenia and control zzso zzso on specific zzso identified with zzso were further investigated using real-time zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso and western zzso 

zzso of zzso for 63 of approximately 12,500 genes differed in BA 46 in zzso zzso real-time zzso has shown that zzso for zzso protein 1 zzso and zzso 17 zzso are increased in BA 46 from subjects with schizophrenia of short, but not long, zzso zzso levels of zzso for neither gene were present in BA 9 from subjects with schizophrenia or in either cortical area from subjects with bipolar 1 zzso By contrast, both zzso and real-time zzso failed to show altered expression of the schizophrenia candidate gene disrupted in schizophrenia 1 zzso zzso from any diagnostic zzso 

The present study has identified genes that are zzso expressed in BA 46 in zzso zzso studies have shown that there is a need for a careful validation of genes shown to be affected in schizophrenia using zzso zzso In addition the present study has shown that gene expression may vary considerably depending on the duration of zzso This raises the hypothesis that changing gene expression may be underlying the change in symptom profile that occurs with disease progression in some subjects with zzso
