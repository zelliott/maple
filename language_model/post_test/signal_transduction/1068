We report a novel case of gray zzso syndrome zzso where a severe zzso of the zzso collagen zzso zzso zzso zzso accompanies classical symptoms of a low zzso count and zzso lacking zzso zzso zzso were normally zzso zzso zzso with collagen was severely zzso as was the response to zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso using zzso zzso zzso in flow zzso showed its virtual absence on the patient's zzso The zzso zzso was confirmed using zzso zzso in Western zzso and in zzso labeling on frozen thin sections where internal pools of zzso were confirmed for normal zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso in normal zzso was present in zzso zzso and the zzso C gamma zzso zzso zzso appeared to function zzso No zzso to zzso were found in the patient's serum using zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of coding regions of the zzso gene failed to show zzso and zzso for zzso was present in the patient's zzso pointing to a probable acquired zzso in zzso zzso Our results may provide a molecular explanation for the zzso of patients with severely deficient zzso zzso zzso as previously described for zzso in the zzso
