zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso during development has marked effects on cell fate and zzso The zzso consequences of zzso treatment on zzso zzso and zzso zzso are similar to the effects of zzso or zzso respectively, of a highly zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso the zzso zzso is zzso by zzso a zzso gene involved in zzso that acts downstream of zzso In higher zzso zzso has been implicated in signal zzso pathways downstream of zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso 

We investigated the effect of zzso on the activity of the zzso zzso At zzso doses, zzso zzso the activity of human zzso beta and zzso zzso but has no effect on other protein zzso The effect of zzso on zzso is zzso in zzso Treatment of cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso cells and rat zzso cells zzso zzso of zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso can mimic zzso zzso in intact cells, consistent with its zzso of zzso 

zzso acts as a specific inhibitor of the zzso family of protein zzso in zzso and in intact cells, and mimics zzso zzso This reveals a possible molecular mechanism of zzso action on development and zzso
