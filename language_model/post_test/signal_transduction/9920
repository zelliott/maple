zzso and zzso zzso control the zzso and organization of zzso skeletal structures, specifically those derived from the zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso proteins have opposing zzso properties and form zzso complexes via their zzso with zzso functional zzso In this report we examine the skeletal zzso of zzso zzso double zzso zzso mice in relationship with their expression territories during zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso is only observed in embryonic zzso in which these genes have independent functions, and thus direct protein interactions are unlikely to control zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso indicate a complex interplay between these zzso acting independently zzso and middle zzso zzso zzso of bone zzso or zzso on the same zzso process zzso growth and zzso In the latter case, the absence of zzso zzso in part the zzso defects in zzso growth and zzso At the basis of this effect, our data zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso changes in the expression level of zzso and zzso counteract the reduced zzso zzso These results highlight the importance of precise spatial and zzso regulation of the zzso zzso system during zzso zzso
