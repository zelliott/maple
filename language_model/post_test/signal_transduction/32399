Cell patterning in the body segments of the zzso zzso requires activity of the segment polarity zzso a zzso zzso group defined by a generic zzso zzso Two of these zzso wingless zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins that enter the zzso pathway, implicating them as signals that instruct the fates of zzso zzso zzso analysis has identified zzso zzso as one of the targets of zzso activity and it has been suggested that the spatial control of zzso expression depends on the limited range of the zzso signal and the differential competence of responding zzso I have tested this model by driving ubiquitous expression of the zzso gene using the zzso zzso Here I report that, as predicted, this causes the zzso zzso of zzso in only a subset of the cells of each zzso Using another target of zzso activity as a probe, I demonstrate that the competence of cells to express zzso is independent of their ability to receive the zzso zzso Finally, I show that zzso zzso requires the function of the segment polarity gene zzso suggesting that the putative zzso signal is zzso by the zzso zzso that fused zzso
