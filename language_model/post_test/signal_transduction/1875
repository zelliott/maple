Four zzso proteins form the structural core of the zzso signaling machinery, linking zzso zzso to zzso These four zzso each with well defined zzso interaction zzso include three zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The biological functions of many distinct zzso interaction zzso have been dissected through a zzso series of knockout and zzso zzso In reviewing these recent advances, we attempt to address two questions often asked by zzso not familiar with the field: what do zzso zzso and what do these terms mean?
