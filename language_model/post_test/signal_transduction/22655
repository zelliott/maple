zzso zzso has been shown to promote zzso zzso zzso in addition to acting as a survival factor for mature zzso In this study, we investigate the expression of zzso during human zzso formation, taking advantage of a recently reported in zzso culture system that generates human OC from precursors in the peripheral blood zzso cell zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso This system enabled us to use zzso zzso and zzso to determine the respective zzso contributions of the zzso cell and zzso cell zzso zzso of functional zzso occurred in zzso of human zzso and zzso cells for up to 21 days in the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso human zzso zzso factor zzso Total zzso was prepared at intervals during the zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction zzso was performed using zzso designed to amplify specifically the zzso species corresponding to the respective zzso or human zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso zzso it was found that the zzso cell component expressed both zzso and zzso zzso zzso measurement of zzso human zzso protein showed greatly zzso levels in zzso compared with zzso cells grown in the absence of zzso cells, consistent with the known signaling from zzso cells to zzso cells during zzso zzso detection of mouse zzso products showed that the zzso zzso cells in the zzso also expressed zzso corresponding to zzso and zzso The expression of both mouse and human zzso zzso was found to decline over the course of the zzso although the level of zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso remained constant, indicating that the two zzso were zzso in both cell populations under these zzso zzso the zzso cells were found to influence strongly the zzso zzso levels in zzso cells, such that mouse zzso and zzso zzso levels were greatly enhanced in zzso compared with zzso cells zzso zzso mouse zzso protein was zzso in zzso in parallel with zzso zzso However, the absolute levels of mouse zzso achieved were more than zzso lower than the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were measured and found to be greatly increased in the zzso compared with zzso cells or zzso cells alone, consistent with evidence that zzso action in zzso is zzso by zzso These results provide novel evidence that zzso signaling between zzso and zzso cells may be important in the generation of human zzso
