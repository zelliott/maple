zzso an zzso display strategy to identify genes of zzso activated zzso cells, we identified among others the zzso protein zzso as a zzso expressed gene of bovine zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso express prominently zzso steady state levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso Growth factor stimulation identified zzso as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso Exposure to zzso D revealed a half life time of zzso zzso of zzso 2 zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso regulation of Ras molecules contributes to their signal zzso capacity and a possible role of zzso in the signal zzso of zzso activated zzso zzso
