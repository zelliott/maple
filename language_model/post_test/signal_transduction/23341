zzso zzso zzso signaling is a key component of innate zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to immune disorders via zzso of zzso production, such as zzso zzso we identify and characterize zzso a zzso zzso as a critical player in zzso signaling using zzso as an affinity zzso zzso is a potent small molecular inhibitor of zzso with an unknown target and has been evaluated in clinical trials for patients with Crohn's disease or zzso zzso Using a chemical genetic approach, we show that it binds to zzso and blocks its zzso activity, leading to selective zzso of zzso zzso or genetic zzso of zzso is necessary and sufficient for suppression of zzso zzso Thus, we have uncovered a zzso regulatory mechanism that controls zzso zzso
