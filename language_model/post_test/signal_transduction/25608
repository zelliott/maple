In colon cancer, disturbances have been detected in genes coding for proteins involved in cellular zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the protein zzso B zzso Although zzso such as zzso have an important role to prevent and treat some types of cancer, there are very few studies about the effect of zzso against colon cancer and its activity at the molecular zzso zzso the aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso activity of zzso against colon cancer induced by zzso zzso The results showed a significant increase in protein expression for zzso and zzso in tumors of zzso zzso zzso we detected changes in the zzso state of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso given in the diet zzso before zzso and after zzso zzso administration, diminished the number of tumors by zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso significantly decreased in tumors the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the amount of zzso zzso during the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso during the treatment stage, zzso This study demonstrates the zzso effect of zzso against colon cancer by modulating the zzso activity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
