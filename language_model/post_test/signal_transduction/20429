zzso are zzso zzso complexes assembled by zzso zzso zzso domain zzso receptors zzso and they initiate innate immune responses to invading pathogens and danger signals by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to the maturation and release of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso inflammatory cell death known as zzso Recently, a new zzso zzso was described that activates zzso a zzso zzso required for zzso zzso This study also highlighted that previously generated zzso knockout mice lack a functional zzso of zzso (also known as zzso making them functionally zzso double zzso Previous studies have shown that these mice are more susceptible to infections with microbial zzso including the bacterial pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but the individual contributions of zzso and zzso to this zzso are not zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso contributes to zzso death during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production is crucial for zzso zzso in zzso but is only partially required for zzso zzso consistent with the existence of an zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso mice were significantly more susceptible to infection with zzso zzso than mice lacking both zzso zzso zzso This zzso was accompanied by higher bacterial counts, the formation of zzso bacterial zzso in the infected tissue and a zzso in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso cell death is zzso to the host in the absence of zzso innate zzso resulting in zzso replication of a zzso zzso bacterial zzso
