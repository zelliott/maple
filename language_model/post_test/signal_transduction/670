Muscle protein synthesis is increased after exercise, but evidence is now zzso that during muscular activity it is zzso In life, muscles are subjected to zzso forces due to contraction, but may also be subject to stretching forces during zzso It would be biologically inefficient if contraction and stretch have different effects on muscle protein zzso but little is known about the zzso effects of zzso To investigate this, we assessed zzso and zzso protein synthesis zzso zzso zzso by incorporation of zzso zzso gas zzso zzso and anabolic zzso (by zzso and zzso zzso in cultured zzso skeletal muscle cells during 30 zzso of zzso stretch and over 30 zzso intervals for up to 120 zzso zzso zzso was zzso whereas zzso was suppressed by 40 zzso zzso during stretch, before returning to zzso rates by zzso zzso zzso Paradoxically, stretch zzso anabolic zzso with peak values after zzso zzso zzso focal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso B activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso zzso binding protein 1 zzso zzso 14 zzso zzso zzso zzso factor 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulated protein zzso 1/2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso initiation factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso initiation factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso After stretch, except for zzso activity, zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso or zzso zzso zzso for zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso remained elevated throughout zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso was unchanged zzso We report for the first time that acute zzso stretch specifically suppresses zzso despite increases in zzso of elements thought to increase zzso
