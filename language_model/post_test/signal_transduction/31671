In zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is frequently observed, conveys a poor zzso and constitutes a promising target for therapeutic zzso Here, we investigated the molecular and functional effects of pharmacological zzso zzso in cell line models of acute zzso leukemia zzso and freshly isolated primary zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso markedly inhibited zzso zzso and growth of several zzso cell lines and approximately zzso of primary zzso zzso Growth zzso was due to zzso arrest and induction of zzso Transformation by zzso active upstream zzso elements zzso zzso and zzso rendered zzso cells exquisitely prone to zzso zzso Gene and protein expression profiling revealed a selective effect of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso ) zzso zzso potentially zzso resistance to drug-induced growth zzso zzso in appropriate cellular zzso both zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso along the zzso zzso and zzso zzso simultaneous zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso combination strategies may result in synergistic zzso zzso Overall, zzso zzso exerts potent growth zzso and zzso activity in zzso models of zzso particularly in combination with other zzso zzso zzso understanding of the molecular mechanisms of action of zzso zzso will likely translate into more effective targeted strategies for the treatment of zzso
