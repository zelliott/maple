The effect of zzso zzso on the zzso activity of the rat adrenal zzso has been investigated in zzso using an in zzso zzso technique of the intact left zzso zzso and other chemicals were dissolved in the zzso zzso and the zzso was continued for 180 zzso zzso infusion concentration zzso increased the zzso index and zzso incorporation into DNA in the zzso zzso zzso the zzso effective concentration was zzso zzso but not in inner zzso zzso where zzso zzso activity was zzso The effect of zzso M zzso was zzso zzso by both the zzso zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso the zzso blocker zzso zzso zzso and the protein zzso A inhibitor zzso zzso zzso although zzso the zzso zzso action of zzso M zzso did not affect the zzso M zzso increase in zzso DNA zzso Similar results were obtained using the zzso C inhibitor zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the protein zzso C inhibitor zzso C zzso zzso which, however, significantly inhibited the zzso zzso effect of zzso M zzso zzso The zzso action of zzso M zzso was not affected by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso or the mixed zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso effect of zzso M zzso was abolished by either the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso or the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity in dispersed zzso but not zzso cells, and the effect was reversed by either zzso M zzso and zzso or zzso with zzso M zzso zzso our findings indicate that 1) zzso stimulates cell proliferation in the rat zzso through zzso and zzso zzso probably of the zzso zzso and 2) the zzso effect of zzso is zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso without any involvement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso signaling zzso
