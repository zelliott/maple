Regulatory mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso expression are not well known, although methamphetamine zzso has been reported to zzso zzso in mouse zzso This study investigate regulatory mechanisms of zzso expression by zzso system using the zzso and cerebral cortical zzso in primary culture zzso exposed to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso for 3 zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso exposure enhanced zzso and zzso proteins and their zzso but not zzso expression in the both types of the zzso These zzso increases of zzso proteins and their zzso were zzso blocked by zzso (a selective zzso DR zzso but not a zzso zzso zzso suggesting a regulatory role of zzso in zzso expression by zzso in these zzso In cerebral cortical zzso intermittent zzso (a selective zzso zzso exposure increased zzso and zzso proteins and their zzso whereas zzso (a selective zzso zzso showed no zzso zzso a protein zzso A zzso zzso attenuated the zzso zzso and zzso expressions in cerebral cortical zzso zzso significantly increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso which was completely suppressed by zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso expressions are regulated by zzso via the signal zzso linked to zzso
