zzso zzso are perceived by zzso receptors and play vital roles in plant growth and development, as well as cell in responses to environmental zzso The zzso zzso zzso can directly bind to zzso zzso and zzso interacts with zzso to enhance the zzso zzso zzso Our previous studies indicated that a membrane zzso protein 1 zzso could bind to zzso in zzso and is zzso involved in zzso zzso To further zzso the underlying zzso we here show that zzso specifically interacts with the zzso domain of zzso in zzso in a zzso zzso zzso cell expansion and zzso responses by increased expression of zzso can be recovered by zzso zzso or its zzso zzso domain, suggesting that zzso may suppress zzso signaling through interacting with zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that both zzso and zzso are localized to plasma membrane and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which results in suppressed zzso signaling by shifting the equilibrium of zzso toward zzso Indeed, enhanced zzso expression reduces the interaction between zzso and zzso in zzso demonstrating that zzso acts as a negative factor at an early step of the zzso signaling zzso
