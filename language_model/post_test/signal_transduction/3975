The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed on several types of cells of the zzso cell zzso We investigated whether different sizes of zzso zzso zzso bind to zzso and subsequently induce cellular zzso As a model we used the zzso B cell line zzso zzso with zzso or zzso cells zzso with zzso as well as with the zzso gamma chain to study the binding of zzso to zzso When these cells expressing zzso were incubated with zzso zzso no significant binding of zzso to the cells was zzso by zzso cell zzso zzso however, incubation of the cells with zzso zzso resulted in 93 zzso zzso positive zzso zzso of the cells with different sizes of zzso zzso revealed optimal binding with zzso containing five to six molecules of zzso per zzso No difference was observed between the binding to zzso of both zzso or zzso zzso Furthermore, the binding of zzso was found to be zzso since the binding of zzso was completely inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and no zzso binding occurred to the zzso parent cell zzso zzso studies using zzso zzso production as a marker, showed that the zzso gamma chain is necessary to induce cellular zzso Only cells zzso with both zzso and the zzso gamma chain zzso zzso enhance the zzso production zzso upon stimulation with zzso of zzso Furthermore, triggering of zzso only results in increase of zzso calcium concentration zzso in cells zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso gamma chain zzso zzso zzso motif of the zzso gamma chain zzso this increase in zzso indicating association and involvement of the zzso gamma chain in zzso zzso
