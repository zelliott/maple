A wealth of growth factors are known to regulate the various cell functions involved in the repair zzso An understanding of their therapeutic value is essential to achieve improved wound zzso zzso growth factor zzso seems to have a unique role as a zzso of zzso zzso it originates from zzso cells, yet acts exclusively on zzso zzso In this paper, we study zzso role in zzso wound healing, since its production is substantially zzso after zzso We begin by zzso the zzso zzso mechanism of zzso to investigate how this extra production affects the signal zzso We then incorporate the effect of zzso on cell zzso and using travelling wave analysis we obtain an approximation for the rate of zzso Our zzso shows that the large zzso of zzso zzso extends the zzso signal range but is above optimal for the rate of wound zzso We predict that other functions of zzso may be more important than its role as a zzso for the healing zzso
