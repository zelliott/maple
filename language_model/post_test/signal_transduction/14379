The Western painted turtle survives months without zzso A key adaptation is a coordinated reduction of cellular zzso production and zzso that may be signaled by changes in the zzso of zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso Little is known about the involvement of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso arrest and zzso have not been previously measured in any zzso zzso The present study was designed to measure changes in these second zzso in the zzso zzso zzso were measured in isolated turtle brain sheets during a zzso zzso to zzso zzso Changes in zzso and zzso were determined in turtle brain, zzso muscle, heart and liver throughout 4 h of forced zzso at zzso degrees zzso Turtle brain zzso production decreased zzso within 10 zzso of cyanide or zzso zzso and returned to control levels upon zzso zzso of electron transfer from zzso to complex III caused a smaller decrease in zzso zzso zzso of complex I increased zzso zzso above zzso In brain zzso decreased zzso In liver zzso doubled after 2 h of zzso before returning to control levels with prolonged zzso zzso skeletal muscle and heart zzso remained zzso however, skeletal muscle zzso became elevated zzso after 4 h of zzso In liver and heart zzso rose 41 and zzso respectively, after 2 h of zzso Brain zzso did not change significantly during 4 h of zzso We conclude that turtle brain zzso production occurs primarily between zzso complexes I and III and decreases during zzso Also, zzso zzso zzso change in a manner suggestive of a role in zzso suppression in the brain and a role in increasing liver zzso
