zzso of zzso zzso zzso in failing hearts improves cardiac efficiency by an unknown zzso We hypothesized that this energetic effect is due to reduced zzso stress and critically depends on zzso oxide zzso zzso activity, reflecting a balance between generation of zzso oxide zzso and zzso oxygen zzso In dogs with zzso heart failure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the beneficial energetic effects of zzso increasing both zzso and efficiency, suggesting an zzso zzso zzso had no additive effect beyond that of zzso zzso between zzso and zzso signaling was zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso 20 zzso had no effect on zzso zzso or efficiency in zzso but prevented the zzso and zzso enhancements of zzso and efficiency, respectively, observed with zzso zzso Similarly, improvements in zzso and zzso due to zzso were also inhibited by zzso Because of the observed zzso zzso we predicted that in normal hearts zzso zzso would uncover a depression of zzso caused by zzso zzso In normal conscious dogs, zzso increased zzso oxygen consumption zzso while lowering left zzso external work, reducing efficiency by zzso zzso zzso efficiency was reversed by zzso zzso zzso 200 zzso or by zzso without affecting cardiac load or systemic zzso zzso zzso detected zzso protein in cardiac zzso that was enhanced in zzso consistent with zzso zzso These data show that both zzso and zzso signaling systems participate in the regulation of zzso mechanical efficiency and that zzso of zzso relative to zzso contributes to zzso zzso in heart zzso
