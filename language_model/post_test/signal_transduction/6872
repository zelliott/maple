Relating protein concentration to zzso responses is one of the remaining challenges for obtaining a quantitative systems level understanding of zzso zzso Here we used zzso zzso and zzso quantitative zzso approaches to measure protein zzso for zzso of a zzso reconstructed zzso network of 198 zzso in two established cell types zzso and zzso and in primary zzso zzso zzso with other quantitative studies allowed building a set of zzso network proteins expressed in all cells and another which are zzso and could impart specific properties to the zzso As a zzso of the importance of protein zzso we generated a small simplified mathematical model encompassing zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso The model predicts zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells simply by incorporating zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but otherwise contains similar rate zzso Altogether, the data provide a resource for protein zzso and zzso to be included in larger mathematical models, enabling the generation of zzso zzso zzso zzso data have been deposited to the zzso via zzso (with zzso zzso and zzso (with zzso zzso
