zzso zzso is a natural fatty acid zzso produced in the heart, but its biological actions in zzso have not yet been zzso This study was carried out to determine whether zzso could be used to prevent the development of heart failure or improve evolving heart zzso We studied in zzso and in zzso actions of zzso in cardiac zzso In an animal model of zzso zzso zzso showed robust effects and attenuated the progression of zzso dysfunction and zzso zzso During evolving zzso zzso a therapeutic course of zzso treatment partially restored zzso zzso The preventive and therapeutic effects of zzso were associated with significant improvement of zzso To investigate the mechanism of zzso action in cardiac muscle, we have carried out in zzso experiments in cultured zzso The results showed that zzso through zzso of zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso Additional experiments showed that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso involved zzso of zzso zzso which suggests zzso actions in cardiac muscle might require zzso of zzso In zzso zzso improved zzso zzso and zzso cardiac function in zzso zzso possibly involving zzso of zzso and zzso zzso These findings suggest zzso is a novel zzso compound that may be used to develop new strategies for the management of zzso
