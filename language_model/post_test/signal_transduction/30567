zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso and aspirin zzso zzso production in zzso liquid bone-marrow zzso Because zzso zzso zzso enhance human zzso colony formation, we investigated whether the effects of zzso and aspirin on zzso bone-marrow were due to blockade of zzso production alone, or involved further promotion of zzso zzso 

zzso liquid bone-marrow cultures were established with zzso alone or associated with zzso zzso or zzso The effects of preventing zzso production or zzso were zzso 

zzso and aspirin zzso the suppression of zzso production by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso enhanced zzso zzso production and further zzso the effect of zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso a zzso synthesis zzso zzso the zzso zzso antagonists, zzso and zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso zzso abolished effects of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were ineffective but zzso and zzso were effective, against zzso zzso aspirin and zzso failed to enhance zzso production in bone-marrow from zzso zzso zzso zzso aspirin and zzso no longer zzso the effects of zzso zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso had no effect by themselves, or in association with zzso 

zzso on the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso shows that zzso zzso act here through zzso zzso While zzso does not act by suppressing zzso production, zzso override zzso zzso zzso production is therefore zzso regulated by both zzso
