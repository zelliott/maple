zzso zzso p zzso zzso phase II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a wide range of zzso zzso and zzso Here, we zzso the molecular zzso zzso zzso induction by zzso in mouse zzso zzso zzso of protein synthesis with zzso zzso completely blocks induction of zzso by zzso as well as the zzso expression and induction by zzso zzso zzso zzso implicating a zzso factor in zzso zzso zzso The zzso is both zzso and zzso requires zzso of protein zzso and occurs at a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso with a rapid reduction of the zzso zzso zzso 'n' zzso basic zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso factor zzso zzso factor 2) through the 26 S zzso zzso Moreover, blocking zzso degradation with zzso inhibitor zzso increases the amount of zzso and zzso zzso in the presence of zzso or zzso Finally, genetic experiments using zzso zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso hydrocarbon zzso nuclear zzso or zzso cells reveal that, while induction of zzso by zzso depends on the presence of zzso and zzso the zzso and zzso expression of zzso by either zzso or zzso requires functional zzso The findings demonstrate a novel role of zzso in the induction of zzso by zzso and provide new insights into the mechanism by which zzso regulates the induction of phase II zzso by both zzso antioxidants and zzso zzso
