zzso is a new zzso novel zzso compound in our laboratory which has demonstrated potential zzso zzso In this study, we have defined the viability zzso and zzso mechanisms of zzso on human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso According to the zzso zzso the cell viability was inhibited by zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso treatment induced zzso arrest and zzso in zzso zzso cells by cell cycle and flow zzso zzso It also profoundly caused a decrease in zzso zzso levels by in zzso zzso zzso zzso which indicated that the zzso zzso appears to be one of the cellular targets in response to zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso treatment caused a zzso increase of zzso B and zzso protein levels and activity during zzso zzso zzso treatment also caused a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso active form, zzso zzso zzso protein levels, and decrease in zzso protein zzso zzso also promoted zzso and zzso activities; however, zzso of cells with zzso zzso and zzso zzso led to reduced cell growth zzso zzso Taken together, these findings show zzso could be a potential candidate for cancer zzso
