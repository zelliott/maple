zzso is a global clinical challenge for which no effective zzso agents currently zzso This study identified zzso zzso 2 zzso as a novel zzso mechanism and potential therapeutic target in zzso 

Experimental zzso was induced in zzso and zzso mice by zzso the zzso zzso ligament zzso leading to the development of a mild zzso zzso degradation and increased zzso bone formation were assessed as indicators of zzso zzso 

Four weeks following zzso section, cartilage erosion and increased zzso bone formation was evident in zzso mice but was substantially reduced in zzso zzso zzso the therapeutic zzso of zzso in zzso mice, using either a zzso zzso or a zzso zzso targeting the zzso zzso site of zzso was also equally effective at reducing zzso progression in zzso zzso was zzso in zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso mice showed further joint degradation 8 weeks after the induction of zzso but zzso mice were still zzso 

The substantial protection from pathology afforded by zzso zzso following the induction of zzso provides proof of concept that zzso plays a key role in zzso and suggests this zzso as a potential therapeutic zzso
