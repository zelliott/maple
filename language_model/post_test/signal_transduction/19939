zzso networks consist of linked functional zzso or zzso The mechanism underlying zzso network zzso is of great interest not only to researchers of basic science but also to those in fields of zzso Previous studies have suggested a theoretical model, which proposes that a change in the evolutionary goal zzso zzso increases network zzso and this hypothesis was supported by statistical data zzso Nevertheless, further investigation has uncovered additional possibilities that might explain the origin of network zzso In this work we propose an evolving network model without tuning parameters to describe zzso zzso We zzso zzso that zzso network zzso can arise from simple growth zzso independent of the change in the evolutionary zzso Our model is zzso to a wide range of organisms and appears to suggest that zzso network zzso can be more simply determined than previously zzso Nonetheless, our proposition does not serve to contradict the previous zzso it strives to provide an insight from a different angle in the ongoing efforts to understand zzso evolution, with the hope of eventually achieving the synthetic engineering of zzso zzso
