This study aimed to test the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso could be altered by specifically zzso zzso zzso We treated cultured zzso zzso with chemical zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and characterized their global effects on zzso metabolism using zzso flux and zzso zzso zzso the zzso over several days did not alter the zzso differentiation program as assessed by the expression levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The main zzso effects were to zzso zzso zzso and decrease zzso zzso zzso PC also zzso zzso zzso estimates indicated that the reduction in zzso was due to decreased de zzso fatty acid zzso zzso addition of free fatty acids zzso increased the cellular zzso level in the zzso zzso but not in zzso control zzso The results of this study support our hypothesis regarding the critical role of zzso reactions in zzso zzso
