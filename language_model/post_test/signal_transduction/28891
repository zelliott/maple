Control of zzso zzso is of paramount importance for plant adaptation to the surrounding zzso Here, we report on several parameters related to zzso dynamics and performance in transgenic tobacco plants zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cucumber zzso zzso zzso a cell zzso zzso of uncertain biological function that zzso zzso acid zzso to zzso acid which zzso yielding AA and zzso acid zzso In comparison to zzso plants, leaves of zzso zzso plants exhibited reduced zzso zzso zzso to partial zzso zzso higher water content, and reduced rates of water loss on zzso zzso plants also exhibited elevated levels of hydrogen zzso and a decline in hydrogen zzso zzso zzso Leaf zzso content was also higher in zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso strips with either 1 zzso zzso or 100 zzso hydrogen zzso resulted in rapid zzso closure in zzso plants, but not in zzso zzso This suggests that signal perception and/or zzso associated with zzso closure is altered by zzso zzso These data support a specific role for cell zzso AA in the perception of environmental cues, and suggest that zzso acts as a regulator of zzso zzso
