zzso zzso zzso zzso is an inflammatory zzso that promotes zzso and is a zzso of the response to zzso zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso growth factor zzso and zzso II zzso induce the zzso of zzso zzso in vascular smooth muscle cells mainly by increasing zzso zzso In the present study, we have examined the signaling pathways involved in this stabilization of zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso stability was zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso II zzso zzso respectively, and did not involve zzso between the two zzso The effect of zzso was blocked by zzso of protein zzso C zzso but not by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the effect of zzso was blocked by zzso of zzso and zzso but not by zzso of zzso or zzso The effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso stability was blocked by zzso directed against zzso and protein zzso D zzso whereas the effect of zzso was blocked only by zzso directed against zzso These results suggest that the enhancement of zzso zzso stability by zzso and zzso are zzso by distinct zzso signaling pathways that zzso on zzso of zzso This study identifies a novel role for zzso in zzso zzso stability in smooth muscle zzso
