zzso zzso factor zzso is a potent zzso factor expressed in many zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso survival, differentiation and proliferation by binding to three zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso maturation zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although zzso is produced by zzso gamma zzso the underlying mechanism remains zzso In this study, we examined the effects of zzso on zzso expression in cultured human multiple myeloma cells zzso both at the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso elevated the expression of zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso marked enhancement of the human zzso promoter activity and nuclear factor zzso B zzso DNA binding zzso zzso dependent on the human zzso gene might be regulated via a zzso event through one putative zzso site on the zzso gene zzso These results provide a molecular mechanism for the increase in expression of the zzso gene that is induced by zzso zzso in responsive zzso
