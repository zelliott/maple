The zzso zzso are specialized areas of surface zzso that make a vital contribution to the peripheral nervous system, producing sensory zzso of the zzso zzso They have long been characterized as a series of patches of thickened zzso in the vicinity of each zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso is not only expressed in these structures but also marks a larger, earlier zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso are produced from the zzso zzso that lies outside of the zzso zzso zzso Our data show that these regions contribute zzso to the zzso zzso but then cease producing zzso as they lose zzso zzso We further demonstrate that the zzso in these regions is responsive to zzso or zzso stimuli that initiate aspects of zzso zzso This response to zzso stimuli is lacking in regions of zzso distant from the normal sites of zzso and the response to zzso active zzso zzso in particular, disappears zzso with loss of zzso zzso Finally, we show that a dominant zzso form of zzso blocks the ability of the zzso to undergo zzso Thus, zzso appears to be essential for the zzso capacity of surface zzso exhibited by the zzso zzso
