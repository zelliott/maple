zzso a zzso of zzso has been reported to have zzso activity on tumor zzso However, the mechanism has not been well zzso 

Using zzso gene signature based approach, we have demonstrated that zzso could inhibit zzso zzso pathway, and thus exert zzso in zzso cancer zzso 

The zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso gene signature similar to that of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of zzso zzso were also found to reveal similar zzso In zzso cells, zzso using zzso zzso showed that zzso could inhibit zzso zzso In addition, zzso was found to inhibit zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was found to decrease cell viability and induce zzso Exposure to zzso induced zzso arrest and zzso the cell cycle regulator, zzso D1 and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso Finally, additive zzso was observed when zzso and zzso were treated zzso 

The current study indicated that zzso approach, such as zzso zzso is a potentially useful method to identify the unknown cellular function among the drugs already in use in zzso zzso to the property of zzso zzso and additive zzso observed with the platinum compound, further research should be focused on this zzso
