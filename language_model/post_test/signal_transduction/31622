zzso are thought to rely solely on zzso immune zzso Here we provide molecular zzso zzso zzso and functional evidence for the presence of a T cell zzso zzso variable zzso in a zzso zzso of human zzso We demonstrate that these peripheral blood zzso express variable and zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso factor regulates expression of the zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso engagement of the zzso zzso complex protects from zzso and stimulates zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Our results, which also demonstrate the presence of the zzso in zzso zzso suggest the coexistence of a variable and an innate host defense system in zzso zzso
