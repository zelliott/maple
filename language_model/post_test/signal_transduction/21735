Although it is known that zzso growth cones migrate towards the zzso of an applied direct current zzso electric field zzso resembling the zzso present in the developing nervous system, the underlying mechanism remains zzso Here, we demonstrate temporally and zzso coordinated roles for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and their zzso Growth cones of cultured zzso embryonic spinal zzso turned towards the zzso but collective zzso of zzso zzso and zzso attenuated zzso Selective zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso revealed temporally distinct roles in steering by an electrical zzso zzso zzso and zzso are each essential for turning within the initial 2 hours zzso zzso Later, zzso and zzso signals remain important but zzso zzso zzso The zzso increased zzso zzso zzso This correlated zzso with collapsed growth cone zzso and reduced zzso migration rates, which were restored by zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso increased zzso activity zzso local zzso collapse, zzso growth cone advance zzso zzso might be zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso light chain zzso since their zzso attenuated early zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso protein zzso zzso did not affect turning zzso eliminating them zzso We propose a mechanism zzso zzso and zzso activities dominate zzso and zzso activity dominates zzso to steer growth cones towards the zzso The interaction between zzso zzso the zzso and growth cone dynamics is explored in the companion paper published in this zzso Our results complement studies of growth cone guidance by zzso chemical zzso and suggest that growth cones might interpret these zzso guidance cues zzso
