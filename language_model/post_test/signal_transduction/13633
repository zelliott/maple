zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso by regulating the zzso signaling zzso zzso we investigated whether zzso zzso affects bone development and zzso using mice zzso deficient for zzso zzso The amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the bone zzso cells of zzso mice were significantly increased compared with those of zzso mice, indicating that zzso signals were enhanced in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the volumes of both the cortical and zzso bones were increased in zzso mice compared with those in zzso zzso zzso to investigate the effect of zzso zzso on bone zzso we established a partial bone zzso in the zzso and observed new bone at 14 days after zzso The volume and mineral density of the new bone were significantly higher in zzso mice than those in zzso zzso These results suggest that bone formation and zzso in zzso are accelerated by zzso of zzso probably through zzso of the zzso signaling zzso
