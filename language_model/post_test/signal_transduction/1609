The zzso and zzso activities of zzso have been extensively studied during the last 10 zzso More recently a series of new zzso structurally related to zzso were zzso This family includes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Most of the biological functions of these zzso remain to be unraveled but new data are coming out zzso Although none of these zzso zzso mimics zzso activities, they are likely to be involved in inflammatory processes as zzso zzso zzso and zzso form a zzso within zzso zzso based on zzso zzso acid zzso and on the use of shared zzso zzso zzso studies have stressed the potential suppressing activity of zzso on tumor zzso As for zzso its zzso in transgenic mice led to skin zzso reminiscent of zzso zzso in zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and was shown to zzso the acute phase zzso production by liver zzso Finally, for zzso originally described as a gene induced upon T cell transformation by zzso zzso functional data are still lacking to determine its biological zzso
