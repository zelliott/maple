Pulmonary hypertension zzso is a devastating condition for which no zzso therapies zzso zzso is recognized as zzso disease of the pulmonary artery zzso In the experimental newborn calf model of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the PA wall exhibit a heightened replication zzso Because elevated zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso we tested the hypothesis that the zzso of zzso contributes to zzso proliferation and zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso calves were exposed to either ambient air zzso zzso 640 zzso zzso or high altitude zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 2 zzso zzso zzso was markedly elevated in PA zzso of zzso calves as well as in cultured PA zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso higher replication in zzso cells compared with that of control zzso zzso proliferation was dependent on zzso oxygen species generation and zzso zzso zzso zzso in both cell zzso however, only zzso cell division via zzso zzso displayed a unique dependence on zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation as the blockade of zzso with zzso a pharmacological zzso of the zzso pathway, and zzso zzso selectively blunted zzso cell zzso 

Our data strongly suggest that zzso modified cells engage the zzso axis to zzso zzso heightened proliferation and zzso zzso in zzso
