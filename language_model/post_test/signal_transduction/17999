Field zzso zzso the upper zzso tract zzso to the formation of multiple primary tumors, when exposed to environmental zzso zzso of zzso growth factor zzso occurs early in zzso cell zzso and is critical for the loss of growth control in a variety of human zzso including head and neck zzso cell zzso In these tumor cells in culture, zzso growth factor zzso stimulation zzso signaling via persistent zzso of selective zzso zzso To determine the timing of zzso zzso in head and neck zzso we studied the expression and zzso zzso of zzso in tumors and normal zzso from patients with head and neck cancer compared with zzso from controls without zzso zzso was zzso and zzso activated in both primary human head and neck tumors as well as in normal zzso from these cancer patients compared with control normal zzso from patients without zzso In zzso zzso gene therapy with a zzso zzso zzso efficiently inhibited zzso zzso increased tumor cell zzso and decreased zzso expression in a head and neck zzso zzso These findings provide evidence that zzso activated zzso is an early event in head and neck zzso that contributes to the loss of growth control by an zzso zzso
