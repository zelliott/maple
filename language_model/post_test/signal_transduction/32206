Cell migration plays a pivotal role in airway repair and zzso involved in respiratory diseases such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso are involved in cell migration upon zzso however, the roles of zzso and zzso in migration of airway zzso cell remain zzso The present study was aimed to investigate influence of zzso on cell zzso with emphasis on the association with zzso zzso healing zzso and zzso zzso were performed to examine effect of zzso on migration and zzso of human zzso zzso cell zzso Level of zzso expression was determined by zzso and quantitative real-time zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso factor signaling in zzso cell migration was investigated using zzso and specific zzso zzso significantly zzso cell migration and zzso in parallel with elevated zzso zzso Further investigation showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in both zzso and protein zzso We showed that zzso activated zzso and inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso highly zzso with zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso migration was significantly diminished by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso cell migration as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso these findings reveal that zzso migration of zzso cell may be attributed to zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and the associated increase of zzso and zzso zzso indicating an important role of zzso signaling and zzso in zzso associated airway zzso
