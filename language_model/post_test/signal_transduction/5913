zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes are indispensable for the maintenance and zzso of mouse embryonic stem zzso cells zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso To understand the mechanism underlying the roles of these complexes in zzso cells, we performed high-resolution zzso mapping of the core zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso We find that zzso as represented by zzso binds to genes zzso components of the core zzso zzso circuitry, including zzso group zzso zzso zzso extensively with zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso zzso and shows distinct functional interactions with zzso and zzso at its target zzso Surprisingly, no significant zzso of zzso with zzso complexes, represented by zzso is zzso Lastly, zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso consistent with a direct and critical role in zzso and zzso signaling for maintaining zzso Taken together, our studies indicate that zzso is an essential component of the core zzso zzso network, and might also be a critical component of the zzso and zzso signaling pathways essential for maintenance of zzso and zzso
