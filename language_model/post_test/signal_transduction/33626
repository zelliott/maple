zzso has been reported to act as a primary regulator of zzso patterning along the zzso (AP) axis in the mouse zzso and disruption of zzso signaling causes distortion of molecular zzso along the zzso zzso Since zzso of zzso structures is observed in zzso zzso mice, zzso is also zzso to be involved in zzso zzso zzso In this study we analyzed the role of zzso in zzso development by means of zzso and zzso zzso The results showed that zzso zzso the expression of zzso factor zzso zzso including putative key factors involved in zzso zzso Although zzso had been thought to act downstream of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso mice, suggesting that zzso signaling acts as an upstream positive regulator of zzso zzso during zzso development independently of zzso
