zzso immune responses to bacterial or viral infection require rapid transition of large zzso of inflammatory response genes from zzso to actively transcribed states, but the underlying zzso mechanisms remain poorly zzso Here, we report that, while the nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso acid and zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso establish repression checkpoints on broad sets of inflammatory response genes in zzso and are required for nearly all of the zzso activities of liver X receptors zzso they can be selectively recruited via zzso or the zzso zzso zzso respectively, establishing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the binding of zzso and zzso to zzso promoters is frequently mutually dependent, establishing a requirement for both proteins for zzso zzso and enabling inflammatory signaling pathways that selectively target zzso or zzso to also zzso zzso zzso These findings reveal a zzso zzso strategy for integration of inflammatory and zzso signals that play essential roles in immunity and zzso
