The veins in the zzso wing have a characteristic zzso which is regulated by the activity of the zzso zzso The expression of the zzso Delta is restricted to the developing zzso and zzso with places where zzso zzso is zzso We find that this zzso distribution of zzso and zzso leads to zzso of zzso on both sides of each vein within a territory of zzso cells, and to the establishment of boundary cells that separate the vein from adjacent zzso In these cells, the expression of the zzso of split gene m beta is activated and the zzso of the zzso gene zzso is zzso thus restricting vein zzso We propose that the establishment of vein thickness zzso a combination of mechanisms that include: zzso independent regulation of zzso and Delta expression in zzso and vein territories, zzso zzso zzso by Delta in cells where zzso and Delta expression zzso zzso positive feedback on zzso zzso in cells where zzso has been activated and zzso repression of zzso zzso by zzso beta and maintenance of Delta expression by zzso zzso
