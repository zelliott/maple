The zzso zzso zzso interacting zzso zzso is a zzso scaffold protein that zzso in many cellular functions including zzso zzso focal zzso zzso and signaling by both zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso However, there have been no in zzso studies of zzso function to zzso 

To determine essential functions of zzso in zzso we generated a traditional zzso knockout zzso zzso knockout mice exhibited approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso examination showed that the major zzso in zzso knockout mice was impaired lung development characterized by markedly reduced numbers of pulmonary blood vessels and increased zzso zzso Given that vascular zzso growth factor zzso is essential for pulmonary vascular development, we investigated the role of zzso in zzso signaling in the lung and cultured zzso zzso Because zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso by zzso II requires zzso we hypothesized that zzso mediates zzso pulmonary zzso by modulating zzso and zzso activity in zzso zzso In cultured zzso cells, zzso of zzso decreased zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso activity in lungs from zzso knockout mice was reduced zzso 

Our data support a critical role for zzso in pulmonary vascular development by regulating zzso zzso and zzso zzso
