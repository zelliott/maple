To study the effect of zzso on zzso oxide zzso zzso in rats with cerebral zzso zzso 

zzso cerebral zzso model was established using modified zzso zzso zzso The NO content in the brain tissue was detected by zzso reduction and the expressions of zzso and zzso were detected by zzso Eighty rats in this experiment were divided into the normal group, the cerebral zzso injury model group (as the model group), the cerebral zzso injury + zzso group (as the acupuncture group), and the cerebral zzso injury + zzso 3 zzso zzso inhibitor group (as the inhibitor zzso Each group consisted of zzso zzso Five zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso was slowly injected at the lateral cerebral zzso of rats in the inhibitor group at a constant speed using zzso according to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were selected to determine levels of NO and zzso 

After zzso zzso the NO levels of the zzso and the cerebral zzso increased zzso and the expressions of zzso and zzso increased, showing significant difference when compared with those of the normal group zzso By zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso cerebral zzso injury zzso loss was zzso Meanwhile, the high levels of zzso zzso and zzso in the cerebral zzso and the zzso were significantly inhibited zzso The zzso increased expressions of zzso and zzso were zzso showing significant difference when compared with the model group zzso But when compared with the normal group, there was no significant difference zzso The effects of zzso reversed the zzso increased NO levels of the zzso and the cerebral zzso and expressions of zzso and zzso after zzso oppressed zzso to block the zzso zzso zzso The NO levels of the zzso and the cerebral zzso and expressions of zzso and zzso increased again, showing significant difference when compared with the acupuncture group zzso 

zzso fought against cerebral zzso and zzso in the loss of zzso at the same time, the abnormal regulation of zzso had reverse effect partly through zzso zzso signal zzso zzso
