The central nervous system is thought to influence the regulation of the cardiovascular system in response to zzso and neural signals from peripheral zzso but our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved is still quite zzso 

Here, we demonstrate a central nervous zzso mechanism by which zzso zzso factor zzso has a protective effect against cardiac zzso after zzso zzso zzso We generated conditional zzso knockout mice, in which expression of zzso was zzso reduced, by using the zzso zzso zzso Two weeks after zzso was induced surgically in these mice, zzso function was significantly impaired and cardiac size was markedly increased in conditional zzso knockout mice compared with zzso zzso death was increased in these mice, along with decreased expression of survival zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the heart also led to the zzso of cardiac dysfunction after zzso The plasma levels of zzso were markedly increased after zzso and this increase was associated with the zzso of zzso expression in the brain, but not in the zzso zzso of zzso nerves from the heart or genetic disruption of zzso zzso expression inhibited the increase of plasma zzso after zzso and led to the zzso of cardiac zzso zzso administration of zzso significantly restored the cardiac zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

These results suggest that zzso expression is zzso by neural signals from the heart after zzso and then protects the zzso against zzso zzso
