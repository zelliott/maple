The zzso zzso zzso and zzso diffuse poorly in isolation yet can spread over long distances in zzso predicting existence of two distinct forms of these zzso The first is poorly mobile and activates short-range target zzso The second is specifically packed for efficient spreading to induce long-range zzso zzso mechanisms involved in the zzso zzso of these two forms remain zzso zzso and zzso can associate with membrane zzso but the function of this association was zzso Here we show that a major protein component of membrane zzso zzso plays important roles in zzso and spreading of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso results in reduced spreading of the zzso while its zzso stimulates zzso of zzso and zzso and expands their zzso The resulting changes in the zzso zzso differently affect the zzso and long-range zzso In its action zzso appears specific for zzso and zzso These data suggest that zzso is an important component of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso dedicated to formation of the mobile pool of these zzso
