zzso plays an important role in embryonic stem zzso cells zzso and zzso yet the precise mechanism through which zzso accomplishes this important function remains zzso To understand comprehensive molecular mechanism by which zzso zzso we identified zzso molecular changes upon zzso zzso in zzso cells by using zzso zzso In order to zzso zzso expression zzso four zzso were designed on the basis of the zzso zzso sequence and their effects on the zzso expression were zzso Among these four zzso zzso was found to be most zzso Once zzso was zzso zzso cells underwent differentiation by showing zzso change and decreased proliferation zzso zzso analysis was then used to identify the altered gene expression after zzso was zzso A series of zzso expressed genes due to reduced expression of zzso was identified as zzso zzso These genes identified here could provide insights into the roles of zzso in zzso cells zzso and early zzso
