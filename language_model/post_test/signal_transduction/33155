The zzso concentration of free zzso zzso zzso is tightly controlled by feedback zzso of the zzso zzso and is zzso by specific zzso binding zzso zzso increases in the concentration are expected to be prevented by conversion into zzso or by zzso by zzso zzso Under normal zzso conditions the free zzso concentration of zzso zzso will be in the low zzso range, and it is unlikely to exceed 200 zzso under the most extreme zzso The fact that zzso zzso is active during fatty acid synthesis zzso for zzso is 5 zzso indicates strongly that the free zzso zzso concentration is below 5 zzso under these zzso Only a limited number of the reported experiments on the effects of zzso on cellular functions and zzso have been carried out at low zzso zzso in the presence of the appropriate zzso binding zzso zzso of many of the reported effects is therefore urgently zzso However, the observations that the zzso zzso channel is regulated by zzso zzso zzso in the presence of a zzso excess of zzso binding protein and that zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso coli zzso factor zzso are affected by low zzso zzso of zzso indicate that zzso zzso zzso can act as regulatory molecules in zzso This view is further supported by the observation that fatty acids do not repress expression of zzso zzso or zzso in zzso deficient in zzso zzso
