zzso zzso describes a phenomenon by which cells die from excessive sensitivity to small single doses of zzso radiation below approximately zzso zzso This review describes experimental data that strongly imply that zzso zzso is exclusively associated with the survival response of cells in the zzso phase of the zzso This zzso concept arose when the characteristic cell survival pattern that denotes zzso zzso was not detected in the radiation survival response of cell populations enriched in zzso or S phase zzso In contrast, an extended or exaggerated zzso zzso response was evident from populations selected to contain only zzso phase cells by flow zzso cell zzso The historical data that has defined the field of zzso zzso will be considered with respect to the radiation sensitivity of, and cell cycle checkpoints specific to, zzso phase zzso A working model of the putative mechanism of zzso zzso will be presented within this zzso The foundation of the model is a rapidly occurring zzso zzso zzso checkpoint that is specific to cells zzso in the zzso zzso This early zzso phase checkpoint has been demonstrated to exhibit a dose expression profile that is comparable to the zzso pattern that defines zzso zzso and is therefore a likely key regulator of the zzso
