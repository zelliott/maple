The current studies have implicated a prominent role for zzso peptides in modulating the zzso function of cells derived from the zzso zzso Compared to zzso both zzso and zzso demonstrated zzso zzso and sustained zzso effects on sympathetic zzso zzso and zzso zzso The differential effects of zzso peptides on zzso zzso and zzso content and zzso coincided with previous studies that activated directly the sympathetic zzso zzso zzso zzso A signaling zzso These effects appear to be zzso primarily by zzso zzso zzso zzso coupled to both zzso zzso and zzso C in zzso zzso The actions of zzso peptides in the zzso shared many parallels with adrenal zzso zzso cells, suggesting diverse roles for the zzso zzso system in zzso cell development and zzso Rather than solutions, these results pose additional questions for the zzso What are the zzso sources of zzso that regulate sympathetic and adrenal zzso Do zzso zzso like zzso have dual roles and also act as sympathetic zzso zzso Are zzso receptors expressed during zzso development? What regulates sympathetic zzso zzso zzso expression and how are they zzso coupled to zzso zzso signaling zzso What defines the zzso responses to zzso and zzso While many of these questions are not easily approached, future studies of these issues will certainly illuminate the function of zzso and zzso receptors in the nervous and zzso zzso
