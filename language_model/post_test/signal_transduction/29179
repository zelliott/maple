Development of a zzso system for the production of homogeneous sugar structures has the potential to zzso zzso relationships of zzso In the current study, we used an artificial zzso zzso to produce an zzso zzso growth factor zzso domain in zzso zzso The in zzso zzso system was constructed via expression of genes that zzso protein zzso 1 and the zzso domain, along with genes whose protein products convert zzso zzso to zzso This system allowed identification of an zzso ability of zzso zzso to transport zzso Moreover, expression of zzso domain zzso in this system revealed the different contribution of three zzso bonds to in zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso revealed differences in the ability of zzso zzso to bind the zzso structure of zzso zzso from human factors zzso and zzso Further introduction of the human fringe gene into zzso equipped with the in zzso zzso system facilitated the addition of zzso to the zzso domain from factor IX but not from factor zzso The results suggest that engineering of an zzso system in zzso provides a powerful tool for producing proteins with zzso zzso zzso Such proteins can be used for the analysis of zzso specificity and the production of zzso that recognize zzso zzso zzso
