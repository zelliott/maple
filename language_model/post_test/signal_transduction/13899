zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key regulatory protein in zzso cell zzso during inflammatory zzso Studies indicated that pending on the nature of the used inflammatory model, zzso of zzso may be beneficial or zzso However, the role of zzso in affecting outcome in zzso zzso is zzso We tested this question using an zzso mouse strain and zzso zzso and puncture zzso zzso which is a clinically relevant zzso septic zzso zzso mortality was markedly lower in zzso mice (35 zzso compared to zzso (85 zzso zzso increases in blood zzso and zzso levels were blunted at 6 h zzso in zzso zzso compared to zzso but zzso levels were similar at 20 h zzso zzso blood zzso and depletion of zzso B cells were also blunted in zzso mice as compared to zzso Analysis of zzso zzso responses by zzso and zzso zzso ex zzso indicated a zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso whereas zzso responses were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso production was also blunted in zzso zzso as compared to zzso The study shows that zzso zzso impacts multiple zzso pathways and decreases early zzso responses following zzso zzso The delayed inflammatory response caused by the lack of zzso expression is zzso as it zzso a marked increased chance of survival after zzso zzso
