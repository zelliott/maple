Previously, we showed that offspring from obese rat zzso were zzso with increased zzso zzso and zzso intolerance associated with increased zzso zzso expression after zzso zzso target of zzso zzso can inhibit food intake through a zzso zzso As we previously showed that maternal obesity zzso zzso zzso in the present study, we zzso that dietary zzso supplementation would activate zzso zzso to reduce food zzso thus limiting zzso disorders in offspring from obese zzso regardless of zzso zzso zzso was induced in zzso females by high-fat diet zzso for zzso before zzso throughout gestation and zzso Male zzso from zzso mothers were weaned onto zzso or zzso within each dietary group, half were supplied with zzso via drinking water zzso versus water control for zzso Those from zzso mothers were fed zzso and zzso zzso obesity led to increased zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso consumption exaggerated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso doubled zzso intake and increased zzso zzso zzso however, appetite regulation was not zzso A reduction in blood zzso levels was observed in offspring regardless of diet, as well as improved zzso tolerance in zzso zzso In zzso rats, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in muscle and zzso zzso 4 in fat suggested that zzso improved peripheral fat zzso and zzso zzso zzso is able to improve peripheral zzso and zzso metabolism independent of appetite and weight regulation, suggesting its potential application in the management of zzso zzso
