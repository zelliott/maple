zzso is mostly known for its capacity to promote bone zzso zzso zzso to mobilize and mature zzso cells as well as to enhance host immune zzso However the molecular actions of zzso are still poorly zzso Here we describe a new surprising facet of this zzso growth factor as a key regulator involved in zzso zzso We found that zzso release, a pivotal component of the triggered innate system, is heavily dependent on the signaling induced by zzso in such an extent that in its absence zzso is only zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso for zzso zzso mainly at the level of zzso production via strengthening the zzso zzso In addition, we show that expression of zzso a zzso required for zzso dependent zzso zzso is greatly zzso by zzso and zzso zzso suggesting a potential zzso contribution in enhancing zzso zzso The role of zzso in regulating zzso zzso is extended also in zzso since zzso zzso mice are more resistant to zzso septic zzso These results identify zzso as a key regulator of zzso production and indicate zzso as a previously underestimated target for therapeutic zzso
