Directing specific, complex cell behaviors, such as zzso in response to zzso for zzso medicine applications is, at present, a mostly unrealized zzso To date, current technological advances have been inspired by the zzso point of view, focused on developing simple and merely adequate environments that facilitate simple cellular zzso However, even if zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso have largely demonstrated their utility in supporting cell zzso their lack of biological specificity is simply not optimal for controlling more integrated zzso such as cell zzso These more complex cellular processes require specific zzso scaffolds and presumably synergistic zzso and growth zzso zzso This article will introduce some current efforts to engineer zzso zzso that incorporate additional levels of complexity for directing greater zzso specificity and synergistic zzso growth factor signaling toward directing cell zzso
