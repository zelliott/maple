To examine the expression of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso and its activated form zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso correlations with zzso progression and zzso 

The expression profiles of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were assessed on 100 clinical zzso samples and 10 normal liver zzso using an zzso zzso zzso their correlations with zzso parameters and survival of zzso patients were statistically zzso 

The results demonstrated that the positive rate of zzso zzso and Twist in zzso was significantly higher than that in normal liver zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso showed reduced zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso was positively correlated with Twist zzso whereas Twist was zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso expression was significantly associated with zzso invasion and zzso Survival analysis showed that zzso patients with zzso Twist positive zzso or reduced zzso expression had a significantly shorter survival duration than those with zzso Twist negative zzso or those with normal zzso zzso zzso analysis identified zzso zzso or zzso expression as an independent zzso factor for overall survival of zzso zzso zzso 

By this study, we suggest that activated zzso signal may associate with Twist and zzso expression and mediate zzso zzso and zzso abnormal zzso signal axis may predict poor prognosis of zzso zzso
