The recent explosion in biological and other real-world network data has created the need for improved tools for large network zzso In addition to well established global network properties, several new mathematical techniques for analyzing local structural properties of large networks have been zzso Small zzso zzso called network zzso have been introduced to identify simple building blocks of complex zzso Small induced zzso called zzso have been used to develop zzso zzso that zzso network zzso Based on these network signatures, two new highly sensitive measures of network local structural similarities were zzso the relative zzso frequency distance zzso and the zzso degree distribution agreement zzso Finding adequate zzso for biological networks is important in many research zzso Network properties are used to assess the fit of network models to the zzso Various network models have been zzso To date, there does not exist a software tool that measures the above mentioned local network zzso Moreover, none of the existing tools compare real-world networks against a series of network models with respect to these local as well as a multitude of global network zzso 

Thus, we introduce zzso a software tool that finds zzso network models by comparing large real-world networks against random graph models according to various network structural similarity zzso It has unique capabilities of finding zzso expensive zzso and zzso zzso In addition, it zzso several standard global network measures and thus supports the largest variety of network measures thus zzso Also, it is the first software tool that compares real-world networks against a series of network models and that has built-in parallel computing capabilities allowing for a user specified list of machines on which to perform zzso intensive searches for local network zzso Furthermore, zzso is easily zzso to include additional network measures and zzso 

zzso is a software tool that zzso the latest research on biological network models and zzso it compares real-world networks against a series of random graph models with respect to a multitude of local and global network zzso We present zzso as a comprehensive, zzso and easily zzso software tool for analyzing and modeling large biological zzso The software is zzso and freely available at zzso It runs under zzso zzso and Windows zzso In addition, it has an easy to use zzso web user interface that is available from the above web zzso
