zzso zzso is a recently discovered, potent zzso zzso with activities including maintenance of cardiovascular and zzso zzso Studies have indicated that AM is important in initiating the zzso response during the early stage of zzso and reduction of the vascular effects of AM marks the transition from the initial zzso phase to the late zzso phase in experimental zzso The decreased AM responsiveness in late zzso may be related to zzso in the AM zzso binding characteristics and/or signaling zzso zzso experiments have provided useful information by enhancing AM gene zzso Moreover, a plasma protein which binds zzso zzso binding zzso zzso was reported very recently and is just beginning to be investigated as an important zzso in the zzso septic zzso In this regard, our recent results have demonstrated that zzso zzso enhanced zzso vascular relaxation in both sham and septic zzso It appears that decreased levels of zzso play a critical role in producing vascular AM zzso during the late stage of zzso Furthermore, administration of AM and zzso in combination prevented the transition from the zzso to zzso response during the progression of zzso zzso Thus, zzso of vascular responsiveness to AM by zzso may provide a novel approach for the management of zzso
