Late cerebral zzso after zzso zzso zzso carries high morbidity and mortality because of reduced cerebral blood flow zzso and subsequent cerebral zzso This is associated with zzso of zzso receptors in cerebral artery smooth muscles via the zzso of zzso zzso In addition, delayed cerebral zzso after zzso is associated with inflammation and disruption of the zzso barrier zzso This article reviews recent evidence concerning the roles of zzso zzso zzso inflammation and zzso breakdown in delayed cerebral zzso after zzso In addition, recent studies investigating the role of various zzso zzso pathways in these processes and the possibilities of targeting zzso components in zzso treatment are zzso Studies using a rat zzso model have demonstrated that cerebral arteries increase their sensitivity to zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso by increasing their smooth muscle expression of receptors for these after zzso This is associated with reduced zzso and neurological zzso A number of signal zzso components zzso this zzso zzso have been identified, including the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been shown to prevent cerebrovascular zzso zzso and zzso zzso and neurological function after zzso in zzso At the same time, in rat zzso certain zzso and zzso proteins are zzso in cerebral artery smooth muscles and treatment with zzso zzso prevents the induction of these zzso Thus, zzso of zzso zzso exert zzso beneficial effects in zzso
