The study aims to provide a selective review of the literature pertaining to the zzso zzso axis and immune abnormalities as zzso biological indicators of vulnerability in bipolar disorder zzso 

We zzso key findings relating to zzso axis and zzso abnormalities in bipolar patients and their high-risk zzso zzso derive from a review of selected original papers published in the literature, and supplemented by papers identified through bibliography zzso zzso findings are discussed in the context of emergent BD in those at genetic risk and zzso into a zzso model of illness onset and zzso 

BD is associated with a number of genetic and possibly zzso abnormalities associated with zzso hormonal and zzso zzso zzso zzso Data from clinical and high-risk studies zzso zzso axis and immune system zzso which may represent inherited vulnerabilities important for the transition to illness zzso zzso and clinical studies zzso zzso signal zzso processes and zzso in energy metabolism associated with established zzso Specifically, long-standing zzso zzso such as changes in zzso systems may be zzso through changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso stress, cellular energy metabolism and zzso associated with substantial burden of zzso 

Prospective zzso studies of zzso and zzso such as zzso axis and immune abnormalities in high-risk offspring will be helpful to understand genetically zzso biological pathways associated with illness onset and zzso A clinical staging model describing emergent illness in those at genetic risk should facilitate this line of zzso
