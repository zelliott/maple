The fused gene encodes a zzso zzso that functions as a positive regulator of zzso signal zzso in zzso zzso wing zzso and zzso cell development during zzso Here, we have characterized the zzso zzso tumors present in adult zzso of fused zzso zzso a zzso not observed upon deregulation of any other component of zzso zzso In the strongest fused zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso zzso accumulate early zzso germ cells corresponding to zzso stem cells and/or early zzso as evidenced by activated zzso signal zzso and zzso repression of zzso zzso the zzso determination zzso These early germ cells are maintained far from their usual position in a specialized niche of zzso cells in the zzso part of the zzso which appears normal in size in fused zzso zzso zzso these results indicate a novel function for fused in zzso of zzso signaling which is necessary for zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The abnormal zzso of these early germ cells seems to be due primarily to defects in differentiation since we show that zzso stem cell proliferation in the zzso is not zzso A later block in zzso development, at the zzso zzso stage before significant nurse cell and zzso zzso was also observed in zzso zzso when fused function was only partially zzso Finally, fused zzso zzso exhibit some zzso zzso having undergone a zzso fifth zzso zzso Through zzso analysis, we provide evidence that fused regulates these zzso divisions cell zzso while the zzso zzso probably reflects both a zzso and zzso requirement for fused for zzso and zzso zzso
