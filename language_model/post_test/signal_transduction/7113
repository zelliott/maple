zzso fatty liver disease zzso affects up to zzso of the adult population in Western societies, yet the underlying molecular pathways remain poorly zzso Here, we identify the zzso zzso zzso 1 as a regulator of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso prevent dietary zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, established zzso and the associated liver damage can be efficiently reversed by zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso promotes zzso zzso while zzso exerts zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso was found to be essential for zzso signaling and zzso zzso This unique zzso regulation of zzso by distinct zzso zzso occurs at the zzso level and establishes zzso as a link between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
