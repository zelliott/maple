Permanent exposure to pathogens requires decisions toward tolerance or immunity as a prime task of zzso zzso The molecular mechanisms preventing uncontrolled immune responses are not completely zzso We investigated the regulatory function of zzso an organizing protein of zzso zzso in the signaling cascade of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells from both zzso and zzso mice with a point zzso in zzso 8 of zzso exhibited increased zzso zzso compared with zzso This finding was restricted to zzso zzso and not induced by zzso Because only zzso zzso was regulated by zzso we used zzso and zzso cells to show that zzso was primarily zzso Interestingly, additional experiments revealed that zzso cells from zzso mice and the blocking of electron transfer by zzso zzso had no influence on zzso zzso confirming an zzso zzso function of zzso Finally, proving the in zzso relevance zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in a strong zzso of zzso zzso zzso response only in zzso zzso These data suggest for the first time an important role for zzso in the fine tuning of the zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso that is independent of its role as an zzso of zzso
