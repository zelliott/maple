Increased growth and contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells zzso are major abnormalities in many vascular zzso To investigate the signaling pathways that mediate these zzso we studied the expression of smooth muscle zzso light chain zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso cultured zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso rats were treated with zzso II zzso zzso zzso expression was examined in the cells using western zzso zzso In zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso was delivered to spontaneously zzso rats zzso using an zzso zzso and their blood pressures were measured using zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso protein is rapidly increased by zzso II, an important zzso responsible for increased zzso and vascular zzso in concert with increased zzso light chain zzso zzso zzso II type 1 zzso zzso zzso or zzso blocked the zzso zzso increase in zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso blood pressure, and vascular zzso in zzso Moreover, zzso zzso activity decreased blood pressure and smooth muscle mass in arteries in zzso 

The regulation of zzso expression by zzso II via Ras signaling is important in the regulation of vascular zzso and blood zzso zzso this zzso could be an effective strategy for developing novel zzso to treat zzso
