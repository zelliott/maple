zzso zzso produces a spectrum of zzso many of which have been implicated in the zzso of human zzso zzso of some of these factors requires zzso communication involving the interaction of a small zzso zzso an zzso with a positive zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso directs the synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which activates the positive zzso zzso zzso Recently, we have discovered a second signaling zzso zzso in zzso termed zzso which contains the genes zzso and zzso Using zzso mass zzso and zzso zzso we now establish that in zzso coli, zzso directs the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These compounds are present in the spent culture zzso of zzso zzso in a zzso ratio of approximately zzso and their structures were unequivocally confirmed by chemical zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso to zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso unable to zzso either of these zzso restored zzso zzso and cyanide zzso In zzso coli carrying a zzso zzso fusion, zzso and zzso activated zzso to a similar zzso zzso of these zzso zzso in which the zzso side chain has been extended and/or oxidized at the zzso position exhibit substantially lower activity zzso zzso or no activity zzso zzso in this zzso reporter zzso These data indicate that multiple families of zzso sensing zzso zzso regulate gene expression in zzso zzso
