In the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso could function as a light signal because its production increases with the level of zzso Given the well-established effects of zzso acid on cell zzso in other zzso it is possible that the changing levels of zzso zzso the gap zzso zzso between retinal zzso This study examines the effects of zzso acid on horizontal cell zzso which is known to be modulated by the ambient light zzso Single horizontal cells were injected under visual control with either zzso zzso zzso or zzso yellow zzso zzso and the extent of zzso zzso or dye zzso was used to monitor the gap zzso zzso In the mouse zzso the injection of zzso revealed a network of approximately zzso zzso horizontal zzso The zzso zzso was completely abolished by zzso the zzso in 150 zzso zzso for 35 zzso In the rabbit zzso the injection of zzso yellow into zzso horizontal cells revealed networks of approximately zzso zzso horizontal zzso zzso in 150 zzso zzso reduced the dye zzso within 12 zzso and complete zzso was achieved after 35 zzso The zzso effects of zzso in the mouse and rabbit zzso were zzso and zzso and they were zzso after zzso The zzso was not affected by either the zzso form of zzso acid or by zzso that had been zzso by intensive zzso The zzso effect of zzso persisted following treatment with a D1 zzso zzso and thus was zzso This study has established that zzso is able to zzso the gap zzso zzso between horizontal cells in the zzso zzso where its zzso release has already been zzso
