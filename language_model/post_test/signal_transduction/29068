The zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso has various protective effects on cardiovascular zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso is required for full zzso zzso induction by zzso injury in the heart in zzso In rat zzso cardiac zzso zzso zzso expression was reduced by treatment with a zzso zzso zzso inhibitor or zzso targeting zzso Treatment with a zzso zzso zzso zzso also diminished zzso expression in response to zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso is a zzso regulator of zzso signaling in the heart and that this regulation occurs in part via a zzso zzso dependent mechanism in cardiac zzso
