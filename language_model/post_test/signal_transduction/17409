zzso zzso is one of the active components present in the root and zzso of zzso zzso It has been shown to contain biological activity zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the mechanisms underlying the zzso effect of zzso have not been zzso Here we investigated whether zzso treatment would zzso the severity of the disease in an experimental arthritis zzso 

We evaluated the effects of zzso on zzso mice in zzso 

The pathological processes of zzso are zzso by a number of zzso and zzso zzso of these zzso zzso is controlled by nuclear zzso zzso This study was performed to explore the effect of zzso on control of the zzso zzso zzso and to investigate whether zzso has zzso effects in zzso mice in zzso zzso inhibited the nuclear zzso and DNA binding of zzso zzso which were correlated with its zzso effect on zzso zzso degradation in zzso zzso These events further suppressed zzso production and zzso zzso In addition, zzso inhibited the zzso differentiation induced by zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso in bone zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso exerts zzso effects in zzso mice through zzso of the zzso zzso and therefore may have therapeutic value for the treatment of zzso
