zzso over the past decades demonstrating persistent zzso in the adult brain have challenged the view of a fixed zzso in normally functioning brain and raised hopes for zzso following brain zzso In addition to providing insights for repair, studying adult zzso may improve our understanding of embryonic development assuming that fundamental mechanisms are zzso It is argued here, using examples of zzso communication, that parallels can be drawn between adult and embryonic zzso Paradoxically, zzso communication in zzso regions resembles that in a mature zzso zzso This suggests that differences in the zzso properties of cells and the zzso zzso molecules may constitute a zzso environment or zzso While reasons for persistent adult zzso in humans remains obscure, recent findings regarding the environmental and zzso control of zzso reinforce the original concept of a role for zzso in motor memory formation and refinement of information zzso
