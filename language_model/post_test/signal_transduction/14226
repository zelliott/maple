zzso after zzso or open vascular reconstruction remains an important clinical zzso zzso zzso cell zzso injury induced by zzso stress plays an important role in the development of zzso zzso In this study, we sought to evaluate the protective effects of zzso zzso in zzso on zzso zzso zzso injury and the role of the zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso Human zzso vein zzso cells zzso exposed to hydrogen zzso zzso zzso zzso were used as the experimental zzso stress zzso The zzso gene was transferred into zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso before zzso zzso Cell zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Cell viability was assessed using the cell counting zzso zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso zzso detection and the scratching zzso Expressions of zzso zzso and zzso were detected by Western zzso Our results showed that zzso induced zzso and decreased the cell viability of zzso zzso zzso significantly protected cells from zzso cell damage and zzso and maintained the cell zzso Furthermore, the level of zzso and zzso protein expression was significantly elevated when zzso with zzso gene zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso exerts an zzso and protective effect on zzso zzso The zzso signaling zzso is probably involved in these zzso
