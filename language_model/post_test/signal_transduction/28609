The zzso zzso family of proteins can bind and directly regulate zzso a zzso protein zzso involved in zzso heart growth, muscle development, learning, and other zzso Whereas high levels of zzso can inhibit zzso signaling in zzso and animal cells, zzso can also stimulate zzso signaling when expressed at zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso effect of zzso zzso involves zzso of a zzso zzso zzso by zzso a member of the zzso family of protein zzso zzso at the zzso consensus site of zzso and human zzso abolish the zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso may therefore zzso between zzso and zzso forms in zzso in a manner similar to the zzso regulators of type 1 protein zzso zzso modeling indicates a zzso response of zzso to increasing zzso concentration such that protein zzso activity is zzso by low zzso of zzso and inhibited by high zzso of zzso or zzso This prediction was verified zzso in zzso cells expressing zzso or zzso at different zzso Through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso can potentially contribute to a positive feedback loop involving zzso zzso of zzso zzso Such feedback may help explain the large induction of zzso observed in brain of Down syndrome zzso
