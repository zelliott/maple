The zzso zzso including the zzso response zzso protein zzso is known to play an important role in zzso survival and zzso Here the influence of this cascade on zzso in adult zzso was zzso zzso of the zzso cascade by administration of zzso an inhibitor of zzso breakdown, increased the proliferation of newborn cells in adult mouse zzso In addition, zzso induction of cell proliferation resulted in mature zzso cells that express zzso zzso Increased cell proliferation is accompanied by zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells, suggesting a role for this zzso zzso This possibility is supported by studies demonstrating that cell proliferation is decreased in conditional transgenic mice that express a dominant negative zzso of zzso in zzso The results suggest that the zzso cascade could contribute to the actions of zzso and zzso factors on adult zzso
