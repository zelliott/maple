zzso of mechanisms regulating cell cycle progression is of fundamental importance for cell and cancer zzso Although several genes and signaling pathways are implicated in zzso regulation, less is known regarding the mechanisms controlling cell cycle progression through zzso and M zzso We report that zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso a member of the zzso protein zzso is activated at zzso and required for timely zzso zzso zzso of zzso activated nuclear factor zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso and degradation of zzso Furthermore, selective zzso of zzso at zzso zzso substantially delayed zzso entry and inhibited zzso of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso at zzso diminished zzso induced by zzso zzso of zzso providing a direct link between zzso zzso and regulation of zzso zzso We conclude that a novel zzso signaling zzso plays a key role in regulation of the zzso zzso
