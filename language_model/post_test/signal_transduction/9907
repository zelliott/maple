The free radical theory of aging states that aging results from the accumulated damage caused by zzso oxygen species zzso zzso we provide a critique of the theory that aims to point out the zzso weaknesses and put forward ideas for how future experiments must adjust to several emerging zzso In the same way fire is dangerous and nonetheless humans learned how to use it, it now appears that cells evolved mechanisms to control and use zzso The way zzso are used as signaling molecules in many crucial biological functions suggests zzso are not unwanted zzso of zzso We zzso that the connection between zzso and cellular processes like growth, zzso and zzso may explain why zzso animals appear to have lower levels of zzso production: the longer development of zzso animals may lead to lower steady state levels of zzso With age, zzso systems become zzso just like so many other cellular zzso and so zzso damage zzso zzso the production of zzso is not merely a cause of havoc but rather a complex and critical system whose disruption in disease and aging leads to zzso zzso Potential roles of zzso in aging are discussed under this zzso
