zzso and subsequent regrowth of zzso buds is a critical zzso process for many perennial zzso We have used the expression of hormone and cell zzso genes as markers to follow this process in leafy zzso zzso zzso In conjunction with earlier studies, we show that loss of mature leaves results in decreased sugar levels and increased zzso perception in underground zzso zzso zzso is sufficient for induction of S zzso but not M zzso gene zzso Loss of both zzso and zzso buds or zzso of polar zzso transport did not result in induction of S zzso or M zzso gene zzso Loss of polar zzso transport was necessary for continuation of the cell cycle and further bud development if the S phase was previously zzso
