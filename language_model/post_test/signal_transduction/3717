Because many zzso zzso zzso zzso to initiate nuclear zzso activity via protein zzso C zzso we have investigated whether zzso might counter zzso zzso inhibited zzso activity in an isolated airway smooth muscle cell zzso and prevented the zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso by zzso growth factor, zzso and zzso zzso zzso in intact zzso zzso zzso in response to all the zzso involves zzso The stimulation of zzso cells with zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso induced an increase in zzso zzso but was without effect on zzso zzso synthesis was zzso whereas zzso levels were increased in the presence of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso indicating that zzso stimulates zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso from zzso was prevented by a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso conversion of zzso to zzso may serve to zzso the effect of zzso on zzso This may account for the zzso action of zzso
