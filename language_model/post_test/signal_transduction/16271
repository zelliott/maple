Complex signaling zzso between different growth factor zzso orchestrate the primary brain cancer zzso Among the frequent zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso activated zzso zzso and sonic zzso pathways have attracted much attention because of their pivotal roles in pediatric zzso and adult zzso zzso zzso brain zzso The enhanced expression levels and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling elements can provide key roles for the sustained growth, migration and local invasion of brain zzso cells zzso and their zzso resistance to current therapies and disease zzso These zzso zzso also can cooperate with zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso receptors zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso receptors zzso for the acquisition of a more zzso behavior and survival advantages by brain tumor cells during disease zzso zzso the simultaneous targeting of these zzso signaling components including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso pathways may constitute a potential therapeutic approach of great clinical interest to eradicate zzso and improve the efficacy of current clinical treatments by radiation and/or chemotherapy against aggressive and zzso zzso and zzso
