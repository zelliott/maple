The zzso changes of human memory T cell zzso are still poorly zzso We define a T cell memory repertoire as the pool of zzso lineages participating in a recall response to the influenza zzso zzso In zzso individuals, this response predominantly uses zzso chains with zzso zzso in the zzso zzso We previously showed that the repertoire is zzso with a large fraction of zzso that are only observed zzso In this study, we perform zzso analyses of memory zzso in three middle-aged individuals at times that spanned from 7 to 10 zzso In these individuals, who are well into zzso zzso a substantial number of zzso were stable, zzso detected at two zzso The shape of the repertoire was stable over time as reflected by a number of repertoire zzso including zzso zzso the fraction of zzso observed only once, and repertoire zzso However, the zzso subset showed a significant decline in the fraction of zzso and in zzso zzso Thus, repertoire structure is maintained over time by a recruitment of zzso and a shift of existing zzso into higher zzso The recruitment of new zzso into the zzso component of the repertoire implies a role for these zzso
