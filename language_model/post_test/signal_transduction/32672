During zzso zzso the two halves of the lateral zzso migrate zzso over a surface of flattened cells, the zzso and meet at the zzso zzso in order to form the continuous sheet of the zzso zzso During this process of zzso migration, known as zzso closure, signaling from a zzso cascade causes the production of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to the putative zzso receptors zzso and zzso activates a zzso zzso that is also required for zzso zzso zzso in genes involved in either the zzso cascade or the zzso signaling zzso can disrupt zzso zzso Our findings show that although these pathways are linked they are not equivalent in zzso Signaling by the zzso cascade may be initiated by the small zzso zzso zzso and acts to assemble the zzso and specify the identity of the first row of cells of the zzso prior to the onset of zzso zzso Signaling in the zzso zzso is zzso by zzso and acts during the closure process to control the mechanics of the migration process, most likely via its putative zzso zzso zzso
