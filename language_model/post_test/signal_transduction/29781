We have characterized and mapped the zzso zzso zzso analyzed its embryonic zzso and studied its role in zzso zzso In zzso zzso experiments show that from the zzso stage to 48 zzso zzso is zzso expressed in the spinal cord, zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso is initially expressed at 32 zzso in the zzso portion of the zzso expression zzso zzso is expressed in a subset of cells located on the left side of the zzso zzso to the liver zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso that arises from the zzso pancreatic zzso Then the zzso expression domain buds giving rise to the zzso pancreatic zzso that grows zzso to eventually engulf the zzso zzso By 72 zzso zzso continues to be expressed in the zzso compartment derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso loss of function suppresses the expression of the zzso zzso while the zzso markers in the zzso are zzso In mind bomb zzso zzso in which zzso notch zzso is defective zzso Cell 4 zzso zzso zzso is normally zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso that lack expression of zzso markers because of a defective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit normal levels of zzso This indicates that zzso signaling plays a different genetic role in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso pancreatic zzso
