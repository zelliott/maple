The outcomes of clinical trials using bone zzso zzso cell zzso are zzso the degree of the expansion of zzso during clinical manufacturing may contribute to this zzso since cell expansion is limited by zzso Human zzso from zzso of healthy subjects were zzso serially until cell growth zzso zzso and functional zzso of zzso from two subjects including zzso zzso zzso and colony formation efficiency changed from an early to a zzso pattern at passage 6 or zzso zzso analysis of 10 early and 15 late passage zzso samples from 5 subjects revealed zzso zzso expressed zzso which were associated with immune response, development, and cell proliferation zzso Analysis of 57 serial zzso samples from 7 donors revealed that the change from an early to zzso profile was variable among subjects and occurred prior to changes in zzso zzso age expressed as a percentage of maximum population zzso zzso was a good indicator for an early or zzso zzso signature but this measure of zzso life span can only be calculated after expanding zzso to zzso In order to find a more useful surrogate measure of zzso age, we used a zzso biology approach to identify a set of genes whose expression at each passage would predict elapsed age of zzso A total of 155 genes were highly correlated with zzso zzso A least angle zzso zzso identified a set of 24 zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the onset of zzso molecular changes was variable and preceded changes in other indicators of zzso quality and zzso The 24 zzso age zzso genes will be useful in assessing the quality of clinical zzso zzso
