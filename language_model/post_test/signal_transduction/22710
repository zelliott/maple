zzso zzso is a novel zzso inhibitor which is currently in phase zzso clinical zzso We found that the sensitivity to zzso was correlated with zzso cell death determined by the zzso DNA ladders in gastric cancer cell zzso The treatment of zzso activated zzso genes such as zzso and zzso zzso The relationship between the zzso induction of zzso and zzso genes and the zzso DNA ladders by zzso was zzso respectively zzso The introduction of zzso gene into zzso gastric cancer cells increased the sensitivity to zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso values, whereas the introduction of zzso gene increased the sensitivity to zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso values, as compared to that of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso gene was found in the zzso zzso Likewise, the zzso zzso of zzso gene was also found in the zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso of zzso family genes such as zzso and zzso plays a crucial role in modulating zzso cell death in the sensitivity to zzso drugs, and suggest that these zzso genes might interact in the zzso for zzso downstream signals leading to zzso in gastric cancer zzso
