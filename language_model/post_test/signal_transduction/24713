In muscle cells, as in a variety of cell types, proliferation and differentiation are mutually exclusive events controlled by a balance of opposing cellular zzso Members of the zzso family of zzso zzso proteins which, in collaboration with ubiquitous factors, activate muscle differentiation and inhibit cell proliferation function at the zzso of the cellular circuits that control proliferation and differentiation of muscle zzso The activities of these zzso regulators are zzso regulated by zzso growth factors and activated zzso whose products transmit growth signals from the membrane to the zzso Recent studies have revealed multiple mechanisms through which zzso growth factor signals may interfere with the functions of the zzso zzso When expressed at high levels, members of the zzso family can override zzso signals and can cause growth arrest independent of their effects on zzso The ability of these zzso regulators to inhibit proliferation of normal as well as transformed cells from multiple lineages suggests that they interact with zzso components of the cellular machinery involved in cell cycle progression and that similar types of regulatory factors participate in differentiation and cell cycle control in diverse cell zzso
