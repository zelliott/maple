The programmed cell death 5 zzso protein is a novel protein related to regulation of cell zzso In this report, we demonstrate that the level of zzso protein expressed in cells undergoing zzso is significantly increased compared with normal cells, then the protein zzso rapidly from the zzso to the nucleus of zzso The appearance of zzso in the zzso of zzso cells precedes the zzso of zzso and fragmentation of zzso zzso This phenomenon is parallel to the loss of zzso membrane potential, independent of the feature of zzso stimuli and also independent of the cell types and the zzso zzso In conclusion, the nuclear zzso of zzso is a universal earlier event of the zzso process, and may be a novel early marker for zzso
