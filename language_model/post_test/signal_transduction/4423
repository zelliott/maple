Previous studies indicate that both acute and chronic ethanol administration inhibit protein synthesis and decrease the zzso of zzso growth zzso zzso Although IGF-1 synthesis and zzso are regulated by growth hormone zzso from the zzso zzso we assessed whether ethanol zzso tissue response to growth zzso Liver slices from male zzso rats were prepared, placed into zzso media, and incubated at 37 degrees C with zzso and either zzso or 1 zzso rat growth hormone and 0, 37 zzso zzso or 175 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were removed at 0, 15, 30, and 60 zzso zzso synthesis increased zzso during this time period, and administration of growth hormone (1 zzso significantly increased protein synthetic rate by zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas addition of 37 or 175 zzso ethanol attenuated the effects of growth hormone zzso zzso zzso Analysis of IGF-1 zzso indicated a zzso increase in response to growth hormone zzso zzso zzso whereas ethanol administration decreased the growth zzso rise of IGF-1 zzso Ethanol zzso zzso inhibited the release of IGF-1 into the media zzso zzso zzso Ethanol did not alter growth hormone zzso zzso and exposure of tissue slices to ethanol did not influence the number of growth hormone receptors or the affinity of growth hormone for its zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso growth hormone is a potent acute regulator of IGF-1 zzso and IGF-1 zzso release, zzso ethanol zzso growth zzso protein synthesis and induction of IGF-1 gene zzso and zzso the zzso effects of ethanol on growth hormone occur without changing growth hormone zzso number or binding zzso We conclude that ethanol suppresses growth zzso signal zzso resulting in a decrease in IGF-1 gene zzso
