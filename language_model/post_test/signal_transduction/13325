zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso function as zzso acting components in zzso light zzso zzso in the respective genes led to very similar zzso under zzso zzso To examine whether both genes are functionally zzso detailed zzso and genetic analyses were performed with zzso and zzso zzso isolated from the same zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso under different light treatments demonstrated that zzso has a strong influence on the regulation of very low zzso responses and a weaker influence on zzso zzso In contrast, zzso severely altered zzso responses and caused almost no change on very low zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso double zzso demonstrated that zzso could not suppress the zzso of the weak zzso zzso under continuous zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso double zzso exhibited a strong interference of both genes in the regulation of zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso are involved in different but interacting zzso signal zzso zzso
