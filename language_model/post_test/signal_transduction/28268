zzso controls zzso growth through cell cycle arrest and zzso and resistance to zzso is a mechanism of zzso zzso The aim of this study was to assess differences in zzso growth zzso in normal and zzso zzso zzso was induced in mice and normal and zzso zzso were isolated by zzso zzso and treated with or without zzso (5 zzso DNA zzso zzso protein zzso and DNA binding activity were zzso zzso reduced DNA synthesis to a greater degree in normal zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein expression was decreased in zzso zzso and zzso zzso complex formation was zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso had decreased DNA binding activity at 120 zzso following zzso zzso In conclusion, decreased zzso protein expression may impair zzso growth zzso in zzso zzso
