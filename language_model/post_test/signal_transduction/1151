zzso the most potent zzso factor in zzso zzso is an unusual molecular zzso that is associated with the zzso of zzso non-native proteins in zzso and in zzso The close cooperation between zzso zzso zzso and specific zzso zzso systems to zzso and reactivate zzso proteins has been dubbed a zzso zzso Interestingly, animal zzso do not zzso a zzso zzso To investigate the zzso and biological consequences of introducing into human cells a stress tolerance factor that has protein zzso capabilities distinct from those already present, zzso was expressed as a zzso in a human zzso zzso line zzso zzso inhibited zzso loss of viability in zzso cells, and this action correlated with reduced zzso zzso but not with reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cooperated with zzso human zzso and zzso molecular zzso and their zzso zzso zzso and zzso to produce a functional hybrid zzso network capable of zzso zzso zzso We also established that zzso zzso across the nuclear envelope and enhances the zzso capacity of both the zzso and zzso of intact zzso Our results establish the fundamental properties of protein zzso function in human cells with implications for the use of zzso or related proteins as therapeutic agents in diseases associated with protein zzso
