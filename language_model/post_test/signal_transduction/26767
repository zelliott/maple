The internal tandem zzso zzso of the zzso region of the zzso zzso has been associated with increased zzso oxygen species zzso generation in acute zzso leukemia zzso How this elevated level of zzso contributes to the zzso zzso however, remains poorly zzso In this work we show that zzso in the zzso expressing zzso cell line zzso is reduced by treatment with zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso a zzso zzso and zzso a zzso specific zzso suggesting that zzso production is both zzso and zzso zzso zzso The majority of these zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso as determined with the zzso zzso dye zzso 1, which also zzso to zzso of zzso Moreover, knocking down zzso dramatically reduces zzso after 24 hours in the zzso without affecting zzso zzso zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso reduces zzso in zzso expressing cell lines zzso zzso through reduction of zzso over 24 zzso zzso zzso is achieved by zzso degradation and is prevented upon zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in reduced zzso zzso and reduced zzso levels in the cells after 24 zzso Thus, we have shown that zzso driven zzso production in zzso cells is zzso by zzso and is critical for zzso zzso
