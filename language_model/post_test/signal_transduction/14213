The biological effects of periodic mechanical stress on zzso have been studied extensively over the past few zzso However, the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso and signaling in response to periodic mechanical stress remain to be zzso In the current study, we examined the effects of focal zzso zzso zzso signaling on periodic mechanical zzso zzso proliferation and zzso zzso 

zzso mechanical stress significantly induced sustained zzso of zzso at zzso and zzso Reduction of zzso with targeted zzso via zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso abolished periodic mechanical zzso zzso proliferation and zzso zzso accompanied by attenuated zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was not prevented upon zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso targeted to zzso or suppression of zzso with its selective zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso at zzso but not zzso under periodic mechanical zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso neither at zzso nor at zzso was affected by zzso depletion when periodic mechanical stress was zzso In addition, zzso and zzso zzso levels were reduced upon zzso with a blocking zzso against zzso zzso under conditions of periodic mechanical zzso 

Our findings collectively suggest that periodic mechanical stress promotes zzso proliferation and zzso synthesis through at least two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
