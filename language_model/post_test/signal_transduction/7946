The zzso signaling zzso regulates cell fate and behavior during zzso adult tissue zzso and zzso When inappropriately zzso the zzso has been linked to zzso cancer and melanoma, and when attenuated it may contribute to Alzheimer's disease and zzso Small molecules that zzso zzso signaling will likely provide new insights into the regulation of this key zzso zzso and ultimately provide pharmacological agents to control zzso signaling in zzso To this end, we screened a library of 100,000 small molecules for activity in a zzso zzso of zzso signaling and discovered a zzso zzso zzso that zzso with zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso signal zzso Through affinity zzso and subsequent functional zzso we showed that zzso binds and zzso the zzso zzso protein of zzso factor 1 zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso signaling through an effect on protein zzso zzso with its function as an zzso zzso zzso zzso migration of zzso zzso breast cancer zzso
