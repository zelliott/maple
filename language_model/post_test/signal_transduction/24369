The zzso and zzso zzso zzso control zzso of the zzso and zzso response regulators in response to the respiratory zzso nitrate and zzso Target zzso zzso is activated by the zzso protein in response to zzso and it is further activated and/or zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso which bind to zzso DNA zzso The location and arrangement of zzso vary widely among different target zzso control zzso We have constructed a series of zzso zzso zzso control region zzso in which the primary operator zzso has been replaced by zzso zzso pairs from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso control zzso These zzso provide tools for zzso various aspects of zzso interactions with zzso sensor interactions with response regulators, and zzso regulator interactions with DNA zzso zzso of the zzso gene from these zzso was zzso to various degrees by nitrate and zzso In response to zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso pairs at operator zzso each zzso greater than zzso repression of zzso gene zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso zzso pair zzso approximately tenfold zzso Introduction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in various combinations allowed the in zzso interactions between different zzso pairs to be evaluated and zzso
