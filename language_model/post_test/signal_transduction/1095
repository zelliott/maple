Bone zzso proteins zzso function during various aspects of embryonic development including zzso However, their biological functions after birth are less zzso To investigate the role of zzso during bone zzso we generated a zzso zzso disruption of zzso that encodes the type zzso zzso for zzso in zzso zzso mice were smaller than controls up to 6 months after zzso zzso zzso and low bone mass were observed, but there were normal numbers of zzso The ability of the zzso zzso to form zzso zzso in culture was severely zzso Interestingly, bone mass was increased in aged zzso mice due to reduced bone zzso evidenced by reduced bone zzso The zzso mice lost more bone after zzso likely resulting from decreased zzso function which could not overcome zzso bone zzso In organ culture of bones from aged mice, zzso of the zzso gene by zzso zzso zzso abolished the zzso effects of zzso on the expression of zzso zzso essential for zzso bone zzso These results demonstrate essential and zzso roles for zzso signaling zzso by zzso (a type zzso zzso for zzso in zzso for bone zzso
