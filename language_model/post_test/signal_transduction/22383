The present study analyzed the effects of endurance training against cardiac zzso dysfunction, particularly on the zzso to zzso zzso transition pore zzso induction in zzso zzso zzso zzso young male zzso rats were randomly assigned into sedentary zzso zzso sedentary type I diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso treadmill running, zzso and zzso zzso zzso before zzso After zzso isolated heart zzso were used for in zzso oxygen consumption and zzso potential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso swelling and zzso zzso were measured to study zzso zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso D zzso zzso factor A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and -9 activities were zzso In the sedentary group, long-term severe zzso decreased state 3, zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso state 4 and lag phase with zzso A decreased state 3 and state 4 with zzso were zzso Moreover, zzso decreased zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso release and zzso zzso zzso The oxygen consumption and zzso parameters impaired by long-term severe zzso were reverted by endurance training zzso zzso zzso Training increased zzso zzso zzso and decreased zzso release in zzso zzso Additionally, endurance training reverted the zzso zzso zzso attenuating decrease of zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, training prevented the zzso zzso in zzso zzso ratio, zzso and -9 and the increased zzso Endurance training zzso heart zzso respiratory dysfunction caused by long-term severe zzso and reduced the increased zzso to zzso induction probably by zzso of zzso regulatory zzso
