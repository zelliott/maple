zzso regulates zzso cells through zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso Due to the paucity of zzso model systems expressing zzso little is known about the specific mechanisms involved in zzso regulation of this gene by zzso Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that the zzso zzso cell line expresses zzso zzso In the present study we characterized the mechanisms involved in zzso regulation of the zzso promoter using this cell zzso Using zzso zzso we show that zzso regulation of the zzso zzso promoter involves at least two zzso present between zzso and zzso zzso in association with one or several elements within the zzso region of the zzso Surprisingly, the two zzso zzso sites previously shown to be involved in the zzso response to zzso in zzso cells do not play a role in zzso responsiveness in the zzso cell zzso Here we demonstrate that calcium influx itself is not sufficient to zzso the response, but it is necessary for both zzso zzso and zzso induction of the zzso zzso Moreover, we show that zzso regulation of zzso gene expression is zzso by zzso and establish the presence of multiple zzso zzso in zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso and zzso induce activity of the zzso promoter through different, although possibly zzso pools of zzso zzso This is further supported by the use of a zzso zzso which zzso the induction of zzso by zzso but not by zzso In conclusion, we have demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso signaling systems are all involved in the induction of zzso gene expression by zzso in the zzso mouse zzso cell zzso
