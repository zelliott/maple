The large protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso orchestrate DNA damage checkpoint zzso In budding zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso by zzso and zzso zzso The zzso complex consists of two highly related zzso zzso and zzso and a third zzso zzso in budding zzso or zzso in zzso The zzso complex controls the zzso signaling zzso in response to zzso break zzso zzso We show here that the zzso complex functions together with zzso 1 zzso in zzso of the zzso signaling zzso after DNA damage and replication zzso zzso controls the checkpoint responses following zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso the zzso complex and zzso play an overlapping role in zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso complex and zzso collaborate in producing long zzso DNA zzso tails at zzso ends and promote zzso association with the zzso The zzso complex associates with sites of DNA damage and zzso the zzso signaling zzso However, zzso association with zzso does not require the function of the zzso complex and zzso zzso controls checkpoint responses to stalled DNA replication as zzso zzso the zzso complex and zzso contribute to zzso of the replication checkpoint zzso Our results provide a model in which the zzso complex and zzso cooperate in generating long zzso tracts and thereby facilitate zzso association with sites of DNA damage or replication zzso
