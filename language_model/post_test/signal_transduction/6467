zzso zzso factor zzso exhibits multiple biological effects during zzso zzso including regulation of zzso cell zzso In the early zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso rapid and transient zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso 1 and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso Although both zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso respond directly to zzso signals, zzso elicits distinct zzso patterns of zzso and zzso zzso stimulation zzso low levels of zzso zzso in zzso and differentiated zzso but a robust zzso zzso among zzso zzso precursors expressing the zzso zzso gene zzso and newly differentiated rod zzso In contrast, zzso causes preferential zzso of zzso in zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso reveals that zzso is required for both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling by a zzso inhibitor zzso or a zzso zzso zzso causes enhanced production of rod zzso in the absence of zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso by a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso inhibitor has no effect on rod zzso differentiation in zzso Furthermore, zzso the function of zzso growth factor zzso zzso which zzso rod development in zzso indicates that the zzso family of zzso does not mediate the zzso effect of zzso on rod zzso These results demonstrate that zzso signal zzso is dynamic and zzso in the developing zzso and that zzso zzso zzso zzso in retinal zzso and/or zzso precursor cells plays an important role in regulating zzso zzso
