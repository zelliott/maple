This study is to investigate the effect and mechanism of zzso on DNA damage of zzso cells induced by zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso at 30 zzso zzso zzso Twenty four hours after zzso DNA damage was detected by comet zzso zzso was measured by thin layer zzso and gas zzso zzso free calcium zzso was analyzed by flow zzso the zzso level of zzso protein was examined by Western zzso zzso zzso of DNA damage, zzso free calcium zzso and zzso protein were elevated in zzso model zzso zzso to the model group, all indicators above were reduced in all groups zzso by zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso to block downstream zzso zzso zzso and calcium zzso rising, therefore reduces DNA damage in zzso cells induced by zzso
