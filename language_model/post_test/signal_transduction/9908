zzso zzso regulates zzso of many developing zzso Sonic zzso zzso zzso has been shown to regulate the growth and zzso of the zzso shelves prior to their zzso and zzso Here, we show that zzso expression is limited to a thickened zzso oral zzso prior to zzso shelf zzso After zzso shelf zzso above the zzso zzso is expressed only in small areas of thickened zzso oral zzso that corresponded to developing zzso The zzso zzso and a regulator of zzso zzso zzso are expressed in the zzso adjacent to the zzso oral zzso so that the highest level of transcripts zzso to the zzso zzso surrounding the zzso thickened zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulator zzso are expressed widely in the zzso zzso No differences were found in the expression patterns of zzso zzso members along the zzso axis of the developing zzso
