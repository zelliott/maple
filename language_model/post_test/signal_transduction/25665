The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are involved in a variety of inflammatory diseases, including zzso and act on at least two distinct zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso are currently used to control zzso and inflammation in zzso zzso The potential role of zzso in asthma remains poorly zzso A zzso in the zzso zzso resulting in a single zzso acid substitution zzso was found to be associated with asthma in three separate population zzso Here, we investigated whether the zzso zzso affected the affinity of zzso for its natural zzso and its signaling zzso Human embryonic kidney zzso cells were zzso zzso with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso for zzso was reduced by zzso whereas affinity for zzso was essentially zzso zzso production of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was significantly decreased at zzso zzso of the zzso but no difference was observed at high zzso In contrast, zzso zzso production was zzso to zzso less in zzso than in zzso zzso Similar results were also observed with the zzso of the zzso promoter induced by zzso or zzso Moreover, in contrast to zzso cells, zzso of nuclear factor zzso zzso was absent in zzso zzso zzso Likewise, zzso of zzso zzso zzso was not induced in zzso zzso cells, whereas zzso of zzso response zzso and zzso was zzso at least at higher zzso zzso Our results indicate that the zzso zzso drastically affects zzso responses to zzso and less to zzso
