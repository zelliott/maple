zzso gap zzso communication between vascular cells has been implicated in ascending zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso of many vascular zzso Here, we assessed the mechanisms by which the zzso acids zzso generated by a zzso zzso zzso control zzso gap zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso coronary zzso cells, zzso which enhances zzso formation, zzso a zzso effect on the electrical zzso and transfer of zzso yellow between zzso cells, consisting of a transient increase in zzso followed by a sustained zzso The initial phase was sensitive to the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and the protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso and zzso and could be zzso by zzso and zzso zzso as well as by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sodium salt and zzso Gap junction zzso in zzso zzso coronary zzso cells was prevented by zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso In human zzso cells, which express little zzso zzso zzso zzso only an zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso product, zzso also exerted a dual effect on the electrical and dye zzso of human zzso cells, which was sensitive to zzso zzso These results demonstrate that an zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso can positively regulate zzso gap zzso communication, most probably via the zzso of zzso an effect that is curtailed by the subsequent zzso of zzso
