Under pathological conditions, the zzso signal zzso is involved in the inflammatory process in zzso zzso and zzso under zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to observe whether or not zzso disease is associated with zzso signal zzso 

All the patients were diagnosed between 1980 and 2009 at zzso University zzso Twenty-two specimens from 12 patients with zzso disease zzso and 13 specimens from nine patients with zzso zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso for zzso zzso (a zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso 1 target zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso were highly expressed in the zzso in the new zzso zzso and in the smooth muscle cells in the media of specimens from both zzso These zzso proteins were also remarkably expressed in inflammatory cells in the zzso of specimens from zzso zzso Fewer inflammatory cells expressed zzso proteins in zzso plaques zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Indeed, zzso which is a zzso factor downstream of zzso was remarkably expressed in the zzso of new zzso vessels and inflammatory cells in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were also seen in the zzso in samples from the zzso zzso 

Our findings are the first demonstration that zzso signal zzso in inflammatory cells may be involved in the zzso mechanism underlying zzso zzso
