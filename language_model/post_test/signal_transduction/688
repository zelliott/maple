zzso skin cancer is the most prevalent cancer in the United States with approximately zzso million new cases diagnosed each zzso zzso zzso expression is commonly elevated in these and other zzso zzso zzso metabolize zzso acid to zzso which promote growth and survival of tumor zzso zzso also zzso zzso forming zzso zzso however, the role of these zzso molecules in tumor cell survival is zzso The goal of this research is to determine if the zzso products of zzso contribute to zzso cell zzso zzso zzso known as zzso zzso zzso induced cell death in the zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso In contrast, zzso did not initiate cell death in zzso zzso which express low zzso levels of zzso Resistance to zzso cell death in zzso cells was reversed by zzso zzso in these zzso Next, zzso zzso were carried out to identify zzso involved in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso were predominantly formed in zzso zzso cells although significant increases in zzso and zzso zzso were also zzso zzso were then treated with various zzso or zzso to determine the contribution of each to zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso were found to be zzso to zzso zzso and the zzso zzso products, zzso and zzso zzso zzso were also potent zzso of cell zzso These results suggest that zzso selectively zzso cell death in zzso zzso due to zzso zzso and the resulting metabolism of zzso to zzso zzso
