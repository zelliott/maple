The zzso effect of zzso on zzso cells and the possible mechanisms were zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso of various zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to evaluate the zzso effect of zzso on the growth of zzso zzso Cell zzso was detected by both zzso zzso zzso zzso and transmission electron zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was determined by Western zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction zzso Our results showed that zzso obviously inhibited growth and induced zzso of zzso cells in zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso The zzso value of zzso for 24 h was zzso zzso Moreover, zzso induced zzso cells zzso in a zzso zzso zzso revealed typical zzso changes of zzso in zzso zzso cells, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, several important zzso protein zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso experienced degradation of various degrees in a zzso manner both at protein level and zzso level when cultured with zzso but the expression of total zzso showed no zzso It is concluded that zzso can inhibit the proliferation and induce zzso of zzso leukemia cells possibly by zzso the survival signaling pathways zzso and zzso zzso
