The present study was carried out to observe the protective effects of zzso protein on hydrogen zzso zzso injury in rat zzso cells zzso and to investigate the mechanisms of these protective effects at the cellular level, which could provide the experimental basis for future applications of zzso in the treatment of cardiovascular zzso Western zzso was used to measure the expression of zzso in cultured zzso cells in zzso A zzso zzso expression zzso zzso was constructed to zzso zzso cells for the establishment of cells that zzso expressed zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to measure changes in the viability of the zzso cells at 1, 2, 3 and 4 h after induced by 150 zzso zzso to establish a model of zzso injury to zzso zzso was applied to zzso cells that were zzso zzso with zzso and the effect of zzso zzso on the viability of zzso cells subjected to zzso injury was measured by the zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso on the zzso injury of zzso cells was also analyzed by flow zzso The zzso components and zzso components of zzso cells were zzso and western zzso was used to measure the effect of zzso zzso on the release of zzso c from the zzso Western zzso was also used to measure the effect of zzso zzso on the expression of the zzso protein zzso and components of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso expression zzso zzso successfully zzso zzso cells, and zzso cells that were zzso zzso with zzso were established after zzso zzso The zzso carried out by western zzso showed that zzso proteins are expressed in normal zzso cells, but the zzso expression was much higher in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed that 4 h of zzso treatment induced significant injury in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso but zzso zzso can effectively antagonize the zzso injury to zzso cells zzso zzso zzso The results of flow zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso can significantly reduce zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso The results of western zzso showed that zzso zzso in zzso cells can reduce the zzso release of zzso c from the zzso zzso zzso zzso antagonize the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnify the decrease in zzso zzso levels induced by zzso injury zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso has a protective effect on zzso zzso cells, and zzso can play a protective role by reducing zzso reducing the release of zzso c from the zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso zzso The protective effects of zzso may be related to the zzso zzso
