zzso clearance of zzso cells is essential for tissue zzso allowing for cellular turnover without inflammatory zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in two aspects of zzso cell clearance by acting as a zzso for zzso a zzso zzso protein that bridges zzso and viable zzso First, zzso acts in a bona fide zzso zzso in concert with zzso zzso by regulating zzso zzso and second, it acts as a negative regulator for inflammation by zzso zzso signals zzso from bacterial zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso and hence zzso zzso immune zzso by zzso zzso Here we describe zzso zzso events that govern zzso and zzso signaling are principally zzso by zzso site zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso and pharmacological zzso we show that zzso is required for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso their zzso in turn elicits protein zzso zzso signals that act on the zzso zzso Although zzso blocked the zzso zzso of zzso on zzso and zzso and also zzso the zzso of zzso cells, this zzso did not suppress zzso zzso transcription, nor was zzso zzso dependent on the protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso Finally, unlike the zzso events associated with zzso zzso the zzso of zzso occurred in a zzso fashion independent of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso has distinct and zzso effects for zzso and for resolving zzso providing a molecular rationale for how immune licensing and inflammation can be zzso from zzso in a single zzso zzso
