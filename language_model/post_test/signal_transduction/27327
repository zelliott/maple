zzso zzso is a major mechanism in the regulation of protein zzso In zzso zzso several zzso II zzso including the major antenna zzso complex II and several core complex zzso are zzso zzso depending on the zzso state of the electron zzso A previously unknown zzso zzso event has recently been described on the zzso zzso which leads to zzso changes and protection from cold stress zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we have identified the zzso site on the zzso zzso domain, showing that it is located in a sequence not zzso to the other members of the zzso zzso The zzso sequence is unique in zzso zzso since it meets the requirements for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The possibility that this zzso is involved in a signal zzso zzso is zzso
