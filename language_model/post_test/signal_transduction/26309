zzso zzso abnormalities of the zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso in the corpus zzso are thought to be the main factors involved in the zzso of zzso zzso dysfunction zzso Recent studies have shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in diabetic zzso zzso 

zzso The aim of this study is to determine whether zzso of the zzso zzso is involved in diabetic zzso zzso dysfunction and abnormalities of the zzso zzso 

Male zzso rats were randomly divided into three groups: zzso controls, diabetic controls zzso and the zzso zzso a zzso zzso diabetic group zzso Diabetes was induced by zzso injection of zzso Eight weeks after inducing diabetes, the zzso group was treated with zzso for 4 zzso 

zzso function was assessed at 12 weeks after inducing diabetes by stimulating the cavernous zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso were evaluated by Western zzso zzso NO generation and zzso levels were also zzso 

The zzso group showed impaired zzso function and significantly increased zzso zzso zzso of total zzso and zzso zzso and zzso decreased significantly in the zzso group compared with those in the control zzso In addition, cavernous NO generation and zzso levels decreased significantly in the zzso group compared with those in the control zzso Treatment with zzso restored zzso function and significantly reversed all molecular zzso except decreased zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso in the corpus zzso of diabetic rats was involved in zzso zzso dysfunction and abnormalities of the zzso zzso resulting in zzso These findings may be applied to develop novel therapies for patients with diabetic zzso
