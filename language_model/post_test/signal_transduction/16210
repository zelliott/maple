zzso is a novel zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso and other zzso In this study, we have examined its activity as an zzso zzso 

The in zzso effect of zzso on rat and human zzso was assessed using proliferation zzso and Western zzso The in zzso zzso efficacy of zzso was assessed in mice with liver zzso induced by zzso and zzso duct zzso zzso 

zzso inhibited zzso migration, and zzso filament formation, as well as the expression of zzso and collagen in activated zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso which was correlated with reduced zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso of zzso as well as increased expression of zzso and zzso zzso also induced cell cycle arrest, accompanied by increased expression of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso not only inhibited zzso of zzso but also zzso through zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in human zzso were inhibited by zzso In zzso zzso reduced collagen deposition and zzso expression in zzso and zzso zzso These beneficial effects were associated with suppressed expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso could induce zzso undergoing zzso in zzso which was correlated with zzso of zzso We also observed reduced expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition to its zzso activity, the drug was zzso and reduced the zzso of zzso and zzso after zzso and zzso 

These studies uncover a novel role of zzso activity in treatment of liver zzso through multiple mechanisms and indicate that zzso represents a potentially effective zzso zzso
