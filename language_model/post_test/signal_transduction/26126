The zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso pathways are master regulators of zzso and tissue renewal and represent zzso therapeutic zzso Using zzso zzso interference screening in zzso cultured cells, we established previously unknown associations between these signaling pathways and genes linked to zzso zzso diseases of premature tissue zzso and zzso We identified functions in both pathways for the multitasking zzso zzso (also known as zzso a tumor zzso implicated in lung and cervical zzso We found that zzso loss resulted in zzso of the primary zzso a cellular organizing center for zzso zzso zzso thus zzso zzso zzso Loss of zzso also induced zzso signaling through the zzso zzso zzso that targeted the zzso zzso zzso or that restored primary zzso length by zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6) countered zzso zzso activities driven by zzso zzso Our study demonstrates that zzso is a critical zzso in both the zzso and the zzso zzso and our approach provides a platform to support the development of targeted therapeutic zzso
