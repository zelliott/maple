The zzso zzso task has been used in many studies to investigate the neural mechanisms that zzso the decision to execute or restrain rapid eye zzso In this task, the presentation of a zzso target is sometimes followed by the appearance of a stop cue that indicates that the subject should cancel the planned zzso Performance has been modeled as a race between motor preparation and cancellation zzso The signal that reaches its zzso threshold first determines whether a zzso is generated or zzso In these studies, an important zzso is the time required to process the stop zzso referred to as the stop signal reaction time zzso The zzso is estimated using statistical approaches, the zzso of which has not been unequivocally zzso A more direct measure of this zzso might be zzso if a method was available to zzso the developing motor zzso This can be accomplished by zzso zzso which inhibit zzso zzso zzso that serve as an zzso gate for the zzso zzso In the present study, brief zzso of air were used to elicit blinks at various times while zzso monkeys performed a zzso zzso zzso If the developing motor command has not yet been zzso this should trigger a zzso When blinks occurred between approximately 50 and 200 zzso after target zzso zzso were often zzso zzso were rarely evoked more than approximately 70 zzso after stop cue zzso this value represents a behavioral evaluation of zzso and was comparable to the estimates obtained using standard statistical zzso When zzso occurred near the zzso on zzso trials, they were often zzso Furthermore, zzso Carlo simulations were performed to model the effects of zzso time on the race zzso Overall, the study supports the zzso of the statistical methods currently in zzso
