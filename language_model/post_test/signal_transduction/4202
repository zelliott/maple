Recent studies indicate that there may be functional zzso of the zzso complex and suggest that the zzso complex is composed of two parallel zzso units, one made of gamma delta zzso chains and the other of zzso zzso To zzso the molecular mechanisms that may explain the functional zzso of zzso and zzso we have analyzed their expression by using flow zzso as well as zzso means both before and after stimulation with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B, and zzso We present evidence that zzso physically zzso from zzso after stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso resulted in zzso of zzso within 45 zzso whereas zzso zzso was still expressed on the cell surface as detected by flow zzso However, the cell surface expression of zzso and zzso was not affected when cells were zzso with zzso under the same zzso In the case of zzso treatment of T cells, the zzso zzso appeared to be due to the zzso of zzso as determined by zzso zzso zzso analysis of cells after stimulation with either zzso or zzso zzso revealed that the overall protein levels of zzso and zzso were zzso More interestingly, the zzso of the zzso complex was observed with both treatments and occurred in a manner that the zzso and the associated zzso chain zzso as a unit from zzso These results provide the first report of physical zzso of zzso and zzso after stimulation through the zzso zzso The results also suggest that the signal zzso zzso triggered by zzso may differ from that induced by zzso
