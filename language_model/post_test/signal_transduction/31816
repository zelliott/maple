To explore the zzso tissue zzso mechanism of zzso and its possible zzso role in insulin zzso 

Male zzso rats were zzso to receive a normal diet (N group), a high-fat insulin zzso diet zzso group), or a high-fat diet plus treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso tolerance and insulin resistance were tested at weeks 10 and 11 after starting the diet and, at week 12, zzso liver and skeletal muscle tissue samples were zzso zzso cells were cultured with zzso acid zzso zzso and PA plus zzso and zzso interference was used to zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 in these zzso The zzso and protein levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and 2 and zzso of zzso zzso were measured in the zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso in zzso tissue and zzso in liver tissue were significantly decreased in the zzso group compared with the N zzso zzso and zzso were significantly increased and insulin resistance significantly decreased in the P group versus the zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso levels and zzso zzso decreased significantly when PA was zzso zzso but were elevated by zzso Small interfering zzso confirmed zzso zzso in liver was regulated by zzso 

zzso prevented insulin resistance in rats fed a high-fat zzso Liver zzso zzso zzso is important in the zzso effect of zzso on insulin zzso
