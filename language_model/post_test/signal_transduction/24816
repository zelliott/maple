Development of the zzso limb bud depends on zzso interactions between the zone of polarizing activity zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso Sonic zzso zzso and zzso growth factors zzso are key zzso molecules produced in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso suggested that zzso expression in the zzso is maintained by zzso expression in the zzso and vice versa, providing a molecular mechanism for zzso the activities of these two zzso zzso This zzso feedback loop model is supported by genetic evidence showing that zzso expression is not maintained in zzso mouse zzso We report here that zzso expression is maintained and limb formation is normal when zzso is zzso in mouse zzso thus contradicting the zzso We also found that maintenance of zzso and zzso expression is dependent on zzso whereas zzso expression is zzso We discuss a model in which no individual zzso expressed in the zzso zzso is solely necessary to maintain zzso zzso but, instead, the combined activities of two or more zzso function in a positive feedback loop with zzso to control limb zzso
