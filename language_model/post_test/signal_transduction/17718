The zzso zzso signaling complex identified previously in zzso smooth muscle zzso contains a number of zzso zzso zzso termed zzso through zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified as zzso zzso I zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso showed that these proteins were zzso zzso products of zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso signaling complex contained following additional zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as verified by zzso as well as zzso sequencing and immune zzso The complex of these six proteins was immune zzso by zzso to each zzso The proteins were zzso by the zzso zzso zzso I with the exception of zzso and zzso zzso The complex did not contain the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso after expression in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may have additional functions to regulate the activity of zzso zzso
