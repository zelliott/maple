zzso stress increases the release of zzso oxide zzso by zzso cells zzso We and others have provided evidence that zzso NO zzso zzso zzso to the vessel zzso We therefore hypothesized that previous exposure to zzso stress would inhibit zzso zzso for zzso by virtue of its effect to increase NO zzso 

zzso zzso of bovine zzso zzso cells, human zzso zzso cells, or human zzso zzso cells were exposed to zzso fluid zzso Culture media were collected for measurement of NO (by zzso and the zzso zzso zzso F1 zzso zzso and zzso F1 alpha accumulated in the zzso medium during zzso fluid flow from 30 minutes to 24 hours in a zzso zzso In another set of studies, zzso previously exposed to flow or to zzso conditions were washed with zzso buffer and exposed to zzso cells for 30 zzso zzso cells were counted by zzso Previous exposure to flow reduced zzso zzso for zzso by 50% zzso zzso zzso The effect of flow on zzso zzso occurred within 30 zzso This effect was zzso by zzso (an zzso of NO zzso as well as by zzso zzso (an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the effects of these zzso were reversed by the NO donor zzso Although the zzso inhibitor zzso totally inhibited the zzso production of zzso by zzso it minimally affected adherence of zzso zzso The early effect of flow on zzso zzso was not zzso by zzso in the expression of the zzso zzso molecules zzso or zzso as assessed by fluorescent activated cell zzso 

zzso stress alters zzso zzso for zzso at early time points, this effect is largely due to zzso release of NO and, to a lesser extent, zzso This effect of flow occurs within 30 minutes and is probably due to zzso in the signal zzso or zzso state (rather than the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
