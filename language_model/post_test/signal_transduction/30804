We recently showed that resistance exercise and zzso of essential zzso acids with zzso zzso can independently stimulate zzso target of zzso zzso signaling and muscle protein synthesis in zzso Providing an zzso solution zzso can further increase muscle protein zzso zzso we hypothesized that enhanced zzso signaling might be responsible for the greater muscle protein synthesis when zzso zzso are zzso during zzso zzso Sixteen male subjects were zzso to one of two groups zzso or zzso The zzso group zzso the zzso solution 1 h after resistance zzso zzso signaling was assessed by zzso from repeated muscle biopsy zzso Mixed muscle fractional synthetic rate zzso was measured using stable isotope zzso Muscle protein synthesis and zzso zzso during exercise were significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was elevated above baseline in both groups at 1 h but was even further elevated in the zzso group at 2 h zzso zzso zzso zzso Increased zzso was associated with enhanced zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was elevated at 1 h and returned to baseline by 2 h in the control group, but it remained elevated in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso returned to baseline during recovery in control but became elevated when zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased at 1 and 2 h zzso to a similar extent in both groups zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that enhanced zzso of the zzso signaling zzso is playing a role in the greater synthesis of muscle proteins when resistance exercise is followed by zzso zzso
