zzso of vascular smooth muscle cells zzso is zzso to be one of the key events in the zzso of zzso and zzso We investigated whether zzso a zzso weight, zzso compound, could zzso proliferation of zzso in zzso and zzso after balloon zzso in zzso We examined the effect of zzso on zzso zzso proliferation by zzso incorporation zzso The data demonstrated that zzso inhibited zzso proliferation in a zzso zzso To define the mechanisms of zzso action, we found that zzso showed a profound zzso on zzso Ras and zzso activities by using Western zzso zzso Furthermore, oral administration of zzso exhibited a marked reduction in zzso thickness using the carotid injury model in zzso Using zzso zzso our experiments also revealed that zzso significantly suppressed expression of the zzso zzso and markedly inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso proliferation in a zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso growth via the zzso and zzso signaling zzso Moreover, zzso also shows a zzso potential in the treatment of zzso and zzso after vascular zzso
