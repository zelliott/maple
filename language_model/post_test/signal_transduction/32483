zzso of the zzso stimulus in plants is thought to entail binding of the hormone to a soluble zzso protein zzso outside the cell and subsequent interaction between this zzso complex and an integral membrane zzso zzso protein that couples the signal across the plasma zzso To explore the structural requirements for zzso function, synthetic peptides were prepared to the zzso acid sequences of the predicted surface zzso of zzso the dominant zzso from zzso Biological function was zzso under zzso zzso monitoring the ability of the peptides to evoke zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso channel activities of zzso guard cells in the absence of added zzso Only the zzso corresponding to the zzso domain of zzso was zzso The dominant response was an zzso of zzso although the zzso also evoked an zzso of zzso zzso of zzso was complete within zzso s and was fully zzso was marked by a slowing of zzso zzso and zzso and was dependent on zzso concentration zzso 16 zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso had no effect on zzso response to the zzso However, virtually complete and zzso block of the response was achieved when zzso pH zzso was brought under experimental control using the weak acid zzso Parallel zzso of zzso using the fluorescent dye zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso evoked rapid and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso unit and confirmed the antagonism of the zzso response in the presence of zzso zzso and comparable results with the zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso acid, zzso the zzso domain of zzso in zzso zzso to zzso and an associated zzso signaling zzso
