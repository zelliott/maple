zzso patients present with zzso zzso T cells in the zzso We find that a subset of primary zzso T cells, expressing high levels of the related zzso zzso zzso can zzso in zzso These cells zzso zzso as zzso T zzso provide a unique model in which the contribution of zzso to zzso responses can be explored in a zzso zzso zzso zzso responses, such as zzso zzso of cellular zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as calcium zzso which are defective in T cells expressing neither zzso nor zzso are observed in zzso T zzso However, zzso T cells differ from control T cells with respect to the T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and recruitment of the zzso and zzso stress-related zzso pathways are zzso This distinct zzso of zzso T cells is associated with a profound decrease in zzso zzso 2 zzso and proliferation relative to control T zzso Thus, zzso and zzso appear to play distinct roles in zzso a zzso zzso
