zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso several steroids involved in hormonal signaling including zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso and zzso a precursor for sex zzso Previous studies have suggested that zzso metabolism involving zzso or zzso may play an important role for zzso zzso zzso zzso However, conflicting data are reported regarding the influence of different zzso steroids on zzso zzso beta zzso In the present study, we investigated zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and human kidney zzso As part of these studies, we compared the effects of zzso (a zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso on zzso zzso beta zzso The data obtained indicated that zzso is a more efficient zzso thus lending support to the notion that zzso zzso may decrease zzso zzso beta zzso Our data on metabolism indicate that the efficiencies of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso are very zzso The zzso zzso both reactions at a similar rate and the zzso values were in the same order of zzso A high zzso ratio in the incubation zzso similar to the ratio of these steroids in many human zzso strongly suppressed zzso zzso zzso As the efficiencies of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso are similar, we propose that varying steroid zzso may be the most important factor determining the rate of zzso metabolism of zzso or zzso zzso zzso steroid zzso may have a strong impact on zzso zzso and thus on the levels of different zzso steroids that can influence zzso zzso beta zzso
