zzso dysfunction is common in diabetes, and several studies indicate that loss of zzso zzso zzso may play an important role in its zzso However, the mechanisms responsible for this effect remain largely zzso We have previously shown that advanced zzso zzso zzso formed by zzso zzso dependent zzso can inhibit the expression of zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso in zzso acting via their zzso zzso for zzso We now hypothesized that this effect may also be important in experimental diabetes in zzso We aimed to evaluate the role of zzso on zzso zzso expression and the effects of zzso (a drug that prevents zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in experimental zzso zzso induced diabetic rats were zzso to no treatment, treatment with zzso (1 g zzso daily through drinking water) at the induction of diabetes, or treatment with zzso (3 zzso zzso zzso beginning at week zzso A fourth group was used as healthy zzso We performed real time zzso chain reaction, Western zzso and zzso to detect zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso using sandwich zzso Diabetes enhanced zzso of zzso in serum, an effect that was prevented by treatment with zzso and zzso Further, diabetic rats showed a significant reduction in zzso zzso expression by zzso protein and zzso an effect that was prevented by zzso zzso had similar effects on zzso protein and zzso (but not on zzso zzso The generation of zzso in diabetes results in loss of zzso zzso expression and may be responsible for enteric dysfunction in this zzso This study suggests that treatment directed against zzso may be useful for the treatment of gastrointestinal complications of zzso
