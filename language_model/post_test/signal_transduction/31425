The zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso are zzso signaling pathways that play a pivotal role in many essential cellular processes such as proliferation and zzso These zzso are activated by a large variety of stimuli and display a high degree of zzso So far, seven zzso zzso have been zzso in mice leading to the discovery of their important functions in development and zzso As we could expect because of their multiple and specific properties in zzso knockout zzso of zzso pathways leads to distinct zzso in zzso Surprisingly, into a given zzso zzso of the various zzso assign specific zzso biological functions to each zzso without compensation by the zzso These results emphasize the notion that, although initiated by the same external zzso these zzso zzso activate zzso zzso each with its own specific zzso
