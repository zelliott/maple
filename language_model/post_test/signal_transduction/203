zzso stem cells are zzso cells able to differentiate into different zzso zzso Studies in the past had suggested that two of these zzso differentiation directions, the zzso and the zzso zzso are zzso regulated by the zzso factor zzso Although zzso differentiation has been extensively zzso the influence of zzso on this differentiation lineage was not subject of detailed analyses in the zzso We have analyzed the consequences of zzso treatment and genetic manipulation of the zzso zzso for zzso differentiation of zzso Treatment of zzso during differentiation with zzso activates zzso and this results in enhanced expression of zzso proteins like bone zzso zzso zzso and alkaline zzso zzso In addition, enhanced zzso zzso was zzso The direct contribution of the zzso zzso was confirmed in cells that express a zzso active version of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso results in the enhancement of zzso and zzso zzso two critical regulators of the zzso differentiation zzso Interestingly, a genetic block of the zzso zzso did not interfere with zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso zzso although not absolutely required for zzso expression and zzso zzso nevertheless supports zzso differentiation and zzso zzso by increasing zzso zzso Our results therefore suggest that zzso zzso may function in lineage selection during differentiation of zzso by zzso zzso differentiation at the expense of other differentiation zzso
