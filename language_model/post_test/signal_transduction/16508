zzso mortality and abnormal zzso zzso have been reported by most researchers studying nuclear transfer zzso and it now is accepted that zzso anomalies and poor development of cloned zzso are zzso As early as day 50 of zzso cloned bovine zzso exhibit poor structural organization of the developing zzso These experiments were designed to identify zzso in zzso interactions during establishment of the zzso of zzso zzso at day 30 of zzso zzso zzso zzso were produced using cultured zzso cells from a single zzso donor zzso and control zzso were derived from in zzso zzso zzso Following in zzso culture in zzso sheep zzso zzso zzso were transferred to synchronized recipient zzso zzso recovered from viable zzso zzso were analyzed by real-time zzso zzso and quantitative zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso tissue from zzso and zzso zzso revealed no significant differences in expression of the zzso zzso zzso collagen type IV and zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that altered expression of these proteins at day 30 of gestation is not a primary cause of abnormal zzso structure in cloned zzso Percentage of zzso cells zzso within the zzso also was similar in zzso and zzso zzso however, expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso transcript was elevated in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that regulation of zzso zzso was altered in cloned zzso zzso zzso suggesting the presence of irregular zzso signaling patterns that might undermine continued development of zzso zzso
