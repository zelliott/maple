zzso cells zzso lining blood vessels have a variety of functions and play a critical role in the zzso of the circulatory zzso It has become clear that zzso forces generated by blood flow regulate zzso zzso zzso are in direct contact with blood flow and exposed to zzso stress, a zzso force generated by flowing zzso A number of recent studies have revealed that zzso recognize changes in zzso stress and transmit signals to the interior of the cell, which leads to cell responses that involve changes in cell zzso cell function, and gene zzso These zzso responses to zzso stress are thought to play important roles in blood zzso phenomena such as vascular tone control, zzso vascular zzso and zzso Much research has been done on zzso stress sensing and signal zzso and their molecular mechanisms are gradually becoming zzso However, much remains uncertain, and many candidates have been proposed for zzso stress zzso More extensive studies of vascular zzso should increase our understanding of the molecular basis of the blood zzso control of vascular zzso
