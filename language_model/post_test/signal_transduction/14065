zzso zzso is a primary response to cellular stresses including DNA damaging agents zzso zzso zzso and is widely believed to be caused by continuous zzso signaling in the presence of cell cycle zzso Studies of signal zzso pathways leading to accelerated zzso have revealed that zzso of zzso target of zzso zzso by zzso zzso cells from zzso However, the molecular mechanisms upstream of zzso following zzso radiation zzso are not well zzso We investigated signal zzso leading to zzso accelerated zzso in human pulmonary artery zzso cells zzso Exposure of zzso to zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso markers including zzso zzso and zzso beta zzso zzso zzso (a zzso zzso zzso or zzso (an zzso zzso blocked the induction of cellular zzso markers suggesting roles for zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed increased zzso of zzso growth factor I zzso a zzso of cell growth and proliferation upstream of zzso zzso confirmed that both IGF-1 and zzso zzso were increased in response to X-rays, and zzso showed increased zzso of IGF-1 protein into the medium of zzso zzso zzso with zzso of these zzso we found that X-ray exposure led to zzso of zzso the zzso for IGF-1 and zzso Treatment with zzso an zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso Together these findings suggest that zzso is a key regulator of zzso accelerated zzso in a zzso that requires intact zzso activity upstream of both zzso and zzso
