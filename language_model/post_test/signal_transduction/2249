To investigate whether G zzso zzso zzso zzso are involved in the regulation of the zzso we have established zzso zzso cells which zzso zzso zzso zzso a dominant negative form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Acute zzso or zzso 2 zzso incubation with zzso zzso induced significantly less (by up to zzso zzso of the zzso in beta zzso zzso zzso cells than observed in zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso for 2 h induced zzso zzso zzso to a second challenge with zzso while the effect was blunted by up to zzso in beta zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso of beta zzso (or a closely related zzso is a critical component of the acute phase zzso or zzso 2 zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso
