The zzso plays a fundamental role in cell division, cell zzso and cell cycle zzso zzso zzso is mainly controlled by zzso zzso 2 zzso E and zzso A complexes, which are inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso It is thought that abnormal zzso of zzso zzso zzso amplification that is frequently observed in a wide range of aggressive zzso We previously reported that zzso of the zzso zzso leads to zzso amplification after DNA damage in zzso zzso We here show that zzso amplification after zzso was caused by suppression of zzso expression in zzso zzso We further show that zzso and zzso mouse embryonic zzso and zzso human cells exhibited a significant increase in zzso amplification after DNA zzso Moreover, abnormal zzso cells with amplified zzso were frequently observed in zzso zzso In response to DNA damage, the level of zzso gradually increased in normal cells independently of the zzso zzso zzso pathway, whereas zzso an zzso protein component of an zzso zzso zzso complex that targets zzso was zzso Additionally, zzso levels in zzso cells were restored by treatment with zzso small interfering zzso indicating that zzso of zzso by zzso was due to high expression of zzso These results suggest that the zzso of zzso after DNA damage is required for suppression of zzso amplification, thereby preventing zzso zzso
