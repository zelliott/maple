Present studies determined the roles of the zzso zzso versus the zzso zzso pathways in the zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso in the internal zzso zzso zzso zzso Studies were performed in the rat zzso versus the zzso zzso smooth muscle zzso zzso the dual zzso zzso but not zzso acid zzso the zzso zzso produced a precipitous decrease in the zzso zzso However, when added in the background of zzso zzso caused significant reversal of the zzso zzso These zzso had no significant effect on the zzso To follow the significance of zzso versus zzso zzso we examined the effects of AA and its zzso In the zzso AA caused an increase in the zzso tone zzso and zzso In the zzso AA was significantly less zzso and potent zzso and zzso The AA zzso (via zzso zzso and zzso (a stable analog of zzso zzso produced increases in the zzso tone and force in the zzso zzso AA zzso (via zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso C4 decreased the zzso zzso Finally, the zzso effects of AA in the zzso were selectively attenuated by the zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso the specific effects of AA and the zzso zzso the Western zzso and zzso analyses showing specifically higher levels of zzso suggest a preferential role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso versus the zzso in the regulation of the zzso zzso
