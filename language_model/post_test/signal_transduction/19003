Gene expression during the early stages of fiber cell development and in zzso crops is poorly zzso Here we report zzso and expression analyses of 32 zzso high-quality zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso Texas zzso zzso immature zzso zzso The zzso were assembled into zzso unique sequences including zzso tentative consensus sequences zzso and zzso zzso representing approximately zzso of the unique sequences in the cotton zzso zzso Compared with approximately 178 zzso existing zzso derived from zzso fibers and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a significant increase in the percentage of genes zzso putative zzso factors such as zzso and zzso and genes zzso predicted proteins involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso signaling zzso Cotton zzso related to zzso zzso zzso and eight genes in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso pathways were induced during fiber cell initiation but zzso in the naked seed zzso zzso that is impaired in fiber zzso The data agree with the known roles of zzso and zzso zzso factors in zzso leaf zzso development and the well-documented zzso effects on fiber cell development in immature cotton zzso cultured in zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso genes were induced prior to the zzso of zzso zzso suggesting an important role of zzso in cell fate zzso zzso AA zzso zzso of all functional zzso including zzso control and zzso factor activity were selectively enriched in zzso zzso zzso an zzso derived from zzso between AA and zzso zzso species, a result consistent with the production of long zzso fibers in AA zzso zzso These results suggest general roles for zzso zzso and zzso gene regulation during the early stages of fiber cell development in cotton zzso
