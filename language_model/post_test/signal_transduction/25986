Giant cell zzso is a zzso zzso of the zzso and its branches that causes blindness, stroke, and zzso zzso zzso T cells are key zzso regulators, instructed by vessel wall zzso cells to differentiate into zzso T zzso The unique pathways driving this zzso zzso interaction are incompletely zzso but may provide novel therapeutic targets for a disease in which the only established therapy is long-term treatment with high doses of zzso 

zzso and gene expression analyses of giant cell zzso zzso arteries revealed abundant expression of the zzso zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain in zzso T cells indicated ongoing zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso did not occur in zzso zzso affecting branches of the zzso zzso zzso We devised 2 strategies to block zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor treatment, preventing nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso domain, and competing for zzso interactions through excess soluble zzso zzso In a humanized mouse model, zzso zzso disruption had strong zzso effects, zzso zzso zzso in the early and established zzso of vascular zzso zzso zzso was particularly effective in zzso zzso responses, but also markedly suppressed zzso zzso 

zzso zzso signaling depleted T cells from the vascular zzso implicating zzso zzso zzso interactions in regulating zzso retention and survival in vessel wall zzso zzso the zzso signaling cascade emerges as a promising new strategy for zzso therapy of zzso zzso
