zzso a widely used zzso zzso of zzso G zzso has been reported to be a potent zzso for Swiss zzso zzso However, we have previously shown that the zzso promotes the release of zzso zzso from Swiss zzso cells and evokes only a modest and delayed increase in zzso We suggested that the ability of the zzso to zzso these cells may account for its zzso zzso Here we show that zzso caused a rapid release of zzso from cells which had been zzso with zzso zzso indicating that the zzso increases membrane zzso to small zzso Furthermore, the release of zzso zzso evoked by zzso was lost after prolonged (24 zzso incubation of cells with the zzso Together, these data indicate that zzso cell zzso is both rapid and zzso We have also shown that zzso increased zzso zzso zzso and that this response was not influenced by zzso toxin or zzso Although zzso increased the zzso calcium zzso the removal of zzso calcium had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These data show that zzso zzso zzso zzso is not zzso by zzso of a G protein and subsequent zzso of zzso D nor by a zzso increase in calcium zzso The data have significance for the interpretation of studies in which zzso is, or has been, used as an zzso of zzso
