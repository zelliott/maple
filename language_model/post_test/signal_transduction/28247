zzso zzso is produced by zzso infected cells and is believed to play an important role in early zzso of the innate immune zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling in B cells and zzso suggesting that zzso (like zzso is a zzso zzso Here, we study zzso between zzso and zzso in human T zzso As expected, stimulation with zzso for zzso h zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, however, zzso has the opposite effect on zzso signaling at earlier time points (up to 6 zzso Thus, zzso enhances zzso zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso human T zzso The effect is specific because zzso another zzso zzso does not enhance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is not modulated by zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso is not enhanced or prolonged by simultaneous stimulation with zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso results in a selective increased zzso association and an association between zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso provides an additional zzso zzso site via zzso leading to a more efficient zzso of zzso zzso The zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso with a cooperative increase in nuclear zzso DNA zzso zzso activity, and zzso expression of zzso target genes zzso and zzso In conclusion, we provide evidence that zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling and thereby regulates the sensitivity to zzso in human T zzso Thus, our findings suggest that zzso has a complex regulatory role in zzso zzso which is different from the zzso zzso profile of zzso
