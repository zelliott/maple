Early cardiovascular changes evoked by pressure overload zzso may reveal zzso strategies that allow immediate survival to the increased zzso zzso In this study, zzso and zzso zzso cycling was analyzed in left zzso rat zzso before zzso 2, zzso zzso and after zzso 7, zzso zzso development of zzso subsequent to zzso zzso as well as in zzso from zzso zzso rats zzso zzso zzso transient zzso was significantly zzso in the zzso zzso In the zzso group, zzso zzso concentration zzso was reduced during zzso and mechanical zzso relaxation (but not zzso zzso was zzso In PO groups, fractional zzso zzso zzso zzso release at a zzso zzso zzso content, zzso zzso loss during zzso and zzso integrated zzso flux during zzso relaxation were significantly greater than in zzso groups, whereas the zzso zzso flux carried by the zzso zzso was not significantly zzso In the zzso group, zzso levels of cardiac zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not significantly altered, but the zzso ratio was increased zzso Moreover, greater sensitivity to the zzso effects of the zzso zzso zzso was observed in the zzso zzso The results indicate enhanced zzso cycling between zzso and zzso early after PO zzso even before zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso may contribute to enhancement of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso content and zzso and protection against zzso due to buildup of zzso during zzso
