During the development of liver fibrosis, zzso are produced that stimulate cells in the liver to differentiate into zzso and to produce zzso Recent studies demonstrated that the zzso factor, zzso zzso zzso is critical for zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso growth zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the liver, during the development of zzso What remains unknown is the cell zzso regulation of these genes by zzso in liver cell zzso zzso the hypothesis was tested that zzso is activated in hypoxic zzso and regulates the production of zzso zzso by these zzso 

In this study, zzso were isolated from the zzso of control and zzso or zzso mice and exposed to zzso 

Exposure of primary mouse zzso to zzso oxygen zzso nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso zzso vascular zzso cell growth factor and the zzso peptides zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, the levels of zzso and zzso zzso were unaffected in these cells by zzso Exposure of zzso zzso to zzso oxygen only partially prevented zzso of these zzso suggesting that other zzso zzso factors, such as zzso may also regulate these zzso In support of this, zzso was activated in hypoxic zzso and exposure of zzso zzso to zzso oxygen completely prevented zzso of zzso vascular zzso cell growth factor and zzso suggesting that zzso may also contribute to zzso of these genes in hypoxic zzso 

zzso our results suggest that zzso may be important regulators of zzso and zzso zzso by hypoxic zzso
