The zzso orphan zzso gene is induced directly by the steroid hormone zzso at the onset of zzso zzso zzso expression zzso in early zzso as the early puff genes are zzso and zzso is zzso Here we provide evidence that zzso directly contributes to both of these regulatory zzso zzso protein is bound to many zzso zzso in the zzso zzso including the early zzso that zzso the zzso and zzso regulatory zzso as well as the zzso zzso and zzso orphan zzso zzso Three zzso binding sites were identified downstream from the start site of zzso transcription, further indicating that this gene is a direct target of zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso revealed that the zzso zzso binding pattern is of functional zzso zzso is sufficient to repress zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as induce zzso zzso thus appears to function as a switch that defines the zzso transition by arresting the early regulatory response to zzso at zzso formation and zzso the induction of the zzso competence factor in zzso This study also provides evidence for direct zzso among orphan members of the nuclear zzso zzso and further implicates these genes as critical zzso of the hormonal signal during the onset of zzso zzso
