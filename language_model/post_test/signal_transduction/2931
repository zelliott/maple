The expression of death zzso 3 zzso a member of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso is zzso in human zzso zzso cells zzso during zzso injury, but its function in this setting remains zzso We used zzso to induce zzso injury in zzso zzso or zzso deficient zzso mice to examine the in zzso role of zzso zzso induced the expression of zzso its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso as observed in human zzso zzso zzso increased zzso death of zzso zzso by twofold compared with zzso zzso whereas it reduced the number of zzso expressing zzso by 50% at 72 zzso Similar degrees of induction of zzso zzso and zzso and changes in zzso and zzso were obtained in mouse kidney organ cultures treated with zzso for 3 hours, suggesting a direct effect on zzso zzso was implicated in zzso zzso zzso damage given that the in zzso zzso of zzso an inhibitor of zzso maturation and release, significantly reduced zzso production and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso whereas zzso reduced, zzso zzso in the zzso mouse zzso zzso cell line, zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso suggesting that this occurs by zzso zzso signals induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso may be beneficial in reducing acute kidney zzso
