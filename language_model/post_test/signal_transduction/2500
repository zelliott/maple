Our previous studies have shown that inflammatory zzso increase zzso zzso through a zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study is to delineate in more detail the signaling zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso zzso calcium and the apparent zzso zzso of zzso zzso were measured in isolated and zzso coronary zzso zzso zzso a rapid increase in zzso calcium followed by a transient zzso in zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso G zzso inhibitor zzso abolished the zzso but did not affect the calcium response to zzso Similarly, the calcium zzso zzso produced a calcium spike preceding zzso zzso zzso of the zzso cascade inhibited the increase in zzso whereas the zzso calcium was still elevated on administration of zzso Furthermore, the relationship between protein zzso C zzso and the zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso dramatically increased zzso Pa without significantly changing the zzso calcium zzso The selective zzso inhibitor zzso abolished the effect of zzso but did not alter the effect of zzso on zzso In contrast, both zzso and zzso were able to greatly zzso the increase in Pa caused by zzso These results suggest that 1) zzso of zzso zzso calcium is an early signaling event preceding zzso oxide zzso synthesis in the zzso of zzso zzso and 2) zzso of zzso may alter the zzso barrier function partially through the zzso of NO zzso
