Clear cell zzso is a clinically and zzso distinct entity among surface zzso zzso zzso recognized for its resistance to standard zzso chemotherapy at advanced stage disease and poor zzso Despite advances in our understanding of the biology of other surface zzso zzso zzso very little is known about the molecular genetic mechanisms that are involved in clear cell zzso Early zzso zzso zzso protein is a key cell cycle regulator, that promotes zzso and zzso entry by zzso the zzso promoting zzso In cell culture systems, zzso of zzso leads to zzso and zzso instability, especially in the absence of normal zzso zzso We investigated zzso protein expression in zzso zzso using a tissue zzso constructed from 339 primary zzso surface zzso zzso zzso clear cell, and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso tumors, germ cell tumors, and normal zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein was present in zzso zzso clear cell zzso including one borderline tumor in a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso pattern, independent of patient age, presence of zzso and/or pelvic zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, only zzso zzso primary zzso and primary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited significant zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso protein was not linked to zzso labeling index, but was directly correlated with zzso E and zzso correlated with zzso in clear cell zzso zzso zzso protein expression was present in mixed zzso cell tumors but absent in tumors with mixed zzso cell zzso These findings represent a potentially important insight into the molecular zzso underlying zzso zzso and provide a possible cell cycle model for the development and progression of zzso clear cell zzso
