For many years evidence has accumulated that zzso acids function in cellular interactions either by masking or as a recognition zzso However, receptors or zzso molecules zzso such functions between zzso cells were unknown until about 5 years ago, when it was found that the members of the zzso family mediate zzso of zzso to specific zzso through binding to zzso zzso like zzso zzso More recently, the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso molecules was defined within the zzso of zzso zzso So far, it has been shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso cell zzso protein zzso belong to this zzso In contrast to the zzso these proteins are associated with diverse biological zzso zzso zzso zzso development and zzso In this review their properties, zzso zzso and potential biological functions are zzso Finally, we provide perspectives with respect to the nature of zzso implications of zzso acid modifications and future zzso
