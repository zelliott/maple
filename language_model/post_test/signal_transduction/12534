Advanced zzso zzso zzso formation on the basement membrane of retinal zzso has been previously described but the impact of these zzso on zzso zzso cell function vascular repair remains zzso This investigation has evaluated retinal zzso zzso cells zzso growing on zzso zzso zzso and determined how this has an impact on zzso interactions and downstream zzso responses and cell zzso 

zzso were grown on zzso zzso zzso or native zzso as a zzso zzso attachment and spreading was zzso In a separate treatment, the zzso zzso had zzso zzso or scrambled zzso added before zzso zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was assessed and zzso zzso In a subset of zzso that remained attached to the zzso zzso the production of zzso zzso zzso was zzso using zzso zzso zzso or zzso in the presence or absence of zzso The specificity of the zzso zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso changes to zzso zzso key basement membrane proteins and regulatory zzso were investigated using real-time zzso 

zzso reduced zzso attachment and spreading when compared to zzso controls zzso zzso zzso enhanced cell attachment on zzso zzso while the scrambled zzso had no zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso was reduced in a zzso fashion, while zzso zzso became focal at the zzso zzso zzso induced zzso a response significantly prevented by zzso zzso zzso caused a significant increase in zzso zzso zzso and zzso production by zzso zzso while zzso also increased basement membrane associated zzso expression zzso 

zzso zzso modifications impair the function of retinal zzso zzso and their zzso potential in response to zzso zzso zzso modifications alter vital zzso cell interactions with the zzso This phenomenon could play an important role in dysfunction and zzso of retinal zzso during zzso
