zzso is a zzso protein found in three cell zzso the plasma zzso the zzso and the zzso The cell has developed elaborate ways of regulating the level and zzso of zzso to assure its specific function in each zzso One aspect of this regulation is inherent in the structural organization of zzso zzso most of its zzso motifs overlap so that interaction with one partner can block binding of another at the same zzso Using zzso zzso we found that zzso and zzso zzso zzso form mutually exclusive complexes with zzso the association of zzso with zzso was zzso out by the zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso and zzso zzso coli zzso formed separate, mutually exclusive complexes with zzso In zzso zzso cells, free zzso accumulated and was able to associate with zzso The absence of zzso in zzso embryonic stem zzso cells also led to an zzso of free zzso and its association with zzso thereby mimicking zzso zzso zzso zzso in these cells was antagonized by transient expression of zzso zzso but not of zzso lacking the zzso binding zzso The potent ability of zzso to recruit zzso to the cell membrane and prevent its nuclear zzso and zzso was also demonstrated using zzso colon zzso zzso
