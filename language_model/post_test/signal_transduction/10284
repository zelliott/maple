zzso a zzso zzso from the fruit zzso of zzso zzso has been shown to have zzso and zzso zzso To study its mechanism of action, we analyzed the effects of zzso and its zzso including zzso zzso and zzso on zzso acid metabolism and zzso oxide zzso synthesis in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as in three zzso cell zzso We also examined the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso NO zzso zzso and related upstream zzso At 1 zzso zzso and its zzso added 1 h after zzso zzso significantly inhibited the release of zzso acid and its zzso in zzso zzso was the most effective, showing zzso zzso Similar zzso activity was also observed in zzso cells, zzso zzso and zzso cells, showing zzso zzso by 1 zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso without altering its protein level, and the effect was related to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso and zzso expression only when it was added to the cells before zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso also significantly decreased zzso expression and NO release from zzso zzso this is probably due to the zzso of the signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso an upstream event in the zzso of zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso zzso acid metabolism by blocking the zzso of zzso and decreases zzso protein level by zzso zzso zzso These activities may contribute to the zzso and zzso actions of zzso and its zzso
