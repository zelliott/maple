zzso play an important role in the zzso between zzso activity and brain blood flow via their capacity to zzso zzso activity and transmit that information to zzso zzso Here we show another role for zzso in zzso zzso the ability to act as a signaling zzso for the vitally important process of upstream zzso zzso by zzso zzso during both excessive zzso and zzso zzso nerve zzso increases in cerebral cortical zzso zzso The predominance of an zzso rather than a vascular route was indicated by data showing that zzso zzso responses to zzso zzso were completely blocked following selective disruption of the superficial zzso zzso whereas interference with zzso signaling was without zzso zzso also revealed contributions from zzso 43, zzso a role for gap junctions and/or zzso in the signaling process and that signaling from the zzso zzso to zzso zzso may involve a zzso zzso
