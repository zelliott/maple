zzso A zzso a zzso zzso is associated with zzso zzso zzso implicated in zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso expression and stress responses in zzso involved zzso via scavenger receptors zzso since zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, block of zzso ameliorated zzso zzso zzso In contrast, block of zzso or the zzso for advanced zzso end products zzso did not prevent zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thus, manipulation of specific scavenger zzso zzso pathways may provide avenues for therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative diseases implicating zzso zzso with zzso zzso
