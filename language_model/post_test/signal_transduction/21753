This study presents an in-depth analysis of the zzso zzso zzso of various zzso strains of zzso coli zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the production of zzso Previously, a zzso network design that includes an active zzso zzso implemented in zzso increased zzso yield from zzso in an zzso coli zzso to zzso zzso under fully zzso zzso The design consists of a dual zzso synthesis route, which zzso required quantities of zzso through the traditional zzso zzso and zzso the carbon converted to zzso by balancing the carbon flux through the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso (which has a lower zzso zzso zzso strains previously constructed during the development of high-yield zzso strains were selected for further characterization to understand their zzso response as a result of several genetic zzso and to determine the significance of the zzso and the zzso pathways in the production of zzso Measured zzso obtained under batch zzso conditions were used to estimate zzso zzso and identify critical branch point flux split zzso The comparison of changes in branch point flux split ratios to the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso as a result of different zzso revealed the sensitivity of zzso yield to these zzso The most favorable split ratio to obtain the highest zzso yield was the fractional partition of zzso to zzso of zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso obtained in strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso yields achieved in these two strains were zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, an active zzso zzso in an zzso zzso zzso zzso strain is shown to be responsible for the high zzso yields achieved zzso Furthermore, in zzso activity zzso of seven crucial zzso involved in the pathways studied and zzso zzso of key intermediate zzso pools provided additional insights on the zzso zzso caused by these zzso The characterization of these zzso zzso strains in terms of flux distribution pattern, in zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso pools provides useful information for the rational modification of zzso zzso to improve zzso zzso
