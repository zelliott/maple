We have reported that zzso total zzso zzso inhibited the development of physical and psychological dependence on zzso However, the possible molecular mechanisms of zzso are zzso zzso this study was undertaken to understand the possible molecular mechanism of zzso on the zzso effects of zzso zzso It has been reported that the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of the mouse brain after repeated administration of zzso contributes to the feature of zzso zzso inhibited zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso after repeated administration of zzso in this zzso zzso inhibited zzso levels and protein expression of protein zzso A zzso In addition, zzso inhibited the increase of zzso response element binding protein zzso zzso zzso we conclude that the zzso effects of zzso on zzso dependence might be zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso
