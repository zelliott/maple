Plants interact with their environment and they often flower earlier under stress conditions, but how such zzso flowering is regulated remains poorly zzso Here evidence is presented that the zzso family plays a key role in zzso flowering in zzso The zzso zzso zzso family members are zzso in zzso zzso and soybean under zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso results in early zzso and zzso of the zzso target zzso zzso especially a zzso version of zzso results in late zzso The results suggest that the zzso family regulates zzso flowering by zzso the zzso zzso factor, which in turn reduces the expression of zzso zzso C zzso allowing for the expression of zzso target genes such as zzso zzso T zzso and zzso zzso to promote zzso It was shown that the expression of genes or zzso involved in the other flowering zzso namely the zzso zzso ambient temperature zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was not affected in zzso plants, suggesting that zzso early flowering is a novel zzso zzso zzso by zzso
