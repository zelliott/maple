zzso differentiation and zzso are complex processes involving multiple signaling zzso which convert a zzso zzso cell into an zzso rigid zzso Loss of attachment to the basement membrane triggers zzso zzso while in other zzso cells, detachment from the zzso zzso leads to rapid programmed cell death or zzso The potential role of zzso in providing a survival signal necessary for zzso and differentiation of primary human zzso was zzso zzso activity increased during zzso differentiation and was attributed to the specific zzso of zzso and zzso zzso reduction of zzso zzso but not zzso by zzso interference resulted in an abnormal zzso in zzso skin cultures with a thin zzso region and a pronounced but zzso zzso zzso This abnormal zzso was due to significant cell death in the zzso layers and was alleviated by zzso zzso zzso expression patterns of both early and late markers of zzso differentiation were also zzso producing a poorly developed stratum zzso
