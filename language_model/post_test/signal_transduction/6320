zzso zzso factor zzso one of the zzso factors acting in the central nervous system zzso prevents ordinary types of zzso cell death induced by various zzso On the other hand, an zzso of unfolded proteins in the zzso zzso zzso leads to zzso stress and then zzso zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso cell death is distinctive because the zzso activity plays a crucial role in the progression of cell zzso We previously showed that nerve growth factor zzso attenuated zzso zzso cell death in zzso zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso suppressed the zzso zzso cell death in zzso zzso cerebral cortical zzso An analysis using a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso prevented this cell death via the zzso signaling zzso We found that the number of zzso positive cells and the activity of zzso suppressed by zzso were increased by zzso We also discovered that zzso diminished the effect of zzso on the zzso of zzso indicating that zzso prevents zzso zzso cell death via a zzso mechanism by suppressing the zzso of zzso in cultured zzso zzso
