zzso changes in zzso gene expression are thought to play an important role in drug addiction and compulsive zzso In this study we report that zzso zzso the expression of the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso beta zzso in primary cultures of zzso zzso We identified the zzso zzso gene coding for substance P and zzso as a potential target gene of zzso We demonstrated that zzso physically interacts with an element of the zzso promoter, thereby zzso substance P precursor gene zzso The regulation of zzso gene by zzso could zzso many important zzso processes involving substance zzso such as zzso zzso inflammation and zzso Given that substance P is known to increase zzso zzso in the zzso and, in turn, zzso increases substance P expression in medium zzso zzso our results zzso zzso in a positive feedback loop, changes of which might contribute to the development of drug zzso
