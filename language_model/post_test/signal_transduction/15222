zzso signals associated with or triggered by zzso zzso can control cell survival, zzso zzso and zzso Despite accumulating evidence that zzso changes regulate zzso affinity to its zzso how zzso structure regulates signal transmission from the outside to the inside of the cell remains zzso Using zzso resonance energy transfer, we addressed whether zzso changes in zzso zzso are sufficient to transmit zzso signals in human zzso zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso occupancy or zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso triggered similar patterns of zzso protein zzso zzso including zzso zzso and inhibited spontaneous zzso zzso indicating that global zzso changes are critical for zzso zzso signal zzso In zzso and zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso or zzso zzso binding promoted zzso extension of the zzso zzso domain and separation of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso tails, two structural hallmarks of zzso zzso These data suggest the primacy of global zzso changes in the generation of zzso zzso zzso
