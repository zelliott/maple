A zzso block is imposed on zzso zzso at the zzso checkpoint in the absence of the zzso T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso Early surface expression of a transgenic zzso zzso has been shown to partially circumvent this block, such that zzso progress to the zzso zzso zzso We wanted to analyze whether a restricting zzso element is required for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to overcome the zzso block in zzso zzso We used the zzso zzso model that zzso zzso with zzso zzso expression in the zzso compartment but has the advantage of zzso expression levels, in contrast to conventional zzso zzso On a zzso background, this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso and enabled progression to later differentiation zzso On a zzso zzso background, however, zzso zzso mice presented a pronounced reduction in numbers of zzso and zzso when compared to animals of selecting zzso zzso showing that zzso restriction is necessary to drive zzso rescue of zzso zzso
