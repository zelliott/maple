The underlying mechanism and the therapeutic regimen for the transition of zzso zzso to irreversible zzso are zzso Since transforming growth factor zzso has been implicated in zzso regulated gene expression in zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso signaling is activated in zzso zzso along with enhanced collagen degradation, that is reversed by zzso zzso A novel three-dimensional zzso zzso system consisting of primary human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells in collagen gels was zzso zzso populations from patients with severe zzso zzso collagen gels, which was reduced by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes was evident in zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso downstream zzso zzso was highly zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results imply that zzso signaling is involved in zzso cell interaction in zzso and suggest that the zzso culture system is a useful in zzso model for therapeutic drug screening for zzso
