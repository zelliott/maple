We have recently identified a novel zzso of the vascular zzso growth factor zzso family termed zzso protein zzso which specifically binds to the zzso zzso To characterize the signaling events after zzso engagement of its zzso zzso in zzso cells, a population of human zzso zzso cells, termed zzso expressing high levels of zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso alone and in combination with the zzso zzso cell factor increased cell zzso zzso induced zzso zzso of various zzso including the zzso zzso Further characterization of these zzso zzso molecules revealed that zzso zzso and zzso form a complex with the activated zzso zzso zzso cells also expressed zzso a recently identified member of the focal zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and activated upon zzso treatment, and there was an enhanced association of this zzso with the zzso protein zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in growth zzso and shown to mediate zzso signaling in other cell types, was activated by zzso zzso We also observed that zzso treatment of zzso cells resulted in the zzso of the zzso protein zzso This treatment resulted in an increased association of zzso with zzso which was zzso by the zzso region of zzso These studies indicate that zzso stimulation induced the formation of a signaling complex at its activated zzso as well as zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso may facilitate signal zzso to the zzso and downstream to the zzso zzso in zzso blood zzso
