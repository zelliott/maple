zzso of zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso has been shown to mediate zzso growth during development and zzso zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso is well known to be the major mechanism by which zzso is zzso However, whether such regulatory mechanism of zzso zzso is used in zzso to control zzso growth has not been directly zzso Here by using zzso zzso mice, in which zzso is insensitive to zzso zzso we show that sensory zzso zzso normally in zzso and in zzso after peripheral zzso We also find that zzso in sensory zzso of the zzso mice is still zzso in response to peripheral zzso and such zzso is required for sensory zzso zzso Lastly, we provide evidence that zzso activity is zzso regulated by zzso signaling in the zzso mice upon peripheral zzso and the zzso zzso is functionally required for sensory zzso zzso Together, these results indicate that in response to peripheral nerve injury zzso zzso regulated by an alternative mechanism independent of zzso zzso controls sensory zzso zzso
