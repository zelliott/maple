zzso appear to be ideal sensors for regulating zzso zzso supply as they release the potent zzso zzso in an zzso zzso zzso Whether zzso play a significant role in regulating zzso supply in the complex environment of zzso zzso exchange among zzso zzso and zzso depends on the efficiency with which zzso signal the vascular zzso If one assumes that the distribution of zzso receptors is uniform throughout the zzso then the most efficient site for signaling should occur in zzso where the zzso membrane is in close proximity to the zzso zzso released from zzso would diffuse a short distance to zzso receptors inducing an increase in blood flow, possibly the result of zzso zzso We zzso that this zzso varies across the zzso bed depending upon zzso supply rate and the flux of zzso from these zzso to support zzso zzso This would suggest that the zzso bed would be the most effective site for zzso to communicate tissue oxygen zzso zzso coupled zzso cells conduct the integrated signal upstream where zzso adjust vascular resistance, thus enabling zzso released from zzso to regulate the magnitude and distribution of zzso supply to individual zzso zzso
