The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso increased zzso levels in three out of five human zzso zzso cell lines tested while an increased in calcium zzso levels was seen only in one cell line zzso This increase was zzso C, zzso toxin dependent and associated with an increase in zzso and zzso protein expression together with the formation of functional zzso zzso factor zzso Cell exposure to zzso or zzso resulted in a decrease in zzso cell proliferation associated with a zzso of the zzso marker, zzso zzso Both peptides were found to increase zzso calcium levels in blasts isolated from patients with zzso zzso Thus zzso and zzso are involved in the physiology and zzso of human zzso zzso
