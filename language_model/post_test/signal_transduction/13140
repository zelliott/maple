zzso accelerate traffic in the zzso and zzso zzso as well as in the regulated zzso zzso pathway, of zzso zzso zzso It has been proposed that zzso of protein segregation in compartments where these traffic pathways intersect may influence zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins couple zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso of zzso signaling zzso but they are also suggested to participate in zzso traffic zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and two zzso were mapped in zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and in zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso All G proteins examined were detected at low levels in isolated compartments zzso believed to represent the zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso and the zzso were concentrated in a series of isolated compartments believed to be related to zzso of a zzso zzso with sorting and recycling functions zzso a distinct zzso compartment with zzso zzso composition zzso and zzso of the zzso network believed to be involved in traffic to and from the zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso concentrated in compartments believed to represent a mixture of immature and mature zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of the zzso network compartment believed to mediate traffic to zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed the presence of both zzso membrane and zzso pools of the G zzso zzso with 10 zzso zzso for zzso caused a component of the zzso zzso away from the zzso components of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso away from the zzso and a component of the zzso zzso away from the zzso Thus, these proteins may participate in zzso traffic steps activated by zzso stimulation in addition to playing their classical roles in plasma membrane signal zzso
