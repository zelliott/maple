Breast cancer cells zzso zzso zzso which may act as a zzso zzso in breast zzso The zzso factors and signal zzso pathways responsible for regulating zzso production in breast cancer are zzso In this study we have examined the involvement of the protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso in the control of zzso zzso in the human breast cancer cell line zzso Treatment of zzso cells with various agents that activate protein zzso A zzso through increases in zzso zzso levels including zzso zzso toxin zzso the zzso analogue zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso all markedly increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while stimulating zzso production, but not zzso zzso zzso also significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso attenuated the zzso response to zzso zzso and zzso but not that due to the zzso zzso zzso The possibility that human breast zzso zzso are a target for zzso action with regard to zzso production was also investigated, and revealed that while zzso were unresponsive to zzso alone, zzso with the zzso zzso greatly zzso zzso release in response to zzso In conclusion our results show that zzso of either the zzso or zzso zzso pathways in human breast cancer cells increases zzso zzso We also found that zzso release zzso after treatment with zzso and that zzso itself stimulates zzso production in zzso zzso The implication of this potential novel zzso loop may be significant in view of the high levels of zzso and zzso found in zzso breast zzso
