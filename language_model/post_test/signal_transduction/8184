Here, we study the zzso expression of the zzso zzso programmed death 1 zzso on zzso zzso virus zzso zzso T cells following zzso zzso infection or following vaccination with a zzso zzso virus Ankara zzso vaccine and zzso zzso virus zzso challenge in zzso Following infection, the majority zzso of zzso zzso T cells expressed zzso and the level of zzso expression per cell increased over zzso The level of zzso expression in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the major sites of virus zzso was higher compared to zzso In zzso blockade of zzso resulted in enhanced proliferation of zzso zzso as well as zzso T zzso In contrast, following zzso the majority of peak zzso zzso zzso T cells expressed low levels of zzso and these levels decreased further as the cells differentiated into memory zzso In addition, following zzso challenge of these vaccinated zzso the level of zzso expression on zzso zzso T cells correlated positively with plasma zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso T cells express zzso after exposure to zzso but zzso expression under conditions of zzso clearance and enhance expression under conditions of zzso zzso They also demonstrate that the level of zzso expression per cell rather than the presence or absence of expression plays an important role in regulating zzso zzso dysfunction in zzso zzso zzso In addition, they demonstrate that similar to zzso infection, the zzso zzso zzso zzso is operational in zzso zzso infection, and the zzso model would be ideal to test the safety and therapeutic benefit of blocking this zzso in zzso
