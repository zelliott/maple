zzso of T zzso is triggered by the interaction of zzso with its specific zzso following T zzso zzso The zzso for zzso consists of at least three distinct zzso the alpha chain zzso zzso the beta chain zzso zzso and the gamma chain zzso zzso Although the role of zzso gamma in zzso zzso remains zzso zzso beta is the zzso critical for zzso zzso Because zzso beta lacks any apparent zzso zzso zzso beta may be physically or functionally coupled to other zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso beta have revealed that at least two distinct zzso regions of zzso beta are involved in zzso cellular zzso The zzso region of zzso beta was identified as a region critical for zzso zzso zzso from experiments in which zzso beta zzso zzso lacking a particular zzso region or regions were expressed in an zzso mouse zzso cell line zzso Meanwhile, another zzso region of zzso zzso the zzso region, is responsible for its physical association with an zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and is critical for zzso the zzso zzso following zzso zzso It is now evident that zzso beta is linked to at least two zzso zzso pathways that mediate nuclear zzso zzso One zzso is linked to zzso zzso events, zzso by a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and that zzso leads to the induction of the zzso zzso and other genes of this zzso Another zzso leads to zzso gene induction by an as yet unknown zzso We discuss the complex zzso machinery that links the cell surface zzso to the nuclear zzso
