zzso have been reported to release zzso oxide zzso and decrease zzso free zzso in cardiovascular system, which play important roles in zzso zzso This study investigated the potential zzso effect of total zzso zzso on right zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso 60 zzso and examined the possible zzso mechanism in male Sprague zzso zzso zzso animals were treated with zzso zzso 40, 60 zzso for 18 zzso zzso treatment ameliorated zzso zzso in right zzso peak zzso pressure, right zzso zzso and the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an NO zzso zzso zzso had no influence on these zzso effects of zzso 40 zzso and zzso at this dose had no any effect on the zzso zzso zzso suggesting the limited rule of NO in zzso zzso To further examine the mechanisms of the protection, the expression of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso treatment significantly suppressed zzso zzso of these signaling pathways in a zzso zzso In zzso zzso is effective in protecting against zzso right zzso zzso possibly through lowering pulmonary zzso Multiple molecular mechanisms appeared to be involved in this protection, such as the suppression of zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso
