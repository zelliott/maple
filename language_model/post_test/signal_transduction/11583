The signals that determine body part identity in zzso zzso are largely unknown, with some exceptions such as those for teeth and zzso The zzso face is derived from small buds of zzso facial zzso that surround the embryonic oral zzso In chicken zzso the skeleton of the upper beak is derived from the zzso mass and zzso zzso Here we show that bone zzso proteins zzso and the vitamin A zzso zzso acid zzso are used to specify the identity of the zzso mass and zzso zzso zzso two beads adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso field, one soaked in the zzso zzso zzso and one soaked in zzso zzso a duplicate set of zzso mass skeletal elements in place of zzso zzso We also show that the duplicated beak is due to transformation of the zzso prominence into a second zzso mass and not due to zzso migration of cells or splitting of the normal zzso zzso Thus the levels of zzso and zzso determine whether specific regions of the face form zzso or zzso mass zzso
