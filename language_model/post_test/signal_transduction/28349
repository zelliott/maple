Control of growth determines the size and shape of zzso zzso signals known as zzso and members of the zzso family of zzso are both elements in this zzso zzso proteins have a zzso zzso paired domain, which is presumed to be essential for their zzso zzso We present evidence that the organizing signal zzso does not promote growth in eyes of zzso zzso through either zzso zzso or Twin of zzso zzso the two zzso zzso zzso Instead, it acts through zzso zzso which has a truncated paired domain, consisting of only the zzso zzso In humans and mice, the sole zzso gene produces the zzso zzso by alternative zzso like zzso this zzso binds DNA though the C zzso of the paired zzso zzso of human zzso zzso strong overgrowth in zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso hardly effects zzso These results show that growth and eye zzso are subject to independent control and explain zzso in a new zzso
