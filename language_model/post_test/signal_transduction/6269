Signal zzso by zzso zzso zzso is initiated by recruitment of a variety of signaling proteins to zzso motifs in the activated zzso Several signaling pathways are thus activated in zzso the combination of which decides the cellular zzso Here, we present a dual strategy for extensive mapping of zzso proteins and probing of zzso protein interactions of a signaling zzso The approach relies on labeling of cells with zzso and zzso zzso forms of zzso to distinguish two cell zzso First, zzso proteins from zzso zzso and control samples zzso are isolated and subjected to high sensitivity zzso transform zzso zzso resonance mass zzso zzso Next, zzso corresponding to zzso zzso sites identified during the zzso zzso analysis are used as zzso to isolate zzso protein binding partners, which are subsequently identified by mass zzso We used this approach to identify 28 components of the signaling cascade induced by stimulation with the basic zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as a novel candidate in zzso growth factor zzso zzso and we defined zzso interactions with other zzso such as zzso protein zzso of the signaling zzso Finally, we present evidence for a complex containing insulin zzso zzso and zzso in signaling by the zzso growth factor zzso
