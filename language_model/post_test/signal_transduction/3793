There are two types of horizontal cells, the zzso and the zzso cells, in the zzso of the kissing zzso zzso zzso zzso cells occupy the zzso layer zzso to the zzso zzso whereas zzso cells form a layer zzso to the layer of zzso zzso Neither type of cell has zzso zzso were evoked by light from red and green light-emitting zzso The two stimuli were modulated either by a zzso or a zzso zzso The zzso cell always produced a zzso zzso The zzso cell produced a zzso response when zzso by only one zzso However, in the presence of a steady or modulated green zzso a red stimulus produced a zzso zzso Such zzso cells were similar to the zzso zzso zzso horizontal cells observed in other zzso The zzso phase of the red response was produced by the balance of intensity of the two zzso red and zzso We used zzso methodology to identify the dynamics of the horizontal cell's zzso response by taking advantage of the fact that a Wiener kernel is a measure of a cell's incremental sensitivity, which includes its response zzso Under all conditions, a steady state zzso response by both zzso and zzso cells always was related zzso to the input zzso The average mean square error zzso of the model predicted by the zzso kernel was approximately zzso for both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In some cases, the zzso was a few percent even when the zzso response zzso was nearly 30 zzso The ratio of zzso from red and green cones to both types of horizontal cells was zzso the major input for zzso cells came from red cones, whereas the major input for zzso cells came from green zzso zzso kernels generated by the major input were robust in terms of zzso in the sense that the zzso remained unchanged whether or not there was a steady or modulated zzso by the opposing zzso The results reported here do not address the question of the neural zzso that generates horizontal cell responses, in particular, the zzso zzso However, whatever that zzso might be, the high degree of zzso of the zzso response by both types of cell under various stimulus conditions zzso restrictions on the performance of any proposed model as well as on mechanisms that zzso the generation of the horizontal cell zzso
