zzso period genes have a pivotal role in generating zzso rhythms and are rapidly induced by several stimuli in zzso zzso In the present study, we revealed that treatment with zzso significantly induced transcripts of mouse period 1 and 2 zzso and zzso but not zzso among zzso related genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expressions took distinct signaling pathways from protein zzso C and zzso but were partially inhibited by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso Thus, the present study suggested that zzso calcium is one of multiple signaling stimuli triggering zzso gene expression in zzso zzso
