zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso whose activity in a cellular context is largely zzso In this study the activity of zzso was examined via zzso zzso release in zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso activity increased approximately zzso in response to zzso a zzso zzso This was significantly inhibited by zzso which implies that the effect of zzso was due, at least in part, to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso was confirmed in zzso zzso zzso The roles of the zzso and C2 zzso in controlling zzso activity via membrane association were also zzso A zzso zzso zzso exhibited no zzso activity in response to zzso or zzso due to an inability to associate with the cell zzso Within the C2 domain, zzso of zzso to zzso at the predicted zzso site dramatically reduced zzso activity highlighting an important regulatory role for this zzso zzso of zzso to zzso also influenced activity, most likely due to altered zzso zzso Of the C2 zzso investigated, none altered sensitivity to zzso This suggests that the C2 domain is not responsible for zzso zzso zzso this work highlights an important new component of the zzso zzso zzso and given its sensitivity to zzso this zzso is likely to facilitate the amplification of zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso between zzso compartments in zzso
