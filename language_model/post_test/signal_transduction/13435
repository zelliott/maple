zzso zzso cells were zzso with expression zzso for zzso (the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso derivatives lacking the zzso 67 zzso acids of the zzso domain, zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso is identical to a naturally occurring alternatively spliced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which incorporates zzso 19 in place of zzso zzso zzso lacks zzso signaling motifs as well as protein zzso necessary for interaction with zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with each construct yielded equivalent levels of zzso zzso whereas no zzso expression was observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso Western analysis and zzso of zzso zzso confirmed zzso protein expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso or zzso gained the capacity to bind zzso zzso zzso and assemble zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso added zzso and zzso In addition, the zzso and zzso cells were able to zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with the zzso alone or with either of the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso did not exhibit the capacity to assemble zzso zzso or to bind and zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso together with zzso reduced the size of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of bovine zzso zzso with zzso also inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso these results indicate an obligatory requirement for the zzso zzso zzso domain for zzso zzso zzso formation and retention of the zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso of zzso In addition, the results suggest a potential regulatory role for the zzso expressed alternatively spliced short tail zzso zzso
