zzso is a zzso phase during which cell fates are zzso Mechanical forces shaping individual cells play a key role during tissue zzso By investigating zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we show that the zzso zzso network is zzso regulated by zzso and zzso signaling to shape the zzso zzso zzso signaling activates expression of the zzso zzso zzso in the secondary cell lineage through the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso contraction of the zzso zzso in the secondary zzso thereby generating a zzso pushing zzso In contrast, zzso signaling in the primary lineage zzso zzso zzso zzso expression to prevent zzso contraction and allow the zzso anchor cell to expand the zzso zzso of the primary zzso The zzso action of the zzso and zzso pathways thus controls zzso tube zzso linking cell fate zzso to zzso
