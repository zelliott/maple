zzso are involved in many interactions with other proteins leading to networks that regulate and control a wide variety of zzso zzso Some of these zzso called hub proteins or zzso bind to many different protein zzso zzso intrinsic disorder, via diversity arising from structural plasticity or flexibility, provide a means for hubs to associate with many partners zzso zzso zzso zzso Romero zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The roles of intrinsic disorder in protein interaction zzso zzso J 2005, zzso 

Here we present a detailed examination of two divergent examples: 1) zzso which uses different zzso regions to bind to different partners and which also has several individual zzso regions that each bind to multiple partners, and 2) zzso which is a structured protein that associates with many different zzso zzso zzso For both examples, three-dimensional structures of multiple complexes reveal that the flexibility and plasticity of zzso zzso protein regions as well as zzso changes in the structured regions are both important for binding zzso 

These data support the conjecture that hub proteins often zzso intrinsic disorder to bind to multiple partners and provide detailed information about induced fit in structured zzso
