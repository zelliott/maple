In the last decade, the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of regulation of the inflammatory process in chronic inflammatory diseases has moved remarkably zzso Recent evidence in various fields has consistently indicated that zzso play a key role in initiating and perpetuating zzso not only via the production of soluble zzso but also via zzso contact interactions with a variety of cell types through membrane receptors and their zzso zzso through zzso and zzso zzso is a versatile zzso that is zzso involved in all these zzso In this article, we review how zzso become activated by zzso cells or inflammatory zzso and how these zzso zzso in turn, zzso zzso cells, smooth muscle cells and zzso to produce zzso zzso zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue factor, the main zzso of the zzso cascade in zzso and finally zzso zzso responsible for tissue zzso Moreover, we discuss how zzso zzso at inflammatory sites stimulates zzso and tissue zzso production of zzso leading to zzso which promotes and maintains the chronic inflammatory zzso This cascade of events is discussed in the context of disease zzso with particular reference to zzso and zzso arthritis, and to potential novel therapeutic targets for their zzso
