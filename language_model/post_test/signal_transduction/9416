Numerous observations zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of systemic lupus zzso zzso however, the potential impact of zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso and disease activity is zzso The aim of this study was to characterize zzso activity and the zzso and clinical profiles of zzso patients with zzso 

zzso obtained from patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso patients with zzso arthritis zzso zzso zzso and healthy control subjects zzso zzso 25) were examined for the presence of zzso using a zzso zzso zzso type I zzso zzso and the ability of zzso zzso to neutralize zzso activity were determined using zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene expression in peripheral blood were determined by zzso and serum levels of zzso zzso zzso and other zzso were measured using zzso 

zzso were detected in zzso of the serum samples from patients with zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis identified 2 zzso of patients, zzso and zzso , that differed in the levels of serum type I zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and in zzso zzso The majority of zzso patients had significantly lower levels of serum type I zzso zzso reduced downstream zzso activity, and lower disease activity compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso were able to effectively neutralize type I zzso activity in zzso 

Patients with zzso commonly harbor zzso zzso patients have lower levels of serum type I zzso zzso and evidence for reduced downstream zzso and disease zzso zzso may influence the clinical course in zzso by zzso the effects produced by zzso
