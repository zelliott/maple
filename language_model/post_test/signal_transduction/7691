zzso zzso zzso is important for learning, memory and synaptic plasticity in the zzso and other brain zzso zzso stimulation of zzso receptors in zzso zzso zzso projection zzso evokes a focal rise in free zzso in the zzso that zzso as waves into the zzso and zzso These zzso waves initiate in the zzso zzso and show limited propagation zzso away from the zzso In other cell types, zzso waves have been shown to be zzso by either zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso and zzso act zzso to release zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Whereas action zzso zzso alone were relatively ineffective in raising nuclear zzso their pairing with zzso zzso zzso evoked an zzso zzso zzso release, raising nuclear zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso release was highly zzso When coupled with zzso zzso zzso large robust zzso rises and zzso amplification were observed in the zzso nucleus and sparsely zzso zzso segments with zzso zzso In contrast, no significant amplification of the zzso transient was detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rises evoked by zzso zzso of zzso showed the same distribution, suggesting that zzso zzso stores are zzso located in the zzso and zzso zzso This distribution of zzso store release suggests that the zzso role of zzso zzso stimulation in zzso learning may result from enhanced nuclear zzso
