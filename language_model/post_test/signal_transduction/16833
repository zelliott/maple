Biological systems are tremendously complex in their functioning and zzso zzso the multifaceted zzso and describing the performance of such complexity has challenged the scientific community for zzso The reduction of real-world zzso into simple descriptive models has therefore convinced many researchers of the usefulness of introducing mathematics into biological zzso zzso zzso takes such an approach another step further in that it takes advantage of existing knowledge to project the performance of a system in alternating zzso The ever growing amounts of available data generated by assessing biological systems at increasingly higher detail provide unique opportunities for future zzso and experiment zzso Here we aim to provide an overview of the progress made in zzso over time and the currently prevalent approaches for zzso zzso cycles in modern zzso We will further argue for the importance of versatility in zzso approaches, including zzso zzso model reduction and network zzso Finally, we will discuss the difficulties in overcoming the mathematical interpretation of in zzso complexity and address some of the future challenges lying zzso
