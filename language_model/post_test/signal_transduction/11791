Several T cell surface molecules can activate signal zzso pathways that lead to T cell zzso Like the T cell zzso zzso zzso several other zzso including the sheep zzso zzso zzso are able to activate the zzso zzso signal zzso zzso upon stimulation with appropriate zzso However, zzso zzso of this zzso is dependent on the functional expression of the zzso Since the T cell does not express other known receptors that activate the zzso zzso independent of the zzso the specificity of the zzso requirement for a functional zzso is not zzso To evaluate the specificity of this requirement, we examined the functional capacity of zzso to activate the zzso zzso in a zzso cell which had been zzso with a zzso zzso the human zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family of receptors and is known to activate the zzso zzso zzso can function in the absence of the zzso in a zzso T cell zzso Here we demonstrate through calcium zzso and zzso metabolism zzso that zzso is unable to substitute functionally for the zzso in zzso signal zzso These results suggest a specific functional interaction between zzso and the zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in T zzso
