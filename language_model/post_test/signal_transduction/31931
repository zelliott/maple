To study the effects of zzso zzso zzso on the proliferation and the migration force of human breast cancer zzso cell and the expression of zzso 

zzso cells were cultured with different zzso of zzso for 24 h and with the final concentration of 8 zzso for 24, 48, and 72 zzso The effects of zzso on the cell proliferation of zzso were detected by zzso zzso The effects of the migration force of zzso cells were detected by zzso The expression of zzso zzso was detected using reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso The expression of zzso protein was detected using Western zzso 

zzso could significantly inhibit the proliferation of zzso cells in a zzso and zzso manner zzso zzso zzso It also could inhibit the migration force of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and Western zzso showed that zzso zzso and protein levels obviously decreased zzso zzso zzso 

zzso could inhibit the expression of zzso and the cell proliferation and the migration force of zzso cells, which primarily revealed that zzso might affect the biological behavior of human breast cancer cells possibly through zzso signaling pathway, thus providing theoretical and experimental bases for treating breast cancer by zzso
