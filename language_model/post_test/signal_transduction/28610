Previous studies have demonstrated that zzso of the zzso zzso including the zzso response zzso protein zzso increases the proliferation and survival of newborn zzso in adult mouse zzso In the present study, we determined whether the zzso cascade also influences the zzso maturation of newborn zzso in the zzso zone of the zzso zzso a selective inhibitor of the zzso zzso type 4, was administered to activate the zzso zzso and zzso zzso was determined by analysis of zzso zzso in the zzso zone of zzso zzso administration significantly increased the number of branch points and length of zzso relative to vehicle zzso Increased branch number and length were accompanied by increased levels of zzso zzso the active form of this zzso factor, in immature zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso zzso was not significantly influenced by zzso treatment in zzso transgenic mice expressing a zzso zzso of zzso in zzso We also tested the influence of zzso zzso in primary zzso cultures and found that zzso of the zzso zzso increased and zzso of the zzso cascade decreased the number of branches and length of processes as observed in zzso These findings indicate that the zzso cascade plays an important role in the differentiation and maturation of newborn zzso in zzso
