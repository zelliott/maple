zzso of protein zzso C zzso plays an important role in the negative regulation of zzso zzso but its effect on zzso growth zzso zzso zzso signaling remains zzso In this study, we characterized the zzso pathways involved in zzso zzso of zzso and evaluated the effects of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso by zzso IGF-1 induced a zzso and zzso zzso of zzso The effect of IGF-1 was blocked by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the stimulation of zzso by IGF-1 is zzso by the zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso with zzso zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso of zzso The zzso was blocked completely by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso but only partially by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso and zzso pathways are zzso zzso induced the zzso of zzso in zzso cells, and this induction was blocked by zzso These data further support the role of zzso in the effect of zzso Moreover, zzso is likely involved in the action of zzso on the basis of data obtained using zzso zzso such as zzso zzso also decreased zzso zzso zzso of insulin zzso zzso and its association with zzso Taken together, these results suggest, for the first time, that stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso
