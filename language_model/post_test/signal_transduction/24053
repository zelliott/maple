Human zzso nerve zzso induce zzso oxide zzso zzso in zzso in response to zzso zzso and elevated zzso zzso Using relatively specific zzso we have compared induction of zzso in response to these two stimuli to determine whether the same or different signal zzso pathways participate in the zzso Using zzso and zzso which inhibit the zzso pathway, the induction of zzso in response to both zzso and elevated zzso pressure was zzso Using zzso and zzso which inhibit zzso zzso protein zzso only the response to zzso was zzso In contrast, when zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso AG 82 and AG 18 were used, the induction of zzso in response to pressure, but not in response to zzso was zzso Signal zzso pathways presumably regulate the synthesis of zzso through downstream events that induce zzso of the zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso of different sites in the promoter region of the zzso gene is needed for these different stimuli to induce zzso
