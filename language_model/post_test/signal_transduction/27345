The use of zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso zzso to deliver therapeutic genes into target cells is limited by their inability to zzso zzso zzso To test the capacity of zzso zzso to deliver genes into zzso cells, we have generated zzso zzso type 1 zzso reporter zzso carrying zzso zzso or mouse heat stable zzso replacing the zzso sequences zzso zzso These zzso also harbor inactive zzso zzso and zzso coding zzso zzso zzso particles carrying either the zzso or the zzso zzso envelope proteins or the zzso zzso virus G protein were released after single or double zzso of either human zzso or monkey zzso cells with zzso of up to zzso zzso units per zzso A simple zzso procedure resulted in an additional zzso to zzso concentration of the zzso zzso These zzso along with zzso zzso were used to zzso primary human skin zzso and human peripheral blood zzso zzso The zzso zzso system was significantly more efficient than its zzso counterpart in zzso human skin zzso arrested at the zzso stage of the cell cycle by zzso zzso of zzso Human zzso cells were zzso efficiently using zzso zzso particles without prior stimulation with zzso
