We have reported that immortalized zzso cells zzso express the zzso growth factor I zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes SC survival and protects zzso in zzso medium from zzso In the current study we examined the roles of zzso and zzso in primary zzso zzso enhances primary SC differentiation and gene and protein expression of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso SC that zzso zzso human zzso also have higher levels of zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso but not the zzso protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso blocks zzso enhancement of zzso gene and protein zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso promotes SC zzso and this may occur in part by enhancing zzso expression via zzso zzso zzso These data support a link between enhanced zzso expression and cellular zzso
