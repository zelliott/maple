zzso syndrome is a zzso disorder with zzso zzso zzso the zzso features of which include zzso zzso zzso and cardiac zzso Using zzso zzso we found linkage to zzso zzso and, in 15 independent families, identified five different zzso (four zzso and one zzso in zzso which encodes a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family of zzso transport proteins and acts as a negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso In 10 patients, the disease was caused by zzso for the same nonsense zzso zzso that resides on a common zzso indicative of a founder effect in patients of northern European zzso Surprisingly, nonsense zzso of zzso in open brain mice cause zzso embryonic zzso with zzso zzso suggesting a species difference in the requirement for zzso during early zzso The discovery of zzso zzso in patients with zzso syndrome implicates zzso signaling in zzso zzso unexpected finding, given that zzso is not usually associated with zzso of other zzso zzso provides a new molecular target for studies of zzso
