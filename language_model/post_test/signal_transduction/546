Proper transport and distribution of zzso in zzso and at zzso are critical for the normal physiology of zzso zzso in zzso display distinct zzso patterns and undergo zzso and zzso movement, where zzso frequently stop, start moving again, and change zzso While approximately one-third of zzso zzso are mobile in mature zzso a large proportion remains zzso Their net movement is significantly influenced by recruitment to stationary or zzso zzso In response to the diverse zzso states of zzso and zzso the zzso balance between zzso and stationary zzso is a possible target of regulation by zzso signals and synaptic zzso zzso control of zzso retention zzso at particular stations, where energy production and calcium zzso capacity are highly zzso is likely essential for zzso development and zzso In this review, we introduce the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the complex mobility patterns of zzso zzso and discuss how motor zzso complexes and zzso machinery contribute to zzso transport and distribution in zzso and at zzso In addition, we briefly discuss the zzso evidence how zzso zzso mobility impacts synaptic zzso
