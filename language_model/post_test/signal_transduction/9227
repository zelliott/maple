zzso zzso regulate plant growth and development via a complex network of zzso zzso Here, we perform functional analyses with zzso plants to provide direct evidence that zzso zzso regulate salt and drought stress zzso All zzso plants with reduced levels of various zzso exhibited a strong zzso zzso that was associated with increased cell membrane integrity and zzso acid zzso hypersensitivity rather than zzso density and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso genes involved in the zzso of zzso zzso and the majority of the zzso zzso zzso genes was zzso by stress and zzso treatments, leading to a decrease in biologically active zzso zzso These results demonstrate a novel mechanism for survival under zzso stress conditions via the zzso regulation of steady state zzso zzso Additionally, under normal conditions, although zzso zzso increased the sensitivity of plants to zzso zzso it caused a zzso of key zzso zzso zzso leading to a significant reduction in zzso zzso levels in zzso plants relative to the wild zzso Taken together, this study provides direct evidence that mutual regulation mechanisms exist between the zzso and zzso metabolism and signals underlying different processes regulating plant adaptation to zzso as well as plant growth and zzso
