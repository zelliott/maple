zzso zzso zzso encodes a positive regulator of Ras zzso We investigated the mechanism by which the human zzso zzso can positively regulate zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso expression enhances zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso but has no effect on zzso zzso induced by active zzso or zzso Furthermore, zzso expression does not increase zzso or zzso zzso zzso interacts with Ras and zzso and is able to form a zzso complex with the two zzso Thus, zzso may function as a scaffold that enhances zzso zzso signal zzso by zzso the interaction between Ras and zzso
