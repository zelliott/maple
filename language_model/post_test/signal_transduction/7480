Some zzso receptors regulate biological processes via zzso or zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to be specifically activated by zzso and mediates a major part of the acute response of vascular smooth muscle cells to zzso II zzso In order to gain information about the dynamics of zzso zzso of zzso we developed a zzso zzso to study interactions between zzso and zzso in single living zzso Upon zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso a robust zzso signal occurred that allowed for the first time the analysis of the zzso of this interaction in zzso zzso and off-set zzso of zzso interactions closely resembled the zzso of zzso zzso Analysis of the effect of zzso zzso of zzso zzso 2) on the dynamics of zzso activity and their interaction with zzso showed that zzso is able to accelerate both zzso of zzso proteins and zzso of zzso and zzso to a similar zzso Furthermore, we were able to detect zzso zzso between zzso and zzso and observed a reduced zzso downstream zzso in the presence of zzso In zzso these observations support the concept of a functional zzso zzso zzso
