zzso is a key zzso of signaling pathways downstream of several zzso surface receptors including zzso collagen zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A recent study identified the novel small zzso zzso as a selective inhibitor of zzso 

The present study evaluates the role of zzso in human zzso using the novel inhibitor zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso signaling were assessed using zzso zzso and western zzso to determine the effects of zzso on zzso zzso 

We demonstrate zzso to be a powerful inhibitor of zzso in human zzso zzso zzso shape change and zzso induced by zzso of zzso and zzso and reduced zzso spreading on zzso The zzso effect of zzso was associated with zzso of zzso zzso of signaling proteins that lay downstream of zzso for all three zzso including zzso zzso zzso markedly inhibited zzso zzso of zzso and zzso downstream of zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso downstream of zzso and zzso zzso was zzso 

The zzso effect of zzso provides direct evidence of a role for zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling in human zzso Further, the results demonstrate a critical role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso suggesting a novel model in which both zzso and zzso zzso regulate zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso
