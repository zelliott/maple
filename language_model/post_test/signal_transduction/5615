To determine whether a zzso active protein zzso C zzso stimulates rat and human zzso zzso cell proliferation through zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso from rat and human were minced and zzso cells were allowed to zzso zzso cells were serum starved and incubated with an zzso containing a zzso active form of zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso The location of zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso C zzso zzso or the zzso 1/2 inhibitor zzso zzso zzso before incubation with zzso Cell proliferation was zzso 

zzso of rat zzso cells with zzso did not change zzso location compared with zzso zzso zzso with zzso caused an increase in cell proliferation by zzso whereas zzso increased proliferation by zzso zzso addition of zzso and zzso did not further increase zzso zzso inhibited zzso proliferation a maximum of zzso In human zzso cells, incubation with zzso caused an increase in cell proliferation by zzso whereas zzso increased proliferation by zzso zzso addition of zzso and zzso decreased proliferation compared with either compound zzso zzso caused zzso 1/2 to zzso to the nucleus in rat and human cells, but the zzso was blocked by zzso 

zzso of zzso alone by inducing zzso of zzso 1/2 and zzso it to the nucleus is necessary and sufficient to cause zzso cell proliferation in zzso and probably human, zzso zzso
