We used shotgun zzso to identify plasma membrane and zzso raft proteins zzso from B cells obtained from mantle cell zzso zzso patients in zzso zzso zzso identified 111 zzso zzso some of which were zzso in primary zzso cases, zzso cell lines, and normal B cells using zzso and Western zzso Several zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso when compared with normal B zzso zzso was zzso zzso in three of five zzso patients along with its zzso zzso zzso which was zzso zzso in five of five patients, suggesting that zzso cells may undergo zzso stimulation via this signaling zzso zzso zzso I and protein zzso C zzso were also detected in the plasma zzso suggesting that these proteins are zzso active in zzso zzso zzso C zzso has been associated with zzso zzso and shotgun zzso profiling revealed that key zzso raft zzso zzso (four of five zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso (four of four zzso were zzso in zzso zzso of other known zzso raft zzso such as Lyn zzso and zzso 1, were similar to normal B zzso However, zzso zzso a key zzso in zzso zzso was associated with zzso zzso and was zzso approximately zzso in zzso compared with normal B zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso its zzso zzso induced zzso in zzso cell lines and primary chronic zzso leukemia cells, indicating an important role for the zzso zzso zzso in zzso and other B cell zzso Thus, using shotgun zzso and zzso and protein expression profiling we identified a subset of known and unknown zzso proteins with zzso expression in zzso plasma zzso These proteins may play a role in the pathology of the disease and are potential therapeutic targets in zzso
