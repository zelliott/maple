Until now, zzso signal zzso system was thought to be exclusive to zzso in the zzso Two recent reports, however, now show that this is not the zzso In one, the zzso signal zzso system has been identified and characterized in zzso zzso This signaling is modulated by zzso However, the response of the individual zzso zzso to the zzso signal depends on whether the zzso zzso in zzso or zzso zzso in zzso zzso is operational in the zzso The zzso zzso results in zzso while the zzso pathway, in zzso The two pathways are mutually zzso In the other report, the zzso zzso signaling system has been discovered in zzso cells of the zzso zzso These findings raise the possibility that a common theme of zzso zzso signaling may be zzso in a wide variety of zzso zzso This idea is also supported from evolutionary and functional zzso
