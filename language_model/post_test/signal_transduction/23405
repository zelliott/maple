zzso signaling through its zzso zzso is crucial for many zzso functions including zzso sex steroid feedback, and overall zzso Although the importance of zzso in the brain is firmly established, its role in regulating reproduction at the level of the zzso is not well zzso This study presents molecular analysis of the role of zzso and zzso signaling in the zzso regulation of the zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso using zzso zzso cells and zzso primary zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso and this induction is protein zzso C dependent and zzso by the immediate early zzso early growth response factor 1 and zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso of the early growth response factor 1 and zzso promoters in zzso zzso zzso also increases zzso gene expression in mouse primary zzso cells in zzso Furthermore, we find that zzso expression is enhanced in the zzso of female mice during the zzso zzso surge, a critical component of the zzso zzso Overall, our findings indicate that zzso regulates zzso gene expression through the zzso of zzso signaling through protein zzso C, inducing immediate early genes in zzso and responds to zzso relevant cues in zzso suggesting that zzso affects zzso gene expression to regulate zzso zzso
