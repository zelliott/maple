Members of the beta 2 zzso family are the dominating zzso expressed on zzso and they play a major role in zzso zzso and zzso zzso during inflammation and other immune zzso zzso 2 zzso are signaling zzso but they are also targets of and are functionally affected by zzso zzso zzso researchers usually discuss two types of signaling by beta 2 zzso (and zzso in zzso transmission of signals into the cell following binding of zzso or zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and regulation of the zzso and zzso of zzso by signals generated by other receptors within the cell zzso zzso In this review, our aim is to zzso what is known about the capacity of beta 2 zzso to generate zzso signaling in zzso in particular zzso zzso zzso in the literature clearly demonstrate that one of the earliest events in beta 2 zzso signaling is zzso of zzso zzso zzso which in turn triggers downstream zzso of various signaling pathways that affect different functional responses of the zzso We also discuss molecules of potential importance in beta 2 zzso zzso
