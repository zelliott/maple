zzso (also known as protein zzso B or zzso comprises three closely related zzso zzso zzso and zzso (or zzso zzso We have a very good understanding of the mechanisms by which zzso zzso are activated by growth factors and other zzso stimuli as well as by zzso zzso in key upstream regulatory proteins including zzso zzso zzso and zzso There are also an ever increasing number of zzso zzso being identified that play a role in the regulation of the diverse array of biological effects of activated zzso this includes the regulation of cell zzso survival and zzso zzso of zzso leads to diseases of major zzso medical need such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular and neurological zzso As a result there has been substantial investment in the development of small molecular zzso zzso that act competitively with zzso or zzso zzso or zzso In this review we will briefly discuss our current understanding of how zzso zzso are zzso the zzso proteins they zzso and how this zzso with the role of zzso in zzso We will zzso discuss the types of zzso zzso that have been developed and are in clinical trials for human cancer, as well as speculate on potential zzso zzso such as disturbances of heart and vascular function, zzso memory and mood, which should be monitored very carefully during clinical zzso
