zzso sensory zzso respond to zzso injury by zzso an zzso retrograde signaling zzso How is this mechanism zzso Here, we show that Ran zzso and its associated zzso zzso and zzso regulate the formation of zzso signaling complexes in injured zzso A zzso of nuclear zzso versus zzso zzso is thought to be fundamental for the organization of zzso zzso Surprisingly, we find zzso in zzso nerve zzso distant from zzso cell bodies and zzso and in association with zzso and zzso Following injury, localized translation of zzso stimulates zzso zzso from zzso and subsequent zzso thereby allowing binding of newly zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso blockade at zzso injury sites reduces the zzso conditioning zzso zzso Thus, zzso employ localized mechanisms of Ran regulation to control retrograde injury signaling in peripheral zzso
