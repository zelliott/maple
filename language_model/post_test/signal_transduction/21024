The zzso protein delta zzso zzso zzso factor is known to be rarely expressed but sharply induced at an early stage of the acute phase zzso To investigate the regulation mechanisms for this zzso the zzso region of the rat zzso delta gene was zzso zzso analyses involving zzso and zzso indicated that the upstream region up to - 175 zzso is sufficient for the full zzso activity in rat zzso zzso zzso At least three zzso including a zzso box are involved in this zzso When zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso zzso delta zzso was rapidly zzso zzso and gel shift analyses identified the binding site for the acute phase response zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso These findings strongly indicate that zzso delta gene expression is zzso by zzso which is zzso for the zzso through the zzso zzso when cells are treated with zzso and zzso the other acute phase response zzso
