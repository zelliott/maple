Association of zzso with specific proteins in the central nervous system was examined by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was detected in zzso with zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso from zzso fraction of rat zzso Using in zzso zzso zzso several zzso proteins of 40, 53, 56, and 80 zzso were isolated by gel zzso Of these zzso the proteins of 53 and 56 zzso zzso were identified as two zzso of zzso family zzso zzso zzso based on zzso during gel zzso comparative zzso zzso and sequential zzso with zzso zzso The identification was confirmed using a zzso expression system in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells, which express solely zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso In zzso with zzso zzso and Lyn expression zzso zzso zzso Lyn and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of rat primary zzso cultures induced Lyn zzso and rapid zzso zzso of several zzso including zzso protein zzso Furthermore, zzso density zzso analysis showed that Lyn of zzso and zzso zzso were detected in a low density zzso band, zzso the zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso extract of zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso may regulate Lyn in a zzso domain on brain cell zzso
