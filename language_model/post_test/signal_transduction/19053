In zzso lateral root formation is a zzso zzso event, which is regulated by hormones and environmental zzso In this study, via analyzing the expression of zzso genes during lateral root zzso formation, we report that zzso zzso inhibit the initiation of zzso through blocking the zzso founder cells cycling at the zzso to M transition phase, while the promotion by zzso of zzso zzso is due to the stimulation of the zzso to S zzso No significant difference was detected in the zzso effect of zzso on zzso formation between zzso plants and zzso defective in zzso response or zzso In addition, zzso applied zzso at different zzso could not rescue the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso and zzso might control zzso initiation through two separate signaling pathways in zzso The zzso repression of zzso initiation is transmitted through the zzso signal system and zzso by the zzso zzso
