We have discovered a family of small zzso proteins in Homo sapiens and zzso zzso using a novel database searching zzso The family is composed of five highly zzso genes referred to as zzso to zzso The zzso genes zzso proteins of approximately 100 zzso acids that contain zzso zzso zzso at fixed zzso zzso to zzso are more closely related to each other than to zzso in which a zzso motif including zzso in zzso to zzso is not zzso In zzso zzso zzso has two zzso formed by alternative zzso zzso zzso analyses reveal that zzso proteins appear zzso related to zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso are highly expressed in specific brain regions, with little expression seen in other zzso
