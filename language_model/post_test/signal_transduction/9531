zzso differentiation and polarization is influenced by, and act on, many processes associated with zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso polarization in systemic lupus zzso zzso remain largely zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso zzso polarization zzso by activated zzso zzso zzso could initiate and zzso zzso lupus zzso zzso zzso P component zzso a zzso zzso protein in mice, has been reported to bind to DNA and zzso immune zzso In this study, zzso zzso was shown to promote zzso zzso zzso through binding to zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso switch from a zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso alone to an zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso were found because of zzso signaling zzso Both in zzso zzso supplements and adoptive transfer of ex zzso programmed zzso zzso induced by zzso into zzso mice could efficiently alleviate lupus zzso zzso increased zzso zzso accompanied by zzso effect exerted by zzso zzso was found to predominantly impede zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso notably reduced the zzso effect of zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that binding of zzso to zzso could switch zzso zzso polarization from zzso zzso to zzso zzso via zzso signaling zzso thus exerting protective and therapeutic interventions on zzso lupus zzso These data provide a possible molecular mechanism responsible for zzso of zzso polarization in the context of lupus zzso and open a new potential therapeutic avenue for zzso
