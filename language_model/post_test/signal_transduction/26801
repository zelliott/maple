zzso is a known zzso zzso in zzso cells and plays a central role in the regulation of many cellular zzso In the following study, we report on the effect of external calcium treatments on the zzso of zzso zzso to zzso Rd by zzso zzso zzso We observed that the zzso calcium content of zzso zzso zzso zzso was increased in response to exposure to high external zzso zzso Both zzso Rd zzso and zzso activity were both found to be dependent on the external calcium zzso At an optimal zzso concentration of 45 zzso zzso zzso Rd zzso rate of zzso was observed and zzso zzso activity of zzso U was reached in a zzso zzso The zzso channel blocker zzso blocked the zzso influx of calcium and decreased zzso Rd zzso In addition, zzso activity and zzso Rd content decreased by zzso and zzso respectively after a zzso incubation in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that both zzso channels and zzso are involved in zzso Rd zzso via regulation of zzso zzso This is the first report regarding the effects of calcium signal zzso on zzso and zzso activity in zzso
