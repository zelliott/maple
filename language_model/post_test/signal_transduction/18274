zzso in the zzso zzso gene are associated with Alzheimer's disease and cause increased zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Critical zzso zzso at zzso zzso and 385 are required for the function of zzso zzso Here we investigate the biological function of a naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which lacks the critical zzso zzso Cell lines that zzso express zzso zzso 8 or a zzso protein in which zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso significant levels of zzso whereas zzso generation is severely reduced in cells zzso with zzso containing a zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso processing of zzso is almost completely inhibited in cell lines expressing any of the zzso zzso that lack one of the critical zzso These data indicate that zzso may zzso facilitate zzso generation of zzso and zzso of zzso
