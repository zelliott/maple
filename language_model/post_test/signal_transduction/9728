zzso and zzso injury are common causes of zzso tissue damage associated with many liver diseases and zzso zzso The zzso signaling zzso is an important regulator of zzso development, zzso and zzso However, the role of zzso signaling in the zzso response to zzso zzso injury has not been zzso 

zzso injury following zzso or zzso was investigated in zzso zzso mice, as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso signaling was affected by the cellular zzso balance in zzso Following zzso or zzso mice with zzso zzso were significantly more susceptible to liver zzso zzso mice that zzso zzso in zzso were resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso signaling was reduced in zzso liver but increased in zzso that zzso zzso under zzso and following zzso indicating an interaction between zzso and zzso signaling in the zzso The mechanism by which zzso signaling protects against liver injury involves the role of zzso as a zzso zzso of zzso zzso which promotes zzso survival under hypoxic zzso 

Cellular zzso balance affects zzso zzso which protects against zzso and zzso zzso These findings might be used to develop strategies for protection of zzso zzso of liver, and zzso of zzso
