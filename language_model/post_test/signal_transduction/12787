zzso is a potent zzso zzso zzso with structural zzso to zzso zzso insect zzso We tested the proposal that this zzso directly activates zzso zzso channels in cultured vascular smooth muscle zzso zzso First, we found that cell zzso can be altered in zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso channel zzso zzso Bay K zzso (10 zzso both raised cell zzso more than zzso the effect of zzso was blocked by the zzso zzso zzso Bay K zzso (40 zzso Similar responses were observed in Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (4 zzso zzso zzso raised zzso in zzso but not zzso cells from 100 zzso 17 to zzso zzso 34 zzso within 12 zzso zzso subsequently fell to zzso levels after 30 zzso Half zzso zzso response was at 4 zzso zzso M zzso Unlike zzso zzso raised zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso responses to zzso and zzso were not affected by zzso (1 zzso zzso Bay K zzso or zzso zzso Lastly, both hormones caused release of zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, the response to zzso was more than zzso larger and was more rapid than the response to zzso the zzso response was sensitive to zzso zzso while the response to zzso was zzso Thus zzso like zzso raises cell zzso in zzso by zzso of zzso stores and not by zzso of zzso zzso zzso However, their receptors are distinct and they exhibit important differences in signal zzso
