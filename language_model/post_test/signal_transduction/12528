zzso alpha zzso zzso is used for the treatment of viral zzso and some forms of zzso During these therapies zzso is injected once daily or every second day for several zzso Recently, the zzso zzso zzso zzso has replaced standard zzso in therapies of chronic zzso C because it is more effective, supposedly by inducing a long-lasting zzso of zzso signaling zzso zzso signaling in cultured cells, however, becomes zzso within hours, and little is known about the zzso effects of continuously high zzso serum zzso To investigate the behavior of the zzso system in zzso we repeatedly injected mice with zzso and analyzed its effects in the zzso Within hours after the first injection, zzso signaling became zzso to further zzso The negative regulator zzso was rapidly zzso and likely responsible for early termination of zzso zzso For long-lasting zzso neither zzso nor zzso were zzso Instead, we identified the inhibitor zzso as the key zzso Our results indicate that the current therapeutic practice using long-lasting zzso is not well adapted to the intrinsic properties of the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression may allow to exploit the full therapeutic potential of zzso zzso
