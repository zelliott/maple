zzso can reduce fertility and zzso Although central zzso actions are thought to contribute to this, the mechanisms are poorly zzso We first tested whether chronic hyperprolactinemia inhibited two neuroendocrine parameters necessary for female zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso hyperprolactinemia induced by the zzso zzso zzso caused a zzso reduction zzso pulse frequency in zzso rats, but only in the presence of chronic low levels of zzso zzso did not affect the magnitude of a zzso zzso surge or the percentage of zzso zzso activated during the zzso zzso is known to influence expression of the long form of zzso receptors zzso and components of zzso signaling zzso To test the hypothesis that zzso increases zzso expression and sensitivity to zzso we next demonstrated that zzso greatly zzso zzso zzso zzso Lastly, we measured zzso and zzso of zzso signaling zzso and zzso and zzso which reflect the level of zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso and zzso zzso induced only zzso in the zzso zzso area, where zzso zzso are zzso but in the zzso nucleus and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels were also zzso zzso enhanced these effects on zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso also induced zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels zzso These data show that zzso pulse frequency is inhibited by chronic hyperprolactinemia in a zzso zzso They also provide evidence for zzso and brain zzso regulation of zzso expression and signaling responses by zzso
