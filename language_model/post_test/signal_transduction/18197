The mechanisms by which primary tumors of the bone cause bone destruction have not been zzso Unlike most other zzso bone tumors, zzso otherwise known as giant cell tumors zzso contain zzso cells within the tumor zzso A new member of the zzso zzso member, zzso differentiation factor zzso was recently zzso zzso was shown to directly stimulate zzso in the presence of zzso In this study, the expression of zzso was examined in a number of tumor samples associated with bone zzso in zzso In addition, we investigated expression of the zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and another zzso zzso member, zzso previously shown to abrogate the zzso effects of zzso We report here the novel finding that zzso zzso cells contain abundant zzso zzso whereas the giant cell population exclusively expresses zzso zzso These results are consistent with the zzso bone destruction by these zzso We also report the expression of zzso and TRAIL zzso in zzso zzso A comparison with other zzso and zzso tumors of bone showed that zzso express more zzso and TRAIL zzso relative to zzso zzso In addition, zzso were found to express a number of zzso previously reported to play central roles in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso were also found to express high levels of zzso zzso a zzso shown to be an essential zzso of zzso and a survival factor for mature and developing zzso Furthermore, expression of these molecules by zzso cells isolated from zzso continued in zzso Thus zzso zzso express all of the signals that are currently understood to be necessary for the differentiation of zzso from precursor zzso
