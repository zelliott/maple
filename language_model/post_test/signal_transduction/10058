zzso bees begin life working in the zzso At approximately 3 weeks of age, they shift to visiting flowers to forage for zzso and zzso zzso is a complex task associated with enlargement of the mushroom bodies, a brain region important in insects for certain forms of learning and zzso We report here that zzso bees had a larger volume of mushroom body zzso than did zzso bees confined to the zzso This result indicates that direct experience of the world outside the hive causes mushroom body zzso growth in zzso We also show that oral treatment of zzso bees with zzso a zzso zzso induced an increase in the volume of the zzso similar to that seen after a week of zzso zzso zzso of zzso were blocked by zzso a zzso zzso Our results suggest that signaling in zzso pathways couples experience to structural brain zzso
