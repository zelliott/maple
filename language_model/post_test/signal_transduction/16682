The zzso zzso region is frequently amplified in human zzso and results in an increased expression of various genes including zzso and is also associated with an increased invasive zzso zzso acts as an important regulator of the zzso zzso It is therefore very tempting to speculate that zzso is the crucial gene within the zzso zzso that mediates the invasive potential of these zzso zzso also zzso in zzso zzso and recent findings have shown that, during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso degradation of the zzso growth factor zzso resulting in a sustained zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso
