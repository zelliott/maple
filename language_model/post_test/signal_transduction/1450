The thesis is presented that molecular zzso physical chemistry offers an interesting model for the design of zzso with respect to chemical recognition and zzso In order to appreciate the desirable features of this system and the inherent difficulties, the structures and binding state zzso of molecular receptors are considered via a direct comparison with zzso zzso zzso analyses of the candidate species zzso and zzso receptors are provided to illustrate the complexity of molecular zzso binding zzso A revised zzso model, which combines zzso and zzso zzso is proposed to explain the zzso changes which drive zzso reactions of coupled zzso Throughout this discussion the relevance of the various arguments to applications in zzso development is zzso Finally, a brief appraisal of attempts to produce devices ready for marriage to molecular zzso material is zzso
