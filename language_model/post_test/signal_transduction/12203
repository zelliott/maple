zzso zzso is reported to stimulate calcium zzso in the zzso small zzso However, little is known regarding its effects on the zzso a part of the large zzso with the highest rate of zzso calcium zzso We demonstrated zzso by quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction and Western zzso analysis that the zzso could be a target organ of zzso since zzso zzso cells strongly expressed zzso zzso In zzso chamber experiments, zzso enhanced the zzso zzso calcium zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso also increased the zzso calcium zzso and passive calcium transport in the zzso which could be explained by the zzso decrease in zzso resistance and increase in zzso selectivity of the zzso zzso zzso actions in the zzso were abolished by zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso and zzso zzso forming zzso zzso but not zzso of gene zzso and protein zzso In conclusion, zzso directly enhanced the zzso and zzso calcium transport in the rat zzso through the zzso signaling pathways involving zzso zzso and zzso
