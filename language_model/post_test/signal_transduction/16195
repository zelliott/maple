zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso protects the heart during zzso zzso yet the underlying mechanisms of zzso afforded by beta zzso zzso zzso remain to be zzso 

We studied the molecular mechanism zzso the effect of zzso zzso upon zzso injury during prolonged zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso of zzso by dominant negative zzso in transgenic mice zzso or in zzso zzso zzso mice zzso significantly increased, whereas zzso of zzso in zzso active zzso zzso mice zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso injury after prolonged zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso in zzso or zzso significantly reduced, while zzso of zzso in zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso signaling and inhibited zzso through a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso and, at the same time, abolished the effects of zzso zzso on both prolonged zzso injury and zzso zzso zzso the influence of zzso over the effects of zzso zzso on zzso injury was reversed by zzso of zzso 

Our results suggest that beta zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso injury but protects against zzso injury by modulating zzso and zzso
