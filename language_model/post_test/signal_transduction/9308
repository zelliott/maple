Type 1 diabetes zzso is associated with increased vascular complications and is a zzso zzso Recent findings have shown increased zzso and 4 zzso zzso zzso and functional zzso in zzso subjects compared to controls and further zzso in zzso with zzso zzso Thus, the aim of this study was to examine if genetic zzso of zzso zzso the increased inflammation associated with zzso using the zzso diabetic mouse zzso zzso and zzso mice were obtained and studied in the native state and following induction of diabetes using zzso zzso zzso mice had increased expression of both zzso and zzso while zzso zzso mice had increased expression only of zzso but not zzso compared to the zzso mice zzso expression was significantly increased with zzso diabetes and was unaffected by knockout of zzso Also, levels of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity were significantly reduced in zzso zzso mice compared to the zzso zzso zzso mice exhibited significantly increased levels of serum and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso beta and zzso compared to zzso mice and this was significantly attenuated in zzso zzso mice zzso Thus, zzso contributes to the zzso state and zzso zzso inflammation in zzso
