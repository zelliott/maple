The zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso responses in zzso cells in diabetic zzso and other zzso conditions in zzso Here, we identify that zzso zzso is required for a subset of zzso gene responses in human kidney zzso cells in zzso zzso treatment of zzso and zzso cells for zzso increased zzso (a zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso zzso This response was inhibited by zzso with zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso an zzso required for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In both cell types, zzso genes associated with zzso transition such as zzso and zzso were also affected by zzso zzso but other zzso targets such as zzso tissue growth factor zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso changes in zzso expression preceded zzso gene changes, and zzso with zzso altered zzso changes in cell shape and zzso zzso of cells with the zzso zzso form of zzso zzso triggered decreased expression of zzso in the absence of zzso but did not affect zzso muscle zzso zzso suggesting differential requirements for zzso zzso within the zzso gene zzso Increased zzso expression upon zzso exposure required zzso zzso and was also regulated by zzso and zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso is required for a subset of zzso zzso and that complex zzso pathways are involved in the zzso between zzso and zzso zzso in kidney zzso
