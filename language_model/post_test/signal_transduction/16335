Type I zzso cells, or zzso zzso zzso cells, express a zzso zzso characterized by its unique zzso usage zzso Upon interaction with zzso complexes, the zzso zzso signals that are essential for zzso selection and zzso However, it remains unclear how these signals are regulated and how important such regulations are during zzso zzso zzso zzso is an essential second zzso downstream of the zzso that activates the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, known to be crucial for zzso development, as well as the zzso zzso in T zzso zzso zzso play an important role in controlling zzso zzso concentration and thereby zzso regulate zzso zzso In this article, we report that simultaneous absence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso causes severe defects in zzso development, zzso with enhanced zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso and Ras activities also result in zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso signaling is not only essential but also needs to be tightly regulated for proper zzso cell zzso
