The ability of the closely related zzso and zzso receptors zzso to form zzso was assessed by zzso resonance energy zzso zzso zzso resonance energy transfer zzso zzso revealed that the zzso has identical propensity to zzso with the zzso than to form zzso To determine the influence of zzso a zzso cell line zzso expressing an excess of zzso over zzso was generated so that all zzso are engaged in zzso with zzso providing a tool to study the effect of zzso on zzso function in the absence of any zzso zzso The zzso had no effect on the zzso binding properties of various zzso zzso and did not affect the potency of zzso to stimulate zzso zzso Despite the zzso zzso binding properties of the zzso zzso the stable association of the zzso with the zzso completely blocked zzso zzso of the zzso Given that the zzso is resistant to zzso zzso the results indicate that the zzso acted as a dominant negative of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with this notion, the zzso zzso displayed a lower propensity to recruit zzso than the zzso The zzso also led to a change in G protein zzso zzso Indeed, in contrast to zzso and zzso which regulate zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity through a zzso to zzso and zzso no zzso zzso was observed for the zzso zzso Together, these results demonstrate that zzso between zzso and zzso forms a zzso signaling unit that possesses unique functional zzso
