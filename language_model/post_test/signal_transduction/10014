Prior studies have shown that zzso zzso display early inner ear defects that are related to abnormal zzso development and zzso These defects in zzso mice have been linked to zzso of the zzso zzso To investigate potential relevance of zzso and abnormal zzso development in inner ear zzso we analyzed the ear zzso in zzso mice using a zzso zzso We also examined the expression patterns of a battery of genes important for normal inner ear patterning and zzso Our results indicate that the loss of zzso zzso structures such as the zzso duct and zzso is attributable to the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso region of the zzso In contrast, the expanded expression domain of zzso in the zzso zzso region likely contributes to the cochlear zzso seen in zzso zzso zzso organ development is also markedly disrupted in zzso zzso This pattern of defects and gene expression changes is remarkably similar to that observed in zzso zzso Taken together, the data show an important role for zzso cues, and zzso zzso in guiding inner ear zzso The data also identify zzso zzso zzso and zzso as key zzso genes ultimately affected by zzso of the zzso zzso
