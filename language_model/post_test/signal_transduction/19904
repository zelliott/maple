Certain cancer genes contribute to zzso in a manner of either zzso or mutually exclusive zzso zzso however, the global picture of when, where and how these functional interactions occur remains zzso This study presents a systems biology approach for this zzso After applying this method to cancer gene zzso data generated from large-scale and whole zzso sequencing of cancer samples, a network of cancer genes with zzso and zzso zzso was zzso Analysis of this network revealed that genes with zzso zzso prefer direct signaling zzso and that the interaction relations among cancer genes in the network are related with their functional zzso It was also revealed that genes with zzso zzso tend to have similar zzso zzso whereas genes with zzso zzso tend to have different zzso zzso Moreover, genes with more zzso tend to have more zzso zzso with other zzso and genes having lower local coherent network structures tend to have higher zzso zzso The network showed two complementary zzso that have distinct functions and have different roles in zzso This study presented a framework for the analysis of cancer zzso sequencing zzso The presented data and uncovered patterns are helpful for understanding the contribution of gene zzso to zzso and valuable in the identification of key zzso and drug targets for zzso
