zzso protein zzso and rich in zzso zzso a member of the family of zzso zzso regulates the interaction of cells with zzso factors and proteins of the zzso zzso zzso Although it has been appreciated that transforming growth factor beta 1 zzso zzso zzso and collagen type I, we have recently shown that zzso regulates the expression of zzso and collagen type I in zzso zzso cells via a zzso pathway, and have proposed a zzso zzso regulatory feedback loop between zzso and zzso zzso we sought to determine how zzso regulates zzso signal zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso in primary zzso cells derived from zzso and zzso zzso We also show that zzso regulates the levels and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells by zzso of the zzso effects of zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso increases the levels and the activity of the zzso factor zzso These effects of zzso on the zzso signaling zzso appear to be zzso through an interaction with the zzso complex, but only in the presence of zzso bound to its zzso type II zzso That zzso is directly involved in the regulation of the zzso signaling cascade is consistent with the paradigm that zzso proteins zzso interactions among cells, growth factors, and their respective zzso
