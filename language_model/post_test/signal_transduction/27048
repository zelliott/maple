zzso and zzso dog zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso exhibited an active zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso second zzso zzso zzso increases in zzso levels were observed following the addition of zzso which zzso a zzso and zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso levels preceded media increases in zzso zzso levels and were observed at the earliest time examined (5 zzso The lowest effective concentration of zzso was between 1 and 10 zzso zzso level increases as large as zzso to zzso were observed in cells and zzso zzso of primary and zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso for 60 minutes reduced the magnitude of the zzso increase in zzso zzso To determine the mechanism by which zzso elicits its effect in primary cultures, the following test agents were zzso zzso zzso zzso and 25 zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso 35 zzso zzso a protein synthesis zzso zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were the only agents that prevented the effect of zzso The specificity of the zzso effect was evaluated with the following test zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso (a zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso none of these agents reduced zzso increases in zzso zzso indicate zzso zzso responsiveness and regulation of this response by zzso in both primary and zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
