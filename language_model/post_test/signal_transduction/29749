The expression of genes involved in nitrate zzso in zzso zzso is regulated by the zzso zzso signal zzso zzso The zzso zzso sensor zzso perceives a zzso zzso and zzso the zzso response regulator zzso which enables interaction of zzso with zzso promoters to activate zzso zzso radical zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso binds to the zzso to zzso region of zzso and the zzso to zzso region of zzso In zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso is necessary and sufficient to activate zzso of the zzso zzso Although zzso of zzso by zzso zzso greatly zzso transcription, zzso zzso as well as zzso with a zzso site zzso zzso was able to activate zzso at a low zzso The zzso zzso was shown to retain the activity in zzso to induce zzso of the zzso zzso in response to oxygen zzso suggesting that zzso itself, in addition to its zzso through zzso zzso change, senses oxygen limitation via an unknown mechanism leading to zzso gene zzso
