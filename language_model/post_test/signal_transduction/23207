To investigate the roles of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso analysis were used to determine levels of zzso and zzso zzso in TM tissue and cultures of normal and immortalized TM zzso zzso was measured using zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso The role of zzso zzso in zzso was evaluated by knocking down zzso zzso expression with zzso against the human zzso zzso Signaling from focal zzso zzso zzso was blocked using zzso inhibitor zzso The role of zzso zzso in zzso was determined by treating zzso cells with zzso zzso or ethanol zzso and by generating stable cell lines that zzso either wild type zzso or zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Both TM tissue and cell lines expressed zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso reduced zzso by zzso and zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso up to zzso in a zzso zzso zzso treatment increased zzso zzso expression in zzso cells but reduced zzso by zzso compared with zzso and zzso zzso The CA zzso zzso cell line showed increased zzso zzso levels and decreased zzso by zzso compared with the zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso in TM cells and this zzso is inhibited by zzso of zzso zzso This suggests that changes in zzso expression and activity may be responsible for zzso in zzso observed in steroid induced zzso
