Experimental evidence has demonstrated the importance of zzso zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso transmit their signals through four zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso Alternative zzso in zzso including zzso generates different zzso that exhibit different zzso exclusive tissue zzso and specific biological zzso Despite extensive information regarding the zzso patterns of expression zzso and zzso during zzso of many zzso a comparative analysis of these specific zzso in the chick zzso has not been zzso To better understand the function of zzso in zzso zzso we have zzso the expression zzso zzso and their putative zzso zzso and zzso in the developing chick zzso processes by in zzso zzso and zzso Our observations show that zzso was primarily expressed in the zzso zzso while zzso was expressed in the zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in a variety of zzso regions including the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and spatial zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the developing zzso reported in this study make them attractive candidates for involvement in zzso zzso interactions that are known to be necessary for proper zzso outgrowth and zzso
