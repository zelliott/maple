zzso immunity is the first line of zzso against infectious zzso and the basic mechanisms of pathogen recognition and response zzso are zzso zzso In zzso the innate immune response in combination with zzso recognition is required for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso innate immunity is a pharmaceutical target for the development of immune zzso Here, for the purpose of pharmaceutical zzso we established an in zzso culture based on the innate immune response of zzso The in zzso system is capable of measuring zzso zzso zzso of the immune zzso zzso pathway, which is similar to the zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso in zzso zzso revealed that well-known zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibit zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso effects of zzso and zzso were suppressed by the addition of an excess of three zzso acid, zzso acid and zzso zzso of the fatty acids so far zzso zzso acid, however, did not activate the zzso zzso when used as the sole zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso via the generation of zzso acid and other zzso but requires additional zzso from zzso zzso Moreover, zzso was activated in response to bacterial infection in zzso These results suggest a functional link between the zzso fatty acid cascade and the zzso zzso zzso in insect zzso
