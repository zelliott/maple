The zzso resistance zzso zzso that is zzso by an zzso of zzso has been suggested to be related also to an increased activity of protein zzso C zzso and to changes in zzso zzso By electron microscope quantitative zzso we investigated whether zzso and other elements of the zzso signal zzso system are affected in an zzso zzso of the human zzso cell line zzso These cells, which are characterized by an increased expression of zzso not only at the plasma membrane but also at the nuclear level, showed increased zzso amounts of zzso zzso and of zzso C beta 1, while both the amount and activity of both nuclear and cellular zzso were not modified with respect to sensitive zzso These results suggest that, in this model, the changes observed in the elements of nuclear signal zzso could be related to previously reported modifications of the zzso zzso but that zzso zzso is not dependent from increased zzso zzso
