Early growth response 1 zzso contributes to the development of chronic zzso pulmonary disease in the lungs of smokers by zzso pulmonary inflammatory responses, but the direct downstream genes of zzso that regulate this process remain zzso We show that a new zzso target zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which controls protein zzso can regulate the zzso function of zzso by zzso zzso zzso When zzso mice were exposed to cigarette smoke, zzso and zzso levels increased in their zzso and the inflammatory responses were zzso whereas these effects could be reversed by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso was induced by zzso zzso zzso when zzso human zzso zzso cells were exposed to cigarette smoke extract zzso Further examination showed that zzso in turn regulated zzso activity because zzso of zzso zzso activity decreased zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso was dependent on zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression with zzso zzso abolished the zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression zzso decreased the inflammatory response induced by zzso in zzso zzso Our results reveal a new zzso signaling zzso that controls cigarette zzso pulmonary zzso and this may shed light on our understanding of the mechanism of cigarette zzso pulmonary diseases such as chronic zzso pulmonary zzso
