In this study we initially examined the interaction between zzso (a zzso zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso exchange zzso in human zzso tumor cells zzso cell zzso zzso data indicate that both zzso and zzso are expressed in zzso cells and that these two proteins are physically linked as a complex in zzso By using zzso fragments of zzso and in zzso binding zzso we have detected a specific binding interaction between the zzso domain of zzso and the zzso domain of zzso In addition, we have observed that the binding of zzso to zzso activates zzso zzso signaling leading to zzso tumor cell zzso Further analyses indicate that the zzso zzso growth factor zzso protein 2 zzso that is bound to zzso (an zzso zzso is also associated with the zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso cells promotes recruitment of both zzso and zzso to the zzso complex leading to Ras zzso and zzso tumor cell zzso In order to determine the role of zzso in zzso zzso we have zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso Delta zzso that has a deletion in the zzso zzso domain or Delta zzso that has a deletion in the zzso zzso zzso Our results clearly indicate that the zzso domain deletion zzso of zzso zzso the Delta zzso (and to a lesser extent the Delta zzso zzso not only block their association with zzso but also significantly impair their binding to the zzso complex and inhibit zzso zzso tumor cell zzso Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that the interaction of zzso with zzso plays an important role in the zzso of both zzso and Ras signaling that is required for zzso human zzso tumor zzso
