The inner ear develops from a simple zzso zzso known as the zzso zzso Classic zzso zzso rotating the prospective zzso tissue found that the zzso axis was determined before the zzso zzso A small percentage of such zzso also resulted in the formation of mirror duplicated zzso or zzso We demonstrate a different zzso manipulation in the zzso zzso the physical removal or zzso of either the anterior or zzso half of the zzso which results in an even higher percentage of mirror image zzso zzso of the zzso half results in mirror anterior zzso whereas removal of the anterior half results in mirror zzso zzso In contrast, complete zzso results in more variable zzso but never mirror zzso By the time the zzso separates from the surface zzso complete zzso results in no zzso To test for a dosage response, differing amounts of the zzso or zzso were zzso zzso of one third of the zzso resulted in normal zzso whereas two-thirds zzso resulted in abnormal zzso including mirror zzso Recent studies in zzso have demonstrated a role for the zzso zzso signaling zzso in zzso patterning of the developing zzso We have used zzso of zzso interacting protein zzso to block zzso signaling and find that this strategy resulted in mirror zzso of anterior structures, consistent with the results in zzso
