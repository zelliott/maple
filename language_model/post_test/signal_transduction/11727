zzso To study the effects of heat stress on zzso zzso and related zzso zzso signal zzso system zzso zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso zzso Male zzso rats were randomly divided into control group and heat stressed zzso Heat stressed rats were placed in small hot chambers and taken out as soon as their zzso temperatures zzso reached the zzso zzso Then the animals were killed and their zzso were taken zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso method and zzso zzso were used to measure the content of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso activity of zzso zzso During heat stress, when zzso zzso reached zzso degrees C or higher, with increase of zzso zzso content increased zzso When zzso zzso zzso degrees C, zzso content was significantly higher than zzso When zzso zzso zzso degrees C zzso activity was higher than control significantly, zzso content of heat stressed group decreased significantly than zzso zzso increased significantly when zzso zzso zzso degrees C as compared with zzso But if zzso zzso zzso zzso was given an hour before heat stress, zzso decreased and zzso took a longer time to get to zzso degrees zzso zzso During heat stress, zzso zzso zzso signal zzso system was zzso The increase of zzso zzso might be zzso by zzso and zzso zzso may improve zzso
