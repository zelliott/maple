zzso zzso receptors and zzso are expressed by zzso cells within the zzso though relatively little is known about the patterns of zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso We developed zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors to study their expression in human fetal zzso cultured from brain tissue as well as the zzso derived zzso human zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso labeling demonstrated expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso from both zzso zzso studies revealed strong expression of zzso and zzso on both zzso and zzso zzso with a weaker expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis of pure zzso zzso confirmed zzso expression for zzso zzso zzso and zzso No changes in the zzso labeling pattern of zzso zzso expression were noted when zzso zzso were grown on a supporting layer of zzso again consistent with similar patterns seen in primary human fetal brain zzso Analysis of zzso calcium zzso revealed a robust response to zzso derived zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity zzso and variable response to zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, we detected the release of zzso zzso zzso from pure cultures of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that individual zzso may not only zzso multiple functional zzso zzso but also that zzso themselves produce zzso which may influence cellular function within the central nervous zzso
