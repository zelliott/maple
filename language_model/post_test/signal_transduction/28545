zzso is a zzso zzso that regulates zzso positioning in cortical brain structures through the zzso and zzso receptors and the zzso protein zzso In addition to cellular zzso zzso abnormalities are present in the brain of zzso mice lacking zzso It is unclear whether these defects are due primarily to cellular zzso or the absence of zzso Here we examined zzso development in the zzso of normal and zzso mice and in zzso zzso We found that zzso complexity is severely reduced in zzso mice deficient in zzso signaling both in zzso and in zzso and it is also reduced in zzso mice in the absence of cellular zzso zzso of zzso interfering zzso zzso antagonists, and zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso outgrowth from normal zzso whereas addition of zzso zzso rescued the deficit in zzso zzso Thus, the same signaling zzso controls both zzso migration and zzso zzso
