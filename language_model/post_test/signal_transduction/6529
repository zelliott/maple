Signal zzso is one of the most important biological processes by which cells convert an external signal into a zzso Novel zzso approaches to mapping proteins onto signaling pathways are needed to fully take advantage of the rapid zzso of zzso and zzso zzso However, despite their importance, research on signaling pathways reconstruction utilizing large-scale zzso and zzso information has been zzso 

We have developed an approach for predicting the order of signaling zzso zzso assuming all the components on the pathways are zzso Our method is built on a score function that zzso zzso interaction data and zzso gene expression zzso Compared to the individual zzso either protein interactions or gene transcript abundance zzso the integrated approach leads to better identification of the order of the zzso zzso 

As demonstrated in our study on the zzso zzso signaling zzso the integration analysis of zzso zzso and zzso data can be a powerful means to zzso the order of zzso zzso enabling the transformation from molecular data into knowledge of cellular zzso
