zzso zzso zzso zzso is an effective zzso against zzso zzso We have investigated the hypothesis that zzso is also an important zzso zzso released during both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of ex zzso rat hearts was instituted by two cycles of 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso prior to 40 zzso of index zzso and then 40 zzso of zzso zzso resulted in zzso recovery of left zzso developed pressure zzso upon zzso and a small zzso size zzso zzso zzso a specific zzso of zzso and 3) G zzso receptors zzso when present during zzso blocked protection afforded by two cycles of zzso zzso also blocked zzso of isolated rat cardiac zzso subjected to zzso zzso Increased release of zzso from zzso in response to zzso was also zzso These data indicate that zzso is released from zzso in response to zzso and protects by binding to zzso zzso In the ex zzso heart, if a third cycle of zzso was added to increase release of zzso zzso then the need for any individual zzso zzso zzso was diminished and zzso had little zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso likewise inhibited protection by two cycles but not three cycles of zzso but zzso plus zzso inhibited protection by three cycles of zzso Similar to zzso zzso induced by four zzso zzso cycles of 15 s zzso s zzso resulted in zzso recovery of zzso and a zzso zzso zzso When zzso was present during zzso and zzso zzso only recovered by zzso and the zzso size increased to zzso Adding an additional cycle of zzso reduced the zzso effect of zzso and zzso individually, but not their combined zzso These studies reveal that zzso is an important zzso of both zzso and zzso that is released along with zzso during each cycle of zzso or zzso
