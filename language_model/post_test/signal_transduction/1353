Gene zzso is frequently used to explore the molecular and zzso consequences of introduced zzso Breast cancer cell lines zzso with genes for growth factor zzso zzso signaling molecules or genes that generate zzso signals are widely used in basic science and zzso zzso Typically, a target gene of interest is zzso with zzso markers that are generally assumed to be zzso zzso of the cellular zzso by zzso sequences may induce subtle and/or unexpected zzso in protein zzso only some of which may be attributable to the target gene of zzso In this study, we show that zzso resistant zzso cells zzso zzso zzso twice as rapidly in nude mice as do the zzso parent cells, but show similar growth rates in zzso zzso zzso with the zzso gene shows minimal zzso in growth rate in zzso and approximately a zzso increased growth rate in zzso zzso cells that express zzso and yellow fluorescent protein zzso slowly in zzso and show essentially no growth in zzso suggesting that zzso of these tracking proteins adversely affects cellular zzso zzso The molecular basis for zzso in zzso capacity of the zzso zzso is poorly zzso We performed two-dimensional gel zzso zzso to compare relative protein expression among the cell zzso Relative to the parental zzso zzso cell lines displayed numerous zzso expressed proteins zzso to zzso relative to parental zzso zzso of these zzso expressed proteins were identified by mass zzso and included zzso zzso and signaling zzso zzso roles of zzso expressed proteins in altering cellular proliferation are zzso
