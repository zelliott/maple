zzso proteins are zzso signaling molecules that regulate pattern formation during animal zzso Many zzso proteins are zzso modified by addition of zzso zzso zzso provides a crucial signal for patterning the zzso axis of the developing neural plate in zzso However, it is not clear how this protein zzso from its source, the zzso margin, to the target cells in the prospective neural plate, and how zzso might influence zzso propagation and zzso 

We have zzso zzso biologically active, zzso zzso zzso in living zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso to zzso zzso structures in live zzso In zzso expressing cells, these zzso are found on zzso cellular zzso from where the protein can be zzso In addition, zzso is found zzso with zzso zzso clusters on signal receiving zzso Combining in zzso and in zzso zzso we compare the roles of zzso zzso zzso in cell and zzso signaling activity and zzso zzso zzso zzso show these zzso can regulate zzso distribution in producing cell zzso and zzso as well as in the receiving zzso 

Together, our results show that zzso forms dynamic clusters found on zzso donor cell and on signal receiving cell zzso Moreover, they demonstrate a differential requirement of zzso zzso in zzso protein for distribution in producing cells and receiving tissue and signaling activity during zzso zzso
