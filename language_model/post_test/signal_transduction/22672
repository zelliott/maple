zzso are an unusual type of cell in that they send processes zzso and zzso over great zzso This elaborate zzso together with their zzso places zzso at risk for multiple zzso Recent studies have demonstrated that zzso and zzso mechanisms not only contribute to zzso death, but also to synaptic dysfunction and a breakdown in neural zzso (see zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso this zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso families have been implicated in neurodegenerative zzso as their zzso can be triggered by calcium influx and zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso that require zzso zzso for zzso The zzso zzso by zzso include zzso and associated zzso zzso members of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso and zzso precursor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso include zzso and associated zzso zzso and zzso membrane receptors and zzso and steroid zzso Many of the zzso of zzso and zzso are localized in zzso and/or zzso compartments of zzso Emerging data suggest that, in addition to their roles in neurodegenerative zzso zzso and zzso play important roles in modulating synaptic zzso The present article provides a review of the properties of the different zzso and zzso their roles in cell death zzso and the zzso upon which they zzso Emerging data are considered that suggest key roles for these zzso in the regulation of synaptic zzso
