zzso multiple unit recordings were performed in isolated rat zzso zzso to determine a possible effect of zzso oxide zzso on the spontaneous electrical activity of zzso zzso active cells forming clusters of 3-5 cells fell into two zzso more or less regularly firing clusters zzso zzso and zzso discharging clusters with periodically repeated bursts zzso zzso The zzso sodium zzso zzso reduced the discharge rate of the great majority of zzso clusters and of all the zzso clusters zzso Moreover, the burst activity of zzso clusters was zzso These results could be completely reproduced by using another zzso zzso zzso The NO zzso inhibitor zzso had no effect on zzso and zzso zzso The results show that spontaneous electrical activity is an intrinsic function of the rat zzso zzso NO can zzso the electrical activity affecting discharge rate and discharge zzso
