Classic signaling by the zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso involves its binding to target cells that express the zzso zzso zzso zzso However, an alternate signaling zzso exists in which soluble zzso zzso zzso can bind zzso and activate target cells that lack zzso such as zzso zzso This alternate pathway, also termed zzso serves as the major zzso signaling zzso in various zzso zzso conditions including zzso Here we report that zzso is elevated in zzso zzso from zzso cancer patients, where it is associated with poor zzso zzso zzso on zzso cells prevented zzso zzso induced zzso zzso and increased zzso migration of zzso cancer zzso Selective blockade of the zzso zzso with zzso inhibitor zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso complex increased zzso integrity via zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso Selective targeting of zzso zzso in zzso reduced zzso formation and enhanced the zzso sensitivity of zzso human zzso tumor zzso in zzso zzso our results show that increased levels of zzso found in zzso cancer zzso drive zzso zzso on zzso cells, thereby contributing to cancer zzso Selective blockade of zzso zzso may offer a promising therapeutic strategy to improve the management of patients with advanced zzso zzso
