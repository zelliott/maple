The zzso syndrome is becoming increasingly prevalent in the general population and carries significant incremental morbidity and zzso It is associated with zzso involvement and increased zzso zzso resembling a precocious aging zzso The mechanisms that account for this phenomenon are incompletely known, but it is becoming clear that longevity genes might be zzso zzso with zzso or disruption of key lifespan zzso zzso such as silent information regulator zzso zzso and zzso target of zzso zzso lead to development of features of the zzso syndrome in zzso These genes integrate longevity pathways and zzso signals in a complex interplay in which lifespan appears to be strictly dependent on zzso and energy zzso zzso we describe the roles and possible zzso of selected lifespan zzso molecular networks in the development of the zzso syndrome and its zzso describing initial available data in zzso Additional pathways are involved in linking zzso availability and zzso certainly including insulin and zzso Growth zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso The model described in this viewpoint article is therefore likely to be an zzso Nevertheless, it represents one starting platform for understanding cell biology of lifespan in relation to the zzso zzso
