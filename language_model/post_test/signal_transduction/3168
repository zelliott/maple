There is growing evidence that the complement zzso product zzso positively or zzso regulates inflammatory zzso The studies presented here report that zzso exerts zzso effects by altering production of the zzso zzso and zzso during zzso shock in young adult male zzso mice and has similar effects on zzso from the same zzso zzso and zzso both appeared in plasma during zzso and their zzso improved zzso The relevant sources of zzso during zzso were not zzso cells, zzso T cells, or zzso cells but zzso zzso The addition in zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso dose zzso antagonized the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso This suppression required the zzso zzso but was independent of the second zzso zzso zzso zzso absence of zzso was associated with much higher levels of zzso and zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso its effects on the zzso axis in a zzso zzso zzso caused zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso resulting in induction of zzso which powerfully inhibited production of zzso and zzso These data identify previously unknown mechanisms by which the zzso zzso limits acute inflammation and zzso the zzso zzso
