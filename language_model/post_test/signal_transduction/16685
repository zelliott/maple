Feeding in zzso zzso zzso was induced by the general zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and by three different zzso zzso known to specifically stimulate different classes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which stimulates group I zzso zzso which stimulates group II zzso and zzso which stimulates some group III zzso zzso exposing larvae to combinations of specific zzso zzso and specific signal zzso zzso suggest that each tested zzso uses a different signaling zzso First, feeding zzso effects of zzso were abolished by zzso C zzso U zzso but remained unaffected by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Second, zzso induced feeding in presence of U zzso or zzso but lost its feeding zzso effects in presence of zzso zzso Finally, zzso did not induce feeding in presence of zzso but maintained its feeding zzso effects in presence of U zzso or zzso zzso The activity of the general zzso zzso zzso zzso was abolished by zzso zzso and zzso U zzso did not affect zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso taste in the zzso zzso zzso relies mostly on zzso signaling zzso
