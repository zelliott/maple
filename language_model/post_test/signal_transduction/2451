Our previous studies have shown that the zzso B virus zzso X, activates all three classes of zzso zzso III zzso zzso promoters by increasing the cellular level of zzso protein zzso zzso Wang et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a limiting zzso component zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have investigated whether these zzso events are dependent on the zzso of the zzso signaling zzso zzso expression of a zzso zzso Ras gene zzso in a zzso zzso stable cell line expressing X zzso or incubation of the cells with a Ras zzso zzso specifically blocked both the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso gene and the increase in cellular zzso zzso zzso expression of a zzso activated form of Ras zzso in control zzso cells produced both an increase in zzso gene zzso and an increase in cellular zzso zzso These events are not cell type specific since zzso gene induction was also shown to be dependent on Ras zzso in a stable rat zzso cell line expressing zzso Furthermore, increases in zzso pol zzso gene activity and zzso levels could be restored in zzso cells expressing zzso by zzso a zzso activated form of zzso These events are serum dependent, and when the cells are serum zzso the zzso effects are zzso Together, these results demonstrate that the zzso induction of zzso pol zzso genes and increase in zzso are both dependent on the zzso of the zzso signaling zzso In addition, these studies define two new and important consequences zzso by the zzso of the Ras signal zzso zzso an increase in the central zzso factor, zzso and the induction of zzso pol zzso gene zzso
