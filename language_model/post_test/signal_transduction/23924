It has been previously demonstrated that zzso can protect zzso from a variety of zzso including zzso zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso can rapidly zzso zzso signaling pathways involved in cell zzso In particular, zzso activates protein zzso C zzso in a variety of cell zzso This zzso plays a key role in many cellular events, including regulation of zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso rapidly increases zzso activity in primary cultures of rat zzso zzso A 1 h zzso with zzso or zzso zzso a potent zzso of zzso protects zzso against zzso zzso Protection afforded by both zzso and zzso is blocked by pharmacological zzso of zzso Further, depletion of zzso levels resulting from prolonged zzso exposure prevents subsequent zzso or zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso activates zzso in zzso and that zzso zzso is an important step in zzso protection against zzso These data provide new understanding into the zzso underlying zzso zzso an action with therapeutic relevance to Alzheimer's disease and other age-related neurodegenerative zzso
