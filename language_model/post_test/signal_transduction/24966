The role of zzso growth factor zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso gene expression in the human breast cancer cell line zzso was zzso Treatment of cells with zzso zzso zzso resulted in an approximately zzso decrease in zzso protein concentration by 6 h and the amount of zzso remained suppressed for 24 zzso zzso binding zzso demonstrated that the decrease in zzso protein corresponded to a similar decrease zzso zzso in zzso binding zzso Although zzso treatment resulted in a decrease in the number of binding sites, it had no effect on the binding affinity of zzso The zzso constant of the zzso complex in the presence or absence of zzso was the same zzso M in control cells versus zzso M in zzso zzso The decrease in zzso protein concentration paralleled a decrease in the zzso amount of zzso zzso By 9 h there was an approximately zzso decrease in zzso zzso The amount of zzso zzso remained suppressed for 48 zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that there was a decrease of approximately zzso in zzso gene zzso upon zzso treatment, suggesting that the mechanism by which zzso regulates zzso gene expression is zzso In addition to regulating the amount of zzso zzso affected the activity of the zzso At high zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso and high zzso of zzso had an additive effect on zzso zzso In contrast to high zzso low zzso of zzso had no effect on zzso zzso and blocked zzso zzso The effects of zzso on zzso expression were inhibited by zzso and zzso suggesting that the effects of the growth factor are zzso by the zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso When the cells were placed in zzso medium and then treated with zzso there was no effect on zzso protein concentration or zzso However, increasing zzso of serum restored the effects of zzso on zzso suggesting that an additional serum factor was required for the zzso effect on the decrease in zzso protein zzso
