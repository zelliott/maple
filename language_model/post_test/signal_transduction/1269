The zzso family of genes have been identified as potential targets for therapeutic intervention because of zzso zzso in different human zzso They are zzso in zzso cell lung cancer zzso approximately zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso is involved in zzso modification of the zzso proteins by zzso linking a zzso group to the zzso zzso This permits the zzso protein to be zzso to the surface zzso allowing the protein to be involved in signaling for increased proliferation and zzso of zzso The class of zzso zzso zzso is designed to block zzso and prevent the mature zzso signaling and thus inhibit cell proliferation and facilitate zzso Multiple agents that inhibit zzso have been developed, and two zzso zzso zzso have been tested in patients with lung cancer in three Phase II zzso zzso has been studied in patients with zzso and in patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer zzso after zzso There has been a single trial of zzso in patients with zzso zzso No objective tumor responses in patients with stage zzso zzso were seen in these zzso There were also no objective responses among the 22 patients with relapsed zzso treated with zzso The median survival for the 44 patients with zzso treated with zzso was approximately 8 months, whereas it was 11 months for the 23 patients treated with zzso zzso and zzso were well tolerated in these studies but showed no significant activity as zzso therapy in relapsed zzso or zzso zzso
