zzso is the development of blood zzso from pre-existing zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso is a key regulator of vessel growth and regression, and acts as an zzso survival factor by protecting zzso cells from zzso Many genes involved in cell proliferation and zzso are regulated by the nuclear factor zzso B zzso zzso factor zzso This study aimed to address the hypothesis that zzso survival effects on zzso involve zzso Using an zzso reporter zzso we observed zzso of zzso following zzso treatment of human zzso vein zzso zzso This was confirmed using zzso mobility shift zzso and found to involve nuclear zzso of zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso occurred without degradation of zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso Instead, zzso zzso of zzso was observed following zzso treatment, suggesting zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso zzso of either native zzso or of zzso in which zzso zzso 42 was zzso to zzso inhibited induction of zzso zzso activity in response to zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso for the zzso protein zzso and cell survival following serum withdrawal was reduced following zzso zzso This study highlights that different molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso may be involved downstream of stimuli which activate the zzso lining of blood zzso
