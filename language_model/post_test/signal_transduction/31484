zzso zzso transcripts undergo extensive alternative zzso and zzso processes the zzso following their zzso Since zzso have been ascribed zzso activities, we asked if a lack of zzso processing by zzso affects zzso signaling and consequently alters zzso zzso site zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso between control and zzso revealed no differences in the zzso zzso We characterized 3 previously unidentified zzso alternatively spliced transcripts and demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso are processed by zzso zzso with zzso 8 were expressed approximately zzso less than those with zzso zzso zzso of the mouse and rat zzso gene structures confirmed that zzso 8 arose in a zzso of zzso 4 through 5, with zzso of the copy downstream of zzso zzso No downstream zzso sequences zzso to zzso 4-5 were present in the bovine or human zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso occurred only in zzso
