A zzso zzso microscope with an zzso zzso laser and a digital imaging zzso microscope were used to study calcium signals in class zzso killer T cells after interaction with target zzso Here, we used two kinds of zzso specific zzso killer T cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and target cells, zzso zzso cells zzso and B cell zzso zzso zzso After interaction with target cells, the zzso free calcium zzso concentration zzso in zzso cells zzso increased rapidly with short zzso (several zzso The zzso in zzso cells zzso however, increased with much longer zzso zzso of zzso The results were consistent with previous findings that the zzso activity of zzso cells zzso was much greater than that of zzso cells zzso
