The action of zzso zzso impacts female zzso Although zzso was recently shown to inhibit zzso activity in human zzso tubes in zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso signaling to zzso function remain zzso Here, we investigate the cellular zzso regulation, and possible function of two zzso receptors zzso alpha and zzso in mouse and human zzso tubes in zzso We show that zzso alpha is restricted to the zzso of zzso cells in both mouse and human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso causes a zzso decrease in zzso alpha zzso which is blocked by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Exposure of different zzso zzso zzso or zzso demonstrated an zzso zzso regulation of zzso alpha in mouse zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso cells in mice but not in zzso In humans, zzso was found in the muscle cells and was decreased in the zzso and zzso zzso during the zzso cycles, indicating a zzso expression and regulation of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso alpha and zzso in zzso knockout mice was found to be zzso however, zzso treatment increased zzso zzso but not zzso in zzso knockout mice when compared with zzso zzso Furthermore, expression levels of zzso zzso but not zzso decreased in parallel with zzso accelerated zzso complex zzso transport in mouse zzso zzso Our findings open the possibility that zzso zzso alpha may play a role in the regulation of zzso transport and suggest an zzso zzso of zzso alpha in the zzso zzso
