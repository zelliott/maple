zzso acid has been implicated as a second zzso in insulin zzso by zzso of zzso zzso the major zzso zzso increases zzso zzso zzso in zzso We now show, for the first time, that the zzso zzso zzso at zzso which stimulate insulin zzso causes a rapid and nearly zzso increase in zzso acid zzso in zzso The combination of zzso and zzso has an additive effect on zzso zzso zzso There is a large component of zzso zzso zzso that is independent of zzso zzso zzso stimulation of zzso acid release is zzso by zzso of zzso zzso as demonstrated by early increases in zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso also appears to involve zzso zzso since the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso partly inhibited zzso acid zzso In contrast, zzso zzso acid zzso appears to reflect zzso zzso zzso Our observations indicate that zzso zzso has an important role in zzso insulin zzso
