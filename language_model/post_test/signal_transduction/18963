To search for the signaling critical for the production of tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso we investigated the role of zzso in zzso production with zzso A zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso Con zzso dramatically activated zzso zzso In contrast, production of zzso in response to Con zzso was severely impaired in cells expressing zzso zzso whose 65 zzso acids in the zzso domain were zzso Con zzso activated dual signaling zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso significantly inhibited the production of zzso whereas zzso a specific inhibitor for zzso could zzso Finally, expression of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells clearly rescued zzso zzso and zzso production in response to Con zzso Taken together, our results strongly suggest that zzso plays a critical role as a positive zzso for the production of zzso via zzso signaling in zzso
