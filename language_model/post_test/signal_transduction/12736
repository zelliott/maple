It is well established that zzso promotes zzso zzso and zzso production by B cells via the zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso However, scavenger receptors zzso are also capable of binding such zzso zzso yet their contribution to zzso signaling events has not yet been zzso Here we identified a novel zzso mechanism of zzso signaling and immune function that is zzso by the scavenger B1 zzso zzso Specifically, we show that zzso triggers calcium entry into primary B zzso via zzso C zzso zzso of zzso channels and also B cell zzso to vascular cell zzso zzso zzso calcium signals and vascular cell zzso zzso zzso are zzso and are zzso exclusively by zzso Although zzso zzso and zzso production induced by zzso require zzso zzso we also found that zzso zzso regulates zzso production of zzso zzso and zzso Thus, our results provide a novel perspective on the complexity of zzso signaling within B cells by demonstrating that zzso is an alternative zzso for zzso zzso signaling that provides feedback zzso on specific zzso responses of B zzso zzso these results have wide implications for understanding the mechanisms regulating immune tolerance to zzso acids and zzso zzso
