zzso zzso is the plant cell surface zzso that perceives bacterial zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso responses, and contributes to bacterial growth zzso zzso zzso also leads to zzso zzso and degradation of zzso within 1 zzso Why plant cells remove this zzso precisely at the time during which its function is required remains mainly zzso Here, we assessed in zzso zzso competency in the context of zzso degradation of zzso zzso and chemical interference known to impede zzso zzso of zzso into zzso zzso Within 1 h after an initial zzso treatment, zzso zzso zzso leaf tissue was unable to zzso zzso signaling in a zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso degradation of zzso zzso may serve to zzso cells to the same stimulus zzso zzso likely to prevent continuous signal output upon repetitive zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso degradation, zzso with the zzso trafficking zzso zzso or zzso zzso impaired zzso zzso oxygen species production that was partially independent of zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, these zzso did not affect zzso zzso protein zzso zzso indicating the ability to zzso zzso trafficking zzso to target different zzso zzso For zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso oxygen species could be separated from the zzso in zzso zzso At later times zzso zzso after the initial zzso zzso recovery of zzso protein levels positively correlated with zzso to zzso indicating that zzso new synthesis of zzso may prepare cells for a new round of monitoring the environment for zzso
