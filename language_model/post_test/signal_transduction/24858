zzso activates zzso of the zzso zzso genes in response to zzso and is zzso during interaction with the zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso One zzso at zzso is necessary for full zzso induction and is zzso by zzso of the zzso Pol II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is necessary for sensitive response to zzso and its requirement for zzso induction can be zzso by high zzso of zzso in strains expressing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs independently of zzso and is responsible for the long-term adaptation response observed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso are shown to represent parallel mechanisms for zzso gene zzso These results demonstrate that zzso activity is controlled by two independent zzso one that acts through zzso and a second that is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Since zzso is regulated independently of zzso our results suggest a function for zzso in zzso responses to specific zzso with the environment through the zzso of zzso zzso
