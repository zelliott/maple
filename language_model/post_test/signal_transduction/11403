zzso family zzso zzso and zzso are pivotal regulators of zzso in multiple cell zzso However, little is known about the mechanism by which these zzso are regulated in response to zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso a zzso zzso zzso exchange factor, is zzso by zzso during zzso zzso zzso occurs in multiple cell lines in response to diverse zzso stimuli such as zzso zzso and serum zzso zzso occurs at zzso zzso of zzso and removes the zzso of zzso two zzso zzso zzso leaving a stable zzso containing the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This leads to functional zzso of zzso as determined by failure of the zzso product to stimulate zzso loading of zzso in zzso Furthermore, this product is defective in signaling to two independent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and serum response zzso Finally, we demonstrate that in cells treated with zzso zzso of zzso coincided with the zzso of zzso zzso These results reveal a novel mechanism for regulating zzso zzso exchange factor activity and zzso signaling zzso
