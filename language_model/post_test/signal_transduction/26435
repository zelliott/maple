zzso of the rotator cuff muscles is a factor that zzso the treatment of a massive rotator cuff tear zzso However, the molecular mechanisms that govern the development of muscle zzso after zzso have not been well zzso The zzso target of zzso zzso signaling zzso plays a central role in maintaining muscle mass in response to mechanical zzso The role of this zzso in the development of muscle zzso after a massive zzso remains zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the regulation of the zzso zzso in the development of muscle zzso after a zzso and zzso nerve zzso zzso We evaluated the activity of the zzso signaling zzso and how this zzso interacts with two zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso muscles of rats that underwent unilateral complete rotator cuff zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso activity was significantly reduced after zzso zzso but increased after nerve zzso zzso and zzso were only zzso following zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso leads to a decrease in protein synthesis with zzso of the zzso signaling pathway, whereas zzso leads to an increase in protein degradation via zzso of expression of zzso and zzso
