The zzso zzso signaling regulates tissue development, and its zzso zzso is a leading cause of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso often occurs in zzso with other mechanisms, such as loss of zzso the master regulator of the DNA damage zzso To date, little is known about mechanisms connecting zzso events to zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso stress triggers a cascade of signals, culminating with zzso of the activity of zzso the final zzso zzso of zzso zzso This zzso is dependent on the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso we identify zzso as a novel zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso but not a zzso with a deletion of its zzso domain, zzso zzso signaling in response to DNA damage by promoting zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso levels zzso the growth arrest and zzso effect triggered by zzso zzso zzso zzso agents fail to inhibit zzso activity in the absence of either zzso or zzso Finally, zzso samples from zzso mice display low levels of zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso suggesting zzso as potential therapeutic target in zzso zzso Together, our data define a mechanism of zzso of a zzso signaling in response to zzso stress and unveil a zzso zzso centered on zzso that limits zzso zzso and zzso zzso
