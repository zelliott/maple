The zzso family of proteins zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling via zzso zzso and zzso These proteins contain two functional zzso a zzso finger domain with zzso zzso activity, and a zzso rich domain zzso the formation of protein zzso The zzso zzso gene encodes two zzso zzso and zzso While both contain a zzso finger domain, the zzso rich domain is absent from zzso We demonstrate that expression of either zzso is sufficient to rescue both the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso and the adult zzso characteristic of zzso zzso suggesting that both zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, targeted zzso of zzso but not zzso results in zzso characteristic of reduced zzso signaling and suppresses the effect of zzso zzso zzso The level of zzso was significantly correlated with the zzso severity of reduced zzso zzso suggesting that zzso controls the efficiency of zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, reduced zzso function suppresses the effects of zzso zzso in zzso cells, suggesting that zzso promotes zzso of activated zzso zzso is detected in a zzso zzso pattern, whereas zzso is mainly localized at the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso may zzso zzso through distinct zzso
