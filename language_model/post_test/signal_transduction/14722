It is well known that zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso seed zzso Recent circumstantial evidence suggests that salicylic acid zzso also zzso seed zzso in zzso and zzso Our study shows that zzso blocks barley seed zzso in a dosage dependent zzso As an initial effort to addressing the mechanism controlling the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso signaling in zzso we studied the regulation of zzso by zzso and a zzso gene whose expression is modulated by these zzso zzso of zzso activity reveal that zzso zzso production in zzso cells is inhibited by zzso zzso but not its zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso This zzso effect is unlikely due to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analyses indicate that zzso suppresses zzso expression of a barley low zzso zzso gene zzso Because our previous data indicate that zzso and zzso zzso genes inhibit the expression of zzso genes in rice, we studied the steady state zzso levels of a barley zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso in barley zzso cells is zzso by zzso but zzso by zzso and zzso However, the regulation of zzso by zzso appears to be different from that of zzso in term of the zzso and levels of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells by particle zzso blocks zzso induction of the zzso promoter reporter construct zzso zzso zzso might serve as a zzso zzso of zzso and zzso signal pathways involved in suppressing zzso seed zzso
