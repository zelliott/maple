The purpose of the present study was to further examine the hypothesis that zzso of G zzso zzso 54 zzso signaling at the end of the juvenile phase of zzso development is responsible for initiation of zzso and the onset of zzso zzso we determined whether repetitive zzso administration of the zzso zzso zzso zzso (2 zzso as a brief zzso infusion once every hour for 48 zzso to the juvenile male zzso monkey would prematurely elicit zzso zzso release of zzso zzso the neuroendocrine trigger for zzso zzso release was monitored indirectly by measuring zzso zzso from the in zzso zzso the zzso responsiveness of which had been heightened before the experiment with an intermittent zzso infusion of synthetic zzso zzso animals zzso zzso 4) were employed to eliminate any zzso and secondary effects of changing feedback signals from the zzso The first brief infusion of zzso evoked an zzso discharge that zzso those produced by zzso zzso and this was followed by a train of similar zzso zzso in response to hourly zzso of zzso by repetitive zzso zzso zzso treatment with a zzso zzso zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso administration also provided a zzso signal to zzso zzso These findings are consistent with the notion that, in zzso the transition from the juvenile zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso state is controlled by zzso of zzso resulting from increased expression of zzso zzso and release of zzso in this region of the zzso
