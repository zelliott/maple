The zzso balance determines the nature of an immune response, and particular zzso zzso and zzso determine the direction at the initial stage of zzso through zzso To investigate how zzso networks and related signaling pathways impact upon the zzso balance, we have developed a computer model for the simulation of zzso zzso The model includes the zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso a positive and negative feedback mechanism for zzso signaling and zzso negative regulators such as zzso of zzso signaling zzso zzso and zzso In the present study, we propose a zzso zzso in which zzso T cells differentiate neither into zzso nor into zzso states in zzso zzso zzso The model was found to be consistent with experimental results in zzso zzso The results of in zzso analysis in the condition with zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and transgenic states were well fitted to ex zzso experimental results for zzso and zzso differentiation profiles in the deficient and transgenic zzso The zzso model suggested the possibility that dominant zzso differentiation in zzso zzso mice may be due to a positive feedback effect of initial zzso production from T zzso The in zzso assessment of beneficial effects of zzso drugs by simulation analysis with our zzso model indicated that zzso zzso zzso zzso might be suitable candidates for the modification of zzso immune zzso Our results demonstrate that models for the simulation of signaling network, such as our zzso model, are useful tools for the in zzso evaluation of novel drug zzso
