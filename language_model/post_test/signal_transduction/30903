The zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso axis zzso in the zzso zzso zzso models suggest that zzso zzso binding of zzso to an zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso also has a crucial function in cellular transformation that is independent of zzso and zzso However, how zzso zzso pathways function in zzso has remained zzso We have generated zzso zzso carrying the zzso acid substitution zzso which blocks the zzso signaling both in embryonic stem cells and zzso zzso In zzso mouse zzso zzso fails to expand its own expression domain and that of zzso indicating that zzso is essential in zzso to stimulate zzso zzso zzso In sharp contrast to zzso zzso zzso zzso establish an zzso axis and initiate zzso zzso Our findings provide in zzso evidence that zzso is required in the zzso zzso to activate an zzso feedback loop, whereas it can promote zzso axis formation and initiate zzso movements independently of its zzso effect on the zzso zzso signaling zzso
