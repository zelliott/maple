Over the past decade, we have learned that cellular zzso including zzso and zzso are highly zzso and that relevant changes in zzso state can occur at zzso zzso Moreover, we have learned that individual cells in zzso or as part of a zzso exist in different zzso If we want to understand zzso processes and zzso better, it will be necessary to measure zzso and zzso responses of individual cells with high zzso and spatial zzso Fluorescence imaging has revolutionized all aspects of biology since it has the potential to provide information on the cellular and zzso distribution of zzso and zzso with zzso time zzso In the present review we zzso recent progress in zzso zzso and zzso in populations of zzso cells as well as in individual zzso cells with the help of quantitative fluorescent zzso namely zzso zzso zzso We discuss the opportunities and potential pitfalls and the controls that help zzso zzso
