zzso differentiation of zzso stem cells zzso is critical for successful cartilage zzso Several methods have been developed to attempt to zzso zzso because zzso differentiated cells can form stable cartilage and induce expression of a zzso zzso In this study, we found that both zzso and zzso induced differentiation into zzso of zzso through zzso of protein zzso A zzso zzso The small zzso zzso was identified by zzso analysis as a potential zzso of zzso zzso zzso induced the expression of the zzso marker, zzso as well as zzso We searched that zzso regulates protein level of zzso When zzso was zzso into zzso zzso differentiation was zzso We confirmed the target of zzso using a reporter gene zzso Furthermore, not only zzso or zzso cells, but also cell zzso with zzso and zzso differentiated into zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso thereby inducing zzso differentiation by zzso zzso of zzso zzso
