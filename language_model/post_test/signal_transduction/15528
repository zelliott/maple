zzso have been reported to possess zzso zzso Not much is known, however, about the effects and mechanism of action of synthetic zzso cannabinoids on breast cancer growth and zzso We have shown that the zzso receptors zzso and zzso are zzso in primary human breast tumors compared with normal breast zzso We have also observed that the breast cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso express zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, we have shown that the zzso synthetic zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibit cell proliferation and migration under in zzso zzso These results were confirmed in zzso in various mouse model zzso Mice treated with zzso or zzso showed a zzso to 50% reduction in tumor growth and a zzso to zzso reduction in lung zzso These effects were reversed by zzso and zzso zzso AM 251 and zzso respectively, suggesting involvement of zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso was shown to delay and reduce zzso zzso tumors in the zzso middle T zzso zzso transgenic mouse model zzso Upon further zzso we observed that zzso and zzso mediate the breast zzso effects via a coordinated regulation of zzso zzso signaling pathways and induction of zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso receptors could be used to develop novel therapeutic strategies against breast cancer growth and zzso
