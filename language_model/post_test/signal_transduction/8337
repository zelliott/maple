It is well established that zzso receptors zzso play a critical role in the generation of innate immune responses and thereby also play an important, indirect role in the initiation of subsequent zzso T cell zzso However, T cells also express certain zzso and we have focused on the zzso importance of direct zzso signaling in T zzso zzso can function as zzso receptors that complement zzso signals to enhance zzso T cell zzso survival and zzso zzso We also found that zzso signaling pathways in T cells are required for the effective zzso expansion of zzso T cells during infection in zzso Thus, the importance of zzso in T zzso immunity reflects both T zzso and T zzso zzso which warrants a reconsideration of the dogma that restricts zzso zzso pattern recognition to cells of the innate immune zzso
