Gene therapy has been regarded as an innovative potential treatment against serious zzso zzso However, applications of gene therapy remain zzso partly because its clinical success depends on therapeutic zzso cells acquiring a zzso zzso To address this problem, we have developed the zzso genetically modified cell amplification zzso system, which uses zzso receptors to enable the selective proliferation of zzso zzso In this report, we describe mimicry of zzso signaling and its application to the zzso zzso We created an zzso zzso in which the zzso domain of zzso is replaced with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso A genetically modified mouse zzso cell line carrying this zzso showed selective expansion in the presence of zzso zzso zzso as a growth zzso By further engineering the zzso domain of the zzso to reduce zzso interaction we attained stricter zzso Since zzso is an important zzso in the expansion of zzso stem cells zzso this zzso zzso could be a promising tool for gene therapy targeting zzso
