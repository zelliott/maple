Flowers are icons in zzso studies of complex zzso The vast majority of 250,000 zzso plant species have flowers with a zzso organ plan bearing zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso The zzso model for the activity of the so-called ABC zzso floral genes has guided extensive experimental studies in zzso zzso and many other plant zzso However, a zzso and zzso explanation for the ABC model and prevalence among flowering plants is zzso Here, we put forward a simple discrete model that zzso logical rules that formally zzso published ABC and zzso gene interaction data for zzso floral organ cell fate determination and zzso this data into a dynamic network zzso This model shows that all possible initial conditions zzso to few steady gene activity states that match gene expression profiles observed zzso in primordial floral organ cells of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the network proposed here provides a zzso explanation for the ABC model and shows that precise signaling pathways are not required to restrain cell types to those found in zzso but these are rather determined by the overall gene network zzso Furthermore, we performed zzso analyses that clearly show that the cell types recovered depend on the network architecture rather than on specific values of the zzso gene interaction zzso These results support the hypothesis that such a network constitutes a zzso zzso and hence provide a possible explanation for the overall conservation of the ABC model and overall floral plan among zzso In addition, we have been able to predict the effects of differences in network architecture between zzso and zzso zzso
