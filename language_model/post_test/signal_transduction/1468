zzso zzso stress can activate zzso zzso and zzso in vascular zzso zzso This study was designed to establish the role of zzso as an upstream zzso in the zzso stress zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of bovine zzso zzso cells zzso were subjected to a zzso stress of 12 zzso over intervals ranging from zzso to 30 zzso zzso stress increased zzso zzso to zzso of control and zzso association with the regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso The zzso zzso activity measured in zzso complexes increased to zzso in response to zzso suggesting that the zzso stress zzso of zzso zzso involves its association with zzso Furthermore, the zzso stress induction of zzso was attenuated by a negative zzso of zzso Finally, zzso stress caused an zzso of zzso zzso only in zzso seeded onto zzso zzso or zzso but not zzso Our results suggest that zzso plays a critical role in the zzso stress induction of zzso zzso and zzso activities, and that this zzso zzso requires the interaction of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso
