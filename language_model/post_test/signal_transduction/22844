The zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the development of sporadic zzso associated with the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso syndrome zzso zzso in sporadic zzso cell zzso zzso of the skin and zzso have been found in genes zzso all three proteins of the zzso A substantial proportion of breast zzso has recently been suggested to contain zzso zzso in the human patched zzso and sonic zzso zzso zzso However, an independent study showed that the implicated zzso in zzso zzso was absent in a large number of zzso zzso breast, zzso and zzso zzso We searched for the zzso zzso zzso in 84 primary breast zzso but did not detect this change in any zzso In addition, a subset of 45 primary breast zzso was zzso for zzso in the zzso coding region and 48 samples in previously implicated zzso of human zzso but no zzso were zzso Although our results do not exclude the presence of zzso zzso of these genes in a small proportion of breast zzso these data do not support the existence of frequent zzso in genes zzso major protein partners of this zzso zzso The absence of zzso changes in zzso may point to another linked gene in the zzso region zzso previously suggested to contain a breast cancer zzso zzso
