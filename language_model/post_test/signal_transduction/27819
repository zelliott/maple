The developing limb is an excellent model for pattern formation in zzso zzso zzso by the polarizing region controls limb pattern across the zzso axis of the chick zzso It was suggested first on theoretical grounds that zzso by the polarizing region could involve a zzso zzso zzso zzso provided evidence consistent with this model and, more recently, zzso molecules associated with the polarizing region have been identified and tested for their role as zzso It is still not clear whether any of the known molecules act directly as a zzso The extension of the zzso model to patterning along the other axes of the limb has been proposed but this may not be zzso
