zzso zzso of G protein zzso proteins are zzso proteins for the zzso zzso of zzso G proteins and act to regulate signaling by rapidly cycling G zzso zzso proteins may integrate receptors and signaling pathways by physical or kinetic scaffolding zzso To determine whether this results in enhancement and/or selectivity of zzso zzso we have prepared zzso cells zzso expressing the zzso zzso and either zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso zzso We have compared the zzso of G zzso zzso of zzso zzso stimulation of zzso calcium release, and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso between cells expressing zzso zzso that is either zzso or zzso The zzso zzso zzso and partial zzso zzso were much more potent and/or had an increased zzso effect in zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso in cells expressing zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso increases in zzso calcium were less zzso The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the zzso protein activity of zzso proteins provides a control that limits zzso action through zzso pathways and may contribute to selectivity of zzso of zzso signaling zzso
