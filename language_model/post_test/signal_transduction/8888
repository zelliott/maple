zzso how molecular signaling pathways participate in behavioral responses requires determining precisely in which zzso populations they are zzso The recent development of bacterial artificial zzso zzso transgenic mice expressing a variety of reporters, zzso zzso or zzso zzso driven by specific zzso is a significant step forward in this zzso These mice help overcome the limitations of traditional approaches that examine an average of signaling events occurring in mixed populations of zzso Here, we review how recent studies using such tools have revisited the regulation of zzso signaling zzso demonstrating the striking segregation between zzso expressing zzso D1 and zzso receptors and significantly extending our overall knowledge of zzso zzso Thus, zzso transgenic mice are changing the way to conceive experiments and provide an opportunity to fill the gaps between molecular and systems zzso
