The role of zzso receptors zzso in the protective effect of restraint stress zzso before acoustic trauma was studied in spiral zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso increased zzso and protected against elevated auditory brain stem thresholds caused by acoustic zzso This protection was inhibited by the zzso with a zzso synthesis zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by acoustic trauma caused an immediate increase in zzso that triggered nuclear zzso of zzso without a change in the expression of zzso zzso zzso + zzso before zzso and acoustic trauma caused an immediate increase in zzso zzso followed by increased zzso protein expression (24 h after zzso zzso signaling was further characterized by analyzing nuclear zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso was reduced after acoustic trauma or zzso with zzso + zzso before zzso and acoustic zzso On the contrary, zzso protected against the zzso zzso zzso reduction of its nuclear zzso in zzso (I zzso zzso zzso + zzso caused a simultaneous decreased I zzso expression and zzso zzso nuclear zzso demonstrating an interference with the I zzso zzso of zzso zzso In zzso zzso protects the zzso from acoustic trauma by increasing zzso and zzso zzso These results emphasis how zzso activity zzso hearing sensitivity and its importance for the rationale use of zzso in inner ear zzso
