The actions of zzso zzso drugs possessing a wide range of chemical structures and pharmacological actions, and zzso agents which modify zzso zzso signals or zzso functions were investigated for their potential to modify in zzso the zzso zzso zzso in bovine zzso cartilage induced by zzso alpha zzso It was found that: zzso none of the conventional zzso agents exhibited any zzso effects on zzso induced zzso of zzso with the exception of the weak effects observed with the iron zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso agent zzso was a potent inhibitor but the zzso zzso which does not inhibit DNA synthesis was without zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of cartilage degrading zzso from zzso also inhibited zzso induced zzso as did natural zzso C zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso but not agents previously shown to inhibit the zzso zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso stimulating hormone, zzso zzso while no effects were observed with drugs that alter the zzso production of zzso zzso those which affect zzso of calcium zzso did inhibit zzso zzso by zzso The results suggest that zzso induced cartilage zzso degradation can be regulated at the level of zzso production of zzso zzso degrading zzso or their activity, regulating calcium zzso into zzso or by overcoming the zzso degradation from zzso by stimulating the synthesis of these zzso
