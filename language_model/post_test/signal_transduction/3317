The vascular system developed early in zzso It is required in large zzso organisms for the transport of zzso zzso and waste products to and from zzso The vascular system is composed of hollow tubes, which have a high level of complexity in zzso zzso describes the de zzso formation of blood vessels, zzso zzso formation in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso is the formation of blood vessels from zzso ones, zzso zzso of zzso blood vessels from the zzso zzso the zzso of all blood vessels in zzso is lined and formed by zzso zzso In both zzso and zzso zzso formation takes place in a zzso of zzso zzso It involves a complex molecular mechanism composed of zzso cell zzso at the zzso contacts within the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell shape zzso As the vascular system also zzso in the course of many diseases, such as cancer, stroke, and zzso zzso it is important to understand and make use of the molecular mechanisms of blood vessel formation to better understand and manipulate the zzso zzso
