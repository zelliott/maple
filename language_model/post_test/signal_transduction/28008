zzso growth zzso zzso is a potent zzso zzso The molecular mechanism underlying zzso zzso however, has not been completely zzso In this study, we showed that zzso beta decreased the zzso zzso content in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which was followed by an increase in collagen I zzso content and collagen protein zzso Prevention of zzso depletion with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso collagen production, whereas a decrease in zzso zzso content with zzso an inhibitor of de zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso collagen zzso These results suggest that zzso depletion induced by zzso may mediate zzso collagen zzso In addition, we showed that zzso zzso zzso production and increased release of zzso from the cells, whereas zzso zzso decreased zzso and zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso added or continuously generated by zzso zzso enhanced zzso collagen production, whereas suppression of zzso production by zzso an zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso collagen zzso These data further suggest that zzso oxygen species are involved in zzso collagen production and that the effect of zzso depletion on zzso collagen production may be zzso by zzso zzso oxygen species zzso
