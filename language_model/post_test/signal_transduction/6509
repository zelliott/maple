The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein belongs to a distinct group of hybrid regulatory sensor proteins that bear a zzso linked zzso receiver zzso zzso has an zzso zzso zzso domain, which is shared with many other hybrid zzso The zzso zzso protein had zzso zzso A truncated zzso lacking the receiver domain, had a zzso zzso zzso However, this truncated protein still efficiently zzso the zzso receiver domain in zzso This indicates that, in the full-length zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso domain is zzso only zzso and that most of the zzso label accumulates in the zzso receiver zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso gene is required for zzso zzso induction of the zzso zzso The presence of a functional zzso gene is not zzso An zzso zzso strain lacking zzso could not be zzso with a truncated copy of the gene lacking the receiver zzso This indicates that the zzso receiver domain is an intermediate in the signal zzso zzso that links oxygen limitation to induction of the zzso promoter in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
