zzso tissue development is initiated during zzso by the migration of zzso tissue zzso zzso cells from the fetal liver to the zzso where they induce the formation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the fetal liver, a subset of common zzso zzso zzso that expresses the zzso zzso gives rise to zzso cells, a process strictly dependent on the expression of the zzso zzso zzso and the nuclear hormone zzso zzso zzso orphan zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso and zzso are zzso zzso during zzso cell development, matching two waves of differentiation with opposite requirements for zzso zzso Both the expression of zzso and zzso are required for the generation of zzso zzso fetal zzso but zzso subsequently blocks progression to the zzso stage and final maturation of zzso zzso zzso is therefore a necessary switch to engage the zzso zzso pathway, but needs to be turned off later to avoid diversion to the T cell zzso
