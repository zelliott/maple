The zzso signaling module elicits a strong negative impact on skeletal zzso that is reflected by a complete loss of muscle gene zzso and differentiation in zzso zzso Recent evidence indicates that zzso signaling also may contribute to zzso cell cycle exit and zzso To further define the mechanisms by which zzso zzso in cellular responses, a stable line of zzso expressing an zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso The cells zzso demonstrate a strict zzso increase in zzso zzso protein synthesis and downstream zzso zzso zzso of low-level zzso activity in these cells zzso zzso protein expression and zzso zzso By contrast, induction of high level zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso the formation of zzso and muscle reporter gene zzso Interestingly, treatment of zzso with zzso medium isolated from zzso cells zzso all of the aspects of zzso Closer examination indicates that the transforming growth zzso zzso gene is zzso in zzso zzso The cells also direct elevated levels of zzso zzso activity, suggesting the existence of a zzso zzso zzso However, zzso the biological activity of zzso does not restore the zzso zzso Our results provide evidence for the involvement of zzso signal transmission during zzso formation as well as during zzso of zzso
