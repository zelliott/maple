We have used a zzso qualitative zzso based zzso to demonstrate that zzso a zzso zzso which enhances in zzso the activity of bovine growth hormone zzso does not disrupt the interaction between zzso and its zzso zzso (as represented by zzso bovine zzso binding protein zzso We have confirmed this using a classical zzso zzso zzso with the zzso mouse zzso cell line zzso The fact that zzso 15 binding to zzso still allows hormone to interact with its zzso allows us to test the hypothesis that there is any amplification of zzso events following zzso treatment of zzso zzso We have used as a reporter of zzso activity the rapid stimulation of zzso zzso zzso which is a critical first step in zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that binding of zzso by zzso zzso hormone stimulation of zzso zzso zzso We conclude that although zzso does not disrupt zzso zzso zzso interactions it does interfere with subsequent zzso activity at the molecular and cellular zzso We further speculate therefore that the biological enhancing activity of this zzso is most likely due to an in zzso effect as presentation of zzso complexes to a zzso cell zzso hormone zzso
