zzso bacterial sensing by zzso receptors is critical for maintaining zzso zzso but can lead to colitis in the absence of zzso Although zzso receptors are expressed in multiple cell types in the zzso the cell zzso responsible for the development of colitis are currently zzso Here we generated mice that are selectively deficient in zzso in various cellular compartments in an zzso zzso Although zzso expression of zzso was zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso compartment was required for colitis zzso Specifically, zzso distinct populations of zzso zzso zzso expressed high levels of zzso zzso and zzso and promoted zzso 17 responses in the absence of zzso Thus, gut bacterial sensing through zzso in zzso zzso drives inflammatory zzso disease when zzso by zzso
