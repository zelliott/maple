We have developed a functional model for zzso characterizing the zzso dynamics of the zzso CO2 receptors zzso in the snake zzso The model was based on experiments in which the neural zzso of several zzso were recorded in response to abrupt step changes in CO2 zzso zzso attempts to model the zzso dynamics zzso proved zzso although the linear model captured gross features such as rate sensitivity and the existence of two time zzso in the adaptation zzso However, with the incorporation of two zzso zzso features, zzso zzso and preferential zzso of the zzso zzso it was possible to account for over zzso of the total variation in the zzso The model produced accurate predictions of zzso responses to other zzso such as zzso zzso changes in zzso The model also allows the prediction of zzso discharge in spontaneous breathing given zzso of lung CO2 zzso and may serve as a starting point for further studies of zzso mechanisms at the cellular zzso
