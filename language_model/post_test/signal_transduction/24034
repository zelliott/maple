zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso functions as a zzso to specify cell fate along the zzso axis of the zzso zzso is a zzso protein and zzso signal zzso is zzso by zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso during assembly of several adult zzso However, the molecular mechanism by which the zzso zzso zzso is established and maintained is poorly zzso We show evidence that zzso regulates both cellular responses to zzso and the distribution of zzso zzso in zzso In the developing wing, zzso expression in the wing disc is controlled by the same molecular pathways that regulate expression of thick zzso which encodes a zzso type I zzso zzso levels of zzso increase the sensitivity of cells to zzso in a cell autonomous zzso In addition, zzso affects the shape of the zzso zzso zzso as well as its activity zzso We propose that zzso serves as a zzso for zzso and contributes to shaping the zzso zzso zzso
