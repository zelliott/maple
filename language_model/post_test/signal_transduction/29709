zzso are a class of small zzso proteins that appear to play a crucial role in many zzso zzso degenerative zzso A recent study demonstrated a reduction of zzso zzso protein in the zzso zzso zzso When the same heart was adapted to zzso stress by zzso with repeated zzso episodes of small duration of zzso and zzso there was an increased induction of zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression resulted in reduced zzso zzso recovery and increased zzso zzso size in the zzso zzso zzso these findings, transgenic mouse hearts zzso zzso were resistant to zzso zzso injury as compared with the hearts from zzso zzso Thus, it appears that zzso plays a crucial role in zzso induced by zzso
