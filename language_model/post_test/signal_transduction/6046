Cellular zzso stress triggers many changes in gene expression which can be used to define the response of a plant to an environmental zzso zzso technology permits the study of expression patterns of thousands of genes zzso permitting a comprehensive understanding of the types and quantities of zzso that are present in a cell in response to zzso zzso The expression of specific genes was compared in three different experiments designed to understand changes in gene expression in response to zzso zzso Surprisingly, there was a relatively small set of genes that were commonly induced or zzso There were 27 genes commonly induced and three commonly zzso zzso and zzso of the genes zzso in common to all three zzso The induced genes fell into six different functional zzso zzso zzso zzso transcription, zzso zzso and zzso The three commonly zzso genes indicated that repression of gene expression supported a frequently observed response to zzso stress, decreased zzso A more detailed analysis of genes involved in cell wall zzso indicated that there was a global decrease in expression of genes that promote cell zzso
