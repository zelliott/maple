Water availability is an important environmental factor that controls flowering zzso Many plants accelerate flowering under drought conditions, a phenomenon called drought zzso Four pathways are involved in controlling flowering time, but which ones participate in drought escape is not yet zzso In this study, plants with zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibited abnormal zzso zzso The peak zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso domain F box protein 1) and the zzso levels of CO and zzso zzso locus zzso changed under drought zzso The zzso factor zzso was zzso by drought stress, and its zzso was dependent on zzso while other zzso were zzso zzso analyses indicated that zzso zzso were more sensitive while zzso zzso zzso plants were less so to drought stress than zzso zzso Digital gene expression and real-time zzso analyses showed that zzso was zzso by zzso and zzso The zzso protein could interact with zzso (a target of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso We proposed that zzso may regulate drought escape and drought tolerance by affecting sugar signaling in zzso
