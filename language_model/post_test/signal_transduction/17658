The zzso signaling zzso has potent zzso effects in zzso cells and loss of negative growth regulation is often associated with increased zzso The human pancreatic zzso zzso cell line, UK zzso which expresses zzso is not highly responsive to zzso due to zzso repression of zzso type II zzso zzso Here, we show that UK zzso cells zzso with a zzso to zzso zzso protein zzso causes an increase in zzso zzso and restores sensitivity to zzso growth zzso The zzso of zzso was associated with diminished zzso signaling as measured by zzso binding domain zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso analysis revealed increased binding of nuclear proteins to a previously identified positive regulatory element zzso of the zzso promoter in zzso zzso zzso Competition with an zzso containing the zzso consensus site was able to inhibit this binding of nuclear proteins to the zzso zzso Further zzso analysis using zzso to various zzso components revealed that zzso zzso partially depleted the increase in binding to the zzso seen in zzso cells while zzso to other zzso constituents such as zzso zzso and zzso had no effect on zzso zzso with this data, transient zzso of UK zzso cells with zzso resulted in greater zzso zzso zzso as measured by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso site inhibited zzso or zzso increases in zzso promoter zzso These data suggest that zzso signaling may mediate an increase in zzso zzso via increased binding of nuclear factors including zzso to the zzso region of the zzso zzso
