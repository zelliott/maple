zzso is a critical T cell growth factor in zzso but predominantly mediates tolerance in zzso zzso is mainly produced by zzso zzso cells, but the role of zzso zzso zzso in zzso is zzso We demonstrate that during immunity to a zzso the zzso role of zzso zzso zzso was to maintain zzso zzso on zzso T regulatory cells zzso which resulted in their maintenance of the zzso cell lineage factor, zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso However, in the absence of zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso maintained zzso T cells and caused zzso zzso signaling was indispensable for zzso cell zzso and efficient zzso function in zzso but, surprisingly, was not required for their generation, because zzso and zzso mice both contained zzso T cells in the zzso zzso signaling was also important for zzso T cell zzso because zzso zzso zzso T cells failed to affect established zzso zzso zzso signaling was not required for zzso cell zzso Lastly, administration of zzso plus zzso zzso to zzso mice enhanced the adoptive zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso paradoxically controls both tolerance and immunity to a zzso in zzso
