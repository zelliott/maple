A growing list of medically important zzso defects and disease mechanisms can be traced to disruption of the zzso cell polarity zzso zzso The zzso system zzso cells in zzso sheets along an axis zzso to their zzso zzso Studies in the zzso zzso have suggested that components of the zzso signaling system function in distinct zzso and that these zzso and the zzso systems with which they interact function together to produce emergent zzso Experimental methods allow the manipulation of individual zzso signaling molecules in specified groups of zzso these interventions not only zzso the polarization of the targeted cells at a zzso level, but also zzso patterns of polarity at the zzso level, often affecting nearby cells in characteristic zzso These kinds of experiments should, in principle, allow one to zzso the architecture of the zzso signaling system, but the relationships between molecular interactions and zzso pattern are sufficiently complex that they defy intuitive zzso zzso modeling has been an important tool to address these zzso This article explores the emergence of a local signaling hypothesis, and describes how a local zzso zzso coupled with a directional zzso can give rise to global zzso We will discuss the critical role mathematical modeling has played in guiding and interpreting experimental results, and speculate about future roles for mathematical modeling of zzso zzso models at varying levels of zzso have and are expected to continue contributing in distinct ways to understanding the regulation of zzso zzso
