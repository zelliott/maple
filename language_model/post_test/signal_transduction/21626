Recently, we reported that zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso genes as a zzso mechanism of zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso administration to rats zzso doses of zzso zzso zzso for 3 consecutive zzso induced a zzso response and liver zzso depletion as an indication of zzso stress, with higher levels of zzso zzso in serum zzso and zzso zzso DNA binding zzso which were zzso at zzso h after zzso Under these conditions, the protein expression of the zzso proteins zzso and zzso is significantly zzso a change that is suppressed by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso before zzso It is concluded that zzso administration zzso the zzso response in rat liver by a zzso mechanism triggered at the zzso cell level, in association with zzso release and zzso of the zzso zzso a response that may contribute to zzso zzso in the liver and zzso zzso exhibiting zzso zzso
