zzso The present study describes effects of zzso zzso zzso on plasma membrane potential and zzso zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso zzso zzso cells in suspension were zzso with zzso and other zzso and zzso changes were monitored utilizing the fluorescent zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced a prompt plasma membrane zzso which was dependent on zzso influx from the zzso zzso since it was abolished by omission of zzso zzso zzso was independent of zzso rise as it also occurred in the absence of zzso zzso and after zzso zzso stores were discharged with zzso zzso also zzso a rapid and zzso increase in zzso a prompt spike was followed by a prolonged sustained zzso The initial spike was dependent on zzso release from zzso stores since it was also present when cells were incubated in zzso zzso medium and was abolished by zzso with zzso and zzso agents that discharge zzso zzso zzso The sustained phase was dependent on zzso influx from the zzso medium as it was abolished when cells were incubated in zzso zzso zzso zzso influx was due to zzso of zzso calcium channels zzso since it was abolished by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso or incubation in zzso zzso an experimental condition which zzso plasma membrane zzso by zzso zzso zzso rises in zzso zzso concentration and plasma membrane zzso were reduced by zzso with zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso mechanisms are in part under the control of zzso zzso zzso These data show that zzso cells possess zzso zzso zzso coupled to influx of zzso and release of zzso from zzso stores and provide evidence for an zzso of different pathways by zzso zzso zzso of these receptors zzso zzso influx that causes a rapid plasma membrane zzso Furthermore, zzso also triggers zzso release from zzso stores and zzso influx from zzso space via zzso zzso
