The vascular system matures during embryonic development to form a stable, well-organized zzso zzso In zzso data have established that the zzso zzso zzso is crucial in providing structural support to the vascular zzso In zzso studies are defining the involvement of zzso cell signaling in establishing and maintaining the mature zzso zzso However, zzso cell signaling with established structural functions for the zzso and determining the relative importance of these two roles in zzso is often zzso Here, we examine human zzso zzso gene targeting and cell biology to better understand the relationship between structural and signaling roles for the zzso in vascular zzso and zzso
