zzso levels of zzso such as zzso in inflamed zzso play a significant role in the tissue destruction caused by zzso partly by targeting local zzso Only very few studies have shown that zzso zzso the proliferation of a zzso zzso zzso cell line, and we expanded this research by using primary human zzso zzso and looking into the mechanisms of the zzso zzso zzso derived from healthy human zzso were treated with zzso and proliferation was assessed by measuring cell number and DNA synthesis and potential signaling pathways were investigated using selective zzso or zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso zzso The effect was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso (a zzso zzso pointing to involvement of zzso Indeed, zzso and zzso induced zzso generation in these zzso Using selective zzso zzso zzso we found that the zzso effect of zzso is zzso via the zzso zzso (which is coupled to zzso zzso zzso We also found that the effect of zzso involved zzso of zzso zzso protein directly activated by zzso an zzso zzso zzso and not zzso While serum increased the amount of zzso in zzso by approximately zzso zzso decreased it by approximately zzso Finally, the zzso effect does not require zzso production of zzso since it was not zzso by two zzso In conclusion, in human zzso zzso zzso activates the zzso pathway, reducing zzso zzso and zzso zzso This effect could hamper zzso healing and provide further insights into the zzso of inflammatory zzso zzso
