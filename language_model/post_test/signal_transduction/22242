Human peripheral blood zzso T cells are important for host zzso and zzso zzso Their unusual zzso zzso zzso recognizes small zzso zzso zzso cells produce inflammatory zzso and are zzso zzso for a variety of zzso However, molecular mechanisms linking zzso stimulation and zzso are incompletely zzso We know that zzso zzso zzso activates zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso specific zzso of zzso or zzso significantly zzso the functional response to zzso We now show that zzso also activates zzso and zzso pathways but on its own, fails to induce zzso expression or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are necessary but not sufficient to induce zzso responses in zzso T cells and a zzso signal is still required for zzso cell zzso zzso A, an inhibitor of zzso blocked zzso nuclear zzso of nuclear factor of activated T cell zzso and significantly reduced zzso zzso production, zzso and zzso The zzso calcium zzso and zzso zzso were necessary to activate zzso zzso zzso zzso acting on the zzso pathway, regulated the strength of these zzso The zzso has a specific role in zzso zzso killing of zzso cells, which is distinct from its role in triggering cellular proliferation in response to zzso
