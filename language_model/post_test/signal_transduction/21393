The function of zzso initially confined to its role in energy zzso and zzso has now expanded to the regulation of zzso zzso zzso bone formation, wound healing and the immune zzso Both stimulation and zzso of the molecular target of zzso the zzso zzso zzso might find applications in disease zzso Recent advances in the understanding of zzso zzso mechanisms have led to the design of zzso zzso Several zzso have been developed for the screening and evaluation of zzso zzso Both the zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso are potential drug zzso The zzso resonance energy transfer technique can be used to screen for compounds that target the zzso part of the zzso and we propose that the novel reverse zzso zzso interaction trap technique can be used to screen compounds that affect zzso aspects of zzso zzso These zzso can be easily adapted to other zzso relevant zzso
