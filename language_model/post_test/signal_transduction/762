zzso zzso development is a chronic inflammatory process that involves excessive cell proliferation and migration within the artery zzso zzso through the zzso cell cycle requires the sequential zzso of zzso composed of a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and a regulatory zzso named zzso Members of the family of zzso zzso proteins zzso interact with and inhibit the activity of zzso Cell migration occurs predominantly at the zzso phase of the cell cycle, and both zzso and zzso are among the molecular machines that zzso regulate the cycling events that control cell proliferation and zzso The purpose of this review is to discuss the role of zzso and zzso in the regulation of vascular cell proliferation and migration and in the control of zzso zzso zzso and gene therapy strategies targeting these cell cycle regulators for the treatment of cardiovascular disease will also be zzso
