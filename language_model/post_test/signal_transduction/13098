zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso effectively kills multiple myeloma zzso cells in zzso irrespective of zzso to zzso and zzso Because clinical trials with this zzso agent are expected zzso we investigated the signaling zzso of zzso zzso in zzso We detected rapid zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA fragmentation zzso zzso but not zzso upon TRAIL treatment in sensitive zzso cells, pointing to zzso as the zzso zzso of TRAIL signaling in zzso zzso These phenomena were not observed or were significantly delayed in zzso zzso cells, suggesting that resistance may arise from zzso at the level of zzso zzso Higher levels of expression for various zzso zzso including zzso protein zzso and lower zzso levels were present in zzso cells and sensitivity was restored by the protein synthesis inhibitor zzso zzso and the protein zzso C zzso inhibitor zzso zzso which both lowered zzso and cellular inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso expression of zzso or zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso cells to zzso Moreover, the cell permeable nuclear factor zzso inhibitor zzso which zzso zzso cells to zzso also inhibited zzso protein zzso Finally, zzso zzso and zzso facilitated the zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso cells, confirming that zzso of zzso zzso occurs at this level and that these agents sensitize zzso cells by zzso this zzso Our data set a framework for the clinical use of approaches that sensitize zzso cells to TRAIL by agents that inhibit zzso and zzso expression or augment zzso zzso
