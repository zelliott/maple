Cell zzso molecules zzso have long been known to guide zzso outgrowth and zzso More recent evidence indicates they contribute to zzso formation as zzso The zzso family of zzso has been implicated in long-term zzso learning, and some features of synaptic zzso We show here that zzso is localized in zzso pathways at both zzso and zzso zzso In the chick zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso receptors and zzso their downstream zzso zzso zzso is also important for aligning zzso structures over the zzso zzso zzso negative experiments suggest this latter effect depends on zzso interactions with zzso zzso At the zzso junction zzso is also found zzso where dominant negative experiments again indicate a role in aligning zzso structures over zzso zzso both in culture and in zzso These findings identify new roles for zzso at zzso zzso and underscore the zzso of zzso
