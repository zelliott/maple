The zzso signaling is a zzso zzso for tumor zzso However, while zzso of the zzso zzso zzso proved efficient in human tumors with zzso zzso in this pathway, recent clinical data have failed to show any benefit in other zzso even though Sonic zzso zzso expression is detected in these zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso a positive regulator of skeletal muscle development, was recently identified as a zzso for zzso We show here that zzso behaves as a zzso dependence zzso it actively triggers zzso in the absence of zzso The zzso activity of zzso zzso requires a zzso zzso in its zzso domain, allowing the recruitment and zzso of zzso We show that by inducing zzso in settings of zzso zzso zzso expression zzso tumor zzso and as such, decreased zzso expression observed in a large fraction of human zzso cancer is associated in mice with zzso tumor zzso zzso we propose that the zzso zzso detected in human zzso and previously considered as a mechanism for zzso of the zzso zzso in an zzso or zzso manner, actually provides a selective tumor growth advantage by blocking zzso zzso In support of this notion, we present the zzso demonstration that interference with the zzso interaction triggers a zzso zzso in zzso and tumor growth zzso in zzso The latter observation qualifies zzso as a relevant alternative target for zzso therapy in zzso zzso
