zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso is a zzso factor which is highly expressed in the zzso zzso from zzso to colon and from zzso to zzso The zzso of this constantly renewing zzso relies on an integrated control of zzso zzso and zzso as well as on the functional architecture of the zzso zzso In order to determine the consequences of zzso loss in the adult zzso zzso we used a zzso zzso system to zzso the zzso zzso In the zzso of adult mice, loss of zzso led to an increased proliferation in zzso and to an increased expression of several genes controlled by the zzso zzso This control of the zzso signaling zzso by zzso was confirmed in zzso Cell lineage was affected, as indicated by an increased number of zzso cells and an impairment of zzso and zzso cell zzso In the absence of zzso zzso junctions were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso zzso zzso signaling and controls zzso zzso zzso cell function, and cell zzso This study indicates that zzso regulates the zzso balance between proliferation and zzso and we zzso that it might act as a tumor zzso
