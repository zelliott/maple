zzso treatment in zzso women has been linked to zzso zzso loss and premature zzso zzso the exact mechanism by which this occurs is zzso Here, two commonly used zzso agents zzso and zzso were added to a mouse zzso culture system, to compare the sequence of events that leads to germ cell zzso The ability of zzso zzso to protect the zzso against zzso or zzso zzso damage was also zzso 

zzso mouse zzso were cultured for a total of six days, exposed to a zzso agent on the second day: this allowed for the examination of the earliest stages of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used to assess zzso following drug zzso zzso was added to cultures with zzso and zzso to determine any protective zzso 

zzso analysis of zzso treated with zzso showed zzso zzso in comparison zzso zzso caused damage to the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression significantly increased for zzso (16 fold, zzso and zzso (3 fold, zzso zzso zzso gave little evidence of primordial zzso damage with either zzso zzso had a significant protective effect against zzso zzso damage zzso but not against zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso both induced zzso damage, but in a markedly different pattern, with zzso protecting the zzso against damage by zzso but not zzso Any treatment designed to block the effects of zzso agents on the zzso may need to be specific to the zzso the patient is exposed zzso
