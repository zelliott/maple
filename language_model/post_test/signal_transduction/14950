zzso seminal plasma zzso has been shown to contain factors that have a zzso or zzso effect on zzso The objectives of the present study were to compare the zzso changes observed in cooled zzso with those seen in zzso after in zzso zzso and to determine whether SP could prevent these zzso zzso were subjected to incubation or to slow cooling under zzso or zzso zzso The effect of SP on protein zzso zzso and the ability of the zzso to undergo an zzso reaction zzso were zzso zzso zzso displayed an increased level of zzso zzso and a higher percentage of induced zzso zzso compared to incubated zzso The addition of SP inhibited the number of zzso that occurred during incubation and zzso These results suggest that cooling of zzso zzso the zzso changes in zzso and that SP contains a zzso that effectively prevents these zzso
