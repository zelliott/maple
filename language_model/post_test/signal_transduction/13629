We discuss here principal zzso transformations of zzso molecules in the visual zzso We focus our analysis on the accumulating evidence of alternate pathways and functional redundancies in the zzso The efficiency of the visual cycle zzso on one hand, on fast zzso of the zzso zzso On the other hand, it is crucial that the zzso process should be highly selective to avoid zzso of zzso The state-of-the-art knowledge indicates that single zzso active components of the cycle are not strictly selective and may require zzso to enhance their zzso It appears that zzso interactions significantly improve the biological stability of the visual zzso In particular, synthesis of zzso less stable zzso zzso is favored by physical interactions of the zzso present in the zzso with cellular zzso binding zzso
