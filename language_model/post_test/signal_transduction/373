zzso is one of the most severe and debilitating symptoms associated with several forms of zzso Various types of zzso and zzso zzso to skeletal bones and cause spontaneous bone pain and zzso which is accompanied by bone degradation and zzso of peripheral zzso Despite recent advances, the molecular mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of zzso pain are not well zzso Several types of zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso factors that act on zzso cells and tumor zzso Here we report that receptors and signaling zzso of zzso and zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso are also functionally expressed on sensory zzso zzso zzso nerves to mechanical stimuli in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso release and caused zzso of sensory nerve endings in the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso signaling in zzso led to reduced tumor growth and nerve zzso and zzso bone cancer zzso The key significance of zzso signaling in sensory zzso was revealed by an zzso of zzso pain following a sensory zzso zzso of zzso zzso These results show that zzso and zzso are important in zzso interactions and suggest that their receptors on primary zzso nerve fibers constitute potential therapeutic targets in cancer zzso
