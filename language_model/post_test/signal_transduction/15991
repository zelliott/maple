zzso protein precursor zzso is a zzso expressed zzso which under zzso conditions can be zzso following two alternative routes; the zzso and the zzso zzso Shift of zzso processing in favor of the zzso zzso is a key event in the zzso of Alzheimer's disease zzso Among the factors that regulate zzso processing, nerve growth factor zzso appears to play an important zzso abnormal zzso signaling has been implicated in the onset of zzso In the present study, we used zzso cells to study the effects of zzso on zzso processing and provide evidence that zzso through binding to its high affinity zzso zzso moderately zzso the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and, most importantly, zzso the expression of two zzso with zzso activity, a zzso and zzso and to a greater extent zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso dependent zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso actively zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso thus it contributes to the shift of zzso processing towards the zzso zzso zzso the formation of zzso zzso zzso
