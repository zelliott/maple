Major regulators of programmed cell death, or zzso are the members of the zzso gene zzso Recently, we reported that zzso zzso triggering of the human B zzso cell line zzso led to strong induction of zzso a zzso member of the zzso family, and subsequently to induction of zzso suggesting a potential regulatory role of zzso in zzso cell zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of this cell line showed only weak zzso zzso which was not zzso by zzso zzso In this study, we were able to demonstrate the functional significance of this zzso We zzso zzso zzso into a zzso zzso resistant against zzso zzso Several zzso zzso clones could be selected, which all showed enhanced sensitivity for zzso zzso In contrast, no sensitive clone could be identified in a large number of mock zzso This clearly indicates that induction of zzso is a critical regulatory step, which zzso B cells for zzso zzso
