There is an increasing interest for zzso generated complex zzso that are potentially more zzso than single oxidized zzso In this survey, the recently available information on the formation and processing of several classes of complex DNA damage formed upon one radical hit including mostly zzso radical and zzso zzso is critically zzso The modifications include tandem base zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso adjacent base zzso and zzso zzso Information is also provided on clustered zzso produced essentially by exposure of cells to zzso radiation and high energetic heavy zzso through the involvement of multiple radical events that induce several zzso DNA in a close spatial zzso These consist mainly of double strand breaks zzso and zzso clustered zzso that are referred as to zzso generated clustered DNA zzso zzso
