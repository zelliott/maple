In the present study, we examined the effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso D activity in primary cultured rat zzso smooth muscle zzso zzso stimulation of zzso formation was dose zzso The zzso was quite different from those of zzso zzso The effect of zzso on the formation of zzso zzso zzso was 3 zzso was more potent than that on the formation of zzso zzso was 30 zzso zzso zzso an zzso of protein zzso C zzso zzso the formation of zzso However, 4 zzso zzso which is inactive for zzso had little zzso zzso an inhibitor of protein zzso which inhibited the zzso formation of zzso had little effect on the zzso formation of zzso Neither zzso C, a highly specific zzso zzso nor zzso zzso with zzso affected zzso formation of zzso A combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the formation of zzso The depletion of zzso zzso by zzso acid significantly reduced the zzso formation of zzso zzso an zzso of zzso inhibited the zzso formation of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso an zzso for zzso protein zzso zzso the formation of zzso However, the formation of zzso by a combination of zzso and zzso was not zzso zzso toxin had little effect on the zzso formation of zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
