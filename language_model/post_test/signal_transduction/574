The zzso factor zzso blocks the formation of long-term zzso zzso These experiments used this observation to uncover the synaptic processes that stabilize the zzso zzso zzso zzso infusion blocked zzso zzso zzso within zzso spines along with zzso itself in control rat zzso slices but not in those zzso with the zzso filament stabilizer zzso zzso also blocked zzso zzso of synaptic zzso but not of synaptic zzso zzso zzso A search for the upstream origins of these effects showed that zzso suppressed zzso activity but only modestly affected zzso and zzso A zzso zzso zzso inhibitor reproduced zzso effects on zzso zzso spine zzso zzso and zzso whereas a zzso inhibitor did zzso However, zzso of zzso or zzso did prolong zzso vulnerability to reversal by zzso a toxin which blocks zzso filament zzso Thus, zzso induction zzso two synaptic signaling zzso one zzso leads to zzso zzso whereas the other zzso zzso the newly formed zzso
