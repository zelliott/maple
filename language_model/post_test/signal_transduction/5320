zzso proteins are key regulators of zzso signaling pathways that have been implicated in the progression of human zzso We found that the binding zzso of the zzso zzso domain is more flexible than those of zzso zzso zzso and enables recognition of both zzso and internal zzso These zzso zzso inhibit zzso signaling in cells, showing that zzso zzso zzso are potential targets for zzso cancer zzso
