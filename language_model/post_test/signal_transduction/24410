To study the expression and regulation of zzso zzso and zzso proteins zzso signaling molecules of transforming growth zzso zzso in rat zzso during zzso zzso 

The whole zzso were collected from zzso rats aged 3, 7, 14, 28 and 90 (adult) zzso The cellular zzso and zzso changes were examined by zzso ABC method with the zzso zzso enhancement zzso zzso analysis of the zzso was made by the image analysis zzso The zzso proteins coexistence in the adult rat zzso was tested by the double immune zzso for zzso and zzso The protein expression of zzso during rat zzso development was examined by means of Western zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso were present throughout zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso were present in zzso zzso A positive zzso was located at the zzso but the nucleus was zzso zzso was zzso at the zzso zzso and adult zzso while zzso at the zzso zzso zzso and adult zzso There was positive zzso in the zzso cells and zzso cells as zzso The zzso of zzso was exclusively at the zzso of zzso cells and the zzso were negative throughout the zzso zzso No expression was detected in the germ zzso The results of image and statistical analysis showed that generally the expression of zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso tended to increase gradually with the growth of the zzso 

The present data provide direct zzso for the molecular mechanism of zzso action in rat zzso during zzso development and zzso
