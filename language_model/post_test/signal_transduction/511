zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso precursor cells play a critical role in the development of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The differentiation of human zzso into zzso in zzso occurs after zzso migration zzso induced by zzso zzso protein 1 zzso Because zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso and zzso zzso we investigated its involvement in zzso 

We subjected mice with genetic deletion of zzso to zzso We found that zzso mice did not develop the zzso and cardiac dysfunction characteristic for zzso compared with zzso zzso hearts showed markedly lower numbers of zzso zzso muscle zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cardiac zzso from zzso mice undergoing zzso were large and slowly proliferating, similar to zzso isolated from zzso zzso We also performed in zzso zzso in which human peripheral blood zzso cells zzso migrated through zzso cells in response to zzso Prior to migration, zzso were incubated with zzso small interfering zzso to silence zzso zzso We found that an zzso reduction of zzso protein did not inhibit zzso but significantly reduced the amount of zzso cells that differentiated into zzso by zzso 

Our data zzso an important role for zzso in the zzso but not in the zzso of zzso that mature into cardiac zzso These cells mediate zzso zzso
