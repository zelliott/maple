zzso zzso are zzso zzso of approximately 22 zzso in length that zzso regulate the zzso expression by zzso repression and/or zzso of zzso zzso The impact of zzso on protein output was recently shown that although some targets were zzso without zzso changes in zzso levels, those zzso zzso by more than a third also displayed zzso zzso zzso and, for the more highly zzso targets, zzso zzso usually comprised the major component of zzso Thus, comparative zzso of zzso and zzso from the same samples of different cell types may identify the putative targets of zzso In this investigation, both zzso and zzso profiles from the zzso human embryonic stem cell line zzso zzso zzso derived zzso bodies zzso and zzso differentiated zzso cells zzso were zzso and 58 genes were found to be targets of four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso by inverse expression levels zzso negative zzso of zzso to their target zzso zzso half of these 58 targets are involved in gene zzso Three common target genes zzso zzso and zzso of three highly expressed zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified, and the target sites of both zzso and zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso genes were confirmed by the zzso zzso The highly expressed zzso and zzso target zzso involved in zzso pathways among zzso zzso and zzso cells were also zzso and the expression levels of target zzso predicted by abundantly expressed zzso were found to be three- to zzso lower than those of zzso zzso involved in the same signaling zzso
