zzso blood zzso has been established to be an alternative source of zzso zzso cells zzso for zzso The number of zzso per CB unit is zzso which results in zzso zzso zzso zzso expansion of zzso improvement must overcome zzso 

zzso zzso was used to extensively zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso was used to track cell zzso The zzso mouse model was employed in transplantation studies to determine long and short term zzso in human zzso Gene array analysis was used to evaluate zzso pathways regulated following ex zzso expansion of zzso 

expansion of zzso zzso impaired their zzso zzso In this zzso transplantation model we showed that zzso activity of CB cells declined following zzso Expanded zzso had delayed zzso at early and late stages zzso High resolution division tracking revealed that the cultured zzso had reduced expansion and zzso probability and increased differentiation rate compared to zzso zzso Gene expression analysis exposed significant zzso of a complex network of genes and pathways that normally maintain zzso proliferation and limit their zzso 

The decline in short-term zzso is consistent with the loss of rapid zzso zzso ability zzso by expanded zzso zzso cells recently zzso Our data raise concerns for future clinical applications of expanded zzso alone in zzso
