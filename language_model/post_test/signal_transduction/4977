zzso of synaptic development and function has been implicated in the zzso of neurodegenerative disorders and mental zzso A zzso that has an important function in zzso and synaptic development is zzso zzso factor zzso In this communication, we examined the effects of lead zzso exposure on zzso zzso B zzso signaling during the period of zzso in cultured zzso derived from embryonic rat zzso We show that zzso exposure decreases zzso gene and protein zzso and it may also alter the transport of zzso zzso to sites of release by altering zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso these effects of zzso resulted in decreased zzso of zzso mature zzso The effect of zzso on zzso gene expression was associated with a specific decrease in zzso zzso IV transcript levels and reduced zzso and protein expression of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso protein levels and zzso at zzso zzso were significantly decreased by zzso exposure with a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso levels and altered zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso I, a zzso target of zzso zzso was significantly decreased by zzso exposure with no effect on total zzso I protein zzso This effect of zzso exposure on zzso I zzso may help explain the impairment in zzso release documented by us previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thompson, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Lead exposure during zzso alters zzso proteins and zzso zzso zzso Potential role of zzso zzso zzso dependent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso because it controls zzso movement from the reserve pool to the readily zzso zzso In zzso the present study demonstrates that zzso exposure during the period of zzso of zzso zzso in culture zzso multiple synaptic processes regulated by zzso signaling with long-term consequences for synaptic function and zzso zzso
