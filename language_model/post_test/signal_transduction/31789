zzso dysfunction is an initiating factor in zzso A zzso and zzso 15 zzso zzso is a zzso zzso recently identified as a regulator of zzso zzso However, whether and how zzso contributes to zzso remains zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso mice led to a significant reduction in zzso zzso zzso size (by zzso plaque zzso zzso (by zzso and smooth muscle cell deposition (by zzso In zzso studies implicated zzso zzso in barrier dysfunction and zzso zzso across mouse zzso and human zzso vein zzso cell zzso This role of zzso depended on intact functioning of the zzso domain, as evidenced in experiments with zzso zzso targeting the zzso active site zzso the zzso domain zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso Further investigations revealed that zzso barrier dysfunction was zzso with zzso of zzso zzso junctions zzso zzso zzso an effect that was sensitive to zzso family zzso zzso Through small interfering zzso zzso of distinct zzso family zzso members, zzso and zzso were identified as important zzso of these zzso effects of zzso 

These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso signaling through zzso and zzso contributes to zzso zzso development by zzso zzso junction integrity and promoting zzso zzso
