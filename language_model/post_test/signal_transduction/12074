To investigate the effects of treatment with zzso component Chinese Medicine zzso zzso on behavioral deficits in zzso cognitive decline zzso rats and verify our hypothesis that zzso treatment improves cognitive function by suppressing the zzso zzso stress zzso and improving insulin signaling zzso in the zzso zzso 

A rat model of type 2 diabetes zzso zzso was established using high fat diet and zzso (30 zzso zzso zzso sensitivity was evaluated by the oral zzso tolerance test and the insulin tolerance zzso After 7 weeks, the zzso rats were treated with zzso The zzso test and Morris water maze were used to evaluate behavior in zzso rats after 5 weeks of treatment with zzso zzso of zzso proteins involved in the zzso and in insulin signaling zzso pathways were assessed by Western zzso for zzso zzso zzso 

Compared to healthy control rats, zzso rats initially showed insulin resistance and had declines in acquisition and retrieval processes in the zzso test and in spatial memory in the Morris water maze after 12 zzso Performance on both the zzso test and Morris water maze tasks improved after zzso zzso In zzso rats, the zzso was zzso and then inhibited the insulin signal zzso pathways through the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment suppressed the zzso increased insulin signal zzso and improved insulin resistance in the zzso zzso 

Treatment with zzso improved cognitive function in the zzso rat zzso The possible mechanism for zzso was related with zzso inducing the insulin signal zzso dysfunction in zzso zzso zzso The zzso could reduce zzso and improve insulin signal zzso and insulin resistance in zzso zzso zzso and as a result improved the cognitive zzso
