Human zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso virus zzso enter target cells by forming a complex between the viral envelope protein and two zzso membrane zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso that differ in cellular zzso use different zzso of zzso receptors as entry zzso zzso zzso primarily use zzso whereas zzso and zzso zzso use zzso zzso zzso signal zzso through zzso is not required for efficient fusion and entry of zzso in zzso Here we show that zzso envelope proteins from zzso zzso and zzso induce a signal through zzso on zzso T cells and that zzso signal zzso through zzso zzso zzso of T zzso This zzso response may contribute to the zzso of zzso in zzso by zzso activated zzso cells to sites of viral zzso zzso zzso through zzso may also enhance viral replication in zzso by increasing the zzso state of target zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso may influence zzso zzso or zzso
