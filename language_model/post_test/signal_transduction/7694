The plant hormone zzso acid zzso plays a key role in the environmental stress responses and zzso processes of zzso Although zzso zzso is a major positive regulator of zzso gene expression and essential for zzso zzso processes in zzso zzso molecular mechanisms underlying the control of zzso expression remain largely zzso Here, we identify a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso 6 zzso which is activated by zzso in zzso We also show that zzso zzso controls zzso zzso based on quantitative zzso and genetic analyses using zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso These results indicate that this zzso unit plays a key role in zzso negative regulation of zzso zzso Both positive and negative regulation by zzso may be used to fine-tune zzso expression to control zzso zzso Moreover, zzso root growth zzso is affected by zzso in the zzso zzso which indicates important roles in zzso zzso We provide a model explaining how zzso can convert three distinct signals - zzso zzso and zzso stress - into three different sets of responses in zzso
