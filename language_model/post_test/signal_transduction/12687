Several lines of evidence point to the early origin of adult onset zzso A key question is: what are the mechanisms that mediate the effects of the early environment on our zzso Another important question is: what is the impact of the environment during adulthood and how zzso are the effects of early life later in life? The zzso is programmed by the zzso which is comprised of zzso a zzso modification of DNA by zzso and zzso zzso The zzso is sculpted during zzso resulting in the diversity of gene expression programs in the distinct cell types of the zzso Recent data suggest that zzso programming of gene expression profiles is sensitive to the zzso environment and that both the chemical and social environment early in life could affect the manner by which the zzso is programmed by the zzso We propose that zzso zzso early in life can have a zzso lasting impact on gene expression and thus on the zzso including zzso to zzso We will discuss data from animal models as well as recent data from human studies supporting the hypothesis that early life zzso leaves its marks on our zzso and affects stress zzso health, and mental health later in zzso
