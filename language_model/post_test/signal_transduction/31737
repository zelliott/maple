Recent studies have suggested that zzso zzso stem cells zzso may be promising candidates for tissue engineering and play an important role in cartilage zzso However, the mechanisms of zzso zzso remain to be identified and zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso pathway, as well as the manner by which it may contribute to zzso and the zzso zzso organization of rat zzso zzso in response to transforming growth zzso zzso zzso isolated zzso were treated with zzso and their zzso organization was examined by zzso zzso zzso The specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were employed to evaluate the function of zzso and zzso The effect of zzso zzso and zzso on the gene expression of zzso markers was evaluated by quantitative real-time zzso chain zzso To examine the effect of zzso on zzso zzso induced by zzso western zzso analysis was also zzso The stimulation of zzso in zzso resulted in the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso zzso which was specifically blocked by zzso zzso and zzso The zzso gene expression of zzso type I zzso type II collagen and zzso was also inhibited by both zzso zzso and zzso at different zzso zzso treatment reduced the zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso These results demonstrate the zzso zzso regulates zzso gene zzso and zzso organization induced by zzso by interacting with the zzso zzso This may have significant implications for the successful zzso of zzso as a cell source for zzso cartilage tissue zzso
