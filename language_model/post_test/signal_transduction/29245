The cell wall integrity zzso protein zzso zzso cascade of zzso zzso drives changes in gene expression in response to cell wall zzso We show that the zzso of this zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso use a zzso mechanism to activate zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was dependent on the zzso zzso zzso factor and on an zzso signal to zzso but not on protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected in a complex with zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso zzso association with zzso in zzso required zzso of zzso zzso association of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso were zzso but did not require zzso indicating that the zzso zzso zzso ability to zzso Based on these data, we propose a model in which zzso zzso or zzso forms a zzso complex with zzso that is competent to associate with the zzso zzso This complex then recruits zzso to activate zzso Finally, we show that human zzso a functional zzso of zzso is similarly capable of driving zzso expression in the absence of protein zzso activity, suggesting that this zzso zzso may also have a zzso function in zzso
