The zzso zzso zzso is critical in the normal development and function of the zzso as well as in prostate zzso zzso deprivation therapy is the mainstay in the treatment of advanced prostate zzso however, after an initial response, the disease inevitably zzso to zzso prostate cancer zzso Recent evidence suggests that continued zzso zzso sometimes in a zzso manner, is commonly associated with the development of zzso Thus, novel agents targeting the zzso are urgently needed as a strategic step in developing new therapies for this disease zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of zzso on zzso signaling in prostate zzso We report that zzso decreased the zzso activity of zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso but induced zzso protein zzso Several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been identified, and these zzso are believed to promote the development of zzso in zzso Interestingly, we found that these zzso were more susceptible to zzso degradation than the full-length zzso Furthermore, although the growth of zzso zzso in nude mice was inhibited by zzso and zzso expression was reduced in the tumors, the zzso and zzso expression in normal zzso were not zzso This study is the first to show that zzso suppresses zzso signaling and suggests that zzso or its zzso presents a promising agent for the prevention and/or treatment of prostate zzso
