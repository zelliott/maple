zzso virus zzso small zzso zzso are zzso untranslated zzso exist most abundantly in zzso zzso cells, and are expected to show secondary structures with many short zzso zzso zzso gene I zzso is a zzso protein that detects viral zzso zzso zzso inside the cell and zzso signaling pathways leading to the induction of protective cellular zzso including type I zzso zzso We investigated whether zzso were recognized by zzso as zzso zzso of zzso zzso induced zzso and zzso genes zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, but not in their zzso counterparts or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or in zzso zzso induced expression of type I zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso zzso activated zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulatory factor 3, which were necessary for type I zzso zzso It was also shown that zzso zzso with zzso These results indicate that zzso are recognized by zzso and activate signaling to induce type I zzso in zzso zzso
