A zzso blockade drives zzso cells into differentiation and zzso by zzso from the zzso zzso Because zzso also supports zzso stem cell zzso we sought to determine the therapeutic efficacy of a joint zzso zzso To unravel the underlying zzso the zzso zzso zzso was zzso with zzso or zzso zzso prohibiting zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso zzso with a point zzso in the zzso binding site, or with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso cells were evaluated for zzso migration, and zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso and zzso studies revealed zzso cooperation in zzso and in zzso in zzso migration, and zzso zzso The cooperation depends on zzso proximity such that both zzso and zzso get access to zzso zzso and zzso and via zzso to the zzso pathway, with the latter also supporting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were only seen in leukemia cells expressing zzso zzso and zzso zzso together with zzso efficiently zzso zzso in bone zzso and zzso zzso was accompanied by increased zzso zzso that strengthened zzso chemotherapy, the combined treatment most strongly interfering with zzso settlement and being partly zzso zzso treatment also promoted zzso and zzso cellular zzso zzso which affected leukemia cells independent of zzso tail zzso Thus, mostly zzso to a blockade of joint zzso zzso and zzso hamper zzso cell settlement and break zzso resistance, which strongly supports zzso zzso
