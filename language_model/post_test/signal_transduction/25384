The zzso zzso zzso activated zzso zzso is zzso in zzso melanoma cell lines and tumor zzso Previously, we demonstrated a significant reduction in tumor growth and experimental lung zzso after zzso zzso via systemic delivery of zzso zzso into zzso Gene expression profiling identified a zzso increase in expression of zzso in zzso zzso melanoma cell zzso zzso promoter activity was significantly increased after zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso regulates zzso at the zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso decreases binding of zzso and zzso zzso factors to the zzso promoter, both known to activate zzso zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso or zzso zzso rather it resulted in increased expression of the zzso zzso complex zzso as well as decreased activity of the zzso inhibitor zzso resulting in increased binding of zzso and zzso to the zzso promoter and higher zzso zzso zzso zzso expression reduced the invasive capability of melanoma cells after zzso zzso which was zzso after rescuing with zzso Furthermore, tumor growth and experimental lung zzso was significantly decreased after expressing zzso in a zzso melanoma cell zzso Moreover, zzso zzso in zzso cells reverted the zzso of tumor growth and experimental lung zzso zzso we demonstrate a mechanism by which zzso zzso regulates the expression of the zzso zzso gene in the acquisition of the zzso melanoma zzso thus zzso an alternative function to zzso other than zzso
