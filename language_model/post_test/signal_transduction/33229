Signaling through the zzso zzso on human and zzso B zzso is necessary for zzso center formation and zzso class switching in zzso and zzso B cells from zzso triggered by zzso of surface zzso M in zzso zzso of zzso on the immature mouse B cell line zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to protect cells from zzso after gamma zzso as well as that following treatment with the zzso zzso or compounds that zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling led to a rapid increase in the expression of the zzso zzso protein zzso In addition, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso B cells was rapidly diminished by zzso zzso This zzso response was observed within 1 h and coincided with a preservation of zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso signaling zzso a generalized cellular resistance to zzso characterized by an zzso of zzso and changes in the zzso zzso zzso
