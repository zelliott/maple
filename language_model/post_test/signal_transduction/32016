zzso binding cassette A1 zzso is a membrane protein that promotes cellular cholesterol zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we studied the relative effects of zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso and on the signaling zzso that regulates its zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso forms induced zzso lower levels of zzso protein and zzso than zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and specificity protein 1 zzso were also lower when treated with zzso compared to zzso The reduced ability of zzso to induce zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were confirmed in human zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso has been suggested as a mechanism for zzso of zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso reduced total cholesterol and cholesterol zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells, and induced zzso cholesterol zzso However, the cholesterol zzso and cholesterol zzso in zzso cells were zzso and zzso lower, respectively, compared to zzso zzso zzso of cholesterol zzso in zzso is a mechanism for foam cell zzso Thus the reduced ability of zzso to activate the zzso signaling zzso and induce zzso expression likely zzso cholesterol zzso zzso and increases foam cell zzso
