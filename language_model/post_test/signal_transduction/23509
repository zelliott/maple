In recent years, long zzso zzso zzso have been investigated as a new class of regulators of biological zzso A recent study reported that zzso control cell proliferation in zzso zzso zzso However, the role of zzso in liver zzso and the overall mechanisms remain largely zzso To address this issue, we carried out a zzso zzso zzso analysis during liver zzso in mice after 2/3 partial zzso zzso at various zzso The results revealed differential expression of a subset of zzso notably a specific zzso expressed zzso associated with zzso signaling during liver zzso (an zzso associated with liver zzso termed zzso The functions of zzso were assessed by zzso and zzso this zzso in zzso and in zzso We found that zzso enhanced zzso proliferation by promoting progression of the cell cycle in zzso Furthermore, we showed that zzso accelerated mouse zzso proliferation and cell cycle progression during liver zzso in zzso zzso we discovered that zzso facilitated zzso D1 expression through zzso of zzso signaling by way of suppression of zzso In addition, zzso inhibited the expression of zzso mainly by recruiting zzso to the zzso promoter zzso We also identified a human zzso zzso of zzso zzso and found that it was expressed in human liver zzso 

zzso promotes cell cycle progression and zzso zzso proliferation during liver zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso intervention targeting zzso may be zzso beneficial in liver failure and liver transplantation by inducing liver zzso
