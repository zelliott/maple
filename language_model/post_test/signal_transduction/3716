Mechanical force applied to bone produces two localized mechanical signals on the zzso deformation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso fluid zzso To study the effects of these stimuli on zzso zzso cells were grown on type I zzso plastic plates and subjected to zzso zzso This technique produces uniform levels of zzso strain and fluid forces on the zzso Each of these parameters can be varied zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was used to assess the anabolic response of zzso zzso When fluid forces were low, neither strain magnitude nor strain rate was correlated with zzso zzso However, zzso fluid forces significantly increased zzso message levels independently of the strain magnitude or zzso These data indicate that fluid forces, and not mechanical stretch, influence zzso expression in zzso and suggest that fluid forces induced by zzso fluid flow within the bone zzso may play an important role in bone formation in response to mechanical zzso
