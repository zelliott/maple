The purpose of this study was to isolate cancer stem cells zzso also called zzso cells, zzso from established human zzso zzso zzso cell lines, characterize them extensively and dissect the mechanism for their zzso Freshly isolated zzso and zzso cells from the zzso human colon cancer cell line were subjected to various zzso Interestingly, zzso cells exhibited higher soft zzso zzso ability and in zzso zzso than zzso zzso In addition, the significant zzso of the protein Snail and the zzso of zzso a zzso zzso in zzso cells suggested that this population possessed higher zzso and differentiation potential than zzso zzso By manipulating the expression of zzso in zzso and zzso cells, we found that the levels of several zzso zzso and zzso were positively and zzso correlated with those of zzso zzso Further analyses revealed that zzso levels were zzso by zzso which was shown to bind to specific zzso present in the zzso zzso In agreement, zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso human colon cancer cells also resulted in an increase of their zzso Finally, we discovered that zzso zzso activity was required for the zzso of zzso in zzso cells, which was zzso by the interaction between zzso zzso and zzso Taken together, zzso is a critical zzso for modulating zzso in zzso More importantly, we show for the first time that the zzso of zzso by zzso signaling is the main reason for zzso in colon cancer zzso
