A cardiac hormone, zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a major role in blood pressure and volume zzso zzso activities are zzso by a single span zzso zzso carrying intrinsic zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to its zzso domain stimulates zzso zzso activity by an as yet unknown zzso Here we report the crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso domain in complex with zzso The structural comparison with the zzso zzso reveals that hormone binding causes the two zzso zzso to undergo an zzso twist with little zzso zzso zzso This motion produces a zzso zzso zzso of two zzso zzso in the zzso with essentially no change in the zzso zzso This movement alters the relative orientation of the two zzso by a shift equivalent to zzso rotation of each by 24 zzso These results suggest that zzso signaling by the zzso zzso is initiated via a zzso rotation zzso
