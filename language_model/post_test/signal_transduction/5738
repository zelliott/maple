zzso growth factors zzso are important regulators of cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso promote growth and zzso of zzso zzso cortical zzso Recently, the function of zzso in zzso zzso in the zzso signaling center was also zzso However, regulation of zzso area formation by zzso signaling remains zzso 

In zzso mice with zzso zzso of zzso zzso 3 zzso in the zzso surface area of the zzso zzso was markedly expanded at early zzso stage, while zzso surface area remained zzso zzso thickness was also increased in zzso zzso The expression domain and levels of zzso as well as overall zzso were zzso In contrast, the changes in zzso surface area were associated with accelerated cell cycle in early stages of zzso without an zzso of cell cycle zzso Moreover, a marked overproduction of intermediate zzso zzso was observed in later zzso indicating zzso of zzso 

zzso of zzso selectively promotes growth of zzso zzso zzso These observations support the zzso zzso and zzso zzso hypotheses and may explain premature zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso a human zzso zzso Together with previous work, this study suggests that formation of zzso and zzso areas are zzso regulated by zzso signaling in the cerebral zzso
