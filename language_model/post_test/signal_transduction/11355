The zzso zzso is expressed on activated zzso zzso cells, zzso certain zzso cells and some tumor cells and zzso zzso through the death zzso zzso In zzso T cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso also acts as a zzso zzso to coordinate zzso and function in zzso The molecular basis for this reverse signal zzso is yet zzso In the present report, we identify individual interaction zzso of zzso and adapter molecules that selectively interact with full-length zzso from zzso and human T zzso These results may help to explain the zzso capacity of zzso
