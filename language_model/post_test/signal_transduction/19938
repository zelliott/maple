The zzso environment strongly influences adult disease zzso We used a rat model of zzso maternal diabetes to test the hypothesis that adult offspring exposed to zzso in zzso display increased blood pressure and zzso in vascular zzso 

Diabetes was induced by zzso injection to pregnant rats on gestation day 13 zzso 21 zzso and partially controlled with insulin zzso zzso function was evaluated in zzso zzso 

Male but not female offspring of diabetic mothers zzso had significantly increased blood pressure as compared with zzso heart rate zzso was zzso For both zzso zzso zzso responses were similar as were in zzso zzso responses to zzso II, zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso II was similar in the two zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso significantly increased zzso responses to zzso II in controls but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production was greater in male zzso than in controls zzso zzso zzso 

Exposure to zzso in zzso results in zzso cardiovascular changes in adult zzso zzso zzso zzso oxygen species signaling may play a significant role in the zzso zzso of zzso
