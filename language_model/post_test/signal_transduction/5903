zzso and zzso motif zzso zzso is the key zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso induction by transforming growth factor beta 1 zzso which has also been identified as a zzso zzso involved in cardiac zzso zzso We hypothesized whether zzso zzso causes cardiac zzso formation due to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulation in this zzso Using zzso analysis of the human cardiovascular tissue zzso we found a positively significant association between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells increases the zzso tissue inhibitor 1/2 zzso protein level, which reduces zzso zzso zzso activity and also activates zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso and zzso zzso which zzso zzso possibly resulting in cardiac zzso Taken together, zzso activity zzso may be a good strategy to prevent the cardiac zzso zzso
