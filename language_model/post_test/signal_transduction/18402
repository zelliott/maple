zzso I expression was used as a marker to screen for zzso affected in the zzso transition zzso of zzso By zzso zzso we have isolated zzso zzso an zzso of zzso zzso It displays normal zzso but shows premature entry into the zzso zzso The disrupted gene was denominated zzso The zzso zzso was reconstructed by disruptions in different parts of the zzso suggesting that all had a complete loss of zzso zzso was expressed in growing zzso the levels of protein and zzso appear to increase with cell density and rapidly decrease with the onset of zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein with four putative zzso zzso In the C zzso the derived zzso acid sequence displays some similarity to the zzso domain of protein zzso zzso experiments demonstrate that the zzso zzso is cell zzso zzso factor is zzso at zzso zzso The response to zzso a negative regulator of zzso zzso was not impaired in zzso zzso zzso that lack the G protein zzso display a loss of zzso expression and do not zzso zzso double zzso show no zzso but strong zzso zzso This suggests that zzso is a negative regulator of the zzso downstream of or in a parallel zzso to zzso
