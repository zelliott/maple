zzso breast zzso frequently zzso to the bones and cause bone destruction, but the underlying mechanism is not fully zzso This study presents evidence that zzso protein zzso 1 zzso signaling in tumor cells promotes bone destruction by zzso breast zzso cells, controlling expression of zzso factors including zzso zzso zzso 9 and zzso zzso of zzso signaling by zzso zzso zzso in breast zzso zzso cells zzso bone colonization by zzso cells and bone zzso in the zzso injection zzso zzso studies showed that zzso of zzso by zzso or zzso blocked expression of factors implicated in bone zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso 8 zzso but did not affect zzso of zzso by zzso zzso signaling is zzso by zzso partners zzso zzso and zzso Carcinoma cells express elevated zzso levels of zzso and zzso whereas the zzso expression is noticeably zzso zzso depletion of zzso by zzso reduced expression of zzso and zzso Together, these studies show that the zzso signaling axis is critical for zzso bone zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso These findings identify the zzso axis as a potential therapeutic target in bone zzso
