zzso plasma cholesterol and increased zzso zzso zzso levels promote zzso of zzso in a process characterized by zzso unloading and zzso of zzso from zzso In contrast free cholesterol loading of zzso leads to zzso zzso activities and impaired zzso 

To study the role of HDL and the zzso cassette zzso zzso and zzso in modulating the zzso of zzso 

zzso mouse zzso displayed profoundly impaired zzso both in a zzso chamber zzso and in the zzso cavity of zzso zzso zzso HDL reversed impaired zzso in free zzso zzso zzso but was without effect in zzso cells, whereas zzso was effective in zzso zzso zzso had markedly increased zzso activity and increased association of zzso with the plasma membrane zzso Their defective zzso was reversed by a zzso zzso To gain a better understanding of the role of zzso in PM cholesterol movement, we measured zzso PM zzso zzso In zzso zzso the majority of cholesterol was located on the inner zzso whereas on zzso of zzso by liver X zzso zzso PM zzso was shifted to the outer zzso where it could be removed by zzso zzso zzso showed increased PM zzso content and defective zzso of zzso to the outer zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso causes an increased cholesterol content on the inner leaflet of the zzso associated with increased zzso PM zzso zzso and impairment of zzso zzso and zzso facilitate zzso zzso by promoting PM zzso cholesterol movement and may contribute to the ability of HDL to promote zzso of zzso
