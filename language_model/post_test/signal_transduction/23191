zzso zzso zzso zzso based on zzso resonance energy transfer zzso are powerful tools to study the zzso dynamics of cell zzso However, many zzso lack zzso We present a zzso library that contains zzso zzso zzso for both the donor and zzso zzso which alter the orientation of the zzso and thus better accommodate structural constraints imposed by different signaling molecules while maintaining zzso zzso Our strategy improved the brightness and dynamic range of zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Using the improved zzso zzso we found zzso zones of zzso activity at the tip of zzso zzso in growth cone zzso during zzso extension, whereas zzso was globally activated throughout collapsing growth zzso zzso was also activated in zzso and protruding zzso at the leading edge of zzso zzso Using the improved zzso zzso we simultaneously measured zzso zzso dynamics in multiple cells using zzso zzso and performed in zzso zzso imaging in zzso Thus, we provide a construction zzso consisting of a zzso set, which enables facile generation of sensitive zzso
