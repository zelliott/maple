The importance of inflammation as a driver of pathology is no longer confined to zzso and infectious zzso In line with convincing experimental data as well as abundant clinical findings the current view of zzso points to inflammation as a critical regulator of zzso plaque formation and progression leading to the fatal clinical zzso zzso zzso stroke or sudden cardiac zzso The underlying mechanisms have been a matter of intense research during the last zzso In this regard, the zzso zzso zzso and their zzso events have been shown to contribute to both, zzso plaque development and plaque zzso via a variety of zzso These involve the release of other zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso stimulation of acute phase protein zzso the release of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, the formation of zzso oxygen species generated by vascular zzso systems may play a critical role in the regulation of zzso indicating a cross talk between zzso substances zzso zzso II or zzso and zzso zzso such as zzso In this review we will zzso and discuss the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms how zzso as an early and central regulator of inflammation contributes to zzso and how this knowledge can be integrated into the clinical zzso
