zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that has been implicated in the impairment of zzso zzso via the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso However, the role zzso plays in humans is zzso This study investigated the effect of zzso on zzso metabolism and insulin signaling using human zzso zzso and small interfering zzso zzso against zzso to treat the human liver zzso zzso The zzso of key genes involved in zzso metabolism and the zzso zzso were detected by real-time zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso were measured by western zzso The incorporation of zzso zzso into zzso was zzso by liquid zzso zzso The results demonstrate that zzso zzso expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso signaling 3 zzso zzso the expressions of insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso inhibited the zzso zzso of zzso independent of zzso In conclusion, our findings suggest that zzso zzso insulin resistance in zzso cells at least partly via induction of zzso expression and reduction of zzso zzso through an zzso zzso zzso also increases zzso production via zzso zzso expression of the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
