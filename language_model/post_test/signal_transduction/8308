zzso is widely used to treat bipolar disorder, but its mechanism of action in this disorder is zzso zzso directly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a critical regulator of multiple signal zzso zzso zzso of zzso provides a compelling explanation for many of the known effects of lithium, including effects on early development and insulin zzso zzso However, zzso also zzso zzso zzso several structurally related zzso zzso and the scaffolding function of zzso It is not known which of these targets is responsible for the zzso or therapeutic effects of zzso in zzso The present review discusses basic criteria that can be applied to model systems to validate a proposed direct target of zzso In this context, we describe a set of simple zzso in mice that are robustly affected by chronic zzso treatment and are similarly affected by structurally diverse zzso zzso and by removing one copy of the zzso zzso These zzso from several independent laboratories, support a central role for zzso in zzso zzso responses to zzso
