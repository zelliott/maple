A region of the brain believed to be important in the zzso response to stress is the locus zzso the zzso site of zzso cell zzso zzso releasing hormone zzso is the primary zzso releasing hormone responsible for the zzso of the zzso axis in response to stress and, in this study, we employed a locus zzso cell line, zzso to investigate the zzso of zzso zzso pathways by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso and zzso (1 zzso produced transient increases in zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso (1 zzso response by zzso was zzso zzso zzso 154 zzso zzso zzso zzso responses to zzso effective zzso of zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (1 zzso were abolished by prior exposure to zzso (1 zzso At the zzso zzso zzso and zzso both substantially increased zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso was also effective at eliminating the zzso calcium zzso zzso with the cell zzso zzso zzso analogue zzso zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso an zzso of protein zzso A zzso for 12 zzso prior to zzso exposure similarly abolished the zzso calcium response to zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso to a maximum of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produced a much greater zzso zzso zzso zzso fold zzso zzso zzso 24 zzso In the presence of zzso (10 zzso neither zzso nor zzso zzso zzso was significantly different from in its zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso calcium responses in a locus zzso cell line possibly via zzso of zzso This zzso could be important in controlling zzso function in zzso in stressful situations in which the levels of zzso are increased in the locus zzso
