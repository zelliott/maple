zzso zzso leukemia zzso B cells characteristically exhibit low or zzso surface B cell zzso zzso and diminished responses to zzso zzso These features suggest that zzso cells may have sustained zzso affecting one or more of the zzso proteins required for zzso surface assembly and signal zzso Loss of expression and zzso in the critical zzso protein zzso zzso zzso are prevalent in zzso and could produce the hallmark features of these zzso B zzso Because patient zzso cells are intractable to zzso we developed a model system to analyze zzso zzso zzso T cells zzso expressing zzso zzso and zzso efficiently assembled a functional zzso when infected with zzso zzso virus bearing zzso zzso In contrast, a zzso zzso zzso protein truncated in the zzso domain did not associate with zzso or zzso at the cell zzso Another zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso zzso zzso motif zzso and zzso zzso brought the zzso to the surface as well as zzso zzso but showed significant impairment in zzso signaling events including zzso protein zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso zzso previously identified in zzso patients can affect zzso signaling and may contribute to the unresponsive B cell zzso in zzso Finally, the features of the zzso zzso in zzso predict that they may be generated by zzso zzso
