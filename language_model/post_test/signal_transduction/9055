zzso zzso has protective effects on zzso zzso zzso This study was to test whether EPO zzso after zzso is as effective as EPO zzso before zzso and to determine the role of zzso protein zzso zzso in the zzso effects of zzso zzso human EPO zzso zzso was zzso injected 12 hours before zzso zzso or 30 minutes after zzso zzso The levels of serum zzso were zzso at 24 and 72 hours after zzso The zzso size was determined by zzso blue zzso zzso The zzso damages were evaluated by electron zzso EPO zzso zzso zzso and protein levels were determined by zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and nuclear factor zzso B was determined by zzso An zzso zzso compound C, was used to inhibit zzso zzso in zzso The authors found that both zzso and zzso of EPO successfully attenuated the serum zzso levels, reduced the zzso size and ameliorated the zzso zzso Moreover, both zzso and zzso of EPO decreased the EPO zzso zzso zzso and protein expressions, which were zzso in zzso More importantly, under zzso conditions, EPO further increased the zzso of zzso and suppressed the zzso of nuclear factor zzso zzso Moreover, when zzso was blocked by compound C, the zzso effect of EPO was significantly attenuated zzso zzso zzso Thus, this study demonstrates that both zzso and zzso of EPO are zzso in an zzso manners, providing the first evidence that the zzso signaling zzso is involved in the zzso effects of zzso
