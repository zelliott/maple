DNA zzso breaks zzso formation coordinates the zzso program, and defects in zzso repair in zzso cells have been associated with human zzso However, the DNA damage response by zzso in terminally differentiated cells has not been explored zzso Here we show that mouse zzso muscle cells accumulate zzso after zzso damage, but they are extraordinarily resistant to the killing effects of a variety of zzso We demonstrate that, upon zzso zzso zzso of zzso occurs in zzso and is largely zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the DNA damage signaling cascade downstream of zzso is defective as shown by lack of zzso increase and zzso at zzso 18 zzso zzso zzso The stabilization of zzso by zzso was ineffective in zzso the cell death pathway, indicating that the resistance to zzso zzso is due to defective zzso downstream zzso The induction of specific types of damage is required to activate the cell death program in zzso Besides the zzso inhibitor zzso known for its zzso we show that the zzso inhibitor zzso is able to activate zzso and to kill effectively zzso Cell killing is zzso as demonstrated by full protection of zzso lacking zzso but there is a restriction of zzso zzso This new information may have important therapeutic implications in the prevention of muscle cell zzso
