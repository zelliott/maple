A zzso sequence motif within the class 1 zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso was zzso The sequence motif in the zzso zzso zzso is zzso This motif was present only in zzso zzso and not in other zzso that harbor the zzso zzso zzso it was speculated that this sequence was involved in zzso zzso of zzso zzso Other members of the zzso protein family are not activated zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso were changed by site directed zzso to the zzso similar zzso zzso and zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso and zzso had both lost the ability for zzso to activate the zzso zzso activity and showed reduced zzso zzso of the zzso zzso synthesis zzso The zzso zzso had a similar zzso constant, zzso for zzso but the zzso was only zzso compared with zzso for the wild type zzso The zzso zzso was found to have a zzso lower zzso for zzso and a zzso decrease in zzso The zzso by zzso of this zzso was about zzso The kinetic parameters for zzso with zzso zzso and zzso were similar for wild type and zzso zzso except that the zzso zzso only had half the zzso of the wild type zzso when zzso was the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso apparently had not lost the ability to bind zzso but the signal transmitted through the zzso to the active sites upon binding of the zzso zzso was clearly disrupted in the zzso zzso
