The recognition of zzso by membrane zzso M zzso results in a complex series of signaling events in the zzso leading to gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso is essential for the full repertoire of zzso signals to be zzso We examined the ability of zzso to regulate the nuclear factor zzso family of zzso factors, as the zzso of these factors is required for a B cell response to zzso We found greatly diminished zzso but not zzso zzso nuclear zzso and DNA binding in B cells from zzso zzso zzso mice that harbor an zzso zzso in zzso a zzso that produces a functionally inactive zzso The zzso was due, in part, to a failure to fully degrade the zzso protein of zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso of zzso chicken B cells, we found that expression of zzso or zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso is essential for zzso of zzso via the B cell zzso
