To explore the role of abnormalities of zzso 8, zzso and zzso genes in zzso of aggressive zzso 

zzso 8 was detected by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene and zzso gene zzso were detected by zzso high performance liquid zzso zzso and direct sequence analysis after the zzso zzso 

The rate of zzso 8 in zzso tumors zzso zzso was significantly higher than that in the primary tumors zzso zzso zzso substitution of zzso gene was found in 18 of 69 zzso aggressive zzso zzso transition of zzso gene was detected in 13 of 69 zzso and zzso at zzso 41 in zzso 3 involving zzso zzso implicated in the degradation of zzso The abnormal expression of zzso had no significant correlation with the zzso of zzso or zzso zzso The group with positively expressed zzso protein showed a significant higher zzso protein expression than those without zzso zzso zzso The zzso index was extremely low in all the zzso The zzso index zzso of the groups with positively expressed zzso and zzso D1 showed significantly lower zzso than those zzso 

zzso 8 may serve as a useful predictor of recurrence in aggressive zzso There are zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso genes in the aggressive zzso and there are abnormalities in the zzso signaling zzso These abnormalities may result in the zzso of cell proliferation and zzso which are likely to be import factors in the zzso
