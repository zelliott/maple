zzso zzso zzso have been assessed for transforming activity and for the ability of the zzso proteins to interact with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins in the zzso zzso zzso Transformation was assessed in zzso cells as well as in a zzso cell line, zzso that zzso a more sensitive transformation zzso zzso zzso Ras proteins were also examined for their ability to interact with an zzso zzso of zzso in zzso Finally, possible cooperation between different zzso zzso zzso and between zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso Ras transforming activity was shown to correlate best with the ability of the zzso protein to interact with zzso No evidence for cooperation between zzso zzso zzso was zzso Signaling through the zzso protein zzso cascade may be the only zzso zzso contributing to zzso transformation in these zzso
