zzso is a widely used zzso drug that can cause serious adverse drug zzso We used zzso zzso as a model zzso with which to zzso the molecular mechanisms of zzso toxicity and zzso Although most zzso cells died during the initial zzso treatment, some survived and started growing zzso zzso analysis of the adapted cells identified three major processes involved in zzso zzso and zzso In particular, zzso drug resistance zzso genes and genes under the control of zzso a zzso factor in the protein zzso C zzso pathway, were zzso in zzso zzso We tested if these processes or pathways were directly involved in zzso toxicity or zzso Of the zzso drug resistance gene products, the zzso zzso zzso was zzso important for zzso zzso Furthermore, deletion of components of the cell wall zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso whereas incubation of cells with the cell wall zzso zzso white before the addition of zzso decreased its zzso Also, zzso induced zzso which might trigger the cell wall zzso Genes involved in zzso zzso and zzso processing were zzso as were zzso zzso Paradoxically, deletion of the zzso zzso factor zzso or addition of the zinc zzso zzso significantly increased zzso zzso establishing a regulatory role for zinc in zzso zzso In conclusion, we have identified three new pathways involved in zzso tolerance in zzso zzso zzso as the main contributor to the zzso response, cell wall signaling via the zzso pathway, and zinc zzso regulated by zzso
