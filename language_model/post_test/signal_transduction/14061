zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso are widely used as a traditional Chinese medicine to control hypertension and cardiovascular disease, and to alleviate fever, zzso and zzso It has been demonstrated that zzso reduces zzso airway inflammation by regulating zzso zzso and decreases tumor growth in zzso zzso However, the effects of zzso on the zzso potential of zzso cancer cells and the detailed mechanism of its zzso activity have not been examined zzso In this study, we investigated whether an zzso extract of zzso zzso reduces the zzso potential of zzso cells, and zzso the underlying zzso zzso In addition, we examined whether zzso administration zzso pulmonary zzso of zzso injected zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso activity under zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso with zzso efficiently inhibited cell migration, invasion, and zzso zzso also dramatically suppressed zzso zzso activity and expression by blocking zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso a key regulator of zzso zzso activity, was almost completely blocked by zzso with zzso Furthermore, daily oral administration of zzso at doses of 50 and 100 zzso efficiently inhibited lung zzso of zzso cells injected into the tail veins of zzso mice with no systemic zzso These results demonstrate that zzso significantly reduced the zzso activity of highly zzso cancer cells by suppressing zzso activity via zzso of zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso may be a safe natural product for treatment of zzso zzso
