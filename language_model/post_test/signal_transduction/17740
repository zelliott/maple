zzso and its zzso play critical roles in cell fate zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in vascular zzso and defects in vascular zzso of targeted zzso in the zzso zzso have suggested a critical role for zzso signaling in zzso and zzso However, the zzso signaling that controls zzso and zzso gene expression is zzso We show here that vascular zzso growth factor zzso but not basic zzso growth factor can induce gene expression of zzso and its zzso zzso 4 zzso in human zzso zzso zzso The zzso specific signaling is zzso through zzso receptors 1 and 2 and is transmitted via the zzso zzso zzso but is independent of zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling zzso network formation of zzso cells on zzso and enhances formation of zzso structures in a three-dimensional zzso model, whereas blocking zzso signaling can partially inhibit network zzso This study provides the first evidence for regulation of zzso gene expression by an zzso growth factor and insight into the critical role of zzso signaling in zzso and zzso
