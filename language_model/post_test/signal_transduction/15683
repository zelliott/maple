zzso is a death zzso whose stimulation by either the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso leads to the formation of a zzso complex termed zzso zzso signaling zzso and the subsequent induction of a zzso zzso zzso According to the magnitude of the zzso formation, two types of cells have been zzso Although type I cells generate an important zzso the complex is barely found in type II zzso zzso the early stages preceding the zzso formation, we found that unlike zzso the commonly used zzso zzso zzso zzso the death zzso Using zzso of zzso zzso we showed that the zzso of the zzso zzso did not alter the capping of the zzso zzso or its zzso into the zzso zzso In addition, whereas the disruption of zzso prevented the zzso of zzso the zzso formation and the zzso signal induced by the zzso zzso zzso in type I cells, it did not affect the signal triggered by the soluble and zzso zzso regardless of the type of zzso In conclusion, the addition of zzso on type I cells triggers an zzso zzso zzso which is absent or marginal in cells (both types I and zzso treated with zzso
