We report a transgenic mouse line in which zzso zzso B zzso zzso can be activated in an zzso manner in defined cell zzso In this transgenic mouse line, zzso expression allows the expression of a zzso form of zzso in a defined cell zzso zzso injection of tamoxifen triggers the transient zzso of zzso in zzso Thus, this transgenic line allows the transient zzso of zzso zzso in a zzso cell zzso We expect that this transgenic system will provide a unique tool to study the roles of zzso zzso in zzso
