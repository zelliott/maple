Genes involved in the zzso signaling zzso are often altered in several types of zzso The zzso human colon cancer cell line zzso has zzso zzso and deficient expression of zzso and zzso which are involved in the zzso signaling zzso 

Western zzso and zzso were performed to confirm gene zzso the zzso zzso to detect cell growth, flow zzso to investigate the cell cycle and the zzso to detect cell zzso 

In the absence of zzso zzso was zzso cell growth was inhibited and zzso was zzso zzso treatment did not affect zzso zzso however, the increase in zzso expression was significant and time zzso Interestingly, zzso but not zzso was also zzso upon exposure to zzso This was not the case after zzso treatment of parent zzso zzso As expected, zzso further inhibited cell growth and induced zzso in zzso zzso 

Our data demonstrate that zzso is involved in zzso and zzso cell growth zzso and zzso induction zzso
