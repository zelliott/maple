To investigate the role of zzso tissue growth factor zzso in zzso zzso transition of zzso cells in zzso 

zzso cells were randomly divided into two groups: zzso control group including cells cultured in zzso medium supplemented with zzso fetal bovine serum only; and zzso experimental group including cells cultured in zzso medium supplemented with zzso fetal bovine serum and zzso zzso at a final concentration of 5 zzso The cells were collected at 72 h time zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used to evaluate the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso was used to detect the zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso Chamber was used to detect the migration of zzso zzso at 1 zzso 3 d and 5 zzso 

There were less zzso but more zzso expressed in cells of the experimental zzso The presence of zzso was detected at 48 h with peak at 72 h in the cells of the experimental zzso On the first day, the cellular migration in the two groups showed no zzso However, after 3 days, the transformed cells migrated surpassed the control group with peak at the 5th day zzso zzso 

zzso tissue growth factor zzso zzso transformation of zzso cells, in which the zzso signaling zzso may play an important zzso
