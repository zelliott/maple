To what extent are the pathways that regulate zzso zzso between stem cells at different stages of development and in different zzso Some pathways play a zzso zzso role in regulating the zzso of diverse stem cells, whereas other pathways are specific to stem cells in certain zzso or at certain stages of zzso Recent studies have highlighted differences between the zzso of zzso fetal and adult stem zzso By understanding these similarities and differences we may come to a molecular understanding of how stem cells replicate themselves and why aspects of this process differ between stem zzso
