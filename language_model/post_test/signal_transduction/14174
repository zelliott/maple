zzso zzso cell zzso is a rare zzso associated with a high risk of zzso and zzso There are limited data on the role of the zzso signaling zzso in penile zzso cell zzso zzso and tumor zzso We assessed a possible role for zzso signaling zzso zzso as a potential zzso zzso of outcome and a therapeutic target for penile zzso 

A cohort of 67 patients diagnosed with invasive penile zzso cell zzso from 1987 to 2010 who had known zzso status were selected for zzso zzso zzso were constructed with 67 primary penile zzso cell zzso matched normal zzso and 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was evaluated using a zzso zzso on a scale of 0 to zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was increased in penile tumors compared with matched adjacent normal zzso indicating zzso of the zzso signaling zzso in penile zzso Over expression of zzso zzso and zzso was significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso also correlated with a poor outcome, including zzso zzso or disease specific zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso were associated with lower zzso zzso zzso and intense zzso expression was associated with zzso negative zzso 

zzso of zzso signaling may contribute to penile zzso cell zzso progression and aggressive zzso zzso zzso or its downstream signaling targets, such as zzso may be a valid therapeutic zzso
