zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene cause zzso dominant zzso zzso The aims of the present study were the functional characterization of novel zzso of the zzso found in patients, the comparison of in zzso zzso function with clinical zzso and the effect of the zzso zzso zzso on the signaling of zzso receptors as a potential new treatment for zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in human embryonic kidney cells zzso zzso zzso signaling was studied by measuring zzso free calcium in response to different zzso of zzso calcium zzso in the presence or absence of zzso 

All zzso patients had lowered serum calcium ranging from zzso to zzso zzso and inadequate intact zzso and urinary calcium zzso In zzso testing of zzso zzso from these patients revealed exaggerated zzso zzso zzso responses with zzso values for zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso which was lower than for the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso diminished the responsiveness to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso however, was only responsive when zzso with the zzso zzso 

zzso might offer medical treatment for patients with zzso dominant zzso caused by zzso zzso zzso
