This study examined the functional significance of zzso zzso zzso expression on zzso injury induced by zzso obstruction in the rat zzso Male zzso rats were divided into three groups, after which unilateral zzso obstruction zzso was zzso zzso zzso 1), treated with 30 zzso body zzso zzso zzso zzso and treated with 50 zzso body zzso zinc zzso zzso zzso zzso and 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso After 7 and 14 zzso zzso changes and the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso cells were flattened on day 7 after zzso zzso zzso and separation of the zzso were markedly increased on day zzso In contrast, the zzso that were treated with zzso exhibited minimal zzso zzso and zzso of zzso cells on day 7 and fewer changes on day 14 than in the zzso However, treatment with zzso an inhibitor of HO zzso activity, eliminated the beneficial effect of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso Increased zzso expression was associated with increased zzso In the zzso rats, zzso signals were decreased compared with the zzso zzso The level of zzso Bad was not changed in any zzso The positive cells for zzso zzso were significantly increased in zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso cells in the zzso rats, and zzso treatment decreased the zzso zzso This study demonstrates that zzso of zzso provides protection against zzso injury that follows zzso This effect is dependent on zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso
