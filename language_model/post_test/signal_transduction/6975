A major production constraint on the important ornamental species zzso is black spot which is caused by the zzso fungus zzso zzso The molecular basis of host resistance to zzso zzso has not been studied as yet in any zzso Here, high zzso sequencing was taken to characterize the zzso response of the zzso leaf to zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso data was acquired using zzso technology, based on the zzso zzso 2000 zzso Four different libraries derived from two sets of leaves harvested from either zzso or zzso plants were zzso Over seven million clean reads were generated from each library, each corresponding to a coverage of zzso zzso About zzso of the reads could be mapped to a set of zzso zzso Read frequency was used as a measure of transcript abundance and therefore as an zzso of differential zzso in the four zzso The zzso transcribed genes identified were involved in photosynthesis, pathogen recognition, zzso oxygen species generation, cell wall modification and zzso zzso in addition, a number of varied zzso factors were zzso A selection of 23 of the genes was zzso using quantitative zzso to validate the zzso zzso 

A substantial body of zzso zzso sequence was generated, which led to a number of insights into the molecular basis of the host response to zzso zzso zzso Although most of the zzso transcribed genes were zzso by the presence of the zzso those involved in photosynthesis were zzso
