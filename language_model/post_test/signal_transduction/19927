A recent model proposing that a barrier is raised against tumor evolution in zzso zzso is zzso For that we zzso expression zzso in zzso maintenance zzso DNA damage response, death pathways and cell cycle and also zzso expressed genes in zzso of zzso and zzso zzso deposited in the zzso zzso We find that the main zzso in zzso samples zzso the barrier are: zzso DNA double zzso signaling and repair pathways zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso dependent (and zzso repair and zzso pathways induction and zzso zzso zzso induction early in tissue zzso In the cancer samples we find that the induced pathways in zzso are systematically inhibited and the only remaining induced zzso is zzso whereas the zzso zzso arises induced in most zzso The results give support to the model, zzso they reveal the involvement of additional mechanisms in zzso including the early induction of zzso zzso and of zzso independent zzso
