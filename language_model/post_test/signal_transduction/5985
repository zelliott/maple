Major signaling zzso have been shown to play a role in the regulation of zzso zzso transport zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso in zzso are regulated by the second zzso zzso through the protein zzso A zzso signaling zzso ; however, the exact mechanisms of this regulation are poorly zzso To study the role of signaling molecules in the regulation of zzso transport in zzso we have asked the question whether the components of the zzso zzso are bound to zzso zzso and whether they interact with molecular zzso to regulate the zzso movement throughout the zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso contain zzso and scaffolding proteins and that zzso associates with zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, we found that the zzso regulatory zzso forms two separate complexes, one with zzso zzso zzso zzso and one with zzso II and zzso V zzso zzso and that the removal of zzso from zzso causes zzso of zzso and disruption of zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso contain protein complexes that include motor proteins and signaling molecules involved in different components of zzso zzso We propose to call such complexes zzso motor zzso zzso
