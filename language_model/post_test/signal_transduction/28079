We have previously shown that behavioral changes induced by zzso were due to an zzso of zzso zzso zzso via the zzso acid cascade in the zzso In the present study, we investigated the participation of the zzso zzso zzso the target of zzso in the brain, in behavioral suppression induced by zzso zzso an zzso of the naturally occurring zzso using a zzso zzso task in zzso zzso administration of zzso inhibited the zzso behavior, which was significantly antagonized by both the selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso administration of zzso significantly inhibited the zzso performance similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso twice a day for 3 days, zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso levels as determined by the zzso analysis in the cerebral cortex, zzso and zzso zzso also antagonized the zzso suppression of the lever zzso In the same way, the suppression of zzso behavior by zzso was significantly improved by zzso It is concluded that the suppression of zzso behavior by zzso is due to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso through an zzso of zzso in the zzso
