Rehabilitation is important for the functional recovery of patients with spinal zzso zzso However, neurological events associated with rehabilitation remain zzso zzso we investigated zzso zzso and exercise following spinal zzso injury, and found that assisted stepping exercise of spinal zzso injured rats in the inflammatory phase causes zzso zzso rats with zzso spinal zzso zzso injury were subjected to assisted stepping exercise 7 days following zzso Exercise promoted microscopic recovery of zzso tract zzso but the paw withdrawal threshold decreased and zzso had zzso zzso suggesting a potential cause of the zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso for zzso zzso factor zzso was expressed on zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling markedly suppressed zzso zzso and decreased the paw withdrawal zzso Thus, early rehabilitation for spinal zzso injury may cause zzso with zzso zzso of zzso through zzso zzso
