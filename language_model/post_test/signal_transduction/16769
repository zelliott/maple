zzso zzso of Ras pathways plays a critical role in cancer development and zzso zzso of such pathways are already in use for cancer therapy, with significant but as yet only partial success in the most deadly types of human zzso against which even combinations of zzso zzso with classic zzso drugs or zzso are zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of Ras zzso are now in use in clinical zzso In this review we analyze possible reasons for the limited zzso the diverse and sometimes even contradictory effects of active Ras pathways in tumor zzso propose possible alternative methods of tailoring zzso inhibitor combinations for cancer zzso Such tailoring is now possible thanks to increased knowledge of the complexity of Ras zzso their cooperation with other zzso zzso and their zzso zzso We provide examples demonstrating that this knowledge can be translated into useful drug combinations that disrupt multiple zzso pathways and hit a weak point of a given tumor zzso One such example is combination treatment with a Ras inhibitor and a zzso blocker for pancreatic tumor zzso The future design of such potential drug combination therapies and the follow-up of their outcome will undoubtedly be facilitated by zzso profiling and zzso zzso
