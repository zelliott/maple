zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso showed positive zzso towards zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and organic zzso present in the zzso of zzso zzso (a zzso plant zzso zzso The varied response of zzso traits such as speed, rate of change in direction zzso and net to gross displacement ratio zzso was observed for different zzso zzso speed of the strains was highest in zzso diluted zzso or zzso zzso strength of different zzso but further zzso significantly decreased the swimming speed zzso zzso zzso zzso response of P zzso was positively correlated with swimming speed zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso Relative to control, the zzso values decreased zzso in zzso acids or zzso and zzso in zzso or organic zzso With increase in swimming speed, the zzso of both strains also increased, but the zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso strains did not show significant differences in their zzso zzso The results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso contains chemical zzso that serve as signal for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso P zzso strains thus may consume zzso zzso as zzso and thus spores could offer a niche for these bacteria in zzso
