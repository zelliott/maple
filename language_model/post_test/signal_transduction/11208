zzso zzso zzso protein zzso are activated by dual zzso on specific zzso and specific zzso zzso that are separated by a single zzso and the zzso zzso motif is a hallmark of zzso zzso In the fungus zzso zzso which causes corn zzso disease, the zzso zzso a zzso previously described to have roles in zzso carries a zzso motif that zzso with the zzso of zzso zzso In this work, we demonstrate that zzso is activated through a mechanism that requires the zzso of this zzso Our data show that zzso a zzso zzso involved in mating and zzso in zzso zzso is required to activate zzso most likely through zzso of the zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso is also required for mating and zzso We investigated the reasons for zzso and zzso of zzso cells, and we found that zzso is required for zzso of zzso a central regulator of mating and zzso in zzso zzso zzso belongs to a wide zzso protein group, whose members have not been previously defined as zzso zzso although they carry zzso zzso On the basis of our data, we propose that all of these proteins constitute a new family of zzso zzso
