zzso an zzso for the zzso zzso zzso can be an zzso and zzso treatment in zzso zzso The clinical use of zzso is limited because of the lack of zzso that predict hormone zzso Despite its efficacy in cancer therapy, mechanisms and site of action for zzso remain zzso Using an in zzso zzso cancer mouse model driven by clinically relevant genetic changes but zzso responses to hormonal therapy, we show that signaling through zzso zzso is necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting from zzso loss of zzso zzso were hormone sensitive and had abundant expression of zzso zzso zzso deletion of zzso as a single genetic change in these tumors induced zzso resistance indicating that zzso signaling through the zzso is essential for the zzso therapeutic zzso A zzso zzso tumor with low levels of zzso zzso developed when zzso of zzso was coupled with zzso zzso The innate zzso resistance in zzso tumors stemmed from zzso of zzso in the tumor zzso zzso of zzso zzso expressed from a zzso active promoter zzso these tumors to zzso zzso zzso show that signaling through zzso zzso is sufficient for inducing hormone zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso of zzso zzso could be a potential therapeutic target for zzso zzso zzso tumors to zzso zzso On the basis of these results, zzso expression of zzso may emerge as a reliable zzso in predicting response to hormonal zzso
