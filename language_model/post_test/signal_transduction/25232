zzso zzso and zzso factor zzso derived from the egg of the zzso zzso activates zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso preparation of intact zzso zzso without zzso was shown to require zzso for zzso However, a zzso preparation of intact zzso zzso treated with zzso did not require zzso for zzso suggesting that zzso is a prerequisite factor for zzso zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to inhibit zzso zzso During in zzso or in zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso or zzso a 26 zzso zzso protein and 21 zzso zzso light chain were zzso respectively, suggesting the involvement of zzso zzso of these proteins in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and an inhibitor of zzso zzso light chain zzso zzso also inhibited the zzso of zzso zzso zzso was reversed by the addition of zzso inhibitor zzso zzso preparations of zzso zzso in the presence of zzso or zzso were zzso by zzso suggesting that zzso participated in zzso zzso and that zzso synthesis was followed by zzso of a zzso zzso
