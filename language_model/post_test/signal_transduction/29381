A promising agent for use in prostate cancer therapy is the zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso This compound, however, has the potential for causing serious side effects in zzso zzso To minimize these bystander zzso we have designed and zzso two novel zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso for use against prostate zzso These zzso were composed of zzso coupled to one of two peptides zzso zzso or zzso that can be selectively zzso by zzso converting the mature zzso into an active zzso inhibitor within the zzso zzso Of the two zzso zzso was rapidly zzso with a zzso of zzso upon incubation with the zzso zzso Thus, modulating zzso at the secondary zzso with zzso peptides is a promising strategy for developing zzso to target prostate zzso
