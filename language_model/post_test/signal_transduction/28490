zzso growth zzso zzso regulates cell growth zzso and zzso of the zzso signaling zzso contributes to tumor zzso In our previous study, altered expression of zzso zzso receptors and zzso was shown to correlate with tumor progression in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso These zzso however, were maintained normally in some patients with zzso zzso In our study, the mechanism by which aggressive zzso SCC maintains these components was investigated, with particular emphasis on the participation of zzso and zzso as zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso was carried out on surgical specimens obtained from 80 patients with zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso was also studied in 6 established cell lines derived from zzso SCC and compared to an immortalized human zzso cell line by Western zzso High levels of expression of zzso detected zzso were found to correlate with depth of invasion zzso zzso zzso and zzso stage zzso zzso zzso There was, however, no significant correlation between expression of zzso and zzso zzso A significant correlation between zzso and zzso expression was zzso Moreover, in patients with zzso negative zzso the survival rates of patients with zzso positive expression were significantly lower than those of patients with zzso negative expression zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed at a high level in 5 of 6 cell lines derived from zzso SCC compared to immortalized zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that was zzso by zzso signaling was expressed at a low level in the 5 cell zzso The expression of zzso protein as a zzso zzso in zzso signaling seems to be correlated with tumor progression of zzso zzso
