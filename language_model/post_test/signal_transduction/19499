We have been extensively investigating the mechanisms by which zzso regulate feeding behavior by using a goldfish zzso zzso zzso In this species, the zzso action of zzso zzso is centrally zzso via the zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso system, whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in the appetite regulation as a peripheral zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to identify the mechanism of the zzso effect of peripherally injected zzso which has not yet been identified in zzso zzso of zzso a zzso that destroys primary sensory zzso at 100 zzso zzso blocked the zzso action of zzso injected zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso action of zzso injected zzso (5 zzso zzso was not blocked by zzso of zzso zzso with a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso attenuated the zzso action of zzso The expression level of zzso zzso in the zzso tissue of the zzso group was not changed, but the level of zzso zzso was significantly increased at zzso after zzso zzso we have identified for the first time that the reduction of appetite induced by peripherally injected zzso in goldfish appears to be zzso by the zzso zzso and subsequently through the zzso and zzso zzso zzso
