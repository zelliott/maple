In zzso plasma zzso of zzso acids zzso are affected by nutritional or zzso zzso zzso in AA profiles have been reported as a result of a zzso of any one of the essential zzso a dietary imbalance of AA or an insufficient intake of zzso In recent years, evidence has accumulated that AA availability regulates the expression of several genes involved in the regulation of a number of cellular functions or AA zzso Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms involved in the AA regulation of zzso gene expression are zzso particularly the signaling pathways zzso the AA zzso This work provides a better understanding of the signaling pathways involved in the AA control of gene zzso We studied the expression of zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso in response to deprivation of a single AA and investigated the possible link between protein synthesis zzso due to zzso acid limitation and gene zzso We have shown the zzso 1) several mechanisms are involved in the AA control of gene zzso When omitted from the culture zzso each AA can activate one (or zzso specific signaling pathways leading to the regulation of one specific pattern of zzso 2) AA limitation by itself can induce gene expression independently of a cellular stress due to protein synthesis zzso Together, these results suggest that AA control of gene expression involves several specific mechanisms by which one AA (or one group of zzso can activate one signaling zzso and thus alter one specific pattern of gene zzso
