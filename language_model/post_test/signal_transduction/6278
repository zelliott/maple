zzso proteins play pivotal roles during signal zzso In zzso zzso the zzso scaffold protein is required for zzso of the mating zzso cascade in response to mating zzso and assembles a G zzso cascade complex at the plasma zzso To serve this function, zzso zzso a regulated zzso event involving nuclear shuttling and recruitment to the cell zzso Here, we show that zzso is also subject to two types of zzso and increases in abundance as a result of zzso zzso During zzso growth, zzso is zzso zzso through a process regulated by the zzso zzso During mating zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso by the mating zzso zzso Multiple zzso of the mating zzso cascade contribute to zzso zzso of zzso with the mating zzso contributing the zzso zzso induction or zzso of the zzso zzso zzso increases the abundance of zzso at a zzso step, as long as the mating zzso are zzso zzso the level of zzso zzso increases the amount of zzso at the cell zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso reveals a strict requirement for zzso recruitment to the plasma membrane for the zzso zzso These results suggest that the pool of zzso that is recruited to the plasma membrane selectively zzso feedback zzso by the associated zzso leading to an increased pool of zzso at the site of polarized zzso These findings provide evidence of a zzso regulated mechanism for zzso control of a signaling scaffold that zzso zzso zzso
