zzso zzso is a primary form of information transfer in cell signaling pathways and plays a crucial role in regulating biological zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in a number of diseases, and zzso and zzso the cellular zzso that control dynamic zzso events, present attractive therapeutic zzso However, the innate complexity of signaling networks has presented many challenges to therapeutic target selection and successful drug zzso zzso in zzso can contribute functional, zzso zzso across signaling networks that can provide insight into suitable drug targets, more broadly profile compound activities, and identify key zzso to assess clinical zzso Advances in zzso zzso efforts now provide the ability to zzso zzso with zzso and sensitivity to sample a significant portion of the zzso in clinically relevant zzso This review will discuss recent work and examples of application data that demonstrate the utility of zzso with a particular focus on the use of quantitative zzso and zzso signaling analyses to provide robust measurement for functional biological interpretation of drug action on signaling and zzso zzso
