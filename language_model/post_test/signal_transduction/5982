Signaling centers within developing zzso regulate zzso in both plants and zzso The putative zzso factor zzso zzso is an organizing signal regulating the division of specific stem cells in the zzso zzso zzso of gene zzso with protein zzso indicates that zzso moves in a highly specific manner from the cells of the stele in which it is zzso zzso Here, we provide evidence that zzso zzso trafficking is both regulated and zzso First, we show that zzso zzso of zzso in the stele is intrinsic to the zzso zzso Next, we show that zzso must be present in the zzso to move, providing evidence that zzso movement is zzso Finally, we describe an zzso new zzso zzso in which the protein is present in the zzso yet does not zzso Thus, in contrast to proteins that move by a process resembling zzso a zzso pool of zzso is not sufficient for zzso
