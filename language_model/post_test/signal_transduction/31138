zzso is the first zzso channel for which the molecular structure was zzso However, the high resolution structural information is limited to the zzso domain, and the dynamic picture of the full zzso channel remains zzso We have developed a new approach to investigate the surface structure of zzso and we applied this method to investigate the full length of the zzso zzso zzso substitution was introduced into 25 sites, and specific reaction of these zzso channels to a bare surface of a flat gold plate was evaluated by surface zzso resonance zzso The surface zzso resonance signals revealed the highest exposure for the zzso of the zzso zzso When the gate of the zzso channel is kept closed at pH zzso the extent of exposure showed periodic patterns for the consecutive sites located in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso This suggests that these stretches take the zzso zzso When the channel was actively gated at pH zzso many sites in the zzso domain became zzso Compared with the rigid structure in pH zzso these results indicate that the zzso domain became loosely packed upon active zzso The zzso end of the zzso zzso is a moving part of the gate, and it is exposed to the outer surface slightly at pH zzso By adding a channel blocker, zzso the gate is further zzso This suggests that in the active gating zzso keeps the gate open rather than being trapped in the central zzso
