The serum zzso A zzso factor zzso was identified as a family of zzso zzso factors that is activated by many zzso of zzso Its zzso involves a zzso event, whose mechanism is not fully zzso Here, we show that zzso treatment of several cell types, including mouse zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso and a primary culture of vascular smooth muscle cells from zzso zzso activated cellular zzso ability to bind zzso The protein zzso A zzso activity in zzso extracts of zzso cells was responsible for the zzso of the zzso activity of the cellular zzso zzso Furthermore, treatment of nuclear extracts of zzso cells with zzso zzso increased the zzso activity of cellular zzso zzso and specific zzso of zzso zzso the enhanced zzso ability of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso with these findings, zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso markedly increased expression of the zzso zzso These results imply a functional role for the previously detected zzso interaction between zzso zzso factor and the zzso zzso of zzso and further demonstrate the consequences of zzso signaling for the expression of zzso zzso
