zzso stem cells zzso are zzso cells that can differentiate into various cell types and have been widely used in tissue engineering zzso In tissue engineering, a scaffold, zzso and growth factors are used as essential components and their interactions have been regarded to be important for zzso of zzso A critical problem for zzso in tissue engineering is their low survival ability and zzso Most zzso are going to be zzso after zzso zzso increasing zzso survival ability and zzso is the key for potential applications of zzso Several approaches have been studied to increase zzso tissue forming capacity including application of growth factors, zzso of stem cell regulatory zzso and improvement of zzso for zzso The effects of these approaches on zzso have been associated with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso The zzso plays central regulatory roles in zzso survival, zzso migration, zzso zzso production, and zzso In this review, we zzso and discuss the zzso related to the roles of the zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso and the involvement of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso have been modified in their properties and surface structure and loaded with growth factors to increase zzso zzso Several studies demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso are zzso by the zzso of the zzso zzso
