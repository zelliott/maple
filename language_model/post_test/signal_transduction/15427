zzso diseases often coincide with reduced bone zzso zzso zzso regulate bone mass by maintaining the balance between bone formation and zzso Despite its zzso significance, the effect of inflammation on zzso zzso is not zzso To fill this zzso we investigated whether the inflammatory zzso tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso response to mechanical zzso 

zzso zzso were incubated with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso for 30 minutes or 24 hours, or with calcium zzso for 30 zzso zzso were subjected to mechanical loading by zzso fluid flow zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso and the response was zzso by measuring zzso oxide zzso production using zzso zzso and by measuring zzso calcium concentration zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso by zzso and zzso was zzso by measuring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso using traction force zzso and zzso zzso was zzso using optical magnetic twisting zzso 

zzso fluid flow increased zzso within seconds (in zzso of zzso and NO production within 5 minutes zzso zzso and zzso inhibited these zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso fluid zzso NO zzso zzso and zzso affected zzso zzso likely because 24 hours of incubation with zzso and zzso decreased the amount of zzso zzso with zzso for 24 hours zzso zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso and zzso inhibit mechanical zzso NO production by zzso via zzso of zzso fluid zzso zzso and that zzso stimulates zzso zzso Since both NO and zzso zzso affect zzso these findings provide a mechanism by which inflammatory zzso might contribute to bone loss and consequently affect bone mass in zzso zzso
