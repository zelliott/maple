zzso react to increased zzso with numerous changes in gene zzso The specific genes affected differ between species, but the known zzso effects of the gene products are remarkably similar, particularly with regard to cellular zzso of compatible organic zzso Here we concentrate on the molecular basis for zzso regulation of gene zzso emphasizing certain genes expressed in bacteria, zzso and the zzso zzso zzso because their expression is best zzso Thus, we emphasize 1) bacterial and zzso zzso zzso zzso systems, each consisting of a membrane zzso sensor and a separate zzso response regulator that, when zzso alters transcription, 2) volume regulatory increases in cellular zzso zzso that can prompt increased gene zzso in bacteria through direct effects on DNA and that in zzso zzso cells increase transcription, seemingly via zzso zzso 3) a zzso zzso cascade that zzso an zzso signal to the gene regulating the level of zzso and 4) in zzso cells, several zzso zzso that are activated by zzso but whose zzso targets are not yet zzso
