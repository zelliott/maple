zzso restriction zzso by feeding the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso - a zzso zzso that lacks the ability to undergo zzso - has been found to increase the life span of the zzso zzso To facilitate understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind this life extension, we analyzed zzso of zzso and zzso zzso obtained by zzso at different zzso We found that, depending on age, DOG changes the magnitude of the expression values of about 2 to 24 percent of the genes significantly, although our results reveal that the gross changes introduced by DOG are small compared to the zzso zzso We found that 27 genes are constantly either zzso or zzso by DOG over the whole life span, among them several members of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso change with age of the zzso expression patterns of the genes was investigated, leading to the result that 21 genes reverse their zzso zzso under impaired zzso Put simply, the zzso reduces the gross zzso activity but increases the zzso of gene zzso However, a detailed analysis of network parameters zzso that the introduced changes differ remarkably between individual zzso zzso We found a reorganization of the hubs of the zzso zzso when standard diet is replaced by DOG zzso By constructing correlation based difference networks, we identified those zzso pathways that are most vigorously changed by impaired zzso Taken together, we have found a number of genes and pathways that are potentially involved in the zzso extension of life span of zzso zzso Furthermore, our results demonstrate how the network structure of zzso zzso pathways is zzso under impaired zzso
