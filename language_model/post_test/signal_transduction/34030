To understand the function of the zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso the zzso factor gene zzso which responds to the zzso zzso has been studied in tomato zzso zzso zzso This zzso called zzso is present as a single zzso and is expressed in both the zzso and zzso during seed zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso It is also expressed in young zzso zzso There is an zzso similarity in the zzso acid sequence of the binding domain of the protein that is zzso by this tomato zzso gene when compared to that zzso by the zzso genes from zzso rice and zzso In both zzso and zzso intact tomato seeds, zzso expression increases during zzso is zzso by zzso acid zzso and declines zzso zzso transcripts are also present in zzso zzso zzso seeds zzso in water, and they are zzso by zzso during promotion of zzso However, dissected zzso zzso complete zzso when zzso in either water or zzso with almost no difference in the amount of zzso transcribed by the zzso gene during this zzso This is indicative that zzso is not required for the expression of the zzso zzso which is likely necessary, but not zzso for zzso to be completed, especially in the intact zzso The zzso hormone zzso acid does not influence expression of this zzso zzso of the zzso gene also occurs in the zzso but there is no correlation between its expression and zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso
