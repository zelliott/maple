zzso signaling molecules such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso organize zzso information along the zzso zzso axis of the zzso wing zzso zzso Responding cells activate different downstream targets depending on the combination and level of these signals and other factors present at the time of signal zzso Two such factors, zzso zzso and zzso zzso are initially zzso throughout the entire wing disc, but are later zzso in zzso cells, permitting the subsequent zzso of zzso zzso Control of zzso and zzso repression is, therefore, crucial for wing development, and plays a role in shaping and zzso the adult zzso Although both zzso and zzso participate in this control, their specific contributions remain zzso In this report, we analyze zzso and zzso in the wing disc, and show that zzso and zzso act independently as the primary signals for the repression of zzso and zzso zzso In cells that receive low levels of zzso zzso repression also requires zzso zzso Furthermore, although zzso is required continuously for zzso repression throughout development, zzso is only required for the initiation of zzso zzso Instead, the maintenance of zzso repression requires zzso group zzso zzso gene zzso which is zzso for zzso zzso Thus, despite their overall similar expression patterns, zzso and zzso repression in the wing disc is controlled by two very different zzso
