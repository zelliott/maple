The model of membrane zzso by zzso functional zzso zzso named zzso zzso has been a fruitful concept resulting in great progress in understanding T cell signal zzso However, due to recent results it has become clear that zzso zzso describe only one out of several membrane organizing principles crucial for T cell zzso besides fences and zzso and zzso interactions that take part in the formation of the zzso zzso as a highly organized structure at the T cell contact site to the zzso zzso This review describes the concepts of zzso zzso and other membrane organizing principles to evolve a novel integrated model on the functional role of zzso in zzso zzso formation and T cell zzso Further research has to zzso the relative contribution and zzso of different modes of membrane organization in productive T cell zzso
