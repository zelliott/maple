Sonic zzso zzso function is essential for patterning and cell fate zzso particularly in zzso regions of the central nervous zzso It is also a crucial zzso for zzso zzso zzso precursors and is important in maintenance of the stem cell niche in the zzso zzso Although it has been reported that zzso is expressed in the developing zzso zzso functions of zzso in this region are zzso and detailed characterization of zzso zzso transcripts in zzso has not been zzso To clarify the roles of zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso zzso development, we have knocked out the zzso and zzso genes specifically in the early developing zzso zzso by using zzso zzso The zzso showed a smaller zzso zzso at zzso which was caused by cell cycle zzso defects of the neural zzso zzso The cell cycle length of the zzso cells was zzso and the number of zzso cells and zzso were zzso zzso analysis revealed abnormal positioning of zzso in the zzso The characteristics of the zzso zone, zzso zone and zzso cells were also zzso zzso zzso of zzso was detected in the zzso zzso of wild zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso supports the above zzso Our data indicate that zzso signaling plays an important role in development of the zzso
