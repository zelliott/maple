zzso of learning and memory is a significant pathological feature of many neurodegenerative diseases including zzso zzso regulation and fine tuning of zzso of the zzso which is an integral part of the zzso program of the zzso brain, are essential for the normal function of the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein implicated in zzso functions and in the zzso of a range of neurodegenerative diseases including zzso and zzso We have combined the use of zzso dye injection, zzso zzso zzso rescue, zzso zzso Western zzso analysis and patch clamp zzso measurement of primary mouse zzso zzso in culture to study the functional role of zzso in zzso zzso We found that depletion of zzso leads to an increase in the number of zzso as well as the percentage of matured spines among the zzso zzso the zzso of zzso also increases the level of zzso and its activated form zzso a known positive regulator of zzso zzso of the zzso receptors on the zzso surface and zzso firing are also induced by depletion of zzso Furthermore, use of an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso regulated zzso of control zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso chase experiments have indicated that increases in zzso protein upon zzso depletion is regulated at the zzso zzso These data together establish that zzso is an upstream regulator of zzso in part through its action on the zzso zzso This study provides the first evidence connecting zzso with the zzso regulatory zzso of zzso It establishes that zzso of zzso as occurs in neurodegenerative diseases with zzso zzso zzso zzso would alter its zzso cellular zzso thus leading to impairment of zzso zzso
