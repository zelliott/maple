zzso zzso 7 zzso has been linked to systemic lupus disease zzso in humans and mice, but how zzso zzso zzso is zzso We used a zzso transgenic zzso mouse model to investigate the cellular and molecular events required to induce spontaneous zzso through increased zzso zzso We determined that zzso exerts zzso effects in promoting spontaneous zzso center zzso and zzso zzso development, and that these zzso zzso are dependent on zzso signals through zzso and zzso protein zzso but not zzso zzso specificity also factored into zzso disease, as both a restricted T cell zzso zzso specificity and zzso zzso zzso protected zzso mice from spontaneous zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cell expansion and zzso did not develop in zzso mice, suggesting either that spontaneous zzso zzso does not occur in zzso cells, or, if it does occur, cannot drive these events in the absence of zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso disease in zzso mice is contingent upon B cells receiving stimulation both through innate pathways and zzso signals and suggest a zzso relationship between B cells and T cells in the development of zzso
