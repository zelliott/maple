With the increasing use of radiation as zzso therapy in breast cancer, the effects of gamma radiation on the remaining normal breast are of increasing zzso The complexities of multiple cellular types within breast zzso and the role of the zzso zzso zzso 53 zzso zzso protein with its downstream zzso targets and cellular processes may be central to the effects on residual normal breast zzso 

While a detailed understanding of zzso zzso responses in normal breast zzso remains zzso zzso appears to have a pivotal role in the effects of gamma radiation on normal breast zzso but not zzso cells, which may account for the differing clinical effects of gamma radiation in women treated for breast zzso
