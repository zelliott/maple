An zzso signaling from the zzso zzso zzso to the nucleus, called the unfolded protein response zzso is activated when unfolded proteins are accumulated in the zzso under a variety of stress conditions zzso zzso We and others recently identified zzso as a zzso factor responsible for the zzso in zzso zzso It was further reported that zzso (238 zzso is detected only in zzso cells, and its expression is zzso by unconventional zzso of zzso precursor zzso The zzso replaces the zzso portion of zzso it was proposed that precursor zzso is also translated but the putative product of 230 zzso is rapidly zzso by the zzso zzso We have identified and characterized the same regulated zzso and confirmed its essential zzso zzso to the above proposal, however, we find that the zzso product of mature zzso and the zzso protein tested are highly unstable with little of no difference in zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that the absence of zzso in zzso cells is due to the lack of translation of precursor zzso We conclude that zzso is zzso as the result of zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso of the zzso
