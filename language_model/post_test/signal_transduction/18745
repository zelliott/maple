The search for effective zzso compounds is a major challenge facing research into preventing the progression of cancer zzso The naturally occurring zzso antioxidants look very promising, but their mechanism of action still remains poorly zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso a zzso zzso derived from olive oil, zzso growth arrest and zzso in human colon zzso zzso zzso The mechanisms involve prolonged stress of the zzso zzso zzso leading to the zzso of the two main branches of the unfolded protein response zzso including the zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatment led to zzso of the zzso factor zzso and persistent zzso of the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso modulated the zzso zzso zzso 1/2 and zzso zzso factors by altering their zzso status as well as zzso tumor necrosis zzso nuclear zzso zzso by zzso the zzso of nuclear factor zzso zzso These findings prompted us to investigate the possible involvement of zzso in zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso interference to silence the zzso zzso 2A zzso prevented zzso cell zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso specifically activates zzso which plays a key initiating role in various pathways that lead to zzso in colon cancer zzso
