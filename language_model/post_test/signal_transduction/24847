The function of zzso is required during the development of the zzso wing in processes such as cell proliferation and vein zzso zzso encodes a zzso factor of the zzso family, but unlike other members of this family, zzso lacks the basic region that is involved in interaction with zzso Some zzso caused by zzso in the wing are similar to those observed when zzso zzso is zzso Furthermore, zzso levels of zzso expression in the wing disc are restricted to places where zzso activity is higher, suggesting that zzso could mediate some aspects of zzso zzso during wing zzso We have studied the relationships between zzso and zzso in wing development, with emphasis on the processes of vein formation and cell zzso We observe strong genetic interaction between zzso and different components of the zzso zzso pathway, suggesting a functional relationship between zzso We show that the higher level of zzso expression zzso with the domain of expression of zzso and its downstream gene zzso of zzso The expression of zzso at the zzso boundary and in boundary cells between veins and zzso depends on zzso zzso We propose that at least during vein differentiation and wing margin formation, zzso is regulated by zzso and collaborates with other zzso genes such as zzso of zzso
