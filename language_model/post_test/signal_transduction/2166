zzso zzso zzso are key regulators of the insulin zzso signal zzso zzso We have performed a detailed analysis of zzso expression in the major human insulin target zzso or cells zzso zzso zzso skeletal muscle and zzso zzso To obtain a representative picture, all zzso were analyzed by zzso using three different primer sets corresponding to zzso regions of known zzso A total of 24 different zzso were zzso A zzso zzso protection zzso was developed to obtain a zzso measure of the expression levels of selected zzso Surprisingly, zzso previously suggested to be a major regulator of the insulin zzso zzso zzso was expressed in extremely low levels in skeletal muscle, whereas the related zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in relatively high levels in all four zzso The low levels of zzso zzso zzso in skeletal muscle were further confirmed by Northern zzso zzso
