zzso zzso is as an ideal model system for the study of mechanisms underlying learning and zzso In the present study, we employed zzso zzso zzso system of zzso memory to investigate the possible role of zzso neurotransmitter in memory zzso Our data showed that both zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso required for zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso resulted in deficits in zzso memory zzso zzso treatment with zzso effectively recovered the deficits in zzso memory of zzso and zzso zzso to the level of zzso zzso zzso activity zzso of zzso suggests that zzso might regulate the zzso memory behavior by release from the zzso sensory zzso zzso of zzso sensory zzso by expressing a zzso zzso gene zzso decreased the zzso memory, whereas zzso of zzso zzso by expression of a zzso active protein zzso C zzso zzso increased the zzso memory and rescued the deficits in zzso memory in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso released from the zzso sensory zzso might act through the zzso zzso receptors of zzso and zzso to regulate the zzso memory zzso zzso analysis implies that zzso might further target the insulin signaling zzso to regulate the zzso memory zzso Thus, our results suggest the possible crucial role of zzso and zzso sensory zzso in zzso memory control in zzso zzso
