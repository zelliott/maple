A mechanical stimulus on zzso tissue is critical to zzso outlet obstruction progression and functional zzso tissue zzso A hypothesis is that mechanical stimulus triggers human zzso smooth muscle cell zzso To help better understand this relationship of zzso function to growth at the cellular level we used a novel method of applying zzso zzso pressure that simulates the zzso cycle to cell zzso We detected the proliferation response of human zzso smooth muscle cells zzso zzso to different pressures as well as the signal zzso mechanism of this zzso 

Human zzso smooth muscle cells cultured in scaffolds underwent 4 pressures zzso 100, 200 and 300 zzso zzso for 24 hours, as controlled by a zzso zzso We then used flow zzso to examine cell cycle distribution, and zzso chain reaction and zzso to zzso zzso and zzso expression and zzso in each zzso zzso was silenced in human zzso smooth muscle cells using small interfering zzso to validate the role of zzso in zzso pressure induced cell zzso 

Compared with the 0 zzso zzso control group, human zzso smooth muscle cells in the 200 and 300 zzso zzso groups showed increased cell zzso zzso expression and activity were also increased while zzso another downstream signal of zzso did not change zzso zzso zzso abolished the increases in cell proliferation induced by zzso 

To our knowledge we provide the first report of zzso zzso pressure stimulating the proliferation of human zzso smooth muscle cells cultured in zzso The signal zzso mechanism for this process is involved with the zzso and not the zzso signaling zzso
