Cell invasion and zzso mark the most lethal phase of cancer, but little is known about the key molecular events that initiate this crucial turning zzso Low zzso or zzso is thought to be one trigger for zzso zzso conditions within the tumor mass are thought to activate signaling pathways that stimulate zzso of cancer cells spreading the zzso However, the molecular basis of this process is not well zzso A recent study used zzso zzso border cell migration to model the type of cell migration that occurs in tumors in response to oxygen deprivation through the zzso of the zzso response zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso This model zzso approach revealed a highly sophisticated mechanism of control of cell migration that is regulated by multiple genetic zzso tied to the hypoxic zzso zzso zzso with the components of the zzso zzso factor 1) zzso were able to either inhibit or block the migration of border cells or cause unprecedented acceleration of their zzso The zzso zzso cascade appears to be the major regulator of border cell zzso Based on the similarity of the fly and human zzso zzso this model zzso study might lead to improvements in understanding zzso zzso of human zzso This article discusses new findings in the context of their relevance to cancer zzso and zzso on the potential regulatory mechanisms and future research zzso
