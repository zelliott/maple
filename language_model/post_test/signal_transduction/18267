The opportunistic pathogen zzso zzso uses zzso signals to control the zzso expression of many zzso zzso The las and zzso zzso systems function, respectively, through the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are known to positively regulate the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Recently, we reported that a second type of zzso signal is involved in zzso zzso This signal was identified as zzso and designated the zzso zzso signal zzso zzso was determined to be part of the zzso hierarchy since its production and zzso depended on the las and zzso zzso systems, zzso In order to define the role of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso were used to determine the effect of zzso on the zzso of the zzso system genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso We found that in zzso zzso zzso caused a major induction of zzso and had lesser effects on the zzso of zzso and zzso We also observed that the zzso of both zzso and zzso was zzso zzso by zzso and zzso Additionally, we present data indicating that zzso was not produced zzso until cultures reached the late stationary phase of zzso Taken together, our results imply that zzso acts as a link between the las and zzso zzso systems and that this signal is not involved in sensing cell zzso
