The zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on rat sensory zzso cell line zzso cells were zzso zzso caused a zzso increase in the number of zzso cells and the expression of the substance P precursor zzso zzso in zzso The effects of zzso were zzso by zzso zzso zzso with lower potency and zzso zzso and inhibited by zzso of protein zzso A, zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso In a zzso promoter zzso reporter zzso the increase of zzso zzso was the result of an increase in zzso gene zzso activity by zzso The increasing effects of zzso on zzso zzso were similarly observed in primary cultured rat zzso root zzso zzso Thus, zzso could induce zzso phenomena in sensory zzso in a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results provide evidence of the zzso action of zzso which may function to rescue damaged zzso or to switch the zzso zzso in injured or inflamed sensory zzso
