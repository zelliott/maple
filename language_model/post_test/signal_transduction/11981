Inherent and acquired resistance of cancer cells is increasingly recognized as a significant impediment to effective radiation cancer zzso As important zzso factors, zzso tumor zzso signal zzso zzso which include the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso pathways zzso zzso and zzso have been proved to be crucial zzso of the probability of cell sensitivity to radiation in zzso zzso There is increasing evidence that targeting the abnormal pathways that can regulate the activity of the DNA damage response and further influence the response of tumor cells to radiation may be suitable for improving radiation zzso zzso and clinical evidence suggest that agents targeting zzso tumor signals can effectively improve the therapeutic effect of zzso zzso zzso in this review, we discuss the intricate interplay between tumor responses to radiation with the zzso signal zzso and the potential zzso targets within the pathways to sensitize tumors without significant collateral damage to normal zzso The application of novel targeting compounds to manipulate the zzso signal of tumor cells in clinical treatments is also zzso
