A central question in reverse engineering of genetic networks consists in determining the zzso and regulating relationships among zzso This paper addresses the problem of zzso genetic regulatory networks from zzso zzso zzso By adopting a zzso modeling framework compatible with the family of models represented by dynamic zzso networks and zzso zzso networks, this paper proposes a network zzso zzso to recover not only the direct gene connectivity but also the regulating zzso 

Based on the minimum description length principle, a novel network zzso zzso is proposed that greatly shrinks the search space for zzso solutions and achieves a good zzso between modeling complexity and data zzso zzso results show that the zzso achieves good performance in the case of synthetic zzso Compared with existing state-of-the-art results in the literature, the proposed zzso exceptionally excels in efficiency, zzso zzso and zzso Given a zzso zzso for zzso zzso the paper proposes a genetic regulatory network involved in zzso muscle zzso
