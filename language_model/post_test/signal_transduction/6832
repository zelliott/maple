zzso zzso requires a rapid response in zzso with high energy zzso zzso are rapid sensors for a lack of zzso but no consistent mechanism for the sensing process and the subsequent zzso has been zzso 

In the present hypothesis review, we suggest an zzso mechanism by zzso that is initiated at low oxygen tension by electrons from the respiratory chain, leading to the reduction of zzso zzso to zzso oxide zzso that would subsequently compete with oxygen for binding to zzso c zzso This allows zzso zzso formation in hypoxic areas, leading to zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso cycle zzso With more formation of zzso zzso is generated and known to damage the connection between the zzso zzso and the outer zzso 

A fundamental question on a regulatory mechanism is its zzso zzso of oxygen and opening of the zzso zzso would allow electrons from zzso to selectively reduce the zzso pool to generate zzso at both sides of the inner zzso zzso On the zzso side, zzso is zzso and will support zzso zzso processes and on the zzso zzso side, it could lead to the zzso reduction and zzso of zzso zzso 

It remains to be zzso up to which stage the zzso proposed zzso of zzso remains zzso and when irreversible changes that ultimately lead to classical zzso injury are zzso
