zzso zzso zzso are master regulators of the cell cycle in zzso zzso activity is regulated by the presence, zzso modification and spatial zzso of its regulatory zzso zzso In budding zzso the zzso zzso is zzso and zzso to the nucleus during zzso zzso However the functional significance of zzso zzso and nuclear zzso and their mutual dependency is zzso In this paper, we demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso requires its import to the nucleus but not vice zzso While zzso zzso is dependent on activity of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso its nuclear zzso requires zzso but not zzso zzso zzso we show that increased nuclear zzso of zzso during zzso enhances zzso of zzso zzso Fourteen Early zzso zzso zzso We discuss the significance of our results in relation to regulation of exit from zzso zzso
