zzso is a major innate immune sensor for viral infection, triggering an zzso zzso zzso response upon zzso detection of viral zzso zzso and zzso zzso were identified as motifs required to elicit optimal zzso zzso However, very little is known about the response dynamics of the zzso pathway, which is crucial for the ability of the cell to react to diverse classes of viral zzso while maintaining zzso In the present study, we addressed the molecular mechanism of zzso signal detection and its translation into zzso zzso By employing highly quantitative methods, we could establish the length of the zzso zzso zzso to be the most critical zzso of response zzso zzso exclusion zzso and direct zzso in scanning force zzso suggested that this was due to cooperative zzso of zzso along zzso The initiation efficiency of this zzso process critically depended on the presence of high affinity zzso like a zzso It is noteworthy that for zzso longer than 200 zzso internal initiation could effectively compensate for a lack of terminal zzso In zzso our data demonstrate a very flexible response behavior of the zzso pathway, in which sensing and integration of at least two distinct signals, initiation efficiency and double strand zzso allow the host cell to mount an zzso response that is tightly adjusted to the type of the detected zzso such as viral zzso replication zzso or small zzso
