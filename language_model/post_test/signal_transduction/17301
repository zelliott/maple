The mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso improves zzso metabolism in essential hypertension are not completely zzso Because dysfunctional insulin signaling is associated with elevated inflammation and high cholesterol and zzso we investigated the effects of HO on the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso in spontaneously zzso rats zzso zzso are a model of human essential hypertension with features of zzso syndrome, including impaired zzso zzso 

zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso were zzso HO was enhanced with zzso or inhibited with zzso zzso 

zzso suppressed inflammation by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso such as zzso zzso protein 1 zzso and zzso inflammatory protein 1 alpha zzso while enhancing zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso Similarly, zzso improved insulin signaling by enhancing insulin zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso and zzso zzso 4 zzso but reduced total cholesterol and zzso These effects were accompanied by increased zzso HO activity, and zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the HO inhibitor zzso nullified the zzso zzso zzso the effects of the HO system on zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso are zzso 

zzso abated inflammation in zzso by selectively enhancing the zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso inflammation while suppressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso and related zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso the reduction of zzso total cholesterol, and zzso was accompanied by the enhancement of important proteins implicated in insulin zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thus, the zzso reduction of zzso total cholesterol and zzso and the corresponding zzso of insulin signaling are among the multifaceted mechanisms by which the HO system improves zzso metabolism in essential zzso
