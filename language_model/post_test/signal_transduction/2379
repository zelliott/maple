The zzso zzso is the principal mechanism for the turnover of short-lived proteins in zzso zzso In this pathway, the zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso is a signal for recognition by the zzso zzso Recent studies indicate that targeting of zzso of the zzso zzso to the zzso is usually accomplished by the zzso of a zzso chain assembled through zzso zzso bonds, rather than by zzso of zzso In addition to providing benefits in signal generation, recognition, and zzso assigning the zzso targeting function to a specific specific type of zzso chain may allow zzso or zzso chains of novel structures to serve distinct targeting zzso Besides zzso zzso the zzso also degrades an unknown number of proteins that are recognized without undergoing zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso zzso it is targeted to the zzso through zzso interaction with a specific protein factor known as zzso The existence of zzso zzso of the zzso raises important questions about the nature of the zzso and zzso elements that cooperate to bring about the targeting of zzso to this novel zzso zzso
