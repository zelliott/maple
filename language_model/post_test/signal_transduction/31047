The zzso zzso zzso zzso family belongs to the zzso zzso and consists of nine mapped zzso Here we report that zzso and zzso constitute novel paired zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso genes are zzso in close vicinity on zzso zzso zzso has been reported to possess zzso zzso zzso motifs in its zzso region and to inhibit the differentiation of zzso zzso has an zzso domain that is highly zzso with that of zzso in its zzso domain, and possesses a zzso charged zzso in its zzso zzso zzso like zzso is expressed in zzso cells, such as zzso cells, zzso and zzso We also show that zzso interacts with zzso to be expressed on the plasma membrane and that the zzso of zzso leads to zzso zzso of zzso including zzso in the zzso cell zzso Taken together, these characteristics suggest that zzso and zzso constitute novel zzso and that zzso may zzso zzso signals as the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
