Advances in innate immunity over the past decade have revealed distinct classes of pattern recognition receptors zzso that detect pathogens at the cell surface and in zzso zzso This has shed light on how zzso which are large zzso DNA viruses that replicate in the nucleus, are initially recognized during cellular zzso Surprisingly, this involves multiple zzso both on the cell surface and within zzso and the zzso In this article we describe recent advances in our understanding of innate detection of zzso how this innate detection translates into zzso host zzso and how the viruses seek to evade this innate detection to establish persistent zzso
