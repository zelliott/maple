We investigated the role of zzso proteins in the nerve growth factor zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso When rat zzso or zzso zzso proteins were zzso zzso zzso treatment zzso zzso for 3 zzso caused three- and fivefold increases in zzso and zzso activities, zzso Increased zzso of both zzso zzso proteins could be achieved by zzso of a zzso active zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso which is known to cause differentiation of zzso cells even in the absence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso site were not activated by either zzso or zzso zzso of zzso active zzso or zzso in zzso cells resulted in highly active proteins whose levels of activity did not change either with zzso treatment or after zzso with zzso zzso expression had no zzso effect on the zzso However, expression of zzso led to differentiation of zzso cells even in the absence of zzso as evidenced by zzso zzso zzso was not observed with a zzso zzso that was zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not lead to zzso of the zzso zzso pathway, indicating that zzso is sufficient to induce zzso outgrowth and is the only target of zzso required for this zzso zzso our data demonstrate a key role for zzso in the differentiation process of zzso zzso
