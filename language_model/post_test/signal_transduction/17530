Although T cell tolerance to self zzso is primarily a reflection of zzso deletion in the zzso recent evidence suggests that mature T cells are subject to negative regulation in the zzso zzso zzso tolerance is the result of zzso zzso in some studies and T cell deletion in zzso The factors controlling the induction of zzso versus deletion of mature T cells are still poorly zzso This article summarizes evidence that exposure of T cells to zzso zzso in zzso leads to a sequence of T cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso appears to reflect persistence of zzso The zzso consequences of exposing T cells to zzso in zzso are zzso
