We investigated the effect of zzso zzso on the interaction of zzso growth factor zzso with its zzso in cultured zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso with zzso but not zzso inhibited the binding of zzso zzso The zzso demonstrated by zzso resulted from a decrease in the affinity of zzso receptors for its zzso with no change in the number of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso for 30 zzso zzso the zzso zzso On the other hand, prolonged zzso with zzso which leads to disappearance of protein zzso C activity, reversed the zzso In addition, zzso with the protein zzso C inhibitor zzso zzso prevented the zzso zzso zzso triggered an increase in zzso zzso levels and zzso of protein zzso C from zzso to zzso consist with the stimulation of zzso C and the zzso of protein zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso the zzso binding affinity of zzso zzso via the stimulation of zzso C, leading to the zzso of protein zzso C in the zzso zzso
