Toll receptors in insects, zzso and plants are key players that sense the invasion of zzso zzso receptors zzso in zzso have been established to detect specific components of bacterial and zzso zzso Furthermore, recent evidence indicates that zzso are involved in the recognition of viral zzso zzso pathways via zzso originate from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso acts as a common zzso that zzso inflammatory zzso however, there exists a zzso zzso that zzso type I zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Another zzso zzso zzso zzso has recently been shown to mediate the zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, individual zzso may have their own zzso systems that characterize their specific zzso
