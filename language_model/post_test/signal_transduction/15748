Studies of the 1918 zzso influenza pandemic, the H5N1 avian influenza outbreak, and the 2009 zzso pandemic illustrate that sex and pregnancy contribute to severe outcome from infection, suggesting a role for sex zzso To test the hypothesis that the sexes respond differently to zzso the zzso of influenza A virus infection was investigated in adult male and female zzso zzso zzso infection reduced zzso function in females and resulted in greater body mass loss, hypothermia, and mortality in females than zzso Whereas lung virus zzso were similar between the zzso females had higher induction of zzso zzso and zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso in their lungs than zzso zzso of the zzso in both sexes eliminated the sex difference in influenza zzso zzso of testosterone or zzso zzso in males did not significantly impact virus zzso zzso females administered high doses of zzso had a zzso lower induction of zzso and zzso in the lungs and increased rates of survival as compared with females that had either low or no zzso The protective effects of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso and mortality were primarily zzso by signaling through zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso females suffer a worse outcome from influenza A virus infection than zzso which can be reversed by administration of high doses of zzso to females and reflects differences in the induction of zzso responses and not in virus zzso
