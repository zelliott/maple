zzso oxide zzso locally regulates vascular resistance and blood pressure by modulating blood vessel zzso zzso signaling via its zzso zzso locally limits the ability of NO to relax vascular smooth muscle cells and increase regional blood flow in zzso zzso To determine whether zzso plays a broader role in central cardiovascular zzso we examined zzso stress responses in mice lacking zzso or zzso Mice lacking zzso exhibit zzso increases in heart rate, central zzso and mean zzso blood pressure and a constant decrease in pulse zzso zzso mice have normal central pulse pressure but elevated resting peripheral blood zzso Both zzso mice show exaggerated decreases in peripheral blood pressure and increased cardiac output and ejection fraction in response to zzso zzso blockade also zzso exaggerated zzso responses in awake zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso mice exhibit a greater zzso response to zzso and zzso zzso under zzso zzso leads to premature death of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso response to zzso is attenuated in zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso protein zzso and its zzso zzso serve as acute zzso regulators of blood pressure and exert a zzso activity to maintain global zzso under zzso
