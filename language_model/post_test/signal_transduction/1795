The zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso factor zzso share the ability to induce such processes as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity and zzso are both essential for development and implicated in tumor zzso Upon zzso by products of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso downstream targets that stimulate growth and inhibit zzso Previous reports suggest that zzso may achieve its effects on zzso and zzso metabolism by stimulating zzso zzso We report here that, whereas serum stimulation can induce a slight zzso of zzso alpha protein in a zzso zzso fashion, zzso zzso much higher levels of zzso alpha protein and zzso DNA binding activity independently of zzso and zzso zzso In addition, we find the effects of zzso active zzso on zzso activity are zzso zzso High levels of zzso signaling can modestly increase zzso alpha zzso but this increase does not affect zzso target gene zzso zzso the zzso zzso is not necessary for hypoxic induction of zzso zzso or activity, and zzso active zzso is not itself sufficient to induce zzso zzso
