In normal zzso zzso factors regulate the growth of zzso zzso However, zzso cells in zzso zzso display increased proliferation and decreased zzso This work tested the hypothesis that in zzso zzso cells lose the ability to regulate survival signaling and cell growth in zzso zzso zzso normal, zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells were cultured in the presence of medium zzso by normal, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells showed higher zzso expression than normal zzso zzso zzso medium zzso from normal or zzso zzso zzso cells significantly inhibited the zzso expression and zzso zzso in normal or zzso zzso zzso zzso However, CM from zzso zzso zzso cells did not have an zzso effect on normal or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso expression in normal or zzso zzso zzso cells in the presence of zzso factors from normal or zzso zzso zzso cells was enhanced by zzso whereas zzso had little effect in the presence of zzso factors from zzso zzso zzso zzso The inability of zzso zzso zzso cells to regulated zzso signaling and mediate the zzso response in zzso zzso cells may facilitate zzso cell proliferation in zzso and promote the survival of zzso zzso
