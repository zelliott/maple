zzso growth factor beta zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso play major roles in the development of vascular zzso It has been documented that zzso gamma zzso zzso the zzso beta signal zzso in vascular smooth muscle cells zzso Here we examined whether zzso beta can regulate zzso gamma zzso Northern zzso analyses revealed that both zzso beta 1 and 2 exert a zzso effect zzso stimulation and late zzso on zzso gamma gene expression in zzso zzso beta rapidly and zzso induced early zzso zzso zzso expression through the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso not only zzso the induction of zzso but also abolished the rapid and transient induction of zzso gamma by zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso a zzso of zzso zzso also blocked the induction of zzso gamma by zzso beta in zzso suggesting that zzso mediates the rapid and transient induction of zzso gamma by zzso zzso With regard to the zzso beta repression of zzso gamma zzso zzso protein 1 zzso and zzso dramatically inhibited the zzso gamma promoter activity in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of a zzso form of zzso partially rescued the zzso zzso zzso gamma repression in zzso Taken together, our data demonstrate that zzso zzso and zzso are part components of the zzso beta signal zzso zzso that regulates zzso gamma zzso
