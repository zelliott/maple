The speed of cell migration on zzso zzso surfaces is determined by the rate of assembly and zzso of clustered zzso receptors known as focal zzso Different modes of cell migration that have been described in zzso environments are distinguished by their dependence on zzso interactions with the zzso zzso In particular, the zzso invasion mode is the most dependent on focal zzso zzso The focal zzso protein zzso is a key zzso zzso in zzso cell migration, however whether zzso plays a role in regulating focal zzso dynamics has not previously been zzso As zzso effects on zzso migration speed appear to depend on the cell type zzso in the present study we have used mouse zzso zzso zzso from mice in which the zzso gene has been depleted zzso zzso zzso This allows comparison with effects of other focal zzso proteins that have previously been demonstrated using zzso We show that focal zzso zzso rates are increased in the absence of zzso expression and this is correlated with increased zzso zzso at focal zzso zzso zzso have increased rates of migration on zzso surfaces, but conversely, migration of these cells is significantly reduced in zzso collagen zzso zzso we show that zzso light chain zzso is activated in zzso in the absence of zzso and is zzso inhibited in zzso zzso zzso of zzso strength reveals that zzso zzso have decreased zzso to zzso despite zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso zzso is significantly suppressed in the zzso suggesting that in the absence of zzso there is decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso may promote zzso cell migration by slowing focal zzso zzso promoting zzso zzso zzso and increasing zzso force to the zzso
