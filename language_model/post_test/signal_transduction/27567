The effects of growth factors have been shown to depend on the position of a cell in the cell zzso However, the zzso basis for this phenomenon remains zzso Here we show that the majority of both zzso zzso zzso and human embryonic kidney zzso cells, when arrested in a zzso phase zzso responded to zzso growth factor zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the same type of zzso response was also observed in zzso zzso cells (and to a lesser extent in zzso zzso zzso blocked at the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso cells synchronized in early zzso or released from zzso arrest responded in an zzso zzso This cell zzso zzso of zzso signaling was not observed on zzso growth factor and zzso zzso stimulation and was not due to differences in the expression of zzso receptors zzso during the cell zzso We demonstrate that zzso of zzso which converts zzso to zzso caused zzso as well as zzso synchronized cells to restore the zzso zzso response to zzso In addition, we show that the synthesis of zzso and zzso is regulated by the cell cycle and may zzso the differences in zzso signaling after zzso zzso
