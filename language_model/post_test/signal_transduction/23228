zzso protein zzso zzso signaling is reported to protect zzso under zzso zzso however, its effect on zzso zzso remains to be zzso We investigated whether zzso signaling protects zzso to restore central nervous system zzso functions in an experimental zzso zzso zzso a zzso model of multiple zzso Increased inflammation and zzso in the zzso and peripheral immune responses were consistent with the observed clinical zzso in zzso animals, which were attenuated by treatment with zzso compared with zzso In addition, expressions of zzso factors and of signatory genes of OL lineages were increased in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Likewise, zzso attenuated inflammatory response and enhanced expressions of zzso factors, thereby protecting zzso via zzso zzso in mixed zzso cultures zzso with zzso zzso zzso as evidenced by analysis of the expression of signatory genes of zzso zzso and their cellular zzso zzso also attenuated zzso stress and zzso protein levels, with corresponding induction of zzso defenses in zzso exposed to zzso via zzso zzso These effects of zzso were evident in the zzso of zzso zzso These data provide evidence that zzso signaling is crucial to protect zzso and, thus, zzso functions in zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso including zzso have the potential to limit zzso deficits in multiple sclerosis and related neurodegenerative zzso
