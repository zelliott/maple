The zzso organizer stands out from other signaling centers of the zzso because of its broad patterning zzso It defines development along the zzso and zzso axes of the zzso body, mainly by zzso zzso of growth zzso zzso models proposed more than a decade ago explain the organizer's zzso zzso zzso head and zzso as the result of different combinations of zzso For example, head induction is zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, little is known about how the levels of these zzso become zzso with those of their targets and with the factors initially responsible for germ layers and organizer formation, including zzso zzso Here we show that key ingredients of the zzso development, namely zzso zzso zzso antagonists, and zzso zzso zzso adjust each other's strength and range of activity by a zzso network of zzso feedback and zzso zzso A key element in this zzso is the limited availability of zzso for which zzso and zzso must zzso By zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso for zzso zzso The system zzso because zzso signaling in turn zzso the expression of the zzso antagonists, zzso the zzso In sum, this work reveals an unprecedented set of interactions operating within the organizer that is critical for embryonic zzso
