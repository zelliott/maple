zzso represents a well organized and tightly regulated cellular process in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso and/or certain differentiated cells zzso specific properties acquired during previous steps of maturation to restore again a younger zzso zzso of the zzso and cellular mechanisms including zzso zzso or zzso can contribute to zzso during a dynamic cellular development in contrast to terminally differentiated cells like zzso organisms, which appear unable to zzso and to zzso The process of zzso is observed in distinct cell populations and includes a coordinated zzso network of zzso zzso with zzso signaling and zzso communication to relay zzso zzso This provides a certain tissue zzso by a zzso potential and renewal upon zzso repair requirements in addition to residual stem cells, which can vary among different zzso and species to extend their life zzso However, zzso within a zzso program may also include the risk of zzso growth during such a retrograde zzso In contrast to zzso in certain cell types, a life span extension - also termed longevity - does not represent a retrograde development but an overall prolonged function of zzso zzso and/or whole zzso Thus, zzso of a distinct cell population could contribute to longevity of the corresponding zzso but may not necessarily be required since longevity could also be achieved mechanistically by zzso of the zzso signaling zzso or by sufficient supply of zzso zzso compounds, zzso by zzso zzso genetically by the induction of longevity genes or environmentally by the zzso of zzso
