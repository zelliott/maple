The small zzso of zzso a zzso zzso zzso was found to interact with the zzso domain of the common zzso zzso gamma chain zzso in a zzso zzso interaction trap zzso This interaction was functional as demonstrated by the ability of zzso to cleave in zzso zzso zzso but not zzso containing a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequence in its zzso domain, as well as by the ability of zzso zzso to mediate zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso In T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso of zzso Moreover, in single positive zzso zzso not only did a zzso inhibitor augment zzso zzso but zzso to zzso blocked this zzso Finally, treatment of cells with zzso could inhibit zzso zzso zzso protein zzso but this zzso could be reversed by zzso zzso Together, these data suggest that zzso zzso of zzso represents a mechanism by which zzso signaling can be zzso
