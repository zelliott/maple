zzso zzso have been shown to contribute to the process of transplant zzso by binding to zzso class I molecules expressed by the zzso and smooth muscle cells of the graft and zzso zzso signals that elicit cell zzso The aim of this study was to determine the role of zzso target of zzso zzso in zzso class zzso zzso cell proliferation and to explore in depth the relationship between zzso complexes and their downstream targets following zzso of zzso class I molecules by zzso zzso We used small interfering zzso technology to abrogate zzso zzso companion of zzso zzso or regulatory associated protein of zzso zzso to study the function of these gene products to activate proteins involved in zzso class zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso of zzso inhibited class zzso zzso of proteins downstream of zzso complex 1 and zzso complex zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso or zzso blocked zzso class zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso significantly blocked both zzso and zzso complex zzso Interestingly, zzso also blocked class zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso zzso These results support the role of zzso zzso in the process of transplant zzso and suggest that exposure of the graft zzso to zzso zzso may promote proliferation through the zzso zzso
