zzso zzso is regulated by a finely tuned network of zzso regulatory mechanisms that guarantees proper surveillance avoiding zzso that would lead to zzso and inflammatory zzso zzso responses involve the zzso of zzso that contain zzso zzso motifs zzso One arm of control involves zzso zzso zzso motif zzso zzso which upon zzso initiate an zzso signal through recruitment of zzso zzso Recently, a new zzso function has been ascribed to zzso which represent in fact dual function zzso that, under specific zzso termed zzso zzso zzso can zzso zzso zzso One paradigm is the zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso which, upon interaction with zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso a powerful zzso signal involving zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso 1 zzso recruitment that suppresses cell zzso launched by a whole variety of zzso receptors without zzso This explains the long known function of zzso as an zzso zzso The importance of this control mechanism in immune zzso is zzso by the high zzso of zzso and allergic diseases in zzso zzso zzso is now described for an increasing number of zzso with multiple roles in zzso zzso signaling is also exploited by zzso coli to achieve immune evasion during zzso Here, we review our current understanding of zzso regulatory mechanisms in immune responses and discuss its role in immune zzso
