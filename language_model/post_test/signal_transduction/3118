zzso zzso is a potent zzso zzso that is associated with zzso a major component of chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso zzso signaling via the zzso zzso is coupled to multiple signaling zzso especially the zzso zzso factor signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso However, the pathological role of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso is ill zzso To zzso the role of the zzso signaling axis in the cellular and molecular zzso of zzso we employed a genetic zzso strategy using zzso zzso mice displaying zzso of zzso zzso that were zzso with mice to impede zzso zzso zzso human lung tissue from patients with COPD and zzso individuals was also evaluated by zzso zzso reduction of zzso zzso in zzso mice prevented lung inflammation and excessive zzso zzso however, zzso still zzso In support of these findings, zzso zzso levels in human lung tissue correlated with the extent of pulmonary inflammation but not zzso obstruction in zzso Furthermore, COPD lung tissue displayed increased levels of zzso and zzso zzso cells, supporting our previous observation that increased zzso zzso expression in the lungs of zzso mice contributes to zzso by promoting zzso cell zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso promotes zzso via zzso of zzso zzso whereas zzso induction of lung inflammation occurs via zzso We propose that while discrete targeting of zzso may alleviate pulmonary zzso global targeting of zzso potentially represents a zzso advantageous approach to combat COPD zzso where zzso zzso
