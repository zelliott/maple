zzso zzso undergo constant growth and differentiation during embryonic development and to replace damaged tissue in adult zzso These processes are governed by different signaling pathways that ultimately control the expression of genes associated with cell zzso zzso and zzso One essential zzso is zzso which controls zzso in several zzso zzso Recently, zzso has been closely linked to other signaling zzso such as zzso that orchestrate proliferation and zzso to control organ zzso There is evidence that zzso cell junctions may zzso the zzso factors that act downstream of these signaling zzso which would represent an important aspect of their functional regulation and their influence on cell zzso Here, we review the zzso control exerted by the zzso and zzso signaling pathways during zzso growth, zzso and differentiation and recent advances in understanding of the regulation and zzso of these pathways in zzso zzso
