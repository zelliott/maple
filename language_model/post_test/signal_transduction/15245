zzso survival of oxygen deprivation by animals with well-developed zzso tolerance depends on multiple zzso adaptations including strong zzso rate zzso We investigated whether the zzso protein zzso zzso could play a regulatory role in the suppression of protein synthesis that occurs when zzso experience zzso zzso zzso activity and the zzso state of zzso translation factors were measured in liver, heart, red muscle and white muscle of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso subjected to 20 h of zzso zzso zzso activity increased twofold in white muscle of zzso zzso compared with zzso controls but remained unchanged in liver and red muscle, whereas in heart zzso activity decreased by zzso zzso with zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso site increased zzso and zzso in red and white muscles from zzso animals, respectively, but was unchanged in liver and zzso The zzso state of the zzso zzso site of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was reduced under zzso in red muscle and heart but was unaffected in liver and white zzso Exposure to zzso decreased zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in heart and promoted zzso initiation factor zzso zzso zzso zzso in red muscle, but surprisingly increased zzso zzso in white zzso The changes in zzso state of translation factors suggest that zzso patterns of zzso and response are involved in achieving the zzso suppression of protein synthesis in zzso
