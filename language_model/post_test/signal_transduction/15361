zzso to the initial recruitment of zzso zzso are recruited to the lung after an zzso zzso Previously the authors have shown that zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased pulmonary zzso recruitment in mice exposed to zzso zzso As the signaling pathways regulating the influx of zzso cells to the lung are poorly zzso the authors undertook the present study to examine the roles of zzso and zzso In a model of zzso lung zzso systemic zzso of zzso but not zzso decreased the recruitment of zzso cells to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso were decreased in the setting of zzso zzso with zzso pulmonary zzso cell recruitment in zzso mice similar to that found with zzso zzso The decrease in zzso zzso levels in the lung seen with zzso zzso however, was independent of zzso zzso as systemic depletion of zzso had no effect on pulmonary zzso levels after zzso zzso In sum, these results suggest that zzso but not zzso regulates zzso zzso cell recruitment to the zzso that this occurs through a zzso pathway, and that zzso pulmonary zzso expression is dependent on zzso but independent of pulmonary zzso zzso
