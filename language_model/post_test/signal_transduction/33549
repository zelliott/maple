zzso involves the commitment of zzso precursors to zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and subsequent fusion of zzso to form zzso mature zzso Despite many studies on zzso zzso little is known about the signaling mechanisms that specifically mediate the zzso zzso In this study, we found that zzso of zzso at the zzso stage provoked zzso of zzso cells to zzso zzso The conversion to zzso cells occurred with zzso return to the state with higher expression of zzso zzso and greater activity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso stage reduced zzso and zzso levels, and addition of active zzso partially rescued the effect of zzso zzso In addition, the level of zzso was decreased by zzso of zzso by zzso and by zzso zzso of zzso which both caused the zzso of zzso to zzso These data suggest that zzso activity is specifically required for maintaining the committed status during zzso and that the zzso zzso is the key element in that specific role of zzso
