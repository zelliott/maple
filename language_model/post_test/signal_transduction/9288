zzso protein zzso binds a number of zzso proteins and influences various signaling zzso Here we show that zzso directly binds and activates the zzso protein of Ras zzso which is responsible for the zzso of zzso The first and the third zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso sequence of zzso contribute most to the complex formation causing direct molecular interaction between the two zzso Cell zzso to the zzso is obligatory for the zzso and zzso association, as cell detachment makes zzso incapable of zzso with zzso This leads to the complex zzso decrease of zzso activity and the increase of zzso level in the detached zzso Our findings reveal unexpected feature of zzso protein zzso as the regulator of zzso zzso
