The fragile zzso zzso zzso gene is a frequent target of deletions in lung zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso gene transfer into lung cancer cells lacking zzso expression results in induction of zzso However, the effect of zzso expression on zzso induced by zzso agents and its zzso mechanism is poorly zzso This study was undertaken to zzso the effect of zzso expression and the role of zzso signaling in zzso zzso in lung cancer zzso zzso lung cancer cells, which lack zzso zzso were zzso zzso with zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso We investigated effects of zzso on zzso zzso of zzso system and expression of zzso zzso We next evaluated whether these effects were reversed by blocking zzso expression using zzso zzso enhanced zzso in zzso cells compared to that in control zzso cells, and this enhancement was suppressed by zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso but not of zzso were higher in zzso cells than in control zzso cells, and this was reduced by zzso zzso When zzso zzso was blocked by a zzso inhibitor in zzso cells, zzso zzso cell death was decreased similar to that in control zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressions were zzso after zzso treatment in zzso cells, whereas zzso and Bad expressions were zzso These were reversed by zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso enhanced by zzso expression in lung cancer cells might be associated with zzso of zzso zzso
