Recent data suggest that the zzso zzso protein zzso is a critical regulator of zzso zzso pathways during zzso zzso zzso Multiple zzso modifications of zzso regulate interaction with downstream protein partners, thus the regulation of zzso zzso is an important point of control for zzso zzso As zzso zzso plays a central role in the development and progression of breast cancer, we have investigated zzso zzso regulation in zzso zzso zzso zzso breast cancer cells in response to zzso We find that levels of the zzso zzso zzso are significantly increased after zzso of zzso exposure, and this is suppressed by the zzso zzso Analysis of protein zzso zzso following treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor zzso indicates that increased zzso levels are due to a slower rate of protein zzso Moreover, zzso expression of zzso failed to induce spreading in the presence of zzso and this was reversed by tamoxifen zzso Finally, we show that the zzso zzso zzso appears to predominate in zzso versus zzso breast cancer cell zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso may suppress zzso functions of zzso
