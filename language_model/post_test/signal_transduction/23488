The liver performs a large number of essential synthetic and regulatory functions that are acquired during fetal development and persist throughout zzso Their disruption zzso a diverse group of zzso and acquired diseases that affect both pediatric and adult zzso Although experimental analyses used to study liver development and disease are typically performed in cell culture models or zzso the zzso is increasingly used to complement discoveries made in these zzso Forward and reverse genetic analyses over the past two decades have shown that the molecular program for liver development is largely zzso between zzso and zzso and that the zzso can be used to model zzso human liver zzso Recent work has demonstrated that zzso can also be used to study the zzso basis of acquired liver zzso Here, we provide a comprehensive summary of how the zzso has contributed to our understanding of human liver development and zzso
