zzso resistance in peripheral zzso is the primary cause responsible for onset of type II diabetes zzso Recently, the genetic and zzso dissection of zzso zzso pathways zzso the zzso and zzso effects of insulin has contributed to the understanding of the molecular causes of this insulin zzso In particular, important efforts have been developed to comprehend the role of negative regulators of insulin zzso since they might represent future zzso targets to reduce insulin resistance in peripheral zzso zzso we will briefly review major zzso zzso pathways activated by insulin and how they are zzso regulated by distinct zzso In particular, the role of zzso and zzso two zzso zzso recently implicated as negative zzso of insulin zzso is in zzso Current knowledge on the role of zzso and zzso in insulin resistance, type II diabetes and related disorders will also be zzso
