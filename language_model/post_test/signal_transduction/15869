Three zzso copper complexes of organic claw zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso and characterized by zzso zzso infrared zzso zzso zzso X-ray zzso analysis, zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Their zzso effects against human protein zzso zzso zzso zzso T cell protein zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso are evaluated in zzso The three copper complexes exhibit potent and almost same zzso against zzso and zzso with zzso values ranging from zzso to zzso about zzso stronger zzso than against zzso zzso stronger zzso than against zzso but almost no zzso against zzso zzso analysis indicates that they are zzso competitive zzso of zzso zzso zzso analyses confirm the zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso studies suggest that the complexes bond to zzso with the formation of a zzso zzso The results demonstrate that copper complexes that are potent zzso zzso but have different zzso effects over different zzso may be explored as new practical zzso towards individual zzso with some zzso
