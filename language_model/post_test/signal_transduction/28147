Multiple myeloma zzso is an incurable form of cancer characterized by zzso of zzso plasma cells in the bone zzso During the course of this disease, tumor cells cross zzso barriers and home to the bone zzso In latter zzso myeloma cells zzso through blood vessels and may seed a variety of zzso zzso growth factor I zzso is one of several growth factors shown to promote the growth of zzso zzso In the current study, we have assessed the ability of zzso to serve additionally as a zzso factor affecting the mobility and invasive properties of these zzso zzso indicate that zzso promotes zzso through vascular zzso cells and bone zzso zzso cell zzso Analysis of zzso signaling pathways revealed that protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were both activated in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso migration, whereas zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso had no zzso These results suggest that zzso promotes myeloma cell migration by zzso of zzso and zzso pathways independent of zzso The identification of zzso as both a zzso and migratory factor provides a rational basis for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies directed at zzso in the treatment of zzso
