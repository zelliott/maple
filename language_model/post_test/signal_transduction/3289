zzso zzso zzso zzso primarily zzso by transforming growth factor zzso is essential in the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to zzso gene expression and zzso in various zzso However, the implications of zzso in terms of zzso expression and zzso zzso remain zzso In this study, we examined the effects of zzso acid zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso on the zzso expression of zzso in a human zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso in the presence or absence of zzso We zzso the expression and stability of zzso zzso and zzso zzso promoter activity, the zzso of zzso zzso the zzso interactions of zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the expression of the zzso protein zzso The results indicate that zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso and attenuated zzso promoter activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso but not zzso zzso Furthermore, the association of zzso with zzso but not with zzso was disrupted by zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso and thereby zzso zzso zzso and decreased zzso protein zzso These findings suggest that the zzso of zzso activity by zzso may zzso zzso expression through the zzso of cellular signaling at multiple zzso Given the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso should be tested further in animal models as potential therapeutic agents for zzso zzso
