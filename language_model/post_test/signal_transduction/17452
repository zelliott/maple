zzso protein zzso is emerging as a key process for maintaining cell zzso and the zzso that participate in this process, in particular zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are increasingly being regarded as candidates for drug zzso Human zzso are a group of approximately 100 zzso whose cellular functions and regulatory mechanisms remain, with some exceptions, poorly zzso One of the zzso human zzso is zzso zzso 1 zzso which plays an important role in the cellular response to DNA zzso zzso levels, zzso and activity are modulated through several mechanisms, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso ensuring that zzso function is carried out in a properly regulated zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is zzso in certain types of human cancer, suggesting that zzso could represent a valid target in cancer zzso This view has gained recent support with the finding that zzso zzso may contribute to zzso zzso resistance in an in zzso model of zzso cell lung cancer zzso Here, we describe the current knowledge on the cellular functions and regulatory mechanisms of zzso We also zzso zzso zzso found in cancer, combining data from the literature and public databases with our own zzso Finally, we discuss the emerging potential of zzso as a target, zzso published data with our novel findings on the effects of the zzso inhibitor zzso in combination with zzso in zzso zzso
