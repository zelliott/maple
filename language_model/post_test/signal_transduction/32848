zzso 12 zzso T helper 1 zzso development requires zzso zzso However, zzso zzso cells can produce zzso gamma zzso independently of zzso and zzso zzso Thus, in differentiated zzso cells, factors regulated by zzso and zzso may be involved in zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we identified zzso an zzso zzso factor, to be a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso occurred in zzso and zzso but not zzso T cells, suggesting zzso is zzso zzso expression of zzso did not restore zzso production in zzso T cells, but zzso zzso expression in zzso T zzso zzso factors frequently regulate zzso via cooperative interactions with other zzso factors, and zzso has been reported to cooperate with zzso However, in the absence of other zzso factors, zzso zzso expression of an zzso reporter by only zzso Thus, determining the requirement for zzso in zzso development likely will require gene zzso
