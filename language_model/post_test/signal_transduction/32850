zzso continues to be a major problem limiting the effectiveness of zzso zzso To date, the roles of zzso G proteins in the triggering of pathological vascular smooth muscle zzso cell proliferation have not been zzso zzso zzso of zzso G proteins zzso are known to activate zzso protein zzso zzso after stimulation of certain G zzso zzso however, their relevance in zzso zzso in zzso or in zzso is not zzso Using zzso transfer of a zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor of zzso signaling zzso we evaluated the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and proliferation in response to several zzso including serum, in cultured rat zzso zzso Our results include the striking finding that zzso proliferation of zzso cells in zzso is zzso largely via zzso Furthermore, we studied the effects of in zzso zzso zzso gene transfer on zzso zzso zzso in a rat carotid artery zzso zzso Our in zzso results demonstrated that the presence of the zzso in injured rat carotid arteries significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso by zzso Thus, zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso zzso and targeted zzso zzso represents a novel approach for the treatment of pathological conditions such as zzso
