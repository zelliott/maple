zzso zzso a zzso living in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso is covered with zzso zzso zzso These bacteria were demonstrated to be sensory zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso moved toward a source of sodium zzso a presumed food zzso when its bacteria were zzso If the bacteria were removed by zzso zzso treatment, zzso zzso was unable to orient efficiently in a sodium zzso zzso The mechanism of this interaction was not zzso This is the first case documented of a sensory zzso involving a surface layer of zzso However, it may not be an exceptional case given the large numbers of organisms with surfaces covered with zzso The zzso for zzso used in this research may be applied in other cases in which zzso organisms are covered with zzso
