The zzso derived zzso regulators zzso and zzso control the expression of genes involved in zzso of aromatic zzso zzso to zzso zzso groups of aromatic zzso controls the activities of these zzso zzso Previous work has derived a common zzso model for these two regulators in which zzso binding by the zzso 210 zzso (the zzso of the protein zzso repression of an intrinsic zzso activity essential for its zzso property and allows productive interaction with the zzso zzso Here we dissect the zzso of zzso and zzso by DNA zzso to identify the zzso that mediates the differences in the zzso specificity zzso Analysis of in zzso zzso in response to multiple aromatic zzso and the in zzso zzso abilities of regulator derivatives with hybrid zzso zzso reveals that zzso 110 to 186 are key zzso that distinguish the zzso profiles of zzso and zzso Moreover, the properties of some mosaic zzso derivatives reveal that zzso aromatic zzso binding can be completely zzso from the ability to promote zzso zzso novel aromatic binding properties will only be translated into functional zzso zzso if zzso binding also triggers release of zzso zzso
