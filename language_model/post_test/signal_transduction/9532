zzso is a zzso zzso that has zzso therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of zzso skin zzso and certain zzso skin zzso To test our hypothesis that zzso enhances DNA repair as a mechanism for its zzso activity, the zzso zzso repair genes were studied in bone zzso zzso zzso enhanced the expression of zzso zzso zzso A and other DNA repair genes zzso real-time zzso zzso and resulted in an increased nuclear zzso of the DNA repair zzso zzso This was dependent on zzso as bone zzso cells from zzso mice did not increase zzso gene expression and did not enhance the survival of zzso bone zzso cells after zzso B exposure as was observed in bone zzso cells from zzso zzso zzso also enhanced DNA repair of zzso light zzso gene expression zzso and accelerated the resolution of zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso in zzso and zzso Lastly, topical treatment of mouse skin with zzso zzso cream prior to zzso zzso resulted in a decrease in the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso that were found in local zzso zzso 24 h after zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso In total, these data support the idea that zzso zzso such as zzso enhance DNA repair in bone zzso zzso This property is likely to be an important mechanism for its zzso effects because it protects zzso zzso from the deleterious effects of zzso
