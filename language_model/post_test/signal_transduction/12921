We have determined the zzso of zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso one of the genes induced following DNA damage in zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso of zzso zzso using treatment with the DNA zzso agent zzso We show that zzso is zzso zzso although zzso with a shift from the zzso cell cycle phase to zzso zzso This zzso is absent in zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased in zzso deficient in zzso zzso repair and zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso DNA damage signal zzso cascade is active in zzso zzso zzso However, when independently zzso it too zzso zzso zzso We present a model in which zzso zzso requires two zzso one depending on the zzso DNA damage signal zzso cascade and the other on zzso zzso zzso
