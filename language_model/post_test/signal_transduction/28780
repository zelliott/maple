zzso therapy zzso limited benefits to hosts bearing late-stage zzso zzso evidence points to local suppression of T cell function as the most substantial barrier to effective zzso immunity in hosts with large tumor zzso Despite this, events responsible for locally defective T cells and immune suppression in tumors remain zzso We describe in this study a zzso T cell population localized within two zzso tumors that is characterized by expression of zzso markers and zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso zzso These defective cells resembled double negative zzso T cells in zzso mice, zzso defects in the expression of T cell signaling zzso and produced the zzso zzso zzso zzso known to increase or decrease the zzso of zzso zzso T cells had corresponding effects on local zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso levels and zzso impacted host zzso zzso transfer into zzso tumors demonstrated that zzso zzso T cells were highly susceptible to becoming zzso zzso and local supplementation of tumors with zzso zzso zzso class zzso zzso decreased both this zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings identify a major defective T cell population with zzso potential within zzso The data also suggest that local T cell zzso is controlled by the tumor environment independent of zzso zzso specificity per zzso zzso defective zzso zzso levels by increasing zzso zzso zzso class I zzso or modulating zzso or zzso signaling may facilitate host survival by bolstering zzso immunity to late-stage tumors, and may help improve therapeutic tumor zzso
