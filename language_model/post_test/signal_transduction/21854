zzso is a protein domain of unknown zzso function implicated in bacterial signaling and zzso In the plant pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso the synthesis of zzso factors and zzso of zzso are positively controlled by a zzso signal zzso system zzso the zzso domain regulatory protein zzso and zzso sensor zzso and by zzso signaling zzso by the zzso signal zzso zzso zzso signal zzso The zzso zzso system has been implicated in zzso perception and signal zzso Here we show that the role of zzso is to degrade the unusual zzso zzso zzso an activity associated with the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso H and D zzso of the isolated zzso domain resulted in loss of both the zzso activity against zzso zzso and the regulatory activity in zzso factor zzso Two other protein zzso zzso and zzso are already implicated in the synthesis and degradation respectively of zzso zzso As with zzso and zzso zzso the zzso domain is widely distributed in zzso bacteria and occurs in plant and animal zzso as well as beneficial zzso and organisms associated with a range of environmental zzso Identification of the role of the zzso domain thus increases our understanding of a signaling network whose importance to the lifestyle of diverse bacteria is now zzso
