Natural killer zzso cells are a key component of the innate immune system, as they are able to detect zzso cells, tumors as well as zzso cells, without specific zzso zzso cell zzso functions zzso zzso zzso are regulated by a wide array of zzso and zzso zzso zzso class I molecules are the zzso of most zzso zzso while zzso receptors recognize either zzso zzso or zzso whose expression is zzso upon microbial infection or tumor zzso Upon integration of these negative and positive signals, Natural zzso cells can discriminate between healthy zzso zzso and zzso cells undergoing different types of cellular stress or zzso cells zzso The knowledge of the different mechanisms of target cell recognition is thus crucial to dissect zzso cell involvement in zzso and disease conditions as well as to develop novel alternative therapeutic approaches based on zzso cell zzso
