zzso is a zzso zzso protein identified as one of the most zzso genes in pulmonary zzso Experimental animal models have identified early zzso zzso as essential to the zzso of zzso pulmonary zzso However, the principal sources of zzso in the zzso zzso and the factors responsible for its zzso have not been fully zzso We isolated primary rat lung zzso in culture to examine the expression and regulation of lung zzso zzso Our results demonstrate a potent and dramatic increase in zzso expression induced by zzso zzso whereas tumor necrosis zzso transforming growth zzso and zzso II had minimal zzso zzso with zzso resulted in the zzso of soluble zzso zzso We found that zzso expression by zzso was regulated via signaling primarily through the zzso protein zzso member zzso partially by zzso zzso but not at all by zzso Finally, the mechanism of zzso increase in zzso zzso requires de zzso zzso and zzso In conclusion, we find that zzso is expressed by primary lung zzso and is zzso zzso by the early inflammatory and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may be a significant source of zzso production during lung zzso
