We have used zzso basic protein immobilized in sodium zzso zzso gels to identify protein zzso after gel zzso followed by protein zzso zzso This technique has permitted us to detect three protein zzso in zzso cells transformed by zzso On induction of cellular transformation by a zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso is activated within 30 zzso and remains activated in fully transformed zzso The zzso protein zzso is not fully activated until 24 h but remains activated in transformed zzso The commonly studied zzso is rapidly activated within 30 zzso and its zzso activity decreases significantly by 24 zzso when the zzso zzso is fully zzso The zzso as well as the zzso and zzso zzso are zzso by transforming zzso zzso but not normal zzso or zzso zzso In addition, the zzso activity of zzso zzso but not of zzso can be induced in zzso zzso chicken zzso zzso indicating that zzso 2A and/or zzso 1 may be involved in the regulation of its zzso Additional data indicate that either zzso or zzso activity zzso with the stimulation of the protein zzso zzso Thus, there may be two independent pathways leading to the zzso of the zzso gene zzso
