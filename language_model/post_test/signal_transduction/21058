We show that zzso zzso zzso applied to the zzso wing region block the formation of a zone of polarizing activity zzso This suggests a direct relationship between zzso signaling and the establishment of the zzso We provide evidence that the zzso zzso zzso is a direct target of zzso signaling since zzso applied zzso rapidly zzso this gene in the absence of protein synthesis and, moreover, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, we find that, in the lateral plate zzso the zzso of zzso expression and of polarizing activity are zzso Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that zzso are required for the establishment of a zzso and that zzso act, at least in part, through zzso a gene associated with zzso formation zzso et zzso zzso
