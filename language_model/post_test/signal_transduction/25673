Recently, we reported that membrane zzso receptors zzso are expressed in colon tumors triggering strong zzso zzso In the present study, we analyzed zzso downstream zzso controlling cell survival and migration of zzso colon cancer zzso We show that long-term zzso of zzso zzso the activity of zzso and zzso and induced zzso of the zzso Bad zzso Moreover, treatment of zzso mice, which spontaneously develop zzso tumors, with zzso testosterone zzso reduced the tumor zzso by zzso and significantly decreased the expression of zzso and zzso levels in tumor zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso strongly inhibited zzso cell zzso In accordance with these findings, zzso a protein controlling cell zzso and zzso zzso was effectively zzso upon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso reorganization and restored zzso Moreover, zzso zzso by appropriate zzso or blocking zzso reorganization by zzso B, restored the migration zzso From these results we conclude that zzso zzso zzso the zzso signals zzso in zzso and in zzso and blocks migration of colon cancer cells via regulation of zzso signaling and zzso zzso supporting the powerful zzso effect of those zzso
