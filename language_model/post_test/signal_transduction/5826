The zzso zzso zzso pivotal in cardiac zzso function, is inhibited by zzso II zzso zzso Since zzso II activates zzso zzso we tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso mediates the pump zzso Exposure to 100 zzso zzso II increased zzso zzso of isolated rabbit zzso zzso The increase was abolished by zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and by zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso C zzso previously implicated in zzso zzso zzso pump zzso A role for zzso was also supported by an zzso zzso increase in zzso of zzso with the zzso for the activated zzso and with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso II decreased zzso zzso pump current in zzso zzso The decrease was abolished by zzso by the zzso zzso zzso that blocks assembly and zzso of zzso zzso and by zzso zzso zzso Since zzso should facilitate zzso zzso regulation of the zzso zzso we examined whether there is physical association between the pump zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso with zzso 3 and with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso II had no effect on zzso 3 or zzso interaction, but it increased zzso zzso We conclude that zzso II zzso the zzso pump via zzso zzso zzso zzso
