Besides differentiation and zzso cell migration is a basic process in brain development in which neural cells migrate several zzso within the developing brain before reaching their proper positions and forming the right zzso For identifying signaling events that control neural migration and are therefore potential targets of chemicals to disturb normal brain development, we developed a human zzso migration zzso based on normal human neural zzso zzso cells, in which the distance is measured that cells wander over zzso zzso this zzso we investigated the role of the zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso in the regulation of zzso cell zzso Exposure to model substances like ethanol or zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a correlation between zzso zzso and cell zzso The participation of zzso zzso was confirmed by exposure of the cells to the zzso inhibitor zzso which directly prohibits zzso zzso and inhibited cell zzso We identified protein zzso C zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso as upstream signaling zzso governing zzso zzso thereby controlling zzso cell zzso Additionally, treatments with zzso zzso zzso led to a diminished cell migration without affecting zzso zzso Based on these results, we zzso that migration of zzso cells is controlled via zzso and zzso zzso
