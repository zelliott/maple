The integrity of the cell wall depends on the synthesis and correct assembly of its individual zzso Several environmental factors, such as temperature zzso treatments with mating factors or with specific cell zzso drugs, or genetic factors, such as zzso of cell zzso genes (for example zzso or zzso can impair construction of the cell zzso As the cell wall is essential for preserving the zzso integrity of the cell, several responses are triggered in response to zzso zzso This review focuses on the zzso of salvage pathways that guarantee cell survival through zzso of the zzso zzso These researches have useful implication for the study of similar pathways in human zzso zzso and for the evaluation of the efficacy of new zzso zzso
