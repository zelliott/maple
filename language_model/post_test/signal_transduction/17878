zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso which contains motifs susceptible to mediate zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies, we isolated the zzso zzso as a specific partner of zzso zzso domain and showed by zzso experiments that the interaction took place with the zzso of zzso The interaction was not modulated in zzso cells zzso by zzso neither in zzso cells zzso the insulin zzso in the presence or absence of insulin zzso We also showed that zzso was able to zzso with zzso zzso protein in the absence of zzso and with the insulin zzso in zzso cell zzso The presence of zzso in a complex around the insulin zzso could account for the very specific increase in insulin sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso
