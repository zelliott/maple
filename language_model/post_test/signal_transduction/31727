zzso is a zzso zzso implicated in zzso dysfunction and zzso although it was originally identified as an oxidized LDL zzso In this review, the roles of various zzso zzso and their interaction with zzso are discussed to understand the zzso significance of zzso 

zzso knockout mice showed resistance of zzso zzso against oxidized LDL and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso reduction in mice also attenuated zzso zzso In a human cohort study, high concentration of zzso zzso zzso predicted the zzso of cardiovascular zzso Furthermore, modified zzso which existed in high concentration in the plasma of coronary artery disease patients, was found to induce impairment of zzso zzso oxide release via zzso In addition to zzso zzso was found to work as a zzso protein zzso providing a scaffold for the zzso of the complement zzso 

zzso is a unique zzso among the sensors of danger zzso zzso is not only sensing danger signals such as modified LDL and heat shock zzso but also scaffolding other danger sensors including zzso protein and zzso and directly commanding responses to danger signals by working as a cell zzso zzso Via these functions, zzso might work as a surveillance zzso of vascular zzso
