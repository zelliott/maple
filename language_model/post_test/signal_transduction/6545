zzso from the zzso zzso the neural zzso and the underlying zzso have all been implicated in the induction of neural zzso Bone zzso protein zzso signaling in particular has an important role in this process; however, it is unclear whether this activity of zzso is due to its effects on patterning the underlying zzso to its ability to establish a competent neural plate boundary zone, or to the direct zzso of neural crest at intermediate levels of activity within a zzso zzso We show neural crest induction occurs in zzso in the absence of zzso zzso indicating that this tissue and signals derived from it are zzso for the formation of neural zzso zzso zzso is a major source of zzso zzso antagonists, and the activity of zzso signaling is thought to depend on the presence of the opposing activity of these zzso We find that the three zzso zzso known to be expressed during zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso for neural crest zzso These results suggest that mechanisms for restricting the zzso pattern of zzso expression may compensate for the loss of zzso zzso zzso activity in establishing zzso zzso neural zzso and the neural zzso
