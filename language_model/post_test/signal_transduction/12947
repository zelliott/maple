The zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein zzso zzso that is zzso expressed in zzso and zzso zzso zzso is believed to play a role in vascular development and zzso and in the inflammatory responses of zzso and zzso To help define the biological role of this zzso and identify its downstream targets, we have developed a zzso zzso of zzso that has potent biological activity in zzso cell zzso Introduction of zzso active zzso into zzso zzso cells induced the appearance of fully differentiated zzso within 6 to 12 zzso The zzso differentiated cells became zzso had distinctive zzso zzso and exhibited increased expression of zzso differentiation zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso factor zzso These cells acquired zzso properties and exhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities, confirming that they were functionally active zzso zzso there was zzso of the zzso marker zzso zzso factor zzso indicating that the biological activity of zzso was coordinated in a zzso zzso A zzso active zzso did not induce zzso zzso or zzso of zzso markers in zzso cells, suggesting that the biological activity we observed was not a general consequence of expression of an activated zzso zzso zzso Analysis of possible downstream targets of zzso revealed that this zzso activated the zzso family zzso factor zzso which is essential for zzso zzso Our results strongly zzso zzso as a key regulator of terminal zzso differentiation and identify zzso as a zzso factor that may mediate some of its biological activities in zzso zzso
