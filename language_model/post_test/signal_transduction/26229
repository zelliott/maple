Several recent investigations have underscored the growing role of zzso signaling in the peripheral regulation of zzso zzso and energy zzso In addition, the zzso play a critical role in the central control of zzso These zzso and the latest reports highlighting the emerging role of the nuclear hormone zzso zzso 4A zzso in zzso have prompted us to investigate the cross talk between zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling in zzso We have shown that zzso zzso and zzso zzso the expression of the zzso zzso (but not any other members of the zzso zzso in differentiated zzso zzso zzso of quantitative zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identified the zzso and marked induction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso after zzso zzso Similar experiments demonstrated that the zzso expression profile induced by zzso and zzso treatment displayed unique but also overlapping properties and suggested that zzso induction of gene expression involves zzso and zzso zzso zzso small interfering zzso zzso expression suppressed zzso induction of zzso and zzso (but not zzso Moreover, expression of the zzso zzso zzso induction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso expression attenuated zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso administration of zzso to zzso zzso zzso mice significantly induced the expression of the zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso expression is necessary for zzso induction of gene expression in differentiated zzso Furthermore, this study demonstrates cross talk between zzso and zzso signaling in zzso
