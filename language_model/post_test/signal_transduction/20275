zzso cancer is the most lethal zzso zzso zzso and its derivatives are zzso zzso and their resistance is a major hurdle in successful zzso cancer zzso zzso the molecular zzso underlying zzso is important for enhancing therapeutic zzso Here, we review two established pathways in cancer zzso zzso is a major tumor zzso regulating proliferation and zzso and its zzso is a frequent event in human zzso The zzso axis is a key zzso zzso regulating survival and zzso by controlling several tumor zzso including zzso The interplay between these pathways is well established, although the zzso zzso zzso adds a new layer to this intricate relationship and provides new insights into the processes determining cell zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by functional food compounds as an adjunct to zzso may tip the balance in favor of zzso rather than survival, enhancing therapeutic zzso and reducing side zzso
