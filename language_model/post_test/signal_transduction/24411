zzso zzso D zzso has been established as a negative zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso We previously demonstrated that induced expression of zzso active zzso zzso that mimics zzso by zzso is sufficient to zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso 63 zzso a natural zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso Because the zzso zzso has been implicated in sustaining both lung and pancreatic zzso zzso we have zzso stable zzso expression of zzso in clones of zzso zzso cell lung cancer zzso and zzso pancreatic cancer cells to determine its effects on zzso signaling in the context of the zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso cells, induced expression of zzso in either zzso zzso or zzso cells failed to zzso zzso dependent zzso of zzso indicating that zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is zzso from zzso suppression in these cancer zzso
