zzso growth factors zzso have zzso biological effects on tumor cells and their zzso In multiple myeloma zzso we have reported that bone zzso zzso cells zzso from zzso patients produce more zzso than zzso from healthy donors, which in turn zzso zzso zzso zzso We show here that the zzso zzso I zzso inhibitor zzso significantly decreases zzso of both zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso from zzso as well as tumor cell growth triggered by zzso cell zzso to zzso 

zzso production and zzso cell proliferation triggered by zzso or zzso to zzso were examined in the presence or absence of zzso zzso of zzso on zzso signaling pathways triggering zzso and zzso zzso in zzso were also zzso 

zzso significantly zzso not only zzso but also zzso of both zzso and zzso from zzso triggered by either zzso or zzso of zzso cells to zzso Moreover, zzso decreased tumor cell growth triggered by zzso cell zzso to zzso zzso works, at least in part, by blocking zzso nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso factor zzso as well as related production of zzso and zzso zzso 

These studies indicate that zzso zzso production of zzso zzso zzso cell growth, survival, drug resistance, and migration in the zzso zzso thereby providing the zzso rationale for clinical evaluation of zzso to improve patient outcome in zzso
