In plants, mounting an effective innate immune strategy against microbial pathogens involves triggering local cell death within infected cells as well as boosting the immunity of the zzso neighboring and zzso located zzso Although not much is known about this, it is evident that zzso zzso signaling is critical in this process to zzso infection to local tissue while allowing for the spread of systemic immune signals throughout the whole zzso In support of this notion, direct zzso communication was recently found to play a crucial role in plant zzso Here, we provide experimental evidence that salicylic acid zzso is a critical hormonal signal that regulates zzso zzso during innate immune responses zzso by virulent bacterial infection in zzso zzso We show that direct zzso application of zzso or bacterial infection suppresses zzso zzso and that zzso zzso zzso are impaired in this zzso The zzso or zzso suppression of zzso zzso requires an enhanced zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with the regulator of zzso gating zzso zzso We discuss a model wherein the zzso signaling zzso and zzso zzso communication zzso under an intricate regulatory zzso
