The objective of this study was to assess the impact of persistent inflammation on spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of evoked zzso behavior in the adult zzso zzso threshold was assessed with von Frey filaments applied to the zzso surface of the hind zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were administered zzso in the presence and absence of complete zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso rats, zzso increased and zzso decreased zzso zzso After zzso the effects of these compounds were zzso Low doses of zzso exacerbated the zzso decrease in zzso threshold and zzso increased zzso zzso zzso increased zzso threshold both in the presence and absence of zzso zzso but not zzso blocked the zzso effects of zzso These findings indicate that zzso changes in zzso signaling are complex and are likely to involve several distinct zzso zzso the changes in zzso signaling may provide effective relief from hypersensitivity observed in the presence of zzso 

An zzso shift in spinal zzso zzso signaling from zzso to zzso appears to zzso inflammatory pain and zzso Use of zzso zzso selective general zzso in association with therapeutic interventions may be zzso More importantly, zzso the changes in zzso signaling may provide effective relief from inflammatory zzso
