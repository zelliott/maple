zzso is one of several genes in zzso whose zzso results in zzso zzso We have now studied the role of its mouse zzso zzso in embryonic development by generating zzso knockout zzso zzso zzso zzso died zzso zzso impairment of zzso in various regions including the zzso and neural zzso The zzso body was found to be properly zzso to the zzso membrane of cells in the zzso but the zzso failed to zzso zzso is a zzso protein and is zzso localized at the base and tip of zzso zzso zzso as revealed with a zzso reporter zzso was lost in zzso zzso at embryonic day zzso zzso but was zzso expanded at zzso The zzso knockout zzso also failed to manifest zzso zzso expression of zzso in the lateral plate, most likely as a result of the loss of zzso signaling in zzso crown cells that in turn leads to pronounced zzso of zzso expression in these zzso Crown zzso restoration of zzso expression rescued zzso expression in crown cells and zzso zzso expression in the lateral plate of zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso contributes to zzso by regulating the zzso transport zzso cycle at the base and tip of the zzso
