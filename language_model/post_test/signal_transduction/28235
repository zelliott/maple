Relative expression levels of zzso genes were determined by zzso zzso analyses in mouse skin zzso cells susceptible zzso and resistant zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes in 6 functional classes were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and basement membrane zzso proteins (20 zzso zzso cells express higher levels than zzso cells of several zzso and zzso and lower levels of zzso zzso Multiple genes zzso zzso molecules are expressed zzso in zzso cells, including six genes implicated in zzso guidance and zzso zzso zzso proteins (13 zzso These include zzso zzso and regulatory zzso almost all zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso Signal zzso proteins (12 zzso Among these are zzso zzso protein zzso the deleted in oral zzso and zzso tumor zzso and zzso 43 zzso gap zzso zzso all expressed zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins (3 zzso These include zzso protein zzso an zzso zzso regulator expressed zzso in zzso zzso zzso Other zzso factors (4 zzso zzso related zzso gene 2 zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso and cellular zzso zzso protein II zzso zzso factors are expressed zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso exhibits preferential zzso zzso zzso Genes of unknown functions zzso zzso Numerous zzso markers are expressed in both cell zzso Data for multiple genes were confirmed by real-time zzso Overall, 26 genes were newly implicated in zzso zzso analyses of the functions of the genes and their zzso provided zzso evidence for their possible roles in implementing genetic programs zzso cancer zzso and zzso These results, in conjunction with cell wounding and zzso zzso data, indicated that concerted genetic programs were implemented that were conducive to cell zzso and tumor suppression in zzso cells and that favored zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso of tumor suppression in zzso zzso Such genetic programs may in part be orchestrated by zzso zzso and zzso regulatory pathways implicated in this zzso
