The zzso growth factors zzso colony stimulating factor and steel factor have been shown to zzso in the stimulation of proliferation of the human zzso cell line zzso We investigated the possible involvement of zzso signaling in zzso colony stimulating factor and steel factor induced zzso zzso It was found that treatment of zzso cells with these factors alone stimulates zzso zzso metabolism and that they cooperate to further enhance this zzso Therefore a zzso zzso signal zzso zzso may operate as part of the series of events leading to synergistic growth induced by the combination of zzso colony stimulating factor and steel zzso
