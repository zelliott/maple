zzso of type I zzso zzso is an early zzso response of the host, and zzso zzso and respiratory syndrome virus zzso has been reported to zzso the zzso response during infection in cells and zzso We report that the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso is a zzso protein distributed to the nucleus and contains a strong zzso activity for zzso production that is zzso through the zzso zzso gene I zzso signaling zzso zzso suppressed the zzso of nuclear factor zzso when zzso with zzso or tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso suppression was zzso The suppression of zzso zzso was associated with the poor production of zzso during zzso zzso The zzso 14 zzso acids of the zzso zzso were critical in maintaining zzso activity of zzso for both zzso and zzso suggesting that the newly identified zinc finger zzso zzso of zzso may be crucial for zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso and as a consequence zzso zzso to the nucleus was zzso leading to the zzso of zzso zzso gene zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso is a zzso nuclear protein participating in the zzso of the host zzso zzso
