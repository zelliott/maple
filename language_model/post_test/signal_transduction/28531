In addition to zzso zzso normal zzso zzso undergo zzso premature zzso zzso in response to DNA damage caused by zzso stress or zzso radiation zzso zzso is not prevented by zzso zzso indicating that, unlike zzso zzso it is triggered by zzso zzso DNA damage rather than by zzso zzso zzso the product of the gene zzso in individuals with zzso zzso zzso plays a central role in cell cycle arrest in response to DNA zzso Whether zzso also mediates signaling that leads to zzso was investigated with the use of normal and AT zzso zzso zzso with an expression zzso for the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso of zzso in AT zzso resulted in zzso zzso and prevented premature zzso zzso but it did not rescue the zzso in zzso checkpoint zzso or the hypersensitivity of the cells to zzso Despite these remaining defects in the DNA damage response, zzso AT zzso exhibited characteristics of zzso on exposure to zzso or zzso in such a manner that triggers zzso in normal zzso These characteristics included the adoption of an enlarged and flattened zzso positive zzso for zzso zzso activity, termination of DNA zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso which mediates signaling that leads to zzso was also detected in both zzso or zzso AT and normal zzso expressing zzso These results suggest that the zzso signaling zzso triggered by DNA damage is zzso for zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in response to zzso or zzso zzso
