Exposure of zzso cells to solar ultraviolet zzso radiation leads to the expression of several zzso and zzso has been recognized as a major zzso and promoter of skin zzso The component of the solar radiation that contributes most to human skin zzso is zzso zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, UVA zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso zzso is absorbed by the earth's upper zzso zzso doses of zzso produce strong induction of zzso and zzso transcripts in several cells including human primary zzso The present report confirms that this is also the case in the zzso cell line and shows that similar zzso doses are potent zzso of the zzso family of zzso protein zzso but only weak zzso of zzso zzso growth factor zzso caused rapid induction of both zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso Prior zzso zzso of the cells decreased the level of the zzso zzso by a subsequent zzso treatment, but this zzso the cells and allowed for the zzso of zzso after a zzso with either zzso or zzso The zzso zzso impaired the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso Our data suggest the presence of shared signaling zzso in the zzso and zzso cellular response pathways and imply that zzso stress plays a significant role in the zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso
