zzso interactions in which one cell sends a signal to another cell, inducing a change in function of the second cell, are common in zzso development, zzso and repair of the lung and other zzso In zzso zzso zzso the zzso that zzso the functional changes in the target cell remains associated with the plasma membrane of the signaling cell, rather than acting in the fluid zzso This feature zzso zzso signaling from zzso and zzso stimulation and provides a mechanism for strict spatial control of zzso of one cell by zzso zzso signaling is likely to be common in zzso events that require tight regulation, and disruption of zzso signaling may lead to zzso zzso In this zzso general principles as well as several specific examples of zzso signaling are zzso
