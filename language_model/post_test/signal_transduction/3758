The zzso family of protein zzso zzso consisting of zzso and zzso associate with the zzso and zzso T cell zzso receptors zzso and undergo zzso zzso and zzso following zzso zzso zzso development in zzso mice is blocked at the zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso in the zzso has raised the possibility that zzso may be able to mediate zzso zzso To determine if zzso can play a role in zzso development, we generated zzso mice expressing a human zzso zzso zzso expression restored both zzso development and zzso In addition, zzso function required the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso can play overlapping functions and exhibit similar regulatory mechanisms in zzso zzso T cell zzso
