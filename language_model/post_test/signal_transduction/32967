zzso of zzso cells with the zzso zzso is zzso through zzso zzso which transmit signals regulating cell growth, differentiation and zzso zzso of these zzso via zzso zzso recognition zzso leads to zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso We treated human breast cancer cell lines with zzso zzso which can disrupt zzso attachment, and investigated zzso in zzso zzso cell detachment and zzso zzso grown in zzso were treated with zzso growth zzso zzso zzso and a small, synthetic zzso zzso zzso and its negative control zzso zzso zzso for either 30 zzso followed by zzso of cell zzso with zzso and Western zzso with zzso or for 24 h followed by cell zzso zzso and flow zzso Both zzso zzso zzso and the synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso caused significant zzso of zzso Furthermore, after 24 h both peptides caused detachment from the zzso and the induction of zzso We conclude from these data that zzso can interact with zzso receptors to induce zzso zzso and subsequently influence attachment and cell zzso
