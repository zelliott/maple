zzso of pathogens by innate immune cells is zzso by pattern recognition receptors zzso which include scavenger receptors zzso The class A zzso zzso and zzso are characterized by the presence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in their zzso zzso Both receptors are expressed mainly on zzso and zzso zzso Thanks to their ability to bind to a wide range of zzso zzso the class A zzso may participate in numerous functions of these cells, such as zzso and zzso to zzso zzso and to other zzso Among zzso zzso are oxidized zzso and zzso zzso which link zzso to the zzso of zzso and Alzheimer's zzso Despite the demonstration of class A zzso involvement in so many zzso the lack of selective zzso precluded reaching zzso conclusions concerning their signaling zzso Using specific zzso zzso with zzso we showed that zzso and zzso trigger zzso zzso modulating zzso and zzso activities of zzso Surprisingly, despite similarities in structure and zzso binding zzso zzso and zzso exert opposite effects on zzso zzso production in zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso and zzso production, but had no effect on the release of several other zzso These limited effects of specific zzso zzso contrast with generalized enhancement of immune responses observed in zzso zzso Recent studies have revealed that many of these effects of zzso zzso may be caused by zzso changes in the expression of other receptors and/or zzso of signal zzso from receptors belonging to the zzso family, rather than by the loss of the zzso function of zzso
