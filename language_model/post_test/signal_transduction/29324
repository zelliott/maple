zzso in zzso zzso 1 zzso gene cause zzso familial zzso To decipher the role of zzso in zzso of Parkinson's disease zzso researchers need to identify protein zzso of zzso zzso activity that govern zzso survival, and establish whether zzso regulation and zzso of zzso contribute to both familial zzso and idiopathic zzso These studies should take into account the several unique structural and functional features of zzso First zzso is a rare example of a protein zzso with a predicted zzso sequence and a possible resident zzso zzso Second, zzso analysis reveals unique insert regions within the zzso domain that are potentially involved in regulation of zzso activity, zzso selectivity and stability of zzso Third, the zzso region contains functional motifs governing zzso activity and zzso zzso Fourth, accumulating evidence suggests that zzso interacts with other signaling proteins implicated in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The most prominent examples are the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso high temperature requirement zzso zzso 2 and the zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso protein zzso How zzso may regulate these proteins to maintain zzso survival is zzso This review describes the unique structural features of zzso and their possible roles in governing zzso import, processing, zzso activity, zzso selectivity and stability of zzso Based upon the findings of previous studies of zzso function in cell lines and animal models, we propose a model on the zzso mechanism of zzso This model may serve as a conceptual framework for future investigation into the molecular basis of zzso zzso
