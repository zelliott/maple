Alzheimer's disease zzso is associated with major zzso in insulin and zzso growth factor zzso gene expression and signaling in the zzso These abnormalities increase with severity of zzso and are associated with deficiencies in energy metabolism and zzso zzso The zzso of brain zzso zzso and resistance suggests that zzso may represent a zzso form of diabetes, zzso Type 3 zzso This hypothesis is supported by the findings in an experimental animal model in which zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso brain and not pancreatic zzso The zzso treatment produced zzso insulin depletion and insulin resistance are associated with progressive zzso that shares many features in common with zzso We now demonstrate that early treatment with zzso activated zzso zzso can effectively prevent zzso zzso and its associated deficits in learning and zzso These effects were zzso by increased binding to insulin zzso reduced levels of zzso stress and zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso expression in the brain, suggesting that insulin zzso agents may have therapeutic efficacy in early zzso
