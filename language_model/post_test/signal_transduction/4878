How zzso versus differentiation of neural zzso cells is temporally controlled during early development remains zzso We show that mouse zzso zzso is highly expressed in neural zzso cells and its expression declines during neural zzso Loss of zzso function in mice causes reduced proliferation and premature differentiation of embryonic neural zzso zzso zzso was recently implicated as the zzso zzso zzso that mediates degradation of zzso 2 zzso a key zzso of the zzso zzso However, our zzso studies of neural zzso cells indicate zzso is not required for zzso zzso or zzso Instead, zzso neural zzso exhibit zzso for zzso growth factor zzso zzso We show that zzso promotes zzso signaling by directly binding to and enhancing the stability of zzso zzso protein 1 zzso and that zzso is an important component of zzso signaling in neural zzso zzso Thus, zzso acts as a zzso regulator to promote neural zzso cell zzso not via the regulation of zzso stability, but through zzso zzso
