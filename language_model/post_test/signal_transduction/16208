zzso has diverse functions and multiple cellular locations in various cell zzso While classically described as an zzso zzso zzso resident zzso zzso has a nuclear location sequence zzso and can enter the nucleus from the zzso to alter zzso of target zzso zzso and variable expression of zzso is associated with a variety of zzso including zzso zzso zzso We investigated the dynamic mobility of zzso in an zzso cell line, zzso to better understand the movement and function of the zzso resident pool of zzso zzso zzso indicated zzso is highly expressed in the zzso with a smaller zzso pool in zzso zzso zzso an zzso green fluorescent protein fusion construct created with and without a zzso signal zzso we found that zzso zzso zzso to the nucleus within zzso after tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not trigger nuclear zzso of zzso indicating zzso is zzso zzso To determine if an interaction between the zzso zzso binding domain in zzso and the nuclear zzso zzso zzso occurred after zzso treatment and could account for nuclear movement, zzso was performed under control and conditions that stabilized zzso zzso zzso No support for a functional interaction between zzso and zzso after zzso treatment was found in either zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso after zzso treatment indicated that nuclear zzso of these two proteins occurs independently in zzso zzso
