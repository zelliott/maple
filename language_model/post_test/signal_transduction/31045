Most viral zzso used for gene therapy lack the ability to target a defined cell zzso zzso zzso has a restricted zzso for human zzso zzso cells and uses activated zzso zzso as zzso for entry zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Blood 102, zzso In this study we examined the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso increased zzso zzso entry into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of one zzso group, however, reduced the virus zzso promoting function of a subsequently activated zzso group, indicating that the three zzso did not operate in isolation but through shared signaling zzso This was further zzso by direct competition between simultaneously clustered zzso and zzso zzso that could be overcome by stabilizing clustered zzso zzso in a zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso entry into primary zzso zzso cells was characterized by strong zzso zzso zzso zzso activity that was not abolished by subsequent zzso and zzso zzso zzso and was, in fact, substantially increased in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso function is regulated in a cell zzso manner through zzso zzso and preferential zzso zzso entry into zzso zzso cells is promoted by a robust zzso zzso response that is enhanced through stable zzso of zzso zzso These results have implications for other viral zzso that use zzso as zzso and for gene therapy of zzso zzso cells using zzso zzso zzso
