zzso an zzso nuclear orphan zzso which zzso promoters through an zzso response element zzso is strongly induced by zzso hormone through the zzso zzso A signaling zzso in zzso Here, we demonstrate that multiple agents zzso diverse signaling pathways in zzso induce zzso The strongest zzso zzso were zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by protein zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had minimal effect, whereas zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso Computer analysis of zzso promoters indicated two potential zzso in the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso site maps to the zzso zzso We tested whether zzso zzso zzso expression through the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein from primary mouse zzso bound to a consensus zzso in zzso zzso induced a consensus 3 zzso zzso reporter construct in mouse zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein bound to the zzso zzso site in the zzso promoter in zzso zzso zzso protein bound to this site as a zzso because neither zzso X zzso alpha nor zzso X zzso beta zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking or containing a zzso zzso zzso site had markedly blunted responses to zzso zzso Finally, zzso expressed zzso protein bound to the zzso zzso site in zzso zzso zzso and induced zzso zzso in primary rat zzso We conclude that zzso is a zzso target zzso which positions zzso in the core of zzso factors regulating zzso gene zzso
