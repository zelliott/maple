Gene expression quantitative trait zzso zzso are useful for identifying single zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso At times, a genetic zzso may be associated with a master regulator involved in the manifestation of a zzso The downstream target genes of the master regulator are typically zzso and share biological zzso zzso it is practical to screen for zzso by identifying zzso associated with the targets of a zzso zzso We used a zzso zzso with the gene expression of known targets of zzso and zzso to identify zzso in European zzso and African zzso zzso zzso A nominal zzso of zzso revealed 234 zzso in zzso and 154 in zzso as zzso These represent 36 independent zzso zzso in zzso and 39 in zzso affecting the downstream targets of 25 and 36 zzso zzso At a false discovery rate zzso one zzso tag zzso zzso 1 zzso of a zzso in each population was identified as a zzso In zzso the zzso zzso in zzso was found to be associated with the genes regulated by zzso whereas in zzso the zzso zzso was linked to the targets of zzso zzso To zzso the pathways that regulate zzso we ranked zzso by connectivity within the structure of biological process zzso One zzso zzso zzso in zzso maps to zzso and is associated zzso zzso with the targets of the zzso breast cancer zzso zzso The structure of the biological process zzso and a gene interaction network of the zzso revealed that tumor necrosis factor, zzso and zzso in zzso coupled receptors signaling may play a central role as communicators in zzso functional zzso The potential zzso effect of the zzso zzso was gleaned from zzso zzso data and zzso enrichment into the zzso
