A zzso signal recorded with in zzso zzso within the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso was taken as an index of the activity of zzso zzso zzso and related to the level of zzso zzso under zzso zzso zzso increases in zzso signal were observed during zzso increases in zzso partial CO2 pressure zzso from 20 to 60 zzso after zzso of tidal volume zzso zzso 5 intact rats, zzso zzso 5 after carotid zzso zzso A zzso increase in zzso CO2 combined with constant tidal volume led to changes in zzso from 40 zzso to 50 or 60 or 70 zzso for 60 zzso zzso zzso 5 in each zzso and to a zzso increase in zzso signal zzso zzso zzso These changes were also observed after carotid zzso zzso zzso zzso 40 to 60 to 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso from 40 to 20 zzso led to a minor, zzso reduction in zzso signal zzso zzso zzso Changes in zzso pressure were zzso although they reached statistical significance in some groups of zzso The level of zzso metabolism in the zzso 1) is continuously related to the level of zzso zzso 2) functions close to its resting level under baseline zzso condition with respect to zzso and 3) is zzso modified on changes in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso recorded in the zzso zzso zzso to CO2 appears primarily to be centrally zzso Thus zzso zzso zzso may relay zzso from the central respiratory generator to the sympathetic zzso or act as zzso for zzso next to the zzso zzso zzso
