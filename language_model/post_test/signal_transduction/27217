zzso zzso and zzso zzso contain nearly identical zzso zzso systems that mediate a zzso transition between virulent zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the zzso phase, the two species express a similar set of zzso and zzso and in both organisms the transition to the zzso phase occurs in response to the same environmental signals zzso temperature or the presence of zzso acid or zzso zzso These two species zzso however, with regard to zzso zzso host zzso the severity and course of the diseases they cause, and also potentially in their routes of zzso To investigate the contribution of the zzso system to these zzso differences, we constructed a zzso zzso zzso strain containing zzso from zzso zzso and compared it with zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso The zzso strain was indistinguishable from the wild type in its ability to express zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, although the zzso strain responded to the same signals as the wild type, it differed dramatically in sensitivity to these zzso significantly more zzso acid or zzso was required to zzso the zzso strain compared with the zzso zzso Despite this difference in signal sensitivity, the zzso strain was indistinguishable from the wild type in its ability to cause zzso infections in rats, indicating that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are functionally interchangeable in zzso By exchanging discrete fragments of zzso we found that the zzso region of zzso determines signal zzso
