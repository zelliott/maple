zzso zzso has been proposed as a driving force for Alzheimer's disease zzso which is characterized by zzso zzso deposition, zzso zzso zzso loss, and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso and nuclear factor zzso B zzso zzso has been reported, which zzso an increased expression of inflammatory zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso is an inflammation zzso whose levels are increased in zzso However, its zzso signaling pathway, zzso appears to be zzso Our previous findings indicate that zzso plays a key role in the zzso of zzso but the molecular mechanisms underlying its effects are not completely zzso Here, we studied the potential role of zzso a zzso that exerts negative regulation on zzso zzso in the zzso actions of zzso Using rat primary zzso cultures, we found that zzso with zzso for 48 h reduced the production of inflammatory zzso induced by zzso a result that was associated with prevention of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso nuclear zzso and an increase in zzso zzso Moreover, suppression of zzso expression by zzso and zzso of zzso reversed the zzso of inflammatory response exerted by zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso the expression of zzso in zzso cells through the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso thus revealing a novel mechanism for the zzso actions of zzso Further research would be important in order to characterize the role of this mechanism in the zzso of zzso
