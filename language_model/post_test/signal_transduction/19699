zzso detect environmental changes, thanks to zzso zzso systems, composed, in general, of a sensor coupled to a zzso zzso and a DNA binding response zzso zzso zzso bacteria like zzso zzso zzso possess a highly versatile metabolism and can grow via photosynthesis using light energy or via zzso through oxygen zzso For zzso bacteria, detecting changes in light quality or zzso or in oxygen zzso is therefore of prime importance for adjusting their metabolism for optimal zzso A central role is played by zzso for light detection and initiation of regulatory zzso The switch of these zzso between two zzso forms is the first event in the zzso zzso This chapter describes in zzso and in zzso methods that have been successfully used to investigate the zzso dependent light regulation zzso in several strains of zzso zzso and zzso These approaches range from zzso and zzso methods to genetic zzso Such multiple approaches are indispensable for understanding these complex zzso zzso In a first step, zzso and associated response regulators are zzso in zzso coli and zzso The spectral and kinetic properties of the two zzso forms of the zzso zzso are then determined by zzso zzso Original spectral and kinetic properties found in some of the zzso that we studied necessitated the development of new methods for computing the zzso of the pure forms and the zzso zzso In zzso zzso approaches help to assess the zzso zzso activity of zzso depending on light conditions, the zzso to response regulators and their affinity to promoter DNA zzso Finally, gene zzso tests the importance of specific genes in photosynthesis regulation under particular light and oxygen tension growth zzso The methods described in this chapter are not restricted to the study of the zzso pathways of zzso zzso and zzso strains but are zzso to the understanding of any bacterial zzso zzso
