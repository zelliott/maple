B cell zzso zzso zzso processing and presentation involves both the zzso zzso and processing of zzso zzso as well as the formation and expression of zzso zzso class II zzso While zzso signaling is known to result in changes in the zzso and zzso trafficking of class II zzso the effect of zzso signaling on the cell biology of zzso zzso and processing is less zzso zzso the effect of zzso signaling on the cell biology of fluid phase zzso zzso processing and presentation was analyzed in both B cell lines or in normal zzso B zzso The results demonstrate that zzso signaling alters neither the global level of fluid phase zzso zzso nor the duration of zzso persistence of fluid phase zzso zzso Moreover, while zzso signal does result in an increase in the level of total cell surface zzso class II molecules as well as specific zzso II complexes, stimulation failed to alter the fraction of class II molecules loaded with zzso zzso These results indicate that while zzso signaling elicits an increase in the expression of zzso zzso II complexes, signaling does not augment zzso presentation by profoundly altering the basic biology of zzso zzso and zzso These results also demonstrate that the high efficiency of zzso zzso processing (when compared to fluid phase zzso zzso is likely to occur independent of zzso zzso global zzso in the biology of zzso processing and zzso This finding suggests that if zzso signaling zzso the efficiency of processing of zzso zzso it must impact unique aspects of zzso zzso processing, such as the zzso persistence of zzso zzso zzso
