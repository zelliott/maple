To clarify the upstream regulatory mechanism of zzso protein zzso zzso we performed the reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso with zzso zzso zzso based on sequences zzso among the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We isolated several zzso zzso fragments that zzso zzso zzso sharing significant sequence zzso with zzso zzso zzso screening of a zzso cell zzso library using one of these zzso fragments as a probe resulted in the isolation of a full-length zzso that encodes a novel protein zzso The zzso domain sequence of this gene product is closely related to those of budding zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso Thus, we call this protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The transcript of zzso was detected in a wide range of zzso and zzso zzso zzso shows protein zzso zzso Although zzso is significantly similar in its zzso domain to zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso did not lead to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso pathway, or zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may be involved in the regulation of a novel zzso signaling zzso
