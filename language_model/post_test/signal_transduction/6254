Whereas most zzso zzso zzso carry a benign outcome, a zzso of individuals with prolonged zzso are at risk for later zzso lobe zzso Signal changes on magnetic resonance imaging zzso may provide early markers for changes in zzso integrity that may promote zzso in such zzso Here, we used serial zzso obtained before and at several time points after experimental prolonged zzso to determine the prevalence and distribution of signal changes on zzso images and to investigate the pathological zzso leading to these zzso Seventy-five percent of immature rats with experimental prolonged zzso had abnormal zzso signal enhancement at 24 hours, and zzso at 8 days after the zzso The altered zzso values involved the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso However, these changes were not accompanied by evidence of zzso injury or death in these regions, as assessed using the zzso zzso Thus, experimental prolonged zzso lead to relatively frequent abnormal zzso signal in zzso zzso zzso Although these changes do not signify cell death, they may zzso pathological cellular processes that promote zzso zzso
