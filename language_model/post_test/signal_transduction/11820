The zzso mouse zzso strain exhibits decreased learning and memory and increased zzso beta zzso zzso zzso at 12 zzso To detect differences in gene expression in zzso mice, we used a control mouse that was a 50% cross between zzso and zzso mice and which showed no memory deficits zzso zzso We then compared gene expression in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and control mice using zzso gene zzso At 12 months, but not at 4 months, zzso analysis revealed significant differences in the long term zzso (6 zzso zzso signaling (6 zzso and zzso (10 zzso zzso The changes in long term zzso included zzso protein zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso responsive element binding protein zzso protein zzso inhibitor 1) and zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso receptors 1 and 2 and zzso zzso Changes in zzso signaling genes suggested altered signaling through zzso and Western zzso revealed zzso changes in zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso Changes in the zzso zzso involved genes related to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is required for zzso recycling, is involved in zzso zzso and is regulated by zzso zzso In zzso these studies demonstrate altered gene expression in 3 zzso zzso pathways associated with memory formation and zzso These pathways might provide new therapeutic targets in addition to targeting zzso metabolism zzso
