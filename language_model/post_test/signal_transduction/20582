The zzso family of zzso factors contributes to zzso through zzso of multiple genes involved in cellular zzso a process that is opposed by the zzso tumor zzso protein zzso RB also increases zzso stability by zzso its zzso degradation, but the consequences of this zzso regulation of zzso remain zzso To better understand the mechanism of zzso stabilization and its zzso zzso we examined the streamlined zzso network in zzso During embryonic development, zzso is insulated from zzso turnover by the zzso zzso a zzso complex that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we report that the zzso zzso also protects the zzso zzso that is responsible for zzso zzso zzso This dual role of the zzso zzso may serve to buffer zzso levels, enhancing its turnover via zzso protection and its stabilization through protection of zzso We further show that zzso stabilization of zzso and repression of zzso cell zzso genes are distinct zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso C terminal zzso disabled zzso repression without affecting zzso zzso This zzso form of zzso also enhanced zzso phase progression when expressed in zzso zzso embryonic cells, suggesting that such zzso may generate zzso properties relevant to cellular zzso zzso with this idea, several studies have identified zzso in the zzso C terminal zzso of RB and zzso in human zzso
