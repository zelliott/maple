zzso resistance is among the most prevalent zzso zzso in the world, and it is closely associated with major diseases of global reach including diabetes zzso zzso zzso fatty liver disease, and zzso zzso It is most commonly found in those with obesity but may also occur in an unusually severe form in rare patients with zzso zzso Such patients may loosely be grouped into those with primary disorders of insulin signaling and those with defects in zzso tissue development or function zzso The severe insulin resistance of both zzso puts patients at risk of accelerated complications and poses severe challenges in clinical zzso However, the clinical disorders produced by different genetic defects are often zzso and clinically distinct and are associated with distinct risks of zzso This means that optimal management of affected patients should take into account the specific natural history of each zzso In clinical practice, they are often zzso however, with low rates of identification of the underlying genetic zzso a problem compounded by confusing and overlapping nomenclature and zzso We now review recent developments in understanding of genetic forms of severe insulin resistance and/or zzso and suggest a revised zzso based on growing knowledge of the underlying zzso
