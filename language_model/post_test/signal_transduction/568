In the current study, we extend our own previous results on the zzso zzso of zzso and/or zzso deficient mice by analyzing the zzso and the zzso organization of their zzso zzso zzso All studied adult zzso zzso showed profound zzso with respect to the zzso zzso zzso Each zzso exhibited a specific zzso but also showed common features including occurrence of zzso immature zzso zzso cells, numerous zzso cells and zzso cells in the zzso zzso and cortical and zzso zzso areas devoid of zzso cell zzso In addition, comparative analysis of zzso and zzso embryonic and newborn zzso demonstrated that the observed adult zzso was a consequence of the gradual zzso of early zzso and zzso zzso becoming more severe at the end of embryonic life and in newborn zzso Together, these results confirm a role for zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The obtained data are discussed from the point of view of the recognized role played by these two zzso in the zzso of other zzso and their possible relationships with molecules known to be involved in zzso zzso cell zzso
