zzso molecules are essential for the recruitment of T cells into the skin during the development of zzso skin disease zzso However, the mechanisms responsible for the regulation of expression of zzso zzso molecules in this setting are still poorly zzso In this study we blocked zzso zzso signaling in a zzso model of minor zzso zzso system mismatch zzso by using an zzso zzso fusion protein zzso The recipient mice treated with control human zzso developed clinically apparent, severe skin zzso However, none of the mice treated with zzso developed clinical skin zzso The expression of zzso in zzso tissue was also much lower in mice treated with zzso than in mice treated with human zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso signaling via zzso treatment appears to be capable of markedly zzso the development of zzso possibly by zzso the expression of zzso zzso
