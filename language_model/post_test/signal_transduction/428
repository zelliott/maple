In zzso zzso by zzso to zzso and aggregate, zzso is rapidly zzso leading to its zzso zzso by severing existing zzso filaments and stimulating zzso zzso on newly created barbed ends zzso the zzso zzso We previously found that zzso zzso is zzso and occurs upstream of zzso in zzso zzso We report now in zzso zzso that zzso and class II zzso zzso were rapidly zzso 5 zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso I zzso zzso was zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso blocked zzso of class II zzso but not zzso Moreover, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso and class II zzso zzso Prevention of zzso zzso by zzso zzso or zzso also blocked zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicating that a zzso II zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso leading to zzso We further found that zzso were activated downstream of zzso but were not involved in regulating zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Our study zzso a zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso as a signaling zzso linking zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso We further demonstrate that this zzso is separate and independent of the protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso
