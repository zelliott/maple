The importance of type I zzso signaling in the innate immune response to viral and zzso pathogens is well established, with an increasing literature implicating zzso bacterial zzso including zzso zzso in this signaling zzso zzso zzso cells and especially zzso cells zzso contribute to the production of type I zzso in the zzso We were interested in establishing how zzso zzso activates the type I zzso cascade in zzso In zzso studies confirmed the rapid zzso of zzso zzso by zzso followed promptly by zzso zzso and expression of zzso Signaling occurred using zzso organisms and in the absence of zzso and zzso zzso with the participation of zzso and not zzso zzso signaling was predominantly zzso by zzso zzso and zzso and blocked by zzso D, zzso and zzso To determine the role of zzso signaling in the zzso of zzso zzso pneumonia, we infected zzso and zzso mice with zzso zzso zzso mice had significantly improved clearance of zzso zzso from the airways and lung zzso zzso mice also had improved zzso This enhanced clearance in zzso mice was not due to differences in the numbers of recruited zzso into the zzso but instead correlated with decreased induction of zzso Thus, we identified zzso as the critical zzso zzso the induction of type I zzso signaling in zzso in response to zzso zzso illustrating an additional mechanism through which zzso zzso exploits innate immune signaling to facilitate zzso
