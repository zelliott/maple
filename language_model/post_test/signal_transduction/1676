Gene expression in zzso can vary in response to zzso zzso In this study, to zzso the zzso dynamics of the zzso response of three genes following the induction of long-term zzso within the entire zzso zzso in zzso two new complementary approaches based on in zzso zzso were developed: three-dimensional reconstruction of the pattern of zzso expression within the entire zzso zzso and radioactive zzso of two zzso species allowing zzso of two different zzso in the same brain zzso zzso Homer and zzso zzso genes were zzso and their regulated expression was examined three times after the induction of long-term zzso zzso expression of each gene under control conditions was zzso but the spatial distribution of zzso was zzso along the zzso axis of the zzso zzso following the induction of long-term zzso and different for each zzso In addition, the intensity of each zzso pattern of expression varied over time following the induction of long-term zzso Our results reveal that long-term zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso species in cells of the zzso zzso depending on their position along the zzso zzso on the gene and on zzso We suggest that there are several molecular mechanisms of long-term zzso differing from one cluster of cells of the zzso zzso to another, or that the different signaling pathways involved in long-term zzso are used with varying efficiencies by different zzso
