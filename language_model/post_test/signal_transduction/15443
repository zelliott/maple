While programmed zzso zzso a zzso member of zzso zzso zzso plays negative roles in zzso functions of T cells and B cells, little is known about the function of zzso expressed on innate immune zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso production was greatly suppressed in zzso zzso cells upon zzso engagement with zzso fusion zzso and was restored in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso suppression of zzso production in zzso zzso cells was zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling pathway, and to a lesser extent, zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso through the recruitment of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso engagement also zzso the expression of zzso molecules such as zzso zzso zzso class I and II proteins in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso activity is enhanced but the zzso capacity is suppressed in zzso zzso cells upon zzso zzso Taken together, our results reveal a novel function of zzso zzso in the negative regulation of zzso synthesis and differentiation into zzso zzso zzso
