zzso protein zzso is a ubiquitous regulatory mechanism that plays critical roles in zzso stress signals to bring about coordinated zzso zzso To gain better understanding of zzso response in plants, we have developed a differential zzso in a food zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were subjected to progressive zzso by withdrawing water, and the changes in the zzso status of a large repertoire of proteins were zzso The proteins were resolved by zzso and stained with zzso fluorescent zzso Diamond zzso Mass zzso analysis led to the identification of 91 putative zzso presumably involved in a variety of functions including cell defense and rescue, photosynthesis and zzso molecular zzso and zzso zzso among zzso Multiple sites of zzso were predicted on several key zzso which include both the regulatory as well as the functional zzso A critical survey of the zzso revealed a zzso zzso regulated plasma membrane zzso plasma membrane zzso family zzso henceforth designated zzso The transcripts of zzso were found to be zzso regulated under zzso stress, further corroborating the zzso zzso This work provides new insights into the possible zzso events triggered by the conditions of progressive zzso in zzso
