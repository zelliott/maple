The size and shape of zzso depend on cellular processes such as cell zzso cell survival, and spatial arrangement of zzso In turn, all of these processes are a consequence of zzso identity of individual cells in whole zzso Links of zzso information with organ growth and pattern expression of genes is a zzso zzso We show that differences in vestigial expression between neighboring cells of the wing blade autonomously and zzso affect cell proliferation along the zzso zzso On the other hand, uniform expression of vestigial zzso cell proliferation and also zzso the shape of wing blade altering the preferential orientation of cell zzso Our observations provide evidence that local cell zzso triggered by differences in vestigial expression between neighboring cells, zzso zzso values operating in the control of growth and shape of the zzso
