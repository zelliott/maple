The zzso barrier zzso is a network formed mainly by brain zzso zzso cells zzso The integrity of the zzso is critical for brain zzso zzso of the zzso is commonly seen in AIDS patients with zzso zzso despite the lack of productive zzso infection of the brain zzso The processes by which zzso causes these pathological conditions are not well zzso In this study we characterized the molecular mechanisms by which zzso mediates its zzso effects in zzso on primary human zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso zzso organization and increased focal zzso sites compared with control cells or cells treated with zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso or with the specific inhibitor zzso which interferes with vascular zzso growth factor zzso type 2 zzso zzso blocked the ability of zzso to stimulate focal zzso assembly and the migration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso and was found to be an important component of focal zzso zzso zzso of zzso by the dominant interfering zzso form, zzso zzso significantly blocked zzso migration and disrupted focal zzso upon zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso induced zzso changes in zzso in a zzso zzso zzso also impaired zzso zzso as observed in zzso zzso transgenic zzso These studies define a mechanism for zzso zzso in focal zzso complex assembly in zzso via zzso of zzso leading to zzso reorganization and zzso zzso
