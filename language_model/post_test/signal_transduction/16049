The zzso drivers of zzso zzso and zzso breast zzso are largely zzso zzso evidence now links zzso signaling by the zzso growth factor receptors zzso to the development of multiple cancer zzso Here, we examined the role of zzso signaling in zzso breast zzso 

We examined the sensitivity of a panel of 31 breast cancer cell lines to the selective zzso inhibitor zzso and investigated the potential mechanisms underlying zzso 

zzso breast cancer cell lines were more sensitive to zzso than zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso cell lines showing significantly reduced zzso The majority of zzso cell lines showed only modest sensitivity to zzso zzso in two-dimensional growth but were highly sensitive in zzso zzso zzso inhibited downstream zzso protein zzso and zzso signaling and induced zzso arrest and zzso zzso breast cancer cell lines were found to express zzso zzso zzso zzso and, similarly, zzso of zzso breast zzso expressed zzso as assessed by zzso compared with zzso of zzso breast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interference targeting of zzso in zzso cell lines significantly reduced growth in zzso and reduced down stream zzso suggesting an zzso zzso signaling zzso Treatment with zzso significantly reduced the growth of zzso zzso breast cancer cell line zzso in zzso 

zzso breast cancer cell lines, and breast zzso express zzso zzso and show sensitivity to zzso zzso identifying a potential novel therapeutic approach for these zzso
