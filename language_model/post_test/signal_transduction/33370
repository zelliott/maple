In this study, we have developed several Chinese zzso zzso zzso cell clones zzso expressing various deletion zzso forms of the rabbit zzso zzso zzso to better define the zzso of the zzso involved in zzso zzso interaction, zzso zzso and to assess the role of zzso zzso of the zzso in signal zzso We observed that the box 1 region of the zzso was critical for productive interaction with zzso and its zzso zzso after zzso zzso However, this region appeared to require the presence of additional zzso domain zzso such as box 2, to exert its complete zzso In addition, we found that a zzso form lacking the 141 zzso zzso lost the capacity to be zzso zzso in response to zzso but remained able to activate zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor, indicating that it contained the minimal sequence required for zzso zzso The absence of zzso zzso of this zzso zzso zzso upon zzso stimulation indicated that the zzso of the zzso normally zzso in the last 141 zzso acids zzso containing three zzso and was not absolutely necessary for induction of these early events in zzso signal zzso zzso cell lines expressing wild type zzso zzso and this zzso zzso form were able to induce zzso activity upon zzso stimulation when zzso zzso with the zzso promoter, containing zzso recognition sites, fused to the zzso reporter zzso The comparison between zzso activity of these two zzso forms leads to the conclusion that the zzso region of the zzso containing the zzso sites for zzso zzso is probably responsible for an amplification of the zzso signal to milk protein zzso
