Human induced zzso stem cell zzso zzso possesses enormous potential in stem cell research and disease zzso Chemical and mechanical signaling has been implicated in the maintenance of zzso of zzso as well as their differentiation pathways toward various zzso zzso zzso have been shown to play a critical role in zzso signaling across a wide spectrum of cell zzso The functions of primary zzso in zzso and their characteristic changes during the zzso process remain largely zzso This work focused on understanding how zzso affects the mechanical characteristics of primary zzso Using zzso imaging zzso we validated the presence of primary zzso on zzso zzso These zzso cells had high expression levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso shown by quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso We also found high expression of zzso signaling proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso resulted in the concerted movement of zzso out of the zzso and zzso into the zzso zzso that the zzso on zzso contain functioning zzso zzso The mean length of primary zzso in zzso cells was shorter than those of parental human zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso resulted in an increase in the zzso of primary zzso from zzso to zzso indicating an underlying approximately fourfold decrease in their zzso and a decrease in length of primary zzso from zzso to zzso Furthermore, zzso resulted in fewer primary zzso displaying zzso zzso
