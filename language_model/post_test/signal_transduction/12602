zzso zzso a zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso has been approved for the management of advanced zzso cell lung zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate whether zzso exerts potent zzso activities through the zzso oxygen species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the human zzso cell lung cancer cell line zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso produced a decline in cell viability of zzso cells and induced cell zzso coupled with quick zzso of zzso In addition, zzso increased the respiratory control ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso generation, suggesting that zzso induced zzso production in zzso cells from both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso with the zzso probe and western zzso analysis indicated that zzso induced loss of zzso membrane potential, the release of zzso c and zzso factor zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The results of the present study suggest that zzso has potent zzso activity in zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso cell zzso These findings provide a novel insight into the mechanism of action of zzso in the treatment of human zzso cell lung cancer in addition to its effects in zzso zzso
