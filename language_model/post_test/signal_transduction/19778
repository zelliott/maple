An understanding of how animal size is controlled requires knowledge of how positive and negative growth regulatory signals are balanced and integrated within zzso Here we demonstrate that the activities of the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and the zzso zzso zzso are zzso during growth of zzso zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates the zzso of zzso and that zzso functions as a critical cellular growth zzso of the zzso We demonstrate that in turn, zzso regulates the expression of zzso as a function of its own cellular level, such that high levels of zzso repress zzso expression through both zzso and zzso zzso We propose that the zzso regulatory relationship functionally coordinates the cellular activities of zzso and zzso and provides a mechanism of growth control that regulates organ size and has broad implications for zzso
