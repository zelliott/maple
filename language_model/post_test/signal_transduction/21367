zzso compounds are known to zzso gene transcription, including nuclear factor zzso B zzso in zzso zzso but the molecular effects of zzso in this setting are not zzso The authors used a rat model of surgical acute zzso zzso to test the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso randomized, controlled animal zzso

zzso male zzso zzso 

zzso were zzso by zzso administration of 50 zzso of zzso and randomly allocated into 4 groups zzso zzso 6 zzso sham operation, sham operation with infusion of zzso zzso of zzso unilateral zzso zzso (1 hour, left zzso artery zzso followed by 4 hours of zzso and unilateral zzso zzso with zzso zzso 

zzso samples were used to measure zzso zzso activity with an zzso mobility shift zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was assessed with zzso analysis, and validated with reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso of zzso growth zzso and zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso (not included in the zzso was studied with zzso zzso DNA binding activity was significantly higher zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso Of the 96 genes zzso 75 were induced and another 8 were suppressed completely zzso or greater change v zzso after zzso Treatment with zzso prevented zzso of zzso DNA binding activity zzso zzso zzso and attenuated 72 of 75 zzso genes and 3 of 8 zzso zzso 

Data from this rat model of zzso zzso suggest that the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso inflammation appears to involve zzso of zzso zzso and signal zzso
