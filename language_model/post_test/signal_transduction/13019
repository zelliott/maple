An zzso zzso connects bacteria that live in organized zzso called zzso While the role of the zzso in the regulation of cell behavior has not been extensively examined in bacteria, we suggest that, like zzso cells, the zzso zzso zzso interactions involved with regulation of cohesion, zzso and sensory zzso The zzso zzso of the soil zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso formation and zzso body zzso The zzso material is zzso as long, thin zzso that mediate zzso to surfaces, cohesion to other cells, and zzso by the zzso zzso zzso We report the identification of a putative zzso zinc zzso called zzso zzso protein zzso Western zzso with zzso zzso zzso 2105 suggests extensive zzso processing of zzso during assembly into zzso consistent with the zzso observed with other members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso had no obvious effect on the structure of the zzso and did not inhibit cell cohesion, zzso by zzso zzso or activity of the A- or zzso zzso However, the cells lost the ability to respond to zzso zzso and to form zzso zzso bodies, though substantial zzso was zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was restored by incubation with zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that this zzso is involved in sensory zzso
