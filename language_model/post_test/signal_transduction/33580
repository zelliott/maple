This overview will examine the zzso nature of a group of proteins known as the zzso These zzso proteins were named in the 1960s because of their expected role during development of dental zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso As gene expression zzso became more sensitive, expression was also noted in zzso not involved with zzso formation leading to hypotheses concerning additional roles for these zzso In zzso approaches led to the discovery that some of the zzso are able to regulate gene expression and to participate in cellular zzso An extract containing predominately zzso has been used clinically in treatment of certain forms of zzso disease with zzso results noted originally in animal models, but later in human patients as zzso Much literature has been devoted to the roles of zzso during mineral formation, and therefore this topic will be covered primarily in the zzso The goal of this review will be to focus on strategies that have been used to uncover roles of zzso related to gene expression and development apart from the roles in zzso zzso and the possible functions that these proteins could have if delivered to normally zzso zzso for therapeutic zzso
