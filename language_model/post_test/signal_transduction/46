In the present study, we investigated the effects of the Sonic zzso zzso protein on zzso zzso maturation and early zzso zzso zzso showed zzso of zzso zzso in zzso complexes zzso as reflected by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso cells and zzso cells, particularly those of small zzso zzso zzso in zzso Western zzso analysis showed zzso expression in zzso and in zzso zzso derived from small and medium zzso zzso zzso Small zzso contained the highest concentration of zzso in zzso fluid compared with zzso and large zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso or 1 zzso zzso enhanced zzso maturation compared with the control group zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso This effect was reversed by the simultaneous addition of zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso Similar to intact zzso zzso zzso showed enhanced maturation following zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso B1 content, zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso zzso calcium release, zzso rate and total cell numbers were greater zzso zzso zzso in zzso matured in the presence of zzso and 1 zzso zzso zzso compared with control zzso The findings of the present study provide the first evidence that the zzso zzso zzso is active, or at least partially zzso in the zzso zzso and is likely to promote zzso zzso and nuclear zzso as well as subsequent in zzso development, although the underlying mechanisms remain to be zzso
