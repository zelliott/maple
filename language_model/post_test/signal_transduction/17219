The human zzso pathogen zzso zzso has at least two types of zzso zzso white to opaque cell transitions and zzso to zzso zzso zzso cells have historically not been known to undergo zzso under standard zzso zzso Here we find that zzso and its downstream regulators zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso control opaque cell zzso in zzso We have shown that deletion of zzso zzso zzso and zzso results in opaque cell zzso under standard culture zzso zzso of zzso in white cells has no obvious effect on zzso growth, suggesting that zzso is an zzso regulator of zzso under the conditions zzso Moreover, zzso of the zzso zzso or disruption of its downstream zzso regulators, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in opaque cells of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso a downstream gene of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso completely blocks opaque cell zzso induced by zzso of zzso These results demonstrate that zzso regulated opaque cell zzso is dependent on the zzso zzso This study establishes a link between the zzso switch and the zzso growth transition in zzso
