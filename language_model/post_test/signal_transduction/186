zzso A zzso is the primary zzso for sensing extremely low amounts of light and for zzso various zzso zzso responses in higher zzso zzso from the zzso to the nucleus is an essential step in zzso signal zzso zzso (for zzso IM zzso zzso is an zzso protein that functions as a negative regulator in zzso light signaling downstream of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso To identify factors involved in zzso light signal zzso pools of zzso zzso seeds were screened for zzso that suppress the hypersensitive zzso of the zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso presented here is caused by a zzso zzso in the zzso gene that leads to an zzso acid transition in its zzso zzso zzso The novel zzso zzso alters the spectral sensitivity and the persistence of zzso zzso zzso zzso The strong zzso zzso zzso of zzso contrasts with the moderate zzso observed when zzso is zzso into the zzso background, which indicates that the zzso mainly alters functions in an zzso signaling zzso The zzso specifically zzso nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso upon red light zzso even though it still interacts with zzso (for zzso long zzso 1) and zzso (for zzso zzso two factors that are essential for nuclear zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is zzso even under light conditions that inhibit its nuclear zzso indicating that zzso degradation may occur mostly in the zzso
