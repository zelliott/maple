zzso II zzso plays a critical role in cardiac zzso and promotes cardiac zzso zzso zzso a negative regulator of muscle growth, is increased in zzso and zzso zzso The direct effect of zzso on cardiac zzso myostatin expression has not been previously zzso We hypothesized that myostatin may act as a cardiac zzso inhibitor for zzso zzso myostatin protein expression in cultured rat zzso zzso was zzso zzso significantly increased myostatin protein and zzso expression in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso 30 zzso before zzso stimulation significantly blocked the increase of myostatin protein by zzso zzso significantly increased zzso of zzso while zzso and zzso attenuated the zzso of zzso induced by zzso zzso increased, while zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso enhance factor 2 zzso zzso abolished the myostatin promoter zzso zzso with myostatin and zzso significantly inhibited the protein synthesis induced by zzso In conclusion, zzso enhances myostatin expression in cultured rat zzso zzso The zzso myostatin is zzso through zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
