Many zzso receptors zzso zzso the activity of multiple zzso Yet, despite this apparent zzso signaling in the context of differentiated cells is often highly zzso This specificity is attributable to the formation of zzso signaling complexes that are held together by scaffolding zzso many of which contain one or more zzso zzso zzso the set of potential interactions among zzso other signaling molecules and these scaffolding proteins is essential for understanding zzso signaling zzso A recent article describes an elegantly simple zzso array that can identify potential interacting partners of zzso and other signaling zzso
