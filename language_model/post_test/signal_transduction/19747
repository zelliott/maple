Exposure to higher levels of zzso produces zzso zzso that can stimulate zzso zzso zzso of zzso factor 2 zzso detoxifying zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is considered an important mechanism of protection against zzso zzso because they would facilitate removal of toxic zzso Here, we studied the impact of zzso zzso signaling on zzso gene zzso In zzso zzso experiments using the zzso region of the human zzso gene promoter, we observe that zzso zzso domain zzso is required for zzso zzso of zzso promoter activity in zzso breast cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that zzso recruits zzso and a class III zzso zzso zzso at the zzso promoter, leading to zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression by the zzso zzso reverses the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso As a consequence, a zzso study was undertaken to monitor the impact of zzso on DNA zzso and tumor zzso Treatment of zzso breast cancer cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a marker of DNA zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso tumor formation, and zzso zzso zzso tumor growth in an zzso manner in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso signaling zzso has an zzso effect on zzso zzso Moreover, zzso reverses the zzso effects of zzso on this zzso and may contribute to breast cancer zzso
