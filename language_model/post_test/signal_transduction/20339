The zzso zzso that occurs after cerebral zzso increases blood flow to the injured area and limits extension of the zzso zzso In this way, it improves the local blood zzso zzso zzso zzso is an effective treatment for zzso cerebrovascular zzso However, zzso in the adult zzso is a complex, zzso process, and the mechanisms underlying the regulation of zzso are not well zzso Although zzso signaling reportedly regulates the zzso process that occurs in zzso zzso little is known about the role of zzso signaling in the regulation of zzso zzso after zzso zzso Recent research has indicated that zzso a zzso zzso plays a crucial role in regulating the biological processes that occur in blood vessel zzso cells under hypoxic zzso This study was undertaken to investigate the role of zzso in regulating zzso in response to brain zzso injury and the role of the zzso zzso in the body's zzso We found zzso to be significantly zzso in adult rat zzso brain zzso in which the expression of zzso signaling molecules was also zzso zzso models of human zzso vein zzso cells zzso were used to assess changes in zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso were consistent with in zzso zzso To determine the molecular mechanisms behind these phenomena, we zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso caused zzso of zzso signaling molecules and induced zzso cells to migrate and form zzso structures on zzso These data suggest that zzso is involved in the regulation of zzso in response to zzso injury to the zzso zzso of zzso can activate the zzso signaling pathway, which may contribute to zzso after cerebral zzso
