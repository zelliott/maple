Most rapid zzso synaptic signaling in the brain is zzso by zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso that are gated open by the neurotransmitter zzso In zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein that is required for currents that are zzso by the zzso zzso zzso in zzso do not affect zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso or stabilization at zzso suggesting that zzso is required for zzso zzso Here, we provide evidence that zzso is an auxiliary zzso that zzso the gating of zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso of zzso with altered gating partially restore zzso current and zzso behaviors in zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso indicates that zzso zzso domain 3 is required for function and that a zzso zzso partially restores zzso currents and zzso Also, we show that zzso zzso synaptic currents are absent in zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso are not simply zzso molecules and require the zzso auxiliary protein to promote the open state of the zzso Our analysis presents the possibility that zzso signaling in other organisms may be similarly modified by zzso zzso zzso
