zzso zzso is associated with a wide range of neurodegenerative disorders and also seems to be involved in the pathology of zzso disorders such as multiple sclerosis zzso zzso toxic zzso shows clear characteristics of zzso such as zzso and zzso damage without the involvement of the innate immune zzso In this study, we have evaluated zzso signaling during zzso zzso in the white and gray matter of mouse brain by studying the expression of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso by zzso gene array analysis, followed by real-time zzso and western zzso zzso Cellular zzso of zzso zzso was investigated by zzso zzso zzso Comparing white and gray matter areas, the expression of zzso receptors was zzso Among zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in the zzso corpus zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso gray zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso was increased in both zzso zzso and zzso cortex, whereas zzso zzso was zzso only in zzso Our data indicate that zzso treatment affects zzso and zzso differently in gray and white matter brain areas revealing particularly regulation of zzso and zzso compared with other zzso This might have an important influence on zzso selective sensitivity to zzso compounds and the progression of zzso as has been reported for zzso and other zzso neurological zzso
