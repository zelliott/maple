In this paper, we use singular zzso methods to study the structure of travelling waves for some zzso models obtained from the zzso and zzso models of zzso zzso in zzso zzso As a consequence, we derive zzso zzso for quantities like wave speed, maximum concentration and other zzso in terms of the different zzso zzso that appear in the zzso
