In this report we characterize the mechanism of zzso zzso D1 gene expression in mouse embryonic zzso zzso zzso strongly zzso zzso D1 gene zzso but did not alter the zzso of zzso D1 zzso zzso of zzso signaling with the zzso zzso blocked the zzso expression of zzso D1 zzso and this effect was selective since zzso zzso D1 zzso induction was minimally affected by zzso zzso However, we found that zzso activity in this system was induced by serum and not by activated zzso Moreover, mouse zzso D1 zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso D1 gene expression without zzso zzso and that an essential zzso promoter element is located far upstream or downstream of the zzso D1 zzso start zzso We conclude that, in zzso zzso induction of zzso D1 zzso requires zzso of a parallel zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso D1 zzso independent of zzso
