Rapid advances have been made in our knowledge of the zzso genetic and zzso zzso found in human sporadic zzso zzso recent contributions came from analyses of gene copy number by comparative zzso zzso and from large-scale gene expression zzso All of the zzso affected genes zzso regulatory zzso zzso with established importance in melanoma, like zzso zzso and zzso have been joined by some less familiar genes including zzso factor sequences zzso and zzso zzso This knowledge is reviewed in relation to the cellular signaling pathways affected by these zzso their biological zzso and the implications as to what changes are required overall to generate a zzso The data support a model in which genesis of melanoma requires changes that zzso initiate zzso expansion, zzso overcome cell zzso and zzso reduce zzso
