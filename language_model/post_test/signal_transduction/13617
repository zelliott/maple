zzso zzso channel zzso activity, which determines the rate of zzso zzso zzso can be regulated by G zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso downstream zzso has been studied zzso but the effect of zzso zzso on zzso is zzso A6 cells zzso contain high levels of zzso but low levels of zzso zzso and zzso were detected by zzso We tested zzso combined individually with zzso through zzso expressed in A6 cells, after which we recorded single-channel zzso zzso Among the five zzso and zzso combinations, zzso strongly zzso zzso activity by reducing both zzso channel number zzso and open probability zzso compared with control zzso In contrast, the other four zzso combined with zzso have no significant effect on zzso zzso By using various zzso to probe zzso effects on zzso regulation, we found that zzso zzso zzso involved zzso of zzso zzso and its zzso products that induce protein zzso C and zzso signaling zzso
