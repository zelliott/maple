Recent data suggest that zzso zzso and zzso complexes are actively involved in signal zzso Miller and Lefkowitz discuss evidence from the zzso visual system that suggests that zzso zzso and zzso complexes induce zzso zzso with activated zzso G zzso zzso and zzso complexes point to a mechanism by which zzso or zzso signals can be zzso largely independent from G protein zzso
