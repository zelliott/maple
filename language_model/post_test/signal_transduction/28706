Signaling through the highly zzso zzso zzso plays a crucial role in a diverse array of zzso zzso many of which depend upon the precise regulation of zzso signaling zzso Recent evidence has indicated that the zzso trafficking of zzso signaling components can result in significant changes in the level of zzso Here, we examine three mechanisms through which zzso trafficking might regulate zzso zzso degradation of zzso its transport and the zzso of its zzso The zzso trafficking of several zzso signaling zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as the functional implications of protein zzso on zzso zzso will be zzso
