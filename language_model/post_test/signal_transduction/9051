zzso is a zzso drug whose zzso is key to its therapeutic and side zzso zzso mainly due to zzso zzso injury, poses its most important therapeutic zzso zzso necrosis is derived from zzso cell death by zzso and necrosis in the zzso and zzso zzso The mode of cell death has been related to drug zzso with necrosis occurring with high zzso and zzso with lower zzso To fully understand the toxic effects of zzso to potentially improve its zzso profile, it is necessary to unravel the cellular events and signaling pathways implicated in the appearance of both modes of cell zzso We used cultured human zzso and zzso zzso cells to investigate the zzso and zzso characteristics of the death mode induced by increasing zzso of zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso of zzso early activate the zzso machinery, which is in turn directly blocked by zzso at the level of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a death zzso lacking some typical characteristics of this process, which more closely resembles zzso Furthermore, unidentified zzso and zzso pathways are induced by zzso and not by zzso zzso of zzso zzso cell necrosis is the result of an aborted zzso at the level of zzso zzso Yet, zzso effects lead to cell death, which may pose potential targets for pharmacological intervention aimed at reducing zzso zzso
