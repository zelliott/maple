The zzso switch is a promising therapeutic target in zzso Work by our laboratory and others has described an important zzso zzso zzso zzso by interactions of zzso a zzso on zzso zzso cells, with proteins containing zzso zzso type I repeat zzso zzso Recent studies revealed that circulating zzso Rich zzso zzso zzso the zzso potential of the zzso zzso by functioning as a decoy zzso that binds and sequesters zzso zzso As tumors of different origin display variable expression profiles of numerous targets, we hypothesized that the zzso axis regulates zzso and growth in the tumor zzso in a context, or tumor type, dependent zzso Growth of Lewis Lung Carcinoma zzso and zzso zzso tumor cell implants in zzso wild type zzso zzso or zzso zzso mice were used as a model to interrogate this signaling zzso zzso tumor volumes were greater in zzso zzso mice and smaller in zzso zzso mice compared to zzso zzso zzso showed increased zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No differences in tumor growth or zzso were observed with zzso zzso consistent with lack of expression of zzso in zzso zzso When zzso expression was induced in zzso cells by zzso zzso tumor growth and zzso were similar to that seen with zzso zzso These data show a role for zzso zzso activity in the tumor zzso when zzso proteins are available and demonstrate that zzso zzso this zzso Further, they suggest a mechanism by which tumor zzso may regulate sensitivity to zzso containing zzso
