zzso zzso zzso of smooth muscle requires discrete coordination of many signal zzso events from the plasma membrane to the zzso zzso of key factors to the plasma membrane is thought to be crucial for zzso of zzso signals leading to zzso We investigated, therefore, for the first time in intact differentiated smooth muscle cells, the zzso of three molecules important for zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We also directly confirmed, by single cell force zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso scanning zzso zzso zzso of central smooth muscle cell sections determined that, at rest, zzso zzso and zzso were distributed predominantly throughout the zzso zzso stimulation resulted in significant zzso of each protein to the cell zzso By digital image analysis, zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were calculated as, respectively, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at rest, increasing significantly following stimulation to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso It is proposed that this zzso recruitment to the cell periphery of the downstream signaling molecules zzso zzso and zzso contributes to the efficacy of zzso zzso zzso of smooth zzso
