zzso mediates the zzso effects of zzso and zzso hormones in zzso cells and zzso zzso Although the zzso of zzso activity is known to decrease the zzso mass, it is still unknown what factors zzso alter the zzso signaling zzso in zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso occurring in chronic zzso are not caused by simple zzso of zzso activity but rather by the persistent zzso of zzso due to decreases in protein zzso zzso When freshly isolated rat pancreatic zzso were chronically exposed to 25 zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity was reduced with a zzso increase in active zzso zzso challenges with 15 zzso zzso or 30 zzso zzso after 2 hour zzso further increased the level of zzso and consequently induced the persistent expression of zzso The excessively produced zzso was sufficient to repress the zzso of zzso insulin, and zzso zzso In contrast, when zzso were grown in 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso activated in response to zzso or zzso zzso Thus, zzso expression was transient and insufficient to repress those target zzso zzso zzso of zzso reversed the adverse effects of chronic zzso and successfully restored the transient zzso of zzso and zzso zzso depletion of zzso with zzso was sufficient to disrupt the negative feedback regulation of zzso and induce zzso zzso even under low zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the failure of the negative feedback regulation of zzso is the primary cause for zzso zzso under conditions of zzso zzso and zzso can be a novel target for future therapies aiming to protect zzso mass in the late transitional phase of zzso dependent type 2 diabetes zzso
