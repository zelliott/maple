Heart failure zzso is characterized by molecular and cellular defects which jointly contribute to decreased cardiac pump zzso During the development of the initial cardiac damage which leads to zzso zzso responses activate zzso zzso to overcome depressed cardiac function and to maintain blood supply to vital zzso in demand of zzso However, during the chronic course of most zzso zzso these zzso mechanisms are sustained beyond months and contribute to progressive zzso zzso of the heart which is associated with a worse zzso Of zzso significance are mechanisms which directly control cardiac zzso function including zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso signaling zzso of stress adaptation such as zzso calcium zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso become zzso in zzso directly contributing to adverse cardiac zzso and depression of zzso and zzso zzso Here, we provide an update about zzso and zzso dependent signaling changes in zzso how these changes affect cardiac function, and novel therapeutic strategies which directly address the signaling zzso
