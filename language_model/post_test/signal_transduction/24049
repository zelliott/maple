zzso zzso zzso zzso was first described as a signal zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and was later implicated in signal zzso of other members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the meantime, four different zzso molecules have been zzso two active zzso zzso and zzso and two inactive zzso zzso and zzso All zzso mediate zzso of nuclear zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Although earlier observations suggested that zzso have redundant functions, this hypothesis is now challenged by knockout zzso Furthermore, recent data imply a role for zzso in tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways as zzso The scope of this review is to highlight the specific role of different zzso and to discuss several mechanisms that contribute to their zzso and zzso
