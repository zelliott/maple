Numerous zzso bacteria communicate and regulate gene expression through a cell zzso mechanism termed zzso sensing zzso which involves the synthesis and perception of zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study we genetically and zzso characterized the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso revealed the presence of at least three AHL zzso zzso and five zzso regulators belonging to the zzso family of zzso Mass zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene prevented zzso of zzso in culture zzso enhanced zzso of sheep zzso increased zzso production, and altered colony zzso on swarming and twitching zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso of zzso and increased zzso production and zzso whereas zzso of the zzso zzso zzso eliminated zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso fully restored the synthesis of zzso and zzso to parental zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso regulators had no effect on AHL zzso enhanced zzso production, and resulted in extensive zzso on sheep blood zzso zzso Furthermore, interruption of the zzso zzso and zzso genes altered colony zzso on twitching and swarming zzso plates and induced zzso Additionally, zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso in zzso zzso both positively and zzso affects the metabolism of numerous zzso including zzso acid, zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso acid, and zzso These results demonstrate that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso system affects various cellular zzso including zzso production, swarming and twitching zzso zzso of sheep zzso and carbon metabolism and/or zzso
