zzso production of zzso oxygen species zzso is frequently observed in cancer and is known to strongly influence zzso cell zzso Here we report that zzso zzso production is strongly elevated zzso zzso in zzso of acute zzso leukemia zzso patients and that this increase is attributable to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, overproduction of zzso zzso was rarely zzso zzso zzso was found to be associated with lowered zzso levels and depletion of zzso defense zzso We also show for the first time that the levels of zzso generated were able to strongly promote the proliferation of zzso cell lines, primary zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, normal zzso cells, and that the response to zzso is limited by the zzso of the zzso stress zzso zzso though zzso zzso with this, we observed that zzso responses were attenuated in patients expressing high levels of zzso These data show that overproduction of zzso zzso can promote the proliferation of zzso blasts and that they also develop mechanisms to suppress the stress signaling that would normally limit this zzso Together these adaptations would be predicted to zzso a competitive advantage to the zzso zzso
