zzso heart failure continues to impose a substantial health-care burden, despite recent treatment zzso The key zzso process that ultimately leads to chronic heart failure is cardiac zzso in response to chronic disease zzso Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms that play a part in the complex zzso process, with a focus on key molecules and pathways that might be suitable targets for therapeutic zzso Such pathways include those that regulate cardiac zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso and cell survival, and processes that take place outside the cardiac zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso We also discuss major gaps in our current understanding, take a critical look at conventional approaches to target discovery that have been used to date, and consider new zzso avenues that might accelerate clinically relevant zzso
