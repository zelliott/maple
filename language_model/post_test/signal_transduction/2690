The diverse zzso effects of zzso are zzso by a family of cell surface receptors that bind zzso selectively and with high zzso The zzso receptors are members of the seven zzso segment zzso zzso and molecular cloning studies have identified five types, designated zzso The human zzso receptors vary in size from 364 zzso to zzso zzso zzso acids with zzso zzso acid identity between zzso and 105 zzso acids are zzso The sequences of the seven putative zzso zzso zzso are more highly zzso than those of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Two forms of zzso have been identified in the zzso zzso and zzso which differ in size and sequence of the zzso zzso zzso These two forms of zzso are products of a common gene and are generated by alternative zzso with zzso and zzso being the products of the zzso and spliced forms, respectively, of zzso zzso Thus, functional diversity within the zzso zzso family may result from the expression of multiple types as well as from alternative zzso The five zzso receptors have distinct patterns of expression in the central nervous system and peripheral zzso They have also been expressed in zzso and shown to have different pharmacological zzso zzso zzso selective for zzso zzso and zzso have been identified which will facilitate in zzso studies of the functions of these zzso zzso Such studies to date suggest that zzso mediates zzso of growth hormone zzso and zzso mediates zzso of insulin zzso The molecular cloning and functional characterization of the zzso zzso family is a first step in zzso the diverse effects of zzso on cellular zzso
