zzso zzso zzso invasion of zzso cells into the collagen zzso The mechanisms of the zzso stimulation of zzso was further investigated by examining cell zzso and zzso activity of tumor cells, using mainly an zzso cell line zzso and normal zzso from zzso zzso zzso medium from the zzso grown in zzso medium was zzso on a zzso 200 zzso column, and Peak 1 zzso at 200 to 300 zzso and Peak 2 zzso at 50 to 100 zzso were found to contain different specific zzso Treatment of zzso cells with Peak 1 resulted in an increase in the production of zzso zzso Peak 2 zzso both zzso and zzso of zzso zzso A zzso factor was zzso from the zzso fraction of Peak 2 by zzso exchange and zzso zzso and was named zzso zzso factor zzso At 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells by zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso of the zzso properties of zzso suggested that it might be different from any known zzso zzso Exposure of zzso cells to zzso resulted in reduced amounts of zzso stress fiber in the zzso and induction of zzso zzso of several cellular proteins zzso 30 to 60 zzso after zzso These zzso changes were blocked by zzso either with zzso or with zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso may be a novel protein which stimulates cell zzso via a signaling zzso zzso by a zzso G protein and zzso zzso
