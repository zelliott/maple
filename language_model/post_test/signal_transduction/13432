zzso are a zzso of zzso zzso proteins that can be found in both zzso and the zzso Among the three known zzso members, zzso 1 has been linked to a genetic skin disorder and shown to play important roles in zzso assembly and zzso However, little is known about the binding partners and functions of the most widely expressed member, zzso zzso To better understand the cellular functions of zzso 2, we have examined its protein interactions with other zzso molecules using zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso 2 can interact directly with several zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2, and zzso zzso and zzso The head domain of zzso 2 is critical for most of these interactions and is sufficient to direct zzso 2 to cell zzso In addition, zzso 2 is less efficient than zzso 1 in zzso to the nucleus and enhancing the recruitment of excess zzso to cell borders in zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso 2 is able to associate with zzso through its head domain, and the expression of zzso 2 in zzso cells zzso the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso This zzso by zzso 2 is abolished by zzso expression of zzso suggesting that these proteins compete for the same pool of signaling active zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso 2 interacts with a broader repertoire of zzso components than zzso 1 and provide new insight into the possible roles of zzso 2 in regulating the signaling activity of zzso
