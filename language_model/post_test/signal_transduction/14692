We investigated the effects of advanced zzso end products zzso which accumulate in zzso cartilage with age in human zzso zzso We found zzso significantly increased zzso zzso and zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso were reversed by treatment with specific zzso zzso zzso suggesting zzso and zzso are involved in zzso zzso and zzso We also observed that zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso with soluble zzso for zzso zzso also reduced zzso zzso and zzso implicating the involvement of zzso for zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso of zzso may have a role in the development of zzso by increasing zzso zzso and zzso and zzso
