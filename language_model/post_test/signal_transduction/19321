Many zzso are known to exert cancer zzso activity by eliminating chemical zzso or toxic zzso through the action of zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the cancer zzso effects of zzso isolated from zzso zzso These zzso significantly induced zzso zzso zzso activity in mouse zzso zzso cells, and showed a relatively high zzso index zzso divided zzso value with CD zzso The zzso also significantly induced zzso zzso of zzso in zzso alkaline zzso zzso cells, which is a stable cell line containing the intact promoter region of zzso In order to determine if zzso of zzso by the zzso was zzso through a zzso or zzso zzso we examined the nuclear zzso zzso factor zzso response element zzso and zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso response element zzso zzso which are two major zzso involved in regulation of Phase I and/or Phase II zzso zzso The zzso increased the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein levels in human zzso cancer zzso cells and also increased the zzso zzso and protein levels in zzso cells through ARE and zzso zzso which resulted from zzso of zzso and zzso into the zzso These results suggest that regulation of zzso by the zzso was due to zzso induction through the zzso and zzso zzso Thus, these zzso as zzso zzso of zzso have potential as cancer zzso zzso
