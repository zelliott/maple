Similar to other organisms, zzso uses its zzso Growth Factor zzso zzso multiple times throughout zzso One crucial zzso event is patterning of the zzso zzso during zzso In addition to providing zzso cues necessary for body axes zzso patterning of the zzso cells zzso the formation of two respiratory eggshell zzso Each zzso is derived from a zzso zzso a patch of cells expressing broad zzso and an adjacent stripe of cells expressing zzso zzso Several mechanisms of eggshell patterning have been proposed in the past, but none of them can explain the highly coordinated expression of br and zzso To address some of the outstanding issues in this system, we zzso the existing information into a revised mathematical model of zzso cell zzso Based on the zzso model analysis, we propose that zzso zzso zzso are established by sequential action of zzso zzso and zzso signals activated by the zzso of zzso zzso The model describes pattern formation in a large number of zzso and points to several unanswered questions related to the dynamic interaction of the zzso and zzso zzso
