zzso protective pathways mitigate the zzso of inflammation after sterile or infectious zzso Here we report that zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso mice display a major zzso with exacerbated vascular inflammation observed zzso zzso zzso injury of the zzso artery, characterized by marked zzso zzso and zzso as zzso by zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso for zzso revealed that zzso A4 zzso was generated by zzso zzso during zzso this cellular response was attenuated in zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were lower after 30 minutes' zzso and associated with zzso vascular inflammation in the zzso zzso minutes) zzso zzso delivery of zzso attenuated zzso inflammation in zzso but not zzso zzso conversely, an zzso zzso skewed the vascular zzso of zzso mice to that of zzso zzso Such zzso circuit could be activated by aspirin zzso zzso which triggered formation of zzso in zzso mice, yet it was effective in zzso zzso In zzso we propose that during zzso zzso zzso controls zzso zzso with the rapid generation of circulating zzso which in turn zzso downstream vascular inflammatory responses evident during the zzso zzso
