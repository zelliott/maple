zzso receptors zzso are expressed in the zzso zzso where they detect zzso but also in other zzso with additional zzso Some zzso are even zzso in tumor zzso In this study, we identified zzso expressed in zzso tumor cells by zzso showing that single cells can zzso several zzso Some of the receptors identified were already reported in other tumors, but they are orphan (without known zzso as it is the case for most of the hundreds of human zzso Thus, genes coding for human zzso with known zzso were zzso into these cells, expressing functional zzso zzso The in zzso stimulation of these cells by the corresponding OR zzso zzso promoted cell invasion of collagen zzso Using zzso prostate cancer cells, the stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso G zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso by zzso its zzso zzso resulted in the same zzso zzso We also showed the involvement of a zzso zzso zzso dependent signaling zzso in this promotion of tumor cell zzso triggered by OR zzso Finally, after subcutaneous zzso of zzso cells into zzso zzso mice, the in zzso stimulation of these cells by the zzso zzso zzso significantly enhanced zzso emergence and zzso
