Vitamin A can significantly decrease zzso morbidity and zzso Vitamin A can inhibit the replication of zzso virus zzso in zzso through an zzso and type I zzso zzso zzso zzso gene I zzso expression is induced by zzso activated by zzso zzso and is important for zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso is central to zzso zzso of zzso in zzso We demonstrate that zzso expression is increased in cells treated with zzso and infected with zzso The central role of zzso in the zzso effect was demonstrated in the zzso zzso the latter cells having zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling was required for the induction of zzso by zzso and zzso zzso signaling was also found to act in combination with zzso to induce high levels of zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso required both zzso and zzso as indicated by markers of active zzso zzso is known to be regulated by zzso and zzso but we found recruitment of zzso to the zzso promoter by zzso zzso Using zzso expression zzso we further demonstrated that the zzso response element of zzso was required for zzso zzso by zzso or zzso These results reveal that zzso treatment and zzso infection zzso significant zzso zzso is required for the zzso zzso zzso The induction is dependent on zzso zzso and zzso
