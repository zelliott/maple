Time series expression experiments are an increasingly popular method for studying a wide range of biological zzso However, when analyzing these experiments researchers face many new zzso zzso zzso that are specifically designed for time series experiments are required so that we can take advantage of their unique features (such as the ability to zzso causality from the zzso response zzso and address the unique problems they raise zzso handling the different zzso sampling zzso 

We present a comprehensive review of the current research in time series expression data zzso We divide the zzso challenges into four analysis zzso experimental design, data analysis, pattern recognition and zzso For each of these levels, we discuss zzso and biological problems at that level and point out some of the methods that have been proposed to deal with these zzso Many open problems in all these levels are zzso This review is intended to serve as both, a point of reference for experimental biologists looking for practical solutions for analyzing their data, and a starting point for computer scientists interested in working on the zzso problems related to time series expression zzso
