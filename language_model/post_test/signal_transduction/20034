zzso a regulatory zzso of zzso zzso promotes cell cycle progression by interacting with cell cycle zzso such as zzso protein zzso via its unique zzso 24 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso specifically zzso these interactions and leads to cell cycle zzso zzso we describe the generation of a fusion protein zzso zzso protein zzso that contains the protein zzso domain and zzso and examined its effects on the proliferation and differentiation of leukemia zzso zzso not only blocks cell proliferation but remarkably zzso differentiation of leukemia cells in zzso and in zzso zzso administered zzso also significantly decreases growth of leukemia cell tumors in animal zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso in leukemia cells leads to increased zzso however, zzso blocks this effect and zzso zzso zzso There is significant zzso of zzso zzso and protein expression in leukemia cells from zzso zzso zzso cell cycle progression and zzso differentiation of bone zzso cells derived from patients with several different types of zzso These results show that zzso zzso zzso zzso leukemia cell differentiation and suggest that zzso may be a novel drug target for the treatment of zzso zzso
