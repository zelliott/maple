It has been well known for zzso years that systemic blood vessels zzso in response to decreases in oxygen tension zzso low zzso and this response appears to be critical to supply blood to the stressed zzso zzso pulmonary vessels zzso to a decrease in zzso zzso to maintain a balance in the zzso zzso Currently, although little question exists that the zzso affects vascular zzso and vascular smooth muscle cells zzso act as oxygen sensors, the molecular mechanisms involved in modulating the vascular zzso are still not clearly zzso Many laboratories, including zzso have suggested that the zzso calcium concentration zzso which regulates zzso function, is controlled by free zzso and zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso In this review article, therefore, we discuss the implications of zzso and zzso zzso seen in pulmonary and systemic hypertension, and how key targets that control zzso such as zzso channels, zzso release from internal stores and zzso by the zzso zzso and the zzso sensitivity to the zzso are regulated by changes in zzso zzso and zzso associated with vascular zzso in zzso or zzso zzso
