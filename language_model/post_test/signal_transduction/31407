As an alternative to zzso zzso drug discovery, we report a strategy that identifies compounds on the basis of the state that they induce in a signaling zzso zzso human cells are grown in zzso plates and treated with compounds from a zzso zzso The target network is then activated and zzso derived from each sample are arrayed onto zzso zzso zzso By probing these zzso with zzso that report on the abundance or zzso state of selected zzso a global picture of the target network is zzso As proof of concept, we screened 84 zzso and zzso zzso for their ability to induce different states in the zzso signaling zzso We observed functional connections between proteins that match our understanding of zzso zzso indicating that zzso screens can be used to define the zzso of signaling zzso Additionally, compounds sort according to the zzso zzso they zzso suggesting that zzso screens may inform efforts to identify the targets of biologically active small zzso
