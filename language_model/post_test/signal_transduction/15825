zzso an zzso zzso zzso has been reported recently to act as a selective breast cancer stem cell zzso but the zzso basis for its zzso effects is not zzso The zzso signal zzso zzso plays a central role in stem cell development, and its zzso zzso can cause zzso In this study, we identified zzso as a potent inhibitor of the zzso signaling zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso blocked the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso related protein 6 zzso and induced its zzso zzso another zzso zzso with activity against cancer stem cells, exerted similar zzso In otherwise zzso chronic zzso leukemia cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the expression of zzso target genes such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso depressed zzso levels, and limited cell zzso zzso human peripheral blood zzso resisted zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso changes induced by zzso and related drugs inhibit zzso zzso signaling by interfering with zzso zzso and thus impair the survival of cells that depend on zzso signaling at the plasma zzso
