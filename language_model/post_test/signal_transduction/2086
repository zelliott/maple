zzso is a vitally important zzso zzso controlling cell fate determination and pattern formation in numerous ways during development of both zzso and zzso zzso An intriguing zzso for the zzso signal has emerged where, after zzso zzso an zzso zzso of the zzso itself zzso to the nucleus to regulate gene zzso The nuclear activity of the zzso zzso domain is linked to complexes regulating zzso organization through zzso zzso and zzso To allow the zzso signal to be deployed in numerous zzso many different mechanisms have evolved to regulate the level, duration and spatial distribution of zzso zzso zzso occurs at multiple levels including patterns of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso trafficking of the zzso and zzso and zzso modifications including zzso zzso and zzso Several zzso regulatory proteins have zzso zzso that link them to the zzso pathway, and zzso of the zzso zzso domain has recently been linked to its zzso Different zzso derived zzso of zzso have also been identified that may be involved in alternative zzso signals or regulatory mechanisms, and differences between the four zzso zzso zzso are beginning to be zzso
