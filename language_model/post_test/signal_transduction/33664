The discovery of zzso approximately zzso zzso in zzso cells and mouse hearts led us to examine zzso II type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso is novel, especially in the zzso system, since zzso and/or zzso zzso of zzso zzso are zzso We used a strategy to retrieve zzso zzso of zzso 1 to confirm direct interaction of fragments with this G zzso zzso and determine zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso complex is associated with full-length and approximately zzso zzso zzso Mass zzso analysis of the zzso short form suggested a zzso site located within the zzso region in the bovine zzso zzso zzso degradation analysis of a zzso 1 zzso zzso fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein confirmed the major zzso to be after zzso and a minor zzso after zzso Rather unexpectedly, the inverse zzso zzso zzso generated different fragmentation of bovine zzso 1, at zzso The zzso zzso zzso is independent of zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso The zzso of zzso 2 occurs, but the pattern is more zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso upon zzso stimulation is a part of the unraveling zzso G zzso zzso signaling zzso
