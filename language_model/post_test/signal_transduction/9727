zzso cells that cover the zzso zzso surface maintain immune zzso and tolerance in the gastrointestinal zzso However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate zzso immune zzso zzso cells are distinct in that they are highly zzso this polarity is, at least in part, established by the zzso polarized sorting factor zzso protein zzso We investigated the role of zzso protein sorting in the maintenance of gastrointestinal immune zzso 

The role of zzso in zzso immunity was examined in zzso mice zzso by monitoring their zzso zzso zzso and zzso barrier zzso zzso protein sorting was examined in polarized zzso cells from zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso mice developed spontaneous chronic zzso characterized by zzso of zzso zzso 17 zzso zzso of zzso caused zzso immune dysfunction, such as reduced expression of zzso proteins and impaired zzso of zzso zzso These defects promoted zzso zzso and increased bacterial zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso led to zzso of a subset of zzso zzso receptors to the zzso plasma membrane in a polarized zzso cell line and in zzso zzso cells from zzso zzso expression was reduced significantly in zzso zzso samples from patients with Crohn's zzso 

zzso is required for proper zzso of a subset of zzso receptors in polarized zzso cells, which allows them to respond to zzso signals from underlying zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein sorting machinery is required for maintenance of immune zzso and prevention of excessive zzso
