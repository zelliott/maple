zzso receptors zzso stimulate zzso effects by acting as nuclear zzso factors as well as zzso effects by zzso distinct zzso protein zzso zzso zzso effects have been implicated in numerous cellular zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso To exploit zzso effects zzso by zzso for novel hormone replacement regimens, we screened a focused library of steroid zzso zzso to identify compounds exhibiting properties different from zzso zzso substances that selectively stimulate zzso signal zzso pathways while exhibiting low zzso zzso Treatment of breast cancer cells and zzso cells with zzso zzso substance A and substance B led to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso signaling zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Such compounds leading to prominent zzso zzso but exhibiting only weak zzso properties were applied in zzso zzso modeling zzso zzso zzso zzso As expected from zzso and zzso zzso data, substances were as effective as zzso in zzso zzso We assume that these zzso zzso zzso zzso may serve as potent lead structures for novel hormone replacement strategies exhibiting lesser side effects than the existing treatment zzso
