With the rapid expansion of protein zzso modification zzso research based on large-scale zzso work, there is an increasing demand for a suitable zzso to analyze zzso zzso Here we present a zzso zzso zzso data base, zzso zzso provides a systematic and sophisticated platform for zzso zzso research equipped not only with a knowledge base of manually curated zzso modification data but also with four fully developed, in-depth data mining zzso Currently, zzso contains data detailing zzso zzso determined zzso sites on zzso proteins involving nearly 50 zzso types, curated from public resources including five data bases and four web servers and more than one hundred zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso GO functional zzso and zzso groups are integrated into the data zzso Four online tools have been developed and zzso including zzso to compare a user's zzso zzso with zzso data in zzso zzso to map zzso proteins to zzso zzso zzso to discover potentially zzso zzso zzso and zzso to find clusters of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was demonstrated by analyzing an in-house zzso zzso identified by zzso It is shown that in zzso the role of zzso and zzso modifications can be systematically investigated in a full biological zzso zzso could be an important contribution to zzso zzso zzso is freely available online at zzso
