zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells are an important component of the zzso immune system and regulate zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, there is a significant increase in zzso T cells in the inflamed zzso of patients with zzso colitis zzso However, the role of zzso T cells in chronic colitis has not been fully zzso 

zzso mice, which spontaneously develop chronic colitis with many features of human UC including an increase in zzso zzso population, represent an excellent model to investigate the role of zzso T cells in zzso zzso To identify the role of zzso T cells in this zzso we zzso have generated zzso mice through deletion of all zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso using the zzso zzso zzso system and subsequently crossing these mice with zzso zzso 

An increase in zzso zzso T cells was associated with the development of human UC as well as zzso disease seen in zzso zzso Interestingly, the newly established zzso zzso zzso double zzso mice developed significantly less severe colitis as compared with zzso zzso The suppression of colitis in zzso zzso zzso double zzso mice was associated with a significant reduction of zzso zzso and zzso productions and a decrease in zzso zzso 

zzso T cells are involved in the zzso of zzso chronic zzso zzso zzso T cells may represent a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of human zzso
