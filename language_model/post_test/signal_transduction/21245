A zzso zzso a novel human zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso was isolated from a zzso human zzso zzso cell zzso zzso The zzso zzso open reading frame encodes 368 zzso acids including the highly zzso zzso site sequence of protein zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso acid position zzso The predicted 70 zzso acid stretch surrounding the HC motif shares significant sequence identity with other human dual specificity zzso zzso including the known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso in a rabbit zzso zzso zzso rat zzso and zzso proteins whose zzso had been zzso by zzso zzso added to the zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso inhibited the induction of an zzso promoter by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso cells with zzso inhibited zzso transformation by zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso suppresses the transforming activity of zzso or zzso zzso through zzso zzso and zzso
