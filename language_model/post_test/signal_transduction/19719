zzso are recruited from the blood to sites of sterile zzso where they contribute to wound healing but may also cause tissue zzso By using spinning disk zzso zzso zzso we examined the zzso and molecular mechanisms of zzso recruitment to sites of focal zzso necrosis in zzso zzso zzso released from zzso cells activated the zzso zzso to generate an inflammatory zzso that alerted circulating zzso to adhere within liver zzso zzso generation of an zzso zzso zzso directed zzso migration through healthy tissue toward zzso of zzso Lastly, zzso signals released from zzso cells guided zzso through zzso zzso into the zzso Thus, dynamic in zzso imaging revealed a zzso hierarchy of directional cues that guide zzso zzso to sites of sterile zzso
