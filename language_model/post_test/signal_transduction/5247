zzso zzso is a component of the zzso zzso zzso complexes that liberate zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso Several lines of evidence indicate that the members of these complexes could also contribute to the control of cell zzso Here we show that zzso of zzso increases the viability of human embryonic kidney zzso cells and decreases zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in various cell lines from human and zzso origins by zzso zzso zzso lowers zzso zzso zzso activity and promoter zzso and reduces zzso zzso zzso protection against zzso cell death was completely abolished by zzso zzso zzso the depletion of zzso drastically enhances zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and favored zzso nuclear zzso We examined whether zzso protective function depends on zzso zzso zzso First, a zzso acid deletion known to reduce zzso zzso zzso production did not affect zzso protective zzso Second, zzso still reduces zzso zzso zzso in zzso lacking zzso and zzso Third, the zzso inhibitor zzso did not affect zzso reduction of zzso zzso Altogether, our study indicates that zzso controls cell death via zzso zzso and zzso pathways and that this function remains independent of the activity and molecular integrity of the zzso zzso
