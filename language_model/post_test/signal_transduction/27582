zzso is a form of programmed cell death that plays a pivotal role during development and in the zzso of the adult nervous zzso However, mechanisms that regulate zzso zzso are not well zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso factor zzso protects cortical zzso against zzso induced by zzso or serum deprivation and activates the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using pharmacological agents and transient zzso with dominant interfering or zzso active components of the zzso or the zzso zzso pathway, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso plays a major role in zzso zzso against zzso Furthermore, zzso is activated in cortical zzso during zzso zzso and zzso of zzso increases zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso is the dominant survival mechanism for zzso survival under normal culture conditions and for zzso protection against serum zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso is one of several zzso mechanisms that are activated by stress to counteract death signals in central nervous system zzso Furthermore, the relative contribution of the zzso and zzso zzso pathways to zzso survival may depend on the type of cellular zzso
