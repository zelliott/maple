The zzso zzso zzso zzso is considered critical in plant responses to many environmental factors, and previous studies have indicated the involvement of multiple zzso gene families during cellular zzso Through a detailed analysis of the zzso zzso zzso 82 zzso were identified as being involved in zzso zzso These could be grouped into different families including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transfer proteins and putative zzso zzso zzso The presence of more than 10 zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggested that these genes might be zzso expressed during plant cellular responses or growth and zzso zzso DNA chip technology was employed to study the expression patterns of various zzso In total, 79 zzso clones were amplified and used for DNA chip zzso zzso profile analysis was performed using samples that represented multiple zzso or cellular zzso Tested samples included normal zzso stem and flower zzso and leaves from plants treated with various hormones zzso zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso or environmental factors zzso zzso zzso drought, salicylic acid and zzso zzso zzso showed that many zzso zzso genes were zzso expressed under these experimental zzso In particular, the different zzso of each family were specifically expressed in many cases, suggesting their involvement in tissue specificity and cellular responses to environmental zzso This work provides a starting point for functional studies of the relevant zzso proteins and may help shed light onto the role of zzso pathways in development and cellular zzso
