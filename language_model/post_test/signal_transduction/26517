We assessed the zzso effects of zzso zzso and intravenous zzso application of zzso zzso on the mean zzso blood pressure zzso heart rate zzso and total blood volume zzso We evaluated also the relation between the effects and zzso of transforming growth zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso beta zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso in rat brain, lung and kidney zzso zzso were zzso and while still breathing spontaneously, a zzso and zzso vein and artery zzso were zzso To determine zzso using the zzso method, 2 zzso zzso solutions were applied by zzso zzso Group 1 zzso zzso received a 1 zzso zzso injection of zzso zzso Group 2 received 15 zzso and Group 3 received 75 zzso zzso zzso The zzso was measured at 10, 20, 60 and 120 zzso For each animal, the values of zzso zzso and zzso were measured within 2 zzso For zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso primary zzso were tested using the zzso zzso zzso was decreased in Group 1 and the increase in zzso was statistically zzso zzso values increased zzso None of the values changed significantly in Group zzso Although zzso was unchanged in Group 3, the decrease in zzso was statistically zzso zzso values increased, but the increase was not statistically zzso zzso zzso zzso and moderate zzso zzso and zzso zzso were observed in the brain, lung and kidney samples in Group zzso Increased zzso zzso in the kidney samples were observed in Group zzso zzso zzso was as strong in the brain and the kidney samples in Group zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in the lung and kidney zzso in Group zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso was observed in all tissue samples in Group zzso The decreased zzso values in Group 3 differed from those in Groups 1 and zzso Despite increased zzso zzso especially in brain and zzso the decrease in zzso zzso in Group 3, especially lung and zzso were consistent with a drop in blood zzso
