To investigate the effects of zzso zzso zzso on the proliferation of human zzso zzso cells, and to explore the signaling zzso of the nuclear zzso factor of the zzso zzso zzso initiated by zzso related with the zzso 

The human zzso cells and bone zzso nuclear cells were exposed to zzso at a concentration of 0, 10, 25, 50, and 100 zzso respectively, in zzso culture system to observe colony forming unite of all zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Three lineages of human zzso cell lines, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were incubated with zzso at 20 zzso for 14 zzso Meanwhile, zzso zzso was used as a positive zzso The nuclear protein of the cells was analyzed by Western zzso with zzso zzso against the zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso mobility shift zzso performed by using the zzso zzso consensus zzso 

zzso promoted the proliferation of zzso cells and significantly raised the colony numbers of zzso by zzso over the zzso control zzso zzso also enhanced the proliferation of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein levels of either the zzso or zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso treated by zzso increased by zzso fold and zzso zzso fold over the zzso zzso zzso binding activity, initiated by either zzso or zzso was apparently elevated to form the complex of zzso with DNA as higher density bands in zzso and zzso cells, and some activity appeared as a band in zzso cells induced by zzso 

zzso displayed the action of zzso growth zzso or synergistic efficacy to promote proliferation of human zzso cells, may play a role in the zzso of gene expression related to proliferation of zzso cells through increasing the zzso synthesis and its DNA binding zzso
