The alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso release of zzso zzso from rat nucleus zzso zzso This effect was antagonized by zzso confirming that it was an alpha zzso zzso zzso There was no evidence of zzso zzso of zzso receptors suggesting that the alpha zzso zzso was not acting zzso to inhibit zzso zzso An in zzso zzso technique was used to investigate whether there was any interaction between alpha zzso and zzso zzso in zzso their zzso effects on zzso release from rat nucleus zzso zzso alpha zzso and zzso zzso interact with similar second zzso systems and it was considered that they may compete for a common pool of zzso The zzso effects of the alpha zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and pergolide were not zzso However, there was no evidence of any interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso antagonists, zzso or haloperidol, suggesting that the two receptors do not compete for a common pool of zzso in zzso their zzso effects on zzso zzso
