zzso traffic between the zzso and the zzso of zzso cells is zzso by nuclear pore complexes zzso zzso if not thousands, of molecules interact with and transit through each zzso every zzso The pore is blocked by a zzso barrier, which consists of a network of zzso unfolded zzso containing thousands of zzso zzso repeat zzso This zzso rejects larger molecules and admits smaller molecules or zzso bound to nuclear transport receptors zzso For a cargo transport complex, minimally consisting of a cargo zzso plus an zzso access to the zzso barrier is provided by interactions between the zzso and the zzso repeat zzso Numerous models have been zzso to explain the controlled accessibility and the transport characteristics of the zzso but the zzso flexible nature of this structure has hindered zzso A relatively recent development is the ability to monitor the real-time movement of single molecules through individual zzso via single zzso zzso zzso zzso A major advantage of this approach is that it can be used to continuously monitor a series of specific molecular interactions in an active pore with zzso time resolution, which therefore allows one to distinguish between kinetic and zzso zzso Novel insights and prospects for the future are outlined in this zzso This article is part of a Special zzso zzso zzso of Signaling and Cellular Fate through zzso of Nuclear zzso zzso
