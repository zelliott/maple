zzso zzso is recognized as a zzso regulator during zzso but little information exists on its actions in male zzso zzso We examined whether zzso affects the expression of its receptors zzso zzso and zzso zzso in male zzso Both long and short zzso zzso were induced zzso during differentiation of zzso zzso with a zzso higher expression of the long zzso zzso zzso both zzso before and after zzso zzso suppressed zzso in zzso zzso and mature zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, which was reversed by a zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso but not zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso and zzso release by acting directly on zzso via interaction with either of its receptors and zzso of a zzso signaling zzso This is the first demonstration of substantial effects of zzso on male zzso
