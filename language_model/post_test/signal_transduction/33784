zzso stem cells zzso have attracted considerable attention as a potential source of cells for therapeutic treatment of impaired areas of the central nervous zzso However, efficient and clinically feasible strategies for expansion of the zzso zzso pool are currently zzso In this study, we demonstrate that mood stabilizing drugs, which are used to treat patients with bipolar disorder, enhance the zzso capability of mouse zzso in zzso and that this enhancement is achieved at zzso relevant zzso in the zzso zzso The pharmacological effects are zzso by the zzso of zzso signaling in the zzso Treatment with mood zzso increased an active form of zzso zzso and zzso its target genes in neural zzso cells, whereas zzso with zzso inhibitor or the presence of zzso in the zzso gene blocked the effects of mood zzso In addition, chronic administration of mood zzso expanded the zzso pool in the adult brain, which subsequently increased the cell supply to the zzso zzso We suggest that treatment with mood stabilizing drugs could be used to facilitate zzso following insult to the central nervous zzso
