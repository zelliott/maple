There is accumulating evidence implicating the involvement of zzso oxide zzso in spinal central zzso The long-term zzso zzso of spinal zzso field zzso is considered as a fundamental mechanism of zzso of zzso zzso in the spinal zzso The present study examined the roles of soluble zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso two potential NO targets, in spinal zzso The results showed that zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso blue zzso zzso 20 zzso or zzso zzso 10 zzso 20 zzso before zzso zzso significantly inhibited the induction of spinal zzso and this was reversed by zzso a zzso zzso zzso However, the maintenance of spinal zzso was not changed when application of zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso Although our previous experiments have identified a key role for NO in the induction of spinal zzso NO zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso or zzso zzso 20 zzso a scavenger of zzso had no effect on established spinal zzso when applied zzso after the induction of spinal zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso had no effect on the induction and maintenance of spinal zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso inhibited its zzso but not its zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso zzso activity plays a critical role in the induction of zzso of zzso field zzso in the spinal cord, whereas zzso zzso activity contributes to the maintenance of spinal zzso
