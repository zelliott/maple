zzso and zzso require stimulation for optimal zzso zzso zzso function, whereas zzso function is zzso in many other zzso The molecular mechanisms that enhance zzso function in zzso zzso cells are poorly zzso zzso of the zzso zzso tail is a recently described but prevalent phenomenon, with unknown effects on zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso of the zzso zzso tail zzso zzso to zzso zzso prevents zzso zzso zzso in two cell zzso Whereas this zzso has no effect on zzso zzso in a cell with zzso zzso function, it completely zzso zzso and zzso zzso by a cell that requires stimulation for zzso zzso zzso zzso change as detected by zzso zzso occurs normally in zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso of zzso is required for stimulation of zzso zzso probably due to its zzso Because the motif in zzso required for zzso zzso is shared by several zzso zzso this may be a zzso mechanism for regulation of zzso zzso
