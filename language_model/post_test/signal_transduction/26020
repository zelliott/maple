zzso zzso and carbon dioxide zzso levels vary in different environments and locally zzso during zzso and zzso Recent studies in diverse animals have identified sensory zzso that detect these external variations and direct a variety of zzso zzso allows animals to stay within a preferred environment as well as identify potential food or zzso The complexity of sensation is reflected in the fact that zzso zzso detection into increases, zzso and short-range and long-range zzso Animals also adjust their responses to these prevalent signals in the context of other cues, allowing for flexible zzso In general, the molecular mechanisms for detection suggest that sensory zzso adopted ancient strategies for cellular detection and coupled them to brain activity and zzso This review highlights the multiple strategies that animals use to extract information about their environment from variations in zzso and zzso
