zzso play an important role in immunity and zzso Upon pathogen recognition via specific zzso they rapidly induce inflammatory zzso This process is tightly controlled at the zzso zzso The DNA binding zzso protein zzso factor zzso is a crucial regulator of long-range zzso interactions and coordinates specific communication between zzso factors and gene expression zzso In this study, the zzso gene was specifically deleted in zzso cells by making use of the transgenic zzso zzso zzso deletion of the zzso gene in zzso cells induced a mild zzso in zzso zzso mice exhibited significantly reduced expression of major zzso complex zzso class II in the zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a normal surface zzso and zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso zzso zzso they produced normal levels of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso but zzso a strongly impaired capacity to produce zzso factor zzso and zzso as well as to express the zzso family members zzso zzso and zzso Taken together, our data demonstrate a role of zzso that involves zzso of zzso zzso
