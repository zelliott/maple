zzso zzso is the process by which the zzso zzso facial bones, zzso and zzso zzso are formed and relies on the tight control of zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso plays a role in bone development and maintenance and belongs to a family of proteins which differ in their zzso affinities and tissue zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene lead to zzso and multiple types of skeletal zzso with varying degrees of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Despite progress in the characterization of zzso regulation of cartilage development, many aspects remain zzso The aim and the novelty of our study was to examine whole gene expression differences occurring in primary human zzso isolated from normal cartilage or pathological cartilage from zzso zzso using zzso zzso The zzso of the primary cells was confirmed by the high expression of zzso zzso zzso expression of genes associated with many cellular processes was observed, including cell growth and zzso cell cycle, cell zzso cell zzso zzso zzso signal zzso cell cycle process and cell zzso Most of the cell cycle process genes were zzso and consisted of genes involved in cell cycle zzso DNA zzso zzso dynamics and zzso About eight percent of all modulated genes were found to impact zzso zzso zzso structure and zzso especially zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso Altogether, the gene expression analyses provide new insight into the consequences of zzso zzso in cell cycle regulation, onset of zzso differentiation and zzso metabolism zzso Moreover, impaired zzso and zzso properties may also provide clues about growth plate zzso These results also suggest that many signaling pathways may be directly or indirectly altered by zzso and confirm the crucial role of zzso in the control of growth plate zzso
