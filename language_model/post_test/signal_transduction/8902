The zzso factor zzso a member of the zzso zzso of zzso zinc finger proteins is involved in signal zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the development of different human zzso entities such as colon and lung cancer and increased zzso expression has been found in these zzso entities as zzso In this study we questioned whether zzso expression might also be important in human breast cancer zzso zzso we correlated zzso expression with zzso and clinical data to evaluate whether zzso could represent a new zzso marker in breast cancer zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso in human invasive breast zzso zzso zzso zzso in comparison to normal human breast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso zzso in a set of normal zzso zzso 3) and zzso breast cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso data were statistically interpreted using zzso version zzso 

zzso analysis of zzso zzso expression in a small cohort of zzso zzso 5) human matched normal and zzso breast zzso showed first tendency towards zzso zzso in human breast zzso However only a small sample number was included into these analyses and values for zzso zzso were statistically not significant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On protein level, nuclear zzso expression in breast cancer cells was clearly more abundant than in normal breast zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased expression of zzso protein in breast zzso significantly correlated with zzso overall survival zzso zzso zzso but also with higher zzso stage zzso zzso zzso and an increased number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, a highly significant correlation was found between zzso expression and the expression of zzso a central upstream zzso of the zzso zzso that was previously zzso on the same tissue zzso 

Our study presents a systematic expression analysis of zzso in human breast zzso zzso levels of zzso protein in human breast cancer are associated with zzso prognosis and progressive stages of zzso Thus zzso protein expression measured zzso by an zzso based scoring system might have an implication in future zzso panels for human breast cancer prognosis or molecular zzso zzso The highly significant correlation between zzso and zzso expression zzso zzso as a potential functional downstream target of the zzso zzso zzso in human breast cancer as zzso Furthermore, our study indicates that altered zzso zzso may represent a key disease zzso in the progression of human breast zzso
