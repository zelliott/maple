zzso of zzso and zzso molecules play an important role in guiding zzso to appropriate targets in the developing nervous zzso Although some of the molecules involved have recently been identified, little is known about the physical mechanisms by which growth cones sense zzso This article applies the seminal Berg and Purcell zzso model of zzso sensing to this zzso The model provides estimates for the statistical fluctuations in the measurement of concentration by a small sensing zzso By assuming that zzso detection consists of the comparison of zzso at two zzso or temporally separated points, the model therefore provides an estimate for the zzso of zzso that can be detected as a function of zzso zzso The model makes the following specific zzso zzso It is more likely that growth cones use a spatial rather than zzso sensing zzso zzso Growth cone sensitivity increases with the concentration of zzso the speed of zzso zzso the size of the growth zzso and the time over which it averages the zzso zzso zzso The minimum zzso zzso zzso for growth cones is roughly in the range zzso zzso This value varies depending on whether a bound or freely zzso zzso is being zzso and on whether the sensing occurs in three or two zzso The model also makes predictions concerning the role of zzso in zzso zzso
