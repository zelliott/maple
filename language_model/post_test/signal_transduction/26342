zzso viruses represent a novel therapeutic approach for aggressive tumors, such as zzso zzso which are resistant to available zzso zzso has been observed in cells infected with zzso zzso however, its role in cell zzso is zzso To zzso the potential therapeutic use of zzso zzso in association with viral therapy, we analyzed zzso induction in human zzso cell lines zzso and zzso infected with the zzso zzso zzso zzso infection triggered an zzso cellular response, as shown by the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso conversion, and reduction of zzso zzso However, on infection, the zzso pathway, which zzso regulates zzso was zzso whereas the zzso pathway, a positive regulator of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso effects, whereas zzso induction by zzso protected cells from zzso zzso Treatment with two zzso of zzso zzso and zzso increased the zzso effects of zzso in zzso In zzso the growth of zzso zzso was further reduced by adding zzso to the zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso acts as a survival response in zzso cells infected with zzso thus suggesting zzso zzso as zzso drugs in zzso zzso zzso
