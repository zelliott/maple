zzso an zzso hormone, plays an essential role in the maintenance of normal body weight and energy zzso as well as zzso zzso Indeed, zzso zzso mice are obese with profound zzso insulin resistance, and often zzso Interestingly, low doses of zzso zzso can reverse the zzso and zzso in these animals without altering body zzso The zzso in zzso mice may result directly from the absence of zzso signaling in pancreatic zzso and, in turn, contribute to both obesity and insulin zzso Here, we acutely attenuated zzso zzso signaling in normal mice with a zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso to determine the contribution of zzso signaling in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso was either injected or continuously administered via zzso zzso for several days, and various zzso parameters were zzso zzso mice had increased zzso and zzso plasma insulin levels, decreased zzso insulin sensitivity, elevated zzso zzso production, and impaired zzso suppression of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso treatment resulted in increased food intake and increased respiratory zzso without significantly altering energy expenditure or body composition as assessed by the zzso zzso Our findings indicate that zzso in insulin sensitivity occur before changes in the zzso ratio and energy expenditure during the acute disruption of zzso zzso zzso
