Enteric zzso are intimately associated with zzso in the enteric nervous system zzso and display zzso and molecular similarities to central nervous system zzso zzso Enteric zzso express neurotransmitter zzso suggesting that, like zzso they are active participants in zzso zzso In the zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso Enteric zzso express zzso receptors and respond to zzso in zzso suggesting that enteric zzso participate in functional gastrointestinal responses to nerve zzso We investigated whether enteric zzso are activated by zzso released from enteric zzso 

zzso activity was zzso in enteric zzso by zzso stimulating zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of the guinea pig zzso zzso in enteric zzso cells was detected by imaging zzso calcium in zzso 

zzso stimulation zzso increases in zzso calcium in enteric zzso cells that were blocked by zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso salt zzso zzso and the zzso C inhibitor zzso Furthermore, enteric zzso responded robustly to zzso applied zzso in zzso and the zzso response was blocked by zzso and zzso Data from zzso profiling and zzso analyses support the hypothesis that zzso is the major functional zzso underlying the zzso response in enteric zzso 

Our results provide direct evidence for functional zzso zzso communication in the enteric nervous system, raising the possibility that zzso released with zzso during enteric synaptic transmission functions to signal to enteric zzso
