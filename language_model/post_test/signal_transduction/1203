zzso of the zzso gene have been associated with an increased zzso to Crohn's disease, but the zzso mechanisms zzso by zzso remain zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso in the zzso gene associated with Crohn's disease results in defective release of zzso from blood zzso cells after stimulation with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not with bacterial zzso a zzso zzso The potential zzso significance of this finding in patients with Crohn's disease and who are zzso for this zzso zzso was substantiated by the finding of decreased zzso zzso release when cells from these patients were zzso with different species of zzso an enteric zzso implicated in the zzso of Crohn's zzso In conclusion, defective zzso function results in a zzso zzso bias after stimulation of zzso cells with zzso zzso and this could contribute to the overwhelming inflammation seen in Crohn's zzso
