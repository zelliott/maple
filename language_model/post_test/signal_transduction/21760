zzso is an zzso that accumulates in zzso zzso Its zzso is increased by its breakdown, which is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study we tested the hypothesis that zzso signaling events zzso zzso induction would protect cultured cortical zzso from zzso A fivefold increase in zzso expression was observed in mixed zzso cultures zzso after zzso zzso This was markedly reduced by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso had a weak but statistically significant effect, while the zzso inhibitor zzso was zzso zzso zzso as assessed by zzso release, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was also prevented by zzso but not by zzso zzso had little or no zzso zzso with reduced iron release, zzso expression was also attenuated by zzso while cell zzso zzso was zzso These results suggest that targeting the zzso zzso may prevent zzso induction in response to zzso and reduce zzso zzso
