We sought to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso cell invasion in human zzso zzso In this study, we found that zzso attenuated zzso protein levels, zzso zzso activity, and cell zzso through a zzso independent zzso zzso increased zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso zzso The addition of zzso (a zzso zzso which blocked zzso zzso abolished the zzso effects by zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that the knock down of zzso by zzso specific small interference zzso reversed the reduction of zzso zzso and of cell zzso by zzso In contrast, the stable expression of zzso in zzso cell lines decreased zzso activity and cell zzso These results suggest that zzso may mediate the zzso effects through zzso zzso Thus, zzso could be a potential target in zzso zzso
