Cell surface zzso zzso zzso zzso act as zzso for multiple families of growth factors that regulate animal cell zzso differentiation and zzso zzso of zzso zzso during brain development is known to produce severe structural zzso Here we investigate the zzso role played by one particular zzso zzso zzso which is especially abundant on zzso cell zzso and is the major zzso of the adult zzso zzso 

Mice with a zzso zzso in zzso were generated and found to be viable and zzso The major zzso associated with zzso loss is a highly significant reduction in brain size, with only subtle effects on brain patterning zzso to the anterior zzso The brain size difference emerges very early during zzso (between embryonic days zzso and zzso and remains roughly constant throughout development and zzso By examining markers of different signaling zzso and the differentiation behaviors of cells in the early embryonic brain, we zzso that zzso zzso most likely result from a transient reduction in zzso growth factor zzso zzso Through the analysis of compound zzso we provide strong evidence that zzso is the zzso family member through which zzso controls brain zzso 

These data add to a growing literature that implicates the zzso family of zzso in organ size zzso They also argue that, among zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso are disproportionately sensitive to loss of zzso Finally, because zzso zzso zzso mice were found to have brain sizes zzso between zzso and wild type, the data imply that zzso zzso levels zzso control growth factor zzso a finding that is both novel and relevant to the general question of how the activities of zzso are exploited during zzso
