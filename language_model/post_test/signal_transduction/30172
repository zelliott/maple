zzso receptors and their zzso zzso zzso are important players in zzso guidance and neural patterning during development of the nervous zzso Much of our knowledge about the signal zzso pathways triggered by zzso receptors has been related to the zzso of zzso zzso which is fundamental in zzso the cellular responses in growth cone zzso cell zzso and cell zzso In contrast, little was known about whether long term zzso of zzso zzso would regulate gene zzso Here we report a novel signaling zzso of zzso which involves zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso but not the zzso zzso induced zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso Treatment of cultured zzso zzso with zzso also induced zzso zzso of zzso which was abolished by the zzso inhibitor zzso Moreover, zzso was zzso with zzso in muscle, and both proteins were concentrated at the zzso junction zzso of adult zzso By using zzso analysis, we have identified zzso the critical zzso that zzso the neurotransmitter zzso at the zzso as a downstream target gene of the zzso zzso in zzso More importantly, zzso increased the expression of zzso protein in zzso zzso which was abolished by zzso In contrast, zzso reduced the expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso independently of zzso Finally, the expression level of zzso in limb muscle of zzso zzso mice was significantly reduced compared with the zzso zzso Taken together, these results have identified zzso proteins as the novel downstream targets of zzso zzso In addition, the present study provides the first demonstration of a potential function of zzso receptors and zzso proteins at the zzso
