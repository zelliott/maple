Although several prominent zzso features of zzso are evident in the cell body zzso cell zzso membrane zzso and nuclear DNA zzso and zzso the zzso and molecular zzso that constitute the cell death machinery can be engaged in synaptic terminals and zzso zzso events such as zzso production and calcium influx, and zzso processes such as zzso production, zzso zzso and zzso zzso can be induced in zzso and zzso Several prominent signal zzso pathways in synaptic terminals play important roles in either promoting or preventing zzso death in zzso and pathological zzso For example, zzso of zzso receptors in zzso spines can induce zzso zzso whereas local zzso of zzso factor receptors in zzso terminals can prevent zzso zzso zzso capable of inducing nuclear zzso zzso and fragmentation can be produced locally in synaptic terminals and zzso and may zzso to the cell zzso Recent findings suggest that, beyond their roles in inducing or preventing cell death, zzso and zzso zzso play roles in synaptic plasticity zzso zzso and long-term functional zzso For example, zzso zzso results in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso which results in altered zzso zzso to zzso zzso of zzso factor receptors in synaptic terminals can result in local changes in energy metabolism and calcium zzso and can induce long-term changes in synaptic zzso The emerging data therefore suggest that zzso can be considered as autonomous compartments in which both zzso and zzso signaling pathways are activated resulting in structural and functional changes in zzso zzso A better understanding of such synaptic signaling mechanisms may reveal novel approaches for preventing and treating an array of neurodegenerative conditions that are initiated by zzso synaptic zzso
