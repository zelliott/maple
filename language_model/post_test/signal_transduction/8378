Type 2 diabetes zzso zzso is commonly associated with both zzso and zzso complications and a strong correlation exists between zzso control and the zzso and progression of vascular zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated for therapy of type zzso zzso vascular effects that seem to occur independently of zzso zzso 

By using a zzso zzso zzso model, in this study we have found that zzso restores the blood flow recovery and zzso density in zzso muscle of diabetic mice and that this process is associated with increased expression of zzso zzso Growth Factor zzso zzso these beneficial effects are zzso when zzso zzso is zzso zzso the direct zzso of zzso with its selective zzso zzso does not restore blood flow recovery and zzso zzso Finally, an important collateral vessel growth is obtained with combined treatment with zzso and selective zzso inhibitor zzso 

These data demonstrate that zzso zzso is essential for zzso zzso effect of zzso and that zzso exerts this effect via a zzso independent zzso
