zzso zzso zzso zzso have shown an impairment of zzso zzso development and zzso We zzso that the immune function of zzso zzso might be affected by increased zzso intake zzso during the zzso zzso zzso we investigated the effects of high zzso zzso on the growth performance, zzso zzso and zzso response of zzso and zzso weight zzso zzso A total of twelve pairs of zzso and zzso zzso (7 d old) were randomly assigned to two different zzso formula milk zzso After 21 d of zzso growth performance, the composition of peripheral zzso serum zzso and zzso innate zzso genes involved in the zzso zzso zzso differentiation factor zzso zzso were zzso The results indicated that zzso decreased the average daily zzso intake zzso and the average daily growth zzso However, the zzso and zzso were increased by zzso irrespective of body zzso Likewise, serum zzso zzso and zzso and zzso gene expressions zzso zzso zzso and zzso were lower in zzso zzso whereas zzso significantly increased blood zzso percentage and serum zzso zzso but decreased zzso percentage, serum zzso zzso and zzso gene expressions zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso with zzso exhibited lower serum zzso of zzso and zzso than zzso zzso and these zzso in the immune traits of zzso zzso receiving zzso were accompanied by decreasing zzso gene expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are related to innate zzso In conclusion, the present findings suggest that increased zzso during the zzso period impaired the immune function of zzso zzso with zzso
