zzso protection can be achieved by transfer of coronary zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso This study was designed to test the hypothesis that zzso zzso from rat hearts zzso by zzso zzso cartridges could induce remote zzso against zzso zzso injury through the zzso of protein zzso C signaling zzso zzso rat hearts were subject to 30 zzso zzso and 60 zzso zzso The zzso zzso injury was assessed by zzso zzso function recovery and zzso zzso The protective effect of coronary zzso collected during zzso zzso zzso was tested in zzso hearts in presence or absence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso size was 17 zzso zzso in zzso versus 37 zzso zzso in control hearts zzso zzso zzso Hearts zzso with fresh zzso zzso had zzso sizes of 16 zzso zzso versus 36 zzso zzso in hearts treated with zzso zzso The zzso effect was lost when the zzso was left at room temperature during 24 h zzso size, 40 zzso zzso or heated to 70 degrees C zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso or 100 degrees C zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso zzso was stable for 30 days, and its zzso in a zzso zzso column resulted in a zzso fraction that reduced the zzso size to 17 zzso zzso versus 38 zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the reduction of zzso size induced by zzso (35 zzso zzso or zzso fraction zzso zzso zzso Recovery of the zzso function at zzso was higher in zzso group zzso zzso zzso versus 17 zzso zzso in control, P zzso zzso and zzso fraction zzso zzso zzso versus 8 zzso zzso in zzso zzso P zzso zzso Similarly, zzso was able to abrogate the zzso function recovery (12 zzso zzso P zzso zzso versus zzso group and 19 zzso zzso P zzso zzso versus zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso factors released in the coronary zzso by zzso are zzso zzso substances with molecular weights higher than zzso zzso and acting through zzso zzso
