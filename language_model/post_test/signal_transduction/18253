zzso zzso zzso zzso contributes significantly to the development of zzso However, the mechanisms of zzso vascular smooth muscle cell zzso proliferation are not completely zzso zzso we investigated the effect of zzso on cell proliferation associated with a specific pattern of zzso protein zzso zzso by zzso incorporation and zzso zzso zzso in canine cultured zzso zzso zzso incorporation and zzso zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso manner in zzso zzso of these cells with zzso toxin zzso for 24 hours attenuated the zzso zzso incorporation and zzso zzso zzso indicating that these responses were zzso through a zzso coupled to a zzso G zzso In cells zzso with zzso for 24 h and with either the zzso inhibitor zzso or the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso for zzso substantially reduced the zzso incorporation and zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso of zzso by addition of zzso plus zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso incorporation and zzso zzso zzso indicating the requirement of zzso for these zzso zzso zzso incorporation and zzso zzso zzso was completely inhibited by zzso (an inhibitor of zzso and zzso (an inhibitor of zzso zzso Furthermore, we also showed that zzso of dominant negative zzso of Ras zzso and zzso zzso completely suppressed zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso and zzso indicating that Ras and zzso may be required for zzso of these zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the zzso effect of zzso is zzso through a zzso zzso zzso that involves the zzso o zzso zzso similar to those of zzso in canine cultured zzso
