The zzso cell line is a relatively recent addition to the range of mast cell zzso and is of particular importance as it is the only human analogue which can be zzso to zzso in an zzso zzso zzso cells are zzso zzso cells which have historically been shown to play an important role in the zzso immune response, though there is now gathering evidence of their significance as a component of the innate immune zzso These functions can be attributed to the ability of mast cells to regulate zzso of a wide variety of potent biologically active zzso through immediate and delayed zzso This zzso zzso mechanism of the mast cell makes it an ideal model in which to study this zzso In this investigation, two-dimensional zzso was employed as part of the zzso characterization of the zzso human mast cell line, focusing in particular on a global analysis of membrane protein relocation after an zzso zzso zzso This investigation has identified six zzso protein spots which became zzso upon zzso zzso 31 protein spots which displayed consistent recruitment to the membrane zzso and three which were consistently lost from the soluble zzso The scenario which emerges reveals a series of substantial changes which affect every compartment of the cell, providing evidence for a coordinated response to a zzso zzso
