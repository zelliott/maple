The zzso is a tissue that zzso a very complex and tightly controlled differentiation zzso The zzso of this program is generally flawless, resulting in the production of an effective protective barrier for the zzso Many of the genes expressed during zzso differentiation are expressed in a coordinate manner; this suggests that common regulatory models may zzso The simplest model envisions a zzso regulatory zzso that is possessed by all genes that are regulated together zzso zzso and zzso type zzso Studies to date, however, have not identified any such elements and, if anything, the available studies suggest that appropriate expression of each gene is achieved using sometime subtly and sometime zzso different zzso Recent studies indicate that a variety of zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are expressed in the zzso and, in many cases, multiple members of several families are present zzso zzso and zzso domain zzso The simultaneous expression of multiple members of a single zzso factor family provides numerous opportunities for complex zzso Some studies suggest that specific members of these families interact with specific zzso zzso The best studied of these families in zzso is the zzso family of zzso All of the known zzso factors are expressed in zzso zzso and each is expressed in a specific spatial pattern that suggests the potential to regulate multiple zzso It will be important to determine the role of each of these members in regulating zzso gene zzso Finally, information is beginning to emerge regarding signal zzso in zzso Some of the early events in signal zzso have been identified zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and some of the molecular targets of these pathways zzso zzso zzso zzso are beginning to be zzso Eventually we can expect to zzso of all of the steps between the interaction of the stimulating agent with its zzso and the zzso of target gene zzso
