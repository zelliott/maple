The signals that initiate cell invasion are not well zzso but there is increasing evidence that zzso physical signals play an important zzso Here we show that zzso cell invasion in the zzso of zzso meltdown zzso zzso arises in response to zzso zzso tone in the surrounding smooth muscle cell zzso Physical signaling in zzso drives formation of membrane zzso within the zzso that resemble zzso zzso zzso present in invasive cancer zzso zzso of zzso a zzso zzso that is required for zzso formation in zzso cells blocked formation of the zzso and rescued invasion in zzso zzso of zzso induced zzso zzso in wild type zzso cells, however the cells did not migrate into the tissue zzso thus indicating that the zzso were required but not sufficient for invasion in this in zzso zzso zzso profiling experiments showed that genes responsive to zzso oxygen species zzso were zzso in zzso zzso zzso generators induced zzso zzso and invasion in zzso zzso larvae but had no effect in wild type zzso zzso of zzso Ras and zzso signaling enhanced the responsiveness of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso These findings present the first direct evidence that zzso play a role in tissue cell invasion in zzso In addition, they identify an zzso physical signaling zzso sensitive to zzso and zzso signaling that can drive this zzso
