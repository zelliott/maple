zzso zzso cells zzso participate in liver zzso via zzso zzso the extent of which appears to correlate with the loss of cellular vitamin zzso The present study has tested a hypothesis that zzso zzso is associated with diminished zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from rats with zzso liver zzso induced by zzso duct zzso zzso and zzso animals zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso zzso from zzso confirmed zzso zzso of the cells with enhanced zzso levels for zzso and transforming growth zzso zzso Competitive zzso chain reaction analysis showed selective reductions in the zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso X zzso zzso to 20 and zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso level for cellular zzso binding protein I, a gene with zzso responsive element zzso was also suppressed by zzso in zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso were decreased in zzso from zzso Nuclear extracts of these cells showed diminished binding activity to the zzso whereas activity of zzso a zzso factor known to be antagonized by zzso and zzso was zzso These results demonstrate diminished zzso signaling in zzso from zzso liver fibrosis, which appeared to have resulted from zzso zzso and suppressed expression of zzso and zzso Furthermore, the zzso enhancement of zzso activity and zzso increased expression of an zzso responsive zzso zzso suggest a zzso role of the diminished zzso signaling in promoting zzso activity and zzso zzso
