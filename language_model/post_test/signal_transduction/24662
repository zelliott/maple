zzso by zzso the T cells responded well to zzso zzso zzso or zzso but the responses were inhibited by zzso or zzso A zzso zzso In contrast, when zzso by zzso the T cells responded to zzso and zzso but not to zzso and the responses were not inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso and zzso A had no zzso effects on T cell proliferation in response to zzso and zzso after the resting T cells were zzso with zzso alone for a certain zzso However, the response of the zzso T cells to zzso was still inhibited by zzso or zzso A, but the zzso effect gradually decreased as the time in which the zzso T cells zzso with zzso was zzso In a control system, the proliferation of the T cells that were treated with zzso or zzso A for 3 h and washed 3 times was not inhibited when the T cells were zzso with zzso in combination with either zzso zzso or zzso Our data suggest that zzso and zzso A interfere with the early steps of T cell proliferation after stimulation of zzso but not zzso It is likely that the two drugs inhibit the expression of zzso zzso by interfering zzso signals and that zzso zzso T cell proliferation in a different way than zzso and zzso which are zzso and zzso zzso
