The mechanism of action of zzso zzso on rat vascular tissue was zzso We obtained evidence that zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso at zzso zzso Previously, we reported that zzso oxide zzso zzso this zzso zzso zzso zzso strips zzso NO zzso zzso activity in response to zzso zzso treatment with other sex steroids hormones was zzso The zzso action of zzso on NO production was specific for zzso hormones and depends on zzso The effect was zzso since zzso did not suppress the zzso in NO induced by zzso Finally, we demonstrated that zzso (5 zzso increased zzso release zzso above zzso in a zzso manner zzso zzso Indeed, zzso (10 zzso completely suppressed the zzso in zzso levels induced by the zzso These results suggest that zzso exerts a direct zzso action on rat zzso zzso which involves zzso and zzso zzso zzso and a zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso
