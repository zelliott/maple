zzso zzso B zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso mediate zzso in the adult heart, although their importance in the developing heart is poorly zzso The goal of the current study was to determine if volume loading the fetal heart resulting from chronic anemia affects regulation of zzso and the zzso and if this response is zzso zzso 

zzso was created by 7 days of zzso zzso beginning at 101 days zzso zzso or 129 days zzso zzso zzso age zzso in fetal sheep zzso zzso 145 zzso following which protein levels of total and active zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined in the right and left zzso zzso and zzso RV zzso ratios were also zzso 

At both zzso zzso zzso + zzso + zzso weight zzso to body weight was significantly increased in anemic zzso zzso had no effect on expression of zzso total or active zzso zzso or zzso at either zzso zzso of total zzso were also zzso although active zzso was significantly decreased in the late but not early zzso anemic zzso Total zzso and total and active zzso and zzso were significantly greater in early versus late zzso anemic zzso zzso ratios were unchanged in response to anemia at both zzso but were greater in late zzso compared to early zzso anemic zzso 

These results identify important zzso differences in the response of the zzso and zzso in the stressed fetal zzso zzso in zzso ratios likely reflect the different populations of zzso zzso the fetal heart at these two zzso and their zzso response to a zzso zzso
