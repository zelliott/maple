zzso protein zzso zzso containing an zzso zzso repeat zzso domain, a zzso domain and a zzso zzso domain play important roles in plant disease zzso zzso zzso domain proteins structurally resembling the zzso portion of the zzso may also participate in zzso zzso and plant zzso zzso Yet the molecular mechanisms and zzso zzso in regulating plant disease resistance of these simple zzso domain proteins are still largely zzso We provided the first experimental evidence to demonstrate the zzso zzso and trafficking of a novel simple zzso domain protein zzso in the zzso pathway, using both zzso and electron zzso zzso zzso and in zzso pull-down zzso show that zzso interacts with the rice zzso response protein 1 zzso which is localized on plasma zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso zzso was shown to be highly zzso among different plant species, suggesting a close functional relationship between the two zzso The function of zzso in plant zzso response was examined by zzso tests using transgenic zzso zzso The protective effects of zzso against bacterial pathogen infection were shown by the alleviating of disease symptoms, lowering of pathogen zzso and higher expression of zzso marker zzso
