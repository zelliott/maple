The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso intimately involved in zzso allergic diseases, such as zzso zzso and zzso The statins zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso have been demonstrated to relieve allergic zzso However, the zzso effects and mechanisms of statins against zzso zzso remain unknown, at least in zzso This study aimed to define how different statins affect zzso expression in zzso cells, a human zzso cell zzso 

To measure the effects of statins on zzso expression in zzso cells, we used a cell viability zzso reverse zzso chain reaction, zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso 

zzso but not zzso or zzso inhibited zzso expression induced by zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso but not a zzso zzso suppressed zzso expression in zzso zzso Further, zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso significantly suppressed zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso in parallel with zzso zzso zzso 

These results indicate that zzso inhibited expression of the zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso in zzso cells, by zzso zzso zzso via the zzso zzso zzso This blockade of a zzso zzso by zzso may suppress the zzso of zzso cells into skin zzso and zzso the skin inflammation seen in zzso zzso suggesting a potential therapeutic use of zzso for this zzso
