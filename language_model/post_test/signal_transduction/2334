The signaling mechanisms zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso to activate the zzso factors zzso and zzso zzso zzso are poorly zzso We present evidence here that zzso not only stimulates a dramatic increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso activity but also zzso the physical interaction of its type I zzso with the zzso regulatory zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, two zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso experiments indicated that whereas zzso of zzso zzso may be sufficient to induce zzso and increase nuclear zzso protein levels, zzso zzso may need to cooperate with other zzso signals to fully activate zzso gene zzso In this regard, zzso studies suggested that zzso zzso may functionally interact with the zzso zzso zzso to activate zzso Our results thus indicate that zzso zzso is a novel signal zzso in zzso signaling and that it may zzso mediate the zzso of zzso and zzso
