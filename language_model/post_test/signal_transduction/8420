zzso zzso potential zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso channels expressed in zzso It has been proposed that zzso of zzso and/or zzso in the skin may release zzso molecules which would then activate zzso of neighboring zzso root zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso is such a candidate zzso released from zzso upon heating in the zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we found that increase in zzso zzso in zzso zzso upon heating was observed only when zzso were zzso with zzso and this increase was blocked by zzso zzso antagonists, zzso and zzso In a zzso of zzso with zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso to serve as a zzso we observed that zzso zzso zzso zzso and that zzso release is compromised in zzso from zzso zzso This study provides evidence that zzso is a zzso zzso for mainly zzso zzso in zzso
