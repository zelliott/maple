zzso zzso is an essential requirement for kernel growth in zzso zzso zzso however, little is known about how N zzso are zzso in young zzso during seed zzso The objective of this study was to assess zzso acid metabolism in zzso and zzso zzso during the critical 2 weeks following zzso Two zzso hybrids were grown in the field for 2 years at two levels of supplemental N fertilizer zzso and zzso zzso zzso The effects of the zzso sink on zzso N metabolism were examined by comparing zzso to zzso zzso zzso were sampled at 2, 8, 14, and 18 d after zzso dissected into zzso zzso and/or zzso and kernel zzso then analyzed for zzso acid profiles and key zzso activities associated with zzso acid zzso Major zzso acids in the zzso were zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso dropped dramatically from 2 to 14 d after zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso whereas all other measured zzso acids accumulated over time in zzso zzso and zzso especially zzso N supply had a variable effect on individual zzso acid levels in young cobs and zzso with zzso being the most notably zzso We found that the zzso performs significant zzso zzso among zzso zzso zzso and zzso during early zzso development, which may precondition the N zzso supply for sustained kernel zzso The measured zzso acid profiles and zzso activities suggest that the zzso to zzso ratio in cobs may be part of a signal zzso zzso involving zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to indicate plant N status for kernel zzso
