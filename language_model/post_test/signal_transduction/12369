zzso zzso T zzso cells are a separate lineage of T zzso with innate zzso zzso They express an zzso zzso specific for lipids presented by zzso and their development and zzso differentiation rely on a unique gene expression zzso We asked whether this program includes zzso small zzso zzso that regulate gene expression zzso and play a key role in the control of cellular differentiation zzso To this aim, we investigated zzso cell development in mice in which zzso the zzso III zzso that generates functional zzso is deleted in cortical zzso We find that zzso deletion results in a substantial reduction of zzso cells in zzso and their disappearance from the zzso unlike mainstream T zzso Without zzso zzso cells do not complete their innate zzso differentiation and display a defective zzso due to increased cell zzso zzso and zzso of zzso cells require zzso in a zzso zzso Furthermore, we identify a zzso profile specific for zzso cells, which exhibits features of zzso T zzso consistent with the idea that zzso cells undergo zzso zzso zzso Together, these results define a critical role of the zzso zzso zzso in the physiology of zzso zzso
