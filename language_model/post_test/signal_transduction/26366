zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channels are essential contributors to signal zzso of zzso sensory zzso The activity of the channels is controlled by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso channels are composed of two zzso zzso one zzso and one zzso zzso each containing a zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we measured zzso binding and channel zzso simultaneously and showed that zzso activated zzso zzso channels not only by binding to the two zzso zzso but also by binding to the zzso zzso In a channel in which the zzso zzso were compromised for zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso was sufficient to partly activate the zzso In contrast, in zzso channels, the zzso zzso did not bind zzso but channels with this zzso showed zzso by zzso Thus, the zzso zzso participate actively in translating zzso binding to zzso of zzso zzso zzso channels and enable the channels to differentiate between zzso zzso
