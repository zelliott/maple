This study examines the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and varying levels of zzso zzso receptors zzso on the cellular distribution of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso was assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso In cells expressing zzso zzso protein zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso was restricted to the plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso toxin or zzso zzso zzso of cellular zzso so that zzso appeared as intense spots throughout the plasma membrane as well as the zzso Exposure to a neutral zzso zzso zzso prevented the zzso zzso zzso from peripheral to inner zzso In cells expressing high level of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities were significantly elevated when compared to the values detected in zzso zzso suggesting a positive correlation between zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso distribution in this group was similar to that observed in zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso did not change the distribution of zzso significantly when tested in zzso zzso No difference in the cellular level of zzso protein between zzso and zzso clones was zzso zzso did not affect the distribution of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso a negative zzso zzso altered zzso distribution from a dispersed zzso pattern to a zzso zzso The latter appearance was similar to that observed in zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that: zzso enhanced zzso zzso induced by zzso stimulation or by increased expression of zzso zzso the cellular distribution of zzso zzso the zzso in zzso distribution induced by zzso zzso provides evidence for zzso interaction of zzso and zzso that can be inhibited by a negative zzso but not by a neutral zzso and zzso zzso influences the activity state of zzso that displays a zzso distribution pattern comparable to that observed when zzso is activated via zzso stimulation or directly by zzso zzso
