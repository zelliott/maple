Recent investigations have demonstrated that zzso of zzso involves the zzso of protein zzso C zzso In the present study the effects of different zzso and selective zzso zzso on zzso zzso release from human zzso were zzso While potent but zzso zzso such as zzso exerted a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso release, zzso derivatives with high selectivity for zzso zzso the zzso zzso The results provide evidence that the zzso zzso activity of protein zzso zzso is zzso correlated with their specificity for zzso This may confirm the hypothesis that zzso exerts a negative zzso role during the process of stimulus zzso following zzso zzso in zzso Moreover, investigations with zzso zzso and zzso derivatives as potent zzso zzso show that direct cellular zzso zzso and zzso zzso release are not closely zzso
