zzso zzso is expressed in the nucleus zzso zzso zzso of the zzso where zzso oxide zzso plays an important role in cardiovascular zzso The zzso zzso and their receptors are important regulators of energy zzso and cardiovascular functions in the central nervous zzso In this study, we investigated the cardiovascular effect of zzso hormone zzso a zzso zzso and its relationship with NO zzso in the zzso of spontaneously zzso rats zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso into the zzso resulted in a zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso was abolished by zzso with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso A zzso the downstream zzso of zzso zzso by previous injection of zzso zzso also zzso the cardiovascular effect of zzso To zzso the role of NO zzso in zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso a universal inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso partially reversed the zzso and zzso effects of zzso Furthermore, previous application of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso attenuated the cardiovascular effect of zzso zzso analysis revealed the zzso of zzso but not zzso with zzso in the zzso of zzso In zzso zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso via zzso zzso which activates zzso and zzso
