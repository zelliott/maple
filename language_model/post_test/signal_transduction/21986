T zzso zzso occurs via pathways based on zzso or zzso zzso zzso is a protein present in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso T zzso and is zzso to form pores on target cell zzso In fish, although the involvement of zzso in zzso have been suggested for several species, zzso zzso of zzso zzso in conjunction with expression of the zzso gene has not been zzso In order to investigate the killing mechanism of zzso zzso by zzso zzso in fish, we measured zzso of target cells triggered by zzso zzso performed zzso zzso in the presence or absence of zzso zzso zzso A and zzso and zzso the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we found that zzso attached with target zzso zzso should have direct contact with target cells to kill zzso zzso 50% of target cells were positive for zzso V after zzso with zzso zzso indicating the induction of zzso cell zzso zzso A, which zzso zzso of zzso resulting in zzso function, suppressed the zzso of zzso cells in a zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso by zzso zzso were significantly suppressed by the addition of the zzso agents zzso or zzso and the addition of zzso restored the killing mechanism of target zzso We further found enhanced expression of zzso but not zzso or zzso in zzso from zzso zzso The present study has demonstrated that zzso zzso kill target cells through zzso pathway, suggesting that zzso zzso is zzso throughout zzso
