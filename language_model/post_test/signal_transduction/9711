The link between cancer and metabolism has been suggested for a long time but further evidence of this hypothesis came from the recent molecular characterization of the zzso signaling zzso as a tumor zzso zzso Besides the discovery of zzso zzso in the zzso gene in certain type of zzso a critical emerging point was that the zzso axis remains generally functional and could be zzso by pharmacological molecules such as zzso in cancer zzso zzso most of experimental evidence of the zzso activity of zzso zzso comes from the study of solid tumors such as breast or prostate zzso and only few data are available in zzso zzso although recent works emphasized the potential therapeutic value of zzso zzso in this zzso Further basic research work should be conducted to zzso the molecular targets of zzso responsible for its zzso activity in parallel of conducting clinical trials using zzso zzso or new zzso zzso agents to explore the potential of the zzso signaling zzso as a new target for zzso drug zzso
