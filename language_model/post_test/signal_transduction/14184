zzso fatty acid synthesis zzso shares zzso with the zzso cycle as a common zzso and is required for the production of zzso acid zzso precursors of zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso is a zzso zzso essential for zzso In a genetic screen in zzso zzso designed to further zzso the zzso role of zzso we isolated zzso with defects in zzso zzso gene expression zzso indicating a novel link to zzso gene expression and respiratory chain zzso In our ensuing analysis, we show that zzso but not zzso per se, is required for respiratory zzso We demonstrate that zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso translation and respiratory complex zzso and provide evidence that not zzso se, but fatty acids longer than zzso play a role in these zzso We also show that zzso and zzso strains suffer from a mild zzso zzso that may contribute to the respiratory complex assembly zzso Based on our data and previously published information, we propose a model implicating zzso as a sensor for zzso zzso availability and a zzso of nuclear and zzso gene expression by adapting the zzso compartment to changes in the zzso status of the zzso
