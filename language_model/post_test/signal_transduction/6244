zzso cell death zzso is zzso in a wide variety of zzso to refine structure in developing zzso and zzso However, little is understood about the mechanisms that, within a developing zzso combine signals to selectively remove some cells while sparing essential zzso One popular system for studying this question is the developing zzso zzso zzso where excess zzso support cells are removed to refine the patterned zzso zzso In this paper, we present data indicating that zzso occurs earlier within the zzso zzso than previously zzso As with later zzso this death is dependent on zzso zzso Surprisingly, altering zzso zzso Growth Factor zzso or Ras zzso activity had no effect on this zzso Instead, our evidence indicates a role for zzso signaling to provoke this cell zzso Together, these signals regulate an intermediate step in the selective removal of zzso zzso cells that is necessary for a precise retinal zzso
