zzso both zzso and zzso zzso pathways can induce transplant tolerance in some, but not all, transplant zzso Under stringent conditions, however, this protocol often completely fails to block zzso zzso The precise nature of such zzso zzso rejection is largely zzso In the present study we developed a new model in which both zzso and zzso two conventional T cell zzso zzso are genetically knocked out zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and used this model to examine the role of novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso mice vigorously rejected fully zzso zzso skin zzso zzso survival time, 12 zzso zzso zzso 6) compared with the zzso controls zzso survival time, 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is critically important in skin zzso rejection in this model, as blocking the zzso zzso pathway, but not the zzso zzso zzso or zzso pathway, markedly prolonged skin zzso survival in zzso zzso zzso The critical role of zzso zzso in zzso rejection is further confirmed in zzso zzso mice, as blocking the zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso blockade induced long term skin zzso survival zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our study revealed a key cellular mechanism of rejection and identified zzso as a critical alternative zzso zzso in zzso zzso
