High zzso zzso can develop near zzso sources during zzso signaling and might lead to localized regulation of zzso zzso By shifting the amount of zzso and other zzso associated with zzso local high zzso zzso might also alter the zzso available for zzso and zzso zzso To study this, simultaneous equations were solved over a range of zzso and zzso zzso to determine the general effects of zzso on the zzso of free and zzso and zzso forms of zzso To obtain a more specific picture of the changes that might occur in smooth muscle cells, mathematical models of zzso diffusion and regulation were used to predict the magnitude and time course of zzso zzso zzso and their effects on the free and bound forms of zzso near the zzso The results of this work indicate that changes in free zzso concentration over the range of 50 zzso zzso would result in significant changes in free zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso concentration zzso
