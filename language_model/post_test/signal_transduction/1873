The killing and removal of superfluous cells is an important step during embryonic development, tissue zzso wound repair and the resolution of zzso A specific sequence of zzso events leads to a form of cell death termed zzso and ultimately to the zzso of the dead cell for zzso Dynamic zzso of the zzso zzso are central to the zzso changes observed both in zzso and zzso Recent research has highlighted the importance of zzso zzso zzso pathways to these changes in cellular zzso In this review, we will discuss how these signal zzso pathways affect the structure of the zzso zzso and allow for the efficient clearance of zzso zzso
