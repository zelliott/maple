The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an effective agent for the reversal of acute cellular zzso zzso rejection which offers several advantages over conventional zzso zzso These include reduced morbidity and a more rapid decrease in serum zzso zzso In the studies presented here comparing zzso and zzso soluble zzso is shown to be a zzso zzso cell zzso Evidence for its lack of zzso potential includes in zzso failure to stimulate zzso proliferation either alone or in the presence of zzso doses of zzso zzso failure to induce the expression of early and late zzso zzso and failure to induce zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Analysis of acute zzso zzso rejection patient plasma zzso levels 2 h after the first dose support the hypothesis that zzso has reduced zzso activity in zzso Both zzso alpha and zzso gamma patient plasma levels are significantly reduced in zzso as compared to zzso zzso However, zzso is capable of cellular signaling as demonstrated by its ability to induce zzso and zzso release in the human T cell line zzso Thus zzso retains the potent zzso activity of zzso with reduced zzso
