It is well established that in the majority of the population language processing is zzso to the left zzso Evidence suggests that zzso is also present in the zzso In the current study, the syllable zzso was presented zzso to the right and left ears and zzso responses from the zzso were recorded in adults with symmetrical zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso presentation occurred earlier than those to zzso presentation in two zzso of the frequency following response zzso and approached significance for the third peak of the zzso and the offset zzso Interestingly, there were no differences in zzso zzso indicating the response to zzso presentation simply occurred earlier over this zzso zzso also showed more robust frequency zzso when stimuli were presented to the right ear than the left zzso The effect was found for the zzso of the fundamental that zzso to the first zzso of the zzso but was not seen in the fundamental frequency zzso The results suggest that left zzso of processing acoustic elements important for discriminating speech extends to the auditory zzso and that these effects are speech zzso
