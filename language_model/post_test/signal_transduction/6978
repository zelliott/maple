zzso cardiac zzso is a major risk factor for developing heart failure, the leading cause of death in the zzso zzso factor 1 zzso a transforming growth zzso family member, is a regulator of cell growth and differentiation in both embryonic and adult zzso Evidence from human and animal studies suggests that zzso may play an important role in cardiac physiology and zzso However, a critical role for zzso in cardiac zzso has not been zzso Here, we performed zzso and zzso studies using zzso zzso knockout mice and transgenic mice to determine the role of zzso in pathological cardiac zzso which was induced by zzso zzso zzso The extent of cardiac zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso and molecular zzso Our results demonstrated that cardiac specific zzso zzso in the heart markedly attenuated cardiac zzso fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction, whereas loss of zzso in zzso exaggerated the pathological cardiac zzso and dysfunction in response to pressure zzso zzso we revealed that the zzso effect of zzso on cardiac zzso was associated with the zzso of the zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso plays a protective role in cardiac zzso via the negative regulation of the zzso and zzso signaling zzso
