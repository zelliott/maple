zzso maps are zzso highly ordered structures that are essential for organizing and presenting synaptic zzso Within the embryonic nervous system of zzso zzso zzso are organized zzso as a zzso map that reflects their pattern of zzso in the muscle zzso Here we reveal that this fundamental organizational principle exists in adult zzso where the zzso of leg zzso also generate a zzso zzso A single zzso zzso zzso generates different leg zzso zzso starting with those zzso zzso targets and zzso zzso regions and producing progeny that zzso zzso muscle targets and lateral zzso later in the zzso Thus the cellular distinctions in peripheral targets and central zzso zzso which make up the zzso map, are linked to the zzso of these zzso Our zzso analysis of zzso growth reveals that this zzso map is generated by zzso We demonstrate that the zzso positioning of zzso zzso in the leg zzso is controlled by the zzso zzso systems zzso and zzso These results reveal that zzso targeting plays a major role in the formation of zzso maps and suggests that the coordinate spatial control of both zzso and zzso elements by global zzso signals may be an important mechanism for establishing the specificity of synaptic zzso
