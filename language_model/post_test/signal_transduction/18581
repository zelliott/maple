zzso is an zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso and degradation and implicated in tumor zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso is zzso as a zzso zzso protein and is processed in the zzso compartment to an active zzso zzso where it is stored in a stable zzso In contrast, its zzso zzso zzso is localized zzso suggesting the existence of mechanisms that trigger zzso zzso Here we show that zzso of the active zzso is zzso by the protein zzso A and C zzso Moreover, zzso of active zzso was observed upon cell stimulation with zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso as well as by the zzso zzso analogue zzso zzso Indeed, zzso zzso was noted upon cell stimulation with a specific zzso zzso zzso and was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso resembled the zzso of zzso D, a zzso zzso indicating that the zzso zzso is of zzso zzso We suggest that zzso of active zzso is initiated by zzso cues zzso the protein zzso A and C signaling zzso The zzso zzso then facilitate cell invasion associated with cancer zzso zzso and zzso
