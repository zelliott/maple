zzso a critical process in both health and disease, is zzso by a number of signaling zzso Although zzso zzso including vascular zzso growth factor zzso basic zzso growth factor zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are known to promote blood vessel formation, their downstream targets are ill zzso We sought to investigate the signaling pathways required for vessel assembly by utilizing a three-dimensional collagen zzso in which human zzso vein zzso cells zzso form zzso zzso Our data show that zzso is sufficient for the induction of zzso and that protein zzso C zzso is necessary for this zzso zzso of zzso zzso alpha and zzso revealed that these proteins are uniquely zzso zzso of an additional zzso target, protein zzso D zzso demonstrated that this zzso becomes zzso in zzso and may therefore be involved in zzso zzso Further examination of downstream zzso of zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso is critical for zzso and is accordingly zzso in response to zzso zzso however, zzso of zzso is independent of zzso zzso In addition, we show that the zzso target zzso zzso zzso is required for vessel zzso These findings illustrate the complexities of blood vessel formation, and suggest that zzso zzso multiple independent pathways to invoke a complete zzso zzso
