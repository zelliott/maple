zzso cells zzso are zzso cells zzso residing in zzso where they critically regulate immunity and zzso The zzso zzso zzso is part of the late zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso and zzso target of zzso zzso zzso complex, thereby contributing to the signal zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso represents an important regulator for zzso sorting processes within the zzso zzso dysfunctional zzso leads to a human zzso disorder with zzso defects in immune zzso Because zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso trafficking, growth factor zzso and cell zzso we investigated the role of zzso in mouse zzso using a conditional knockout mouse zzso zzso animals displayed a virtually complete loss of zzso in the zzso early after birth due to impaired proliferation and increased zzso of zzso zzso analysis after application of contact zzso leads to the recruitment of a transient zzso population, predominantly consisting of short-term zzso The underlying molecular mechanism involves the zzso disruption of the zzso complex which results in the malfunction of both zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso we conclude that zzso acts as a novel and essential regulator of zzso zzso in zzso
