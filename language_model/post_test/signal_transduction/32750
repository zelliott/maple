The zzso growth hormone is the major growth factor of activated T zzso during a developing immune zzso zzso is required not only for cell cycle progression but also to protect zzso T cells from programmed cell zzso In several cell types, zzso of zzso B and/or zzso zzso zzso has been demonstrated to be extremely important in blocking zzso To determine whether either or both of these zzso factors are involved in cell survival or cell cycle progression in response to zzso primary human T cells responsive to the growth factor were analyzed for zzso B and zzso zzso The current study clearly demonstrates that zzso does not induce I zzso B alpha degradation or zzso B zzso in primary human T cells that respond to zzso by entering the cell cycle and avoiding zzso Similarly, zzso neither activates zzso nor increases zzso binding activity to a consensus zzso zzso zzso response zzso On the other hand, the growth factor does induce the zzso of zzso and zzso in these cells, as has been previously zzso These data show that neither zzso B nor zzso zzso is required for zzso survival or cell cycle progression in activated primary human T zzso
