zzso of zzso is thought to generate the specificity of zzso zzso action in cardiac zzso with zzso zzso playing a major role in this process by preventing zzso zzso We tested this hypothesis in adult rat zzso zzso by characterizing zzso involved in the regulation of zzso signals and zzso zzso current zzso on stimulation with zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso E1 receptors zzso All receptors but zzso increased total zzso and zzso of zzso with zzso strongly zzso these zzso When monitored in single cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso channels, stimulation of zzso and zzso increased zzso whereas zzso and zzso had no zzso zzso Selective zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signals, whereas zzso zzso was zzso only by zzso zzso zzso and zzso generated substantial zzso increases only when zzso and zzso were zzso For all receptors except zzso the zzso of zzso closely matched the ones obtained with zzso zzso Indeed, zzso and zzso controlled zzso and zzso regulation of zzso whereas only zzso controlled zzso regulation of zzso thus demonstrating that zzso zzso has functional implications downstream of zzso zzso had no effect on zzso even after blockade of zzso or zzso suggesting that other mechanisms prevent zzso produced by zzso to diffuse to zzso zzso zzso These results identify specific functional zzso of individual zzso families to zzso receptors as a major mechanism enabling cardiac cells to generate zzso zzso signals in response to different zzso
