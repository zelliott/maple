The plasma membrane consists of a mosaic of functional zzso zzso a variety of zzso processes associated with the cell zzso In most cells, the majority of the cell surface is zzso zzso leading to difficulties in characterizing its organization and zzso zzso The reliance on indirect and zzso techniques has led to vigorous debate concerning the nature and even existence of some zzso Recently, increasing technical sophistication has been applied to study cell surface zzso providing evidence for small, short-lived clusters that may be much less than 50 zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso highly ordered zzso that have received most attention in recent years, yet their precise roles in regulating functions such as cell zzso remain to be zzso zzso of zzso zzso follows a zzso route to both early zzso and zzso zzso The observation that a variety of cellular pathogens zzso to and zzso with these zzso provides an additional incentive to characterize the organization, dynamics and functions of these zzso
