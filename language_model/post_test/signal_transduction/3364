Light is an important zzso of plant immune zzso Here, we show that zzso of the zzso zzso B zzso by a low zzso ratio zzso which is a signal of competition in plant zzso zzso the expression of defense markers induced by the zzso fungus zzso zzso including the genes that zzso the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and the plant zzso zzso zzso zzso This effect of low zzso correlated with a reduced sensitivity to zzso zzso thus resembling the zzso effects of salicylic acid zzso on zzso zzso Low zzso failed to zzso zzso zzso levels in a transgenic line in which zzso zzso was zzso by zzso expression of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso background zzso These results suggest that the low zzso effect, in contrast to the zzso effect, requires a functional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the effect of low zzso depressing the zzso response was zzso in zzso impaired in zzso signaling zzso and zzso Plant exposure to low zzso ratios and the zzso zzso markedly increased plant zzso to zzso zzso the effect of low zzso was zzso independent of the zzso of the zzso syndrome, zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso absent in two zzso interference lines disrupted for the expression of the zzso zzso zzso our results suggest that low zzso ratios zzso zzso zzso zzso immune responses against zzso zzso via a zzso mechanism that requires the zzso zzso zzso and that this effect may increase plant zzso to zzso infection in dense zzso
