zzso zzso relies on a complex interplay of zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso sonic zzso zzso is required for pancreatic development in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and its signaling zzso establish this dependence as specific to zzso but not zzso zzso Using zzso to inhibit zzso zzso we show that transient zzso signaling is necessary during zzso for subsequent differentiation of zzso into zzso zzso A second zzso activity occurring later in development was also identified and may be analogous to the known action of zzso in gut zzso to direct zzso of pancreatic zzso The early action of zzso may be part of a more general process allowing neuroendocrine cells to originate in zzso derived zzso
