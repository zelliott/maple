Strong production of zzso proteins interferes with cellular processes in many zzso zzso of precursors and energy urges the cell to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso stress responses are zzso and hence the cellular activity is shifted from growth to zzso of zzso This may result in zzso of growth or low level of product zzso The extent of the bacterial stress response is determined by the specific properties of the zzso zzso and by the rates of zzso and zzso Taking into account the capacities of the host for protein processing and zzso adaptation, production schemes can be developed that enhance zzso productivity and zzso of the zzso
