zzso zzso factor 1 zzso is an zzso zzso that is believed to act solely via its zzso zzso zzso Evidence is now provided for the existence of a different zzso binding and signaling zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso strongly expressed zzso and exhibited high binding capacity for zzso labeled zzso However, zzso binding was not correlated with the zzso expression level and was virtually unaffected by the specific zzso zzso zzso or zzso Similar observations were made in zzso cells of mouse and human zzso Also, zzso failed to block zzso zzso and zzso zzso signal zzso via zzso zzso zzso 1/2 in zzso In contrast, zzso binding and signaling were almost completely inhibited by the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Together, our data point to the existence of an additional zzso through which zzso exerts its biological effects in zzso zzso
