Among the various zzso cells, zzso are critical for maintaining the integrity of the vascular zzso They must be rapidly activated by sequential and coordinated mechanisms in order to efficiently prevent zzso upon vascular zzso Several signal zzso pathways lead to zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso among them, several are initiated via receptors or zzso containing zzso zzso zzso motifs zzso which trigger downstream zzso like the immune receptors in zzso However, in contrast to immune cells for which the role of zzso zzso in zzso has largely been zzso the involvement of zzso zzso membrane zzso in zzso zzso has been investigated only zzso The results obtained until now strongly suggest that early steps of zzso zzso via the collagen zzso zzso or via zzso occur zzso in these zzso where specific proteins efficiently organize key downstream zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso also contribute to zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso They are sites where the zzso zzso metabolism is highly active, leading to a local generation of zzso second zzso such as zzso zzso Here, evidence is accumulating that zzso membrane zzso are part of a general process that contributes to the efficiency and the coordination of zzso zzso zzso Here we will discuss the zzso and functional zzso of human zzso zzso and their potential impact in zzso zzso
