zzso zzso is the most devastating pathogen of rice and the main cause of crop losses zzso The successful management of blast disease caused by this fungus is a clear zzso The synthetic zzso zzso has been characterized by its zzso of zzso zzso zzso formation on zzso zzso Growth and the ability of zzso to zzso was not affected by zzso indicating the lack of toxicity on zzso zzso The addition of the zzso zzso zzso does not interfere with the zzso effect of zzso on in zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso of zzso formation by zzso was nullified by the zzso addition of zzso Our results suggest that zzso affects the zzso zzso by repression of the gene expression of zzso which encodes a sensing surface zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was reduced after zzso treatment specifically blocking zzso zzso Our results support zzso as a promising compound to control rice blast disease by blocking a specific target related to zzso formation, a process essential for infection of rice zzso Moreover, zzso is proposed as a lead compound to develop novel specific zzso with improved zzso
