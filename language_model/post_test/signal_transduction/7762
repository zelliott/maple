Several recent studies demonstrated the potential of zzso using zzso stem cells in zzso zzso Adult human zzso stem cells zzso derived from bone zzso have the zzso to differentiate into cells of zzso origin, zzso bone, cartilage, zzso and muscle zzso they, therefore, have many potential clinical zzso On the other hand, stem cells possess a zzso capability similar to cancer zzso For safety evaluation of tissue engineered medical devices using normal zzso in this study, we investigated the expression levels of several genes that affect cell proliferation in zzso during in zzso zzso We focused on the relationship between the zzso proliferation and their transforming growth factor beta zzso signaling during in zzso zzso The proliferation rate of zzso gradually decreased and cellular zzso was observed for about 3 zzso The zzso expressions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso type I zzso in zzso increased with the length of cell zzso The zzso expressions of zzso increased, but those of zzso and zzso decreased with the length zzso were in in zzso zzso In addition, the expression profiles of the genes which regulate cellular proliferation in zzso were significantly different from those of cancer zzso In conclusion, zzso derived from bone zzso seldom underwent spontaneous transformation during 1-2 months in zzso culture for use in clinical zzso In zzso as well as in zzso cells, growth might be controlled by the zzso family zzso
