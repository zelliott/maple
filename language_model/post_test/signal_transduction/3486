Carcinoma cells must circumvent the normally zzso signals to zzso While often considered zzso signals for adherent cells, zzso zzso have recently been correlated positively with cancer progression though the molecular basis remains zzso 

Here, we examined the expression and function of two zzso zzso in human prostate cancer zzso and cell zzso Globally, both zzso zzso and protein were elevated in localized and zzso human cancer zzso compared to zzso Additionally, zzso zzso level was zzso while zzso zzso was zzso in these prostate cancer zzso In contrast to normal prostate zzso cells zzso zzso was up to half the zzso in the invasive and zzso zzso and zzso prostate cancer cells, but not in the localized zzso zzso Instead of zzso cell migration as in zzso cells, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso promoted cell zzso and zzso in both zzso and zzso cells via zzso and zzso zzso zzso diminution of cell zzso in zzso cells is likely a result of zzso zzso and zzso zzso via zzso signal zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso in zzso cells decreased cell movement and zzso 

These data suggest that the zzso expression of zzso and zzso of zzso may switch a progression zzso to a zzso signal to promote prostate tumor zzso via stimulating cell migration and zzso
