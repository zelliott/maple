The zzso zzso acid zzso regulates plant growth and development as well as stress zzso To gain more insights into zzso zzso a population of zzso zzso zzso zzso was screened on the basis of the zzso effect on the zzso of seed zzso Two novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso and zzso were characterized as zzso of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, as zzso zzso zzso and zzso these two zzso were renamed zzso and zzso The zzso zzso was an zzso hypersensitive zzso for seed zzso and root zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso revealed that the expression of zzso and zzso genes was increased in zzso as compared with the wild type zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso showed that zzso was also more sensitive to salt and zzso zzso The zzso zzso also showed zzso to zzso during seed zzso Further analysis showed that, among the zzso zzso zzso all the other zzso were not only enhanced in sensitivity to zzso salt and zzso stress, but also enhanced the expression of zzso zzso In addition to the zzso in the zzso zzso the interruption of the production of crucial components of other small zzso pathways such as zzso zzso and zzso also caused zzso zzso during zzso
