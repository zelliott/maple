Previous studies have shown that food zzso which occurs naturally in the life cycle of many species of fish, results in zzso of growth and zzso of stored energy reserves, including zzso In this study, we used rainbow trout zzso zzso to identify the cellular mechanisms involved with this zzso zzso Fish were placed on one of five dietary zzso continuously for 2 or 4 weeks, zzso continuously for 2 or 4 weeks, or zzso 2 weeks then zzso 2 zzso the effects on zzso growth and zzso zzso and on the zzso state of signaling elements zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in selected zzso were zzso zzso for either 2 or 4 weeks significantly retarded growth in terms of body weight, body zzso and body zzso zzso restored growth such that body length and body condition were similar to measures seen in continuously fed zzso zzso activated zzso zzso by stimulating the zzso expression and zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso have been zzso and the expression of both forms of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso fish were significantly elevated over levels in fed fish in all zzso In zzso zzso liver, and white muscle, zzso activity was significantly elevated in zzso and zzso zzso fish compared to fed zzso whereas in red muscle, zzso activity was significantly elevated compared to fed fish after 4 weeks of zzso zzso reversed both zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso liver, and red and white zzso By contrast, zzso activated zzso and zzso in all zzso zzso zzso reversed zzso zzso in the zzso state of all signal zzso These findings suggest that zzso of zzso and zzso in conjunction with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso growth zzso and zzso
