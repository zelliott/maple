Bone zzso proteins zzso are zzso growth factors that influence diverse processes such as skeletal development, zzso and zzso They play crucial roles in diseases such as pulmonary zzso hypertension zzso In zzso zzso of the zzso type II receptors zzso were zzso and their functions were impaired during zzso zzso It is thought that expression levels of these receptors determine the fate of zzso zzso with low levels of expression leading to decreased zzso zzso in zzso However, our studies zzso for the first time, that the zzso of receptors on the plasma zzso in this case zzso was zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are known to be involved in zzso were chosen as our model zzso Our results show that all three zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although the three zzso reached the cell membrane and their expression was lower than that of zzso they formed smaller clusters and associated differently with membrane zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso The disruption of these zzso restored the zzso signaling of zzso and zzso to the level of zzso zzso showing that these zzso were trapped in the zzso rather than just expressed at a lower level on the zzso zzso new treatment options for zzso should also target zzso zzso rather than just expression zzso
