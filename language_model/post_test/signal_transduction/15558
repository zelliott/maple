During the zzso zzso reaction zzso B cells with zzso or zzso zzso receptors are zzso selected by zzso to generate B cell repertoire with appropriate zzso zzso We studied the molecular mechanism of zzso and B cell zzso zzso zzso to shed light on the zzso events involved in the negative selection of zzso B zzso As an experimental model, we used human zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso which originates from a zzso B cell, and zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso or dominant negative zzso zzso zzso zzso was dependent on the zzso zzso since the zzso of zzso a natural inhibitor of zzso zzso blocked zzso induced by zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was not involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the typical characteristics of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso was involved in zzso DNA zzso while zzso showed only marginal zzso zzso zzso of zzso could block all zzso changes induced by zzso As a novel finding, we demonstrate that zzso can enhance the zzso release and collapse of zzso membrane potential zzso during zzso zzso The requirement of different zzso pathways in zzso induced by zzso and zzso may be relevant, since zzso and zzso zzso can thus be regulated zzso and targeted to different zzso of zzso B zzso
