Bone zzso proteins zzso members of the transforming growth zzso zzso play a variety of roles during mouse zzso zzso type II zzso zzso is a type II zzso zzso zzso which zzso signals for zzso through zzso complexes with type I zzso including zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso and zzso To zzso the function of zzso in zzso development, we generated zzso zzso mice by gene zzso zzso zzso zzso were arrested at the egg cylinder stage and could not be recovered at zzso days zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso zzso failed to form organized structure and lacked zzso The zzso zzso zzso are zzso very similar to the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is important for zzso zzso signals during early mouse zzso Moreover, the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso exhibited an zzso character, although the expression of zzso genes for the visceral zzso was essentially zzso Our results suggest that the function of zzso is essential for zzso differentiation and zzso induction during early mouse zzso
