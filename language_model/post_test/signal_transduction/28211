One of the mechanisms responsible for the zzso resistance zzso zzso of cancer cells is zzso of so-called zzso drug zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso gene and the zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso by the zzso zzso The purpose of the present study was to verify the hypothesis zzso that zzso zzso apart from enabling drug zzso zzso on the cells resistance to zzso by zzso zzso and zzso 

Human zzso cells, either zzso or with the zzso zzso caused by zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso were treated with the natural dye zzso at 50 zzso M or with zzso to induce zzso zzso of cell death were assessed by zzso observation after zzso zzso DNA fragmentation was measured by flow zzso and the zzso method, and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso c release from zzso were measured by Western zzso 

zzso induced cell death in zzso cells, both sensitive and with the zzso zzso which could be classified as zzso zzso together with zzso c release, zzso of zzso and zzso DNA zzso No active zzso was zzso Also zzso caused zzso zzso in both the sensitive and the zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings show that there was no correlation between zzso expression and resistance to zzso zzso induced by zzso and zzso at least in zzso zzso However, we cannot exclude the possibility of parallel zzso expression and zzso zzso in some other cell lines, as cancer cells can acquire many different zzso zzso
