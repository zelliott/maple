zzso virus infection zzso chronic zzso disease in mice and has been investigated as an infectious model for multiple sclerosis zzso zzso plays an important role in the zzso of both the zzso disease model zzso and this viral model for zzso However, zzso is known to play an important protective role against certain viral zzso zzso it is unclear whether zzso signaling plays a protective or zzso role in the development of zzso zzso zzso 

Female zzso mice and zzso mice zzso zzso were infected with zzso zzso zzso virus (1 zzso 106 zzso zzso in the development of zzso disease and changes in the zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso production, and immune responses in the zzso of infected mice were analyzed using quantitative zzso zzso and flow zzso 

Administration of zzso thereby zzso resistant B6 mice susceptible to zzso zzso disease, induced a high level of zzso zzso Interestingly, infection of zzso into zzso resistant zzso zzso mice also induced zzso zzso zzso High viral persistence was found in the late stage of viral infection in zzso mice, although there were few differences in the initial zzso immune responses and viral persistent levels between the zzso B6 and zzso zzso The initial type I zzso responses and the expression of zzso and zzso were higher in the zzso of zzso zzso mice, leading to deficiencies in T cell function that permit viral zzso 

These results suggest that the presence of high zzso level exerts the zzso role by zzso zzso zzso responses, whereas the lack of zzso signals promotes viral persistence in the spinal zzso due to insufficient T cell zzso by zzso the production of zzso zzso and regulatory zzso zzso the balance of zzso signaling appears to be extremely important for the protection from zzso zzso disease, and either too much or too little signaling promotes the development of zzso
