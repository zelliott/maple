The cellular zzso status and the exposure to soluble growth factors both contribute to zzso protein zzso zzso zzso To date, however, whether zzso acting through zzso receptors zzso need cell zzso to activate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, 2 has been poorly zzso We addressed this point in primary cultures of zzso cells zzso maintained in suspension, considering that zzso hormone zzso activates zzso 2 in attached zzso cells by acting through a zzso We found that zzso actively zzso zzso 2, in a zzso but zzso protein zzso zzso manner, and this zzso required the activity of a zzso zzso In comparison, in the absence of zzso zzso 2 were still activated by zzso growth factor, in a zzso zzso Altogether, these data suggest that sensitivity of the zzso zzso response toward cell zzso may zzso at least in part, on the class of zzso zzso or zzso with zzso zzso activity, by which it is zzso
