zzso zzso cells zzso can be expanded from different zzso We compared the influence of inflammation and zzso zzso on the zzso and function of zzso derived from bone zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso and Wharton's jelly zzso zzso were featured by a lack of zzso zzso While inflammation zzso zzso in all three zzso types, zzso zzso was observed only on zzso zzso zzso increased the production of inflammatory zzso in zzso and zzso but not in zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso Although inflammation increased in all zzso types the zzso of inflammatory zzso additional zzso triggering did not have further effect on zzso The zzso potential of zzso on zzso was affected neither by inflammation nor by zzso zzso This resistance was related to an overproduction of zzso These data indicate that zzso source could be of importance while designing zzso cell therapy in zzso
