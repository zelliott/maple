zzso zzso zzso zzso in budding zzso has classically been associated with zzso of zzso and other genes involved in zzso zzso To identify all zzso zzso genes that are necessary for growth in the absence of zzso we carried out a zzso zzso screening for deletion zzso exhibiting zzso zzso under one or more growth zzso We report the identification of zzso zzso including 385 genes not previously reported, which exhibit this zzso when zzso The identified genes are involved in a wide range of cellular zzso but are particularly enriched in those affecting transcription, protein zzso membrane trafficking, diverse stress responses, and zzso zzso Among the zzso zzso involved in stress response, many exhibited zzso that are strengthened at elevated temperature and/or when zzso is present in the zzso The role of zzso in regulation of zzso metabolism and stress response signaling is zzso
