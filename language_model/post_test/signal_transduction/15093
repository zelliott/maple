Two scientific areas have recently emerged that can revolutionize cancer zzso First, an understanding of the different cellular signaling pathways implicated in the development and progression of cancer resulting in poor prognosis and drug resistance, have identified potential drug zzso zzso of signal zzso pathways are currently in the zzso zzso zzso has emerged as an exciting multidisciplinary field promising to provide breakthrough solutions to the problems of zzso the efficacy or therapeutic index of zzso zzso The promise of zzso lies in the ability to engineer zzso zzso zzso that can be loaded with one or more zzso such as zzso targeting units, imaging and diagnostic zzso This review addresses the potential integration of these two approaches to engineer zzso that can target various signal zzso pathways in zzso
