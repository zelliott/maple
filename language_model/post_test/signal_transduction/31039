Evidence suggests that bone zzso zzso cells may give rise to a significant proportion of smooth muscle cells zzso that contribute to zzso zzso after vascular zzso however, the molecular pathways involved and the timeline of these events remain poorly zzso We hypothesized that the stem cell factor zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso is critical to zzso formation by zzso zzso zzso zzso artery injury in mice zzso with zzso zzso cells expressing yellow fluorescent protein was performed, which revealed that zzso of the zzso zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso in the zzso were from zzso To characterize the role of the zzso pathway, we used zzso deficient zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso vascular injury in these mice resulted in almost a complete zzso of zzso formation, whereas zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso mice led to zzso formation in a similar fashion as zzso animals, as did chronic administration of zzso in zzso zzso mice, a model of soluble zzso zzso zzso antagonism of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso also resulted in a marked reduction in zzso zzso zzso injury resulted in the local zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso to the injured vascular wall and differentiated into zzso zzso zzso injury also caused an increase in circulating zzso levels which promoted zzso PC zzso a response that was blunted in zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso promoted zzso of zzso PCs to zzso Additionally, zzso zzso inhibited zzso of zzso PCs to activated zzso and diminished zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso signaling plays a pivotal role in the development of zzso by zzso PCs and that the zzso of this zzso may serve as a novel therapeutic target to limit zzso vascular zzso
