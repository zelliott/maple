zzso zzso entry, a mode of zzso influx activated by depletion of zzso from the internal stores, has been detected in a wide variety of cell types and may be the primary mechanism for zzso entry in zzso zzso Nevertheless, until recently, no candidate zzso channel zzso had been identified zzso Through the zzso of zzso zzso a candidate zzso referred to as zzso zzso Potential zzso has been identified that is essential for the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso A combination of in zzso and in zzso studies has provided strong evidence that zzso is a bona fide zzso Moreover, zzso forms a zzso complex, proposed to be critical for feedback regulation and/or zzso that includes zzso zzso C, protein zzso C, zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso seems to be a scaffolding protein that links zzso with several of these other proteins in the zzso zzso also complexes with a related channel zzso zzso to form a zzso with zzso characteristics distinct from those of zzso or zzso zzso A family of proteins related to zzso is zzso from zzso zzso to humans, and recent evidence indicates that at least some of these proteins are zzso The human zzso proteins may mediate many of the zzso zzso that have been identified previously in a plethora of human zzso
