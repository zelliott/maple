The presence of zzso zzso distinct zzso sites on a wide range of zzso families has offered new zzso for small molecules to zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso that target zzso sites offer significant advantages over the corresponding zzso zzso in terms of zzso including zzso selectivity within zzso families, and can also impart improved zzso zzso However, zzso zzso are not a zzso Many chemical issues zzso flat zzso zzso and pharmacological issues zzso zzso zzso that are zzso zzso have zzso zzso the fact that zzso sites are less zzso zzso leads to improved zzso however, this can also lead to species differences that can hinder safety zzso Many zzso zzso possess molecular zzso wherein a small structural change zzso or zzso can zzso the mode of pharmacology or zzso zzso zzso As the field has zzso as described here, key principles and strategies have emerged for the design of zzso for zzso zzso
