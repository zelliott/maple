zzso stem cells zzso are zzso cells which can differentiate into several distinct zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso It has been reported that the zzso zzso factors including zzso related zzso factor 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso and zzso differentiation 1 zzso may play key regulatory roles among the differentiation of zzso Recently, researches have confirmed that the zzso zzso impacts the differentiation fates of zzso through regulating the activity of zzso zzso zzso factors by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso protein zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso boosts the zzso processes and promotes zzso zzso into zzso zzso However, zzso binding to zzso may inhibit the zzso zzso and thus zzso of zzso in zzso stem zzso cells increases the expression of zzso genes and zzso zzso formation through a zzso zzso Moreover, other signaling pathways (such as zzso zzso zzso zzso small molecules zzso zzso zzso and zzso stimuli can also affect the fate by regulating the activity of zzso In this review, we summarized the signaling pattern of zzso zzso and the function mechanism of zzso and/or zzso by enumerating their interaction to several zzso zzso factors and relationship with other signal pathways during zzso zzso
