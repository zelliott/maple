Growth rate is determined not only by zzso cues such as zzso availability but also by zzso zzso Changes in cell zzso in budding zzso zzso by polarization of the zzso zzso have been shown to reduce cell zzso 

Here we demonstrate that polarization of the zzso zzso zzso the highly zzso Target of zzso Complex 1 zzso zzso This zzso is suppressed by zzso of the zzso zzso regulatory zzso complex, which also regulates zzso during nitrogen zzso We further demonstrate that zzso of growth is important for cell recovery after conditions of prolonged polarized zzso 

Our results indicate that extended periods of polarized growth inhibit protein zzso mass zzso and the increase in cell size at least in part through zzso the zzso zzso We speculate that this mechanism serves to coordinate the ability of cells to increase in size with their zzso zzso
