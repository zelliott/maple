The zzso response to a direct immune challenge was examined by in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso injected acutely into rat zzso induced zzso expression for zzso factor zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso and the type 1 zzso zzso zzso patterns were evaluated at select time points ranging from 15 zzso to 3 days zzso zzso injected with vehicle alone were used to control for mechanical zzso Following zzso administration, a wave of zzso induction within brain zzso radiated outward from the injection site, generally zzso in intensity at the zzso time zzso The individual profiles of zzso zzso induction patterns reveal that the zzso immune response to local inflammatory stimulation is quite elaborate and in many ways resembles the progression of zzso induction customary of localized inflammation in peripheral zzso
