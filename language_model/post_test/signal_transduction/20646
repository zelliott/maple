zzso zzso zzso a zzso hormone zzso by zzso L cells, is a potent growth factor for the pancreatic zzso The development of zzso zzso and enhancers as a novel class of zzso medications zzso the importance of zzso the molecular basis of zzso zzso In the present study, we sought to test the hypothesis that zzso recruitment of zzso zzso the zzso action of zzso in zzso Our results show that zzso increased zzso zzso in zzso cells, an effect inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of a zzso zzso zzso protein curtailed zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments showed a physical association between zzso and both zzso and zzso upon zzso zzso Moreover, expression of zzso zzso that lack the ability to bind zzso blunted zzso zzso zzso expression of a zzso zzso that fails to target G zzso receptors to zzso pits for zzso zzso increased zzso zzso We propose that the formation of a signaling complex zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso is required for the action of zzso on zzso zzso
