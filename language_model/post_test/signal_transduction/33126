zzso is an zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso function is a necessary but not sufficient component of the zzso transformation zzso Previously we showed that the zzso site in the zzso promoter is a zzso response element and that zzso appears to induce zzso by initiating a zzso cascade that ultimately activates zzso zzso In this work we have investigated the signaling zzso between the zzso zzso zzso and activated zzso zzso We show that the Ras zzso and zzso zzso zzso are required in this zzso However, in contrast to other aspects of zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso is independent of the zzso zzso Our results also establish a requirement for activated zzso zzso zzso as zzso induction of zzso zzso is blocked by zzso inhibitor zzso and induction of zzso is accompanied by zzso of zzso and zzso Finally, we show that zzso induction of zzso is accompanied by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso On the basis of these data, we propose a model for the signaling path from zzso to zzso
