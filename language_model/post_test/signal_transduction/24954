zzso II zzso zzso and basic zzso growth factor zzso play relevant roles in zzso zzso Since the signaling pathways modulating the zzso effects of zzso II and zzso in human fetal zzso cells zzso are not clearly zzso we carried out experiments to determine whether they would exert their zzso effects by modulating the activity of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso In zzso zzso zzso (20 zzso induced a significant zzso increase in zzso activity and zzso incorporation zzso In contrast, under similar tissue culture conditions, zzso II zzso zzso induced a more modest increase in zzso activity zzso and zzso incorporation (35 zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso almost completely abolished the zzso proliferation in zzso but did not significantly affect zzso II zzso zzso In the presence of the zzso zzso agent zzso zzso II and zzso induced opposite changes in zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso inhibited the zzso and zzso proliferation of zzso through a zzso zzso that included the zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso increased zzso II zzso effects in correlation with a reduction in zzso zzso We conclude that zzso II and zzso zzso the proliferation of zzso through the stimulation of different zzso and independent signaling zzso zzso of zzso is required but not sufficient for zzso in zzso The zzso of zzso in zzso zzso the zzso effects of zzso by a zzso zzso
