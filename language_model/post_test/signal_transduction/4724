zzso play an important role in the development of oral zzso zzso zzso In the current study, we investigate the effect of zzso on growth and zzso of zzso derived from human oral zzso 

zzso were generated by zzso zzso obtained from human oral zzso with transforming growth zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used to investigate zzso effect on proliferation and cell cycle of zzso and zzso zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso were used to examine zzso of zzso Western zzso to determine the levels of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso was employed to examine the levels of collagen type I and III in the zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso proliferation of zzso and zzso it also zzso the cell cycle, zzso zzso and decreases the generation of collagen type I and III in zzso which are more sensitive to its effects than zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso by zzso the zzso zzso zzso 

Our results demonstrate the zzso effect of zzso in zzso It may therefore be a candidate for the treatment of zzso
