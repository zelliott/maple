The zzso Sonic zzso zzso zzso plays multiples roles during central nervous system zzso zzso To zzso the molecular repertoire of zzso zzso we have recently described novel zzso targets in response to zzso zzso zzso Among them, we were able to identify zzso zzso a death dependence zzso as a new direct zzso downstream regulator in neural precursor zzso As appropriate zzso signaling is required for zzso growth and zzso cause zzso zzso zzso here we have addressed the role of the zzso interaction in the context of zzso development and zzso We demonstrate that the zzso zzso regulates zzso expression in mouse models that zzso the zzso zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso zzso directly regulates the zzso gene acting through an upstream sequence in its promoter both in zzso and in zzso in zzso zzso precursor zzso We also identified and characterized a functional zzso site in the first zzso of the human zzso zzso Gene expression profiling of more than 300 zzso shows that zzso is indeed zzso in zzso tumors compared to the other zzso zzso Finally, we provide evidence that zzso is necessary for cell cycle progression in a human zzso cell line, because a loss of function of zzso arrests cells in the zzso zzso Taken together, these results highlight zzso as a novel downstream zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso and a possible therapeutic zzso
