Due to the evolutionary conservation of innate immune mechanisms, zzso has been extensively used as a model for the dissection in genetic terms of innate host immunity to zzso zzso screening in fruit flies has set the stage for the pathways and systems required for responding to immune challenge and the dynamics of the progression of bacterial and zzso zzso In addition, fruit flies have been used as infection models to dissect zzso interactions from both sides of this zzso This chapter describes our current understanding of the zzso of the fruit fly immune response and summarizes the most important findings in this area during the past zzso
