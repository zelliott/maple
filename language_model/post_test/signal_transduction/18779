To determine whether zzso zzso zzso directs the expression of zzso cell zzso factor zzso in zzso and in zzso 

zzso DNA from zzso arthritis zzso zzso zzso treated with zzso and soluble zzso zzso zzso was used to probe a zzso zzso zzso regulation by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso M zzso zzso and leukemia zzso factor zzso was determined by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso regulation of zzso was determined using a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso arthritis zzso was induced in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected by zzso zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso zzso levels of zzso were zzso by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso regulated zzso in a zzso zzso In addition, zzso was regulated by the zzso zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso receptors suggested that zzso regulates zzso via its zzso zzso beta and not its zzso zzso The involvement of zzso in arthritis progression was confirmed in zzso where induction of zzso resulted in a zzso increase in the zzso expression of zzso In contrast, little or no change was observed in zzso mice, in which the inflammatory zzso was markedly reduced and zzso zzso activity was also zzso Analysis of human zzso zzso tissue confirmed that zzso zzso in zzso zzso membrane cells, zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso zzso fluid levels of zzso were significantly higher in zzso patients than in zzso zzso 

zzso presented zzso demonstrate that zzso is regulated via zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso is also actively expressed during zzso Although these data confirm an involvement of zzso in disease zzso the consequence of its action remains to be zzso
