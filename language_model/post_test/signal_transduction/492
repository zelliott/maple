zzso zzso is a zzso protein with a critical role in zzso zzso Although zzso has been implicated in zzso arthritis zzso its underlying mechanism remains zzso In this study, we investigated the role and molecular mechanism of zzso in the induction of 2 key zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso and zzso inflammatory protein zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and quantitative zzso chain reaction were used to determine zzso zzso zzso migration in the presence of zzso was measured by zzso zzso Signaling and molecular events were analyzed by zzso and zzso zzso 

The effect of zzso on inflammatory cell migration was zzso through its unique property of inducing the expression of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The concentration of zzso was significantly elevated in zzso patients and appeared to correlate with the serum levels of inflammation markers and increased expression of zzso or zzso in zzso in zzso zzso zzso production of zzso in zzso zzso fluid was attributable to increased production of zzso or zzso and this effect could be blocked by an zzso zzso Furthermore, the structural motif responsible for this property resided within zzso zzso of human zzso sparing the known zzso or zzso zzso It was evident that the effect of zzso on zzso expression was zzso through both the zzso and zzso zzso involving the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso 

These results support a unique role of zzso in zzso migration, in the context of perpetuation of zzso zzso through the induction of zzso and zzso
