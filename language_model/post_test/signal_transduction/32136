zzso stress and zzso are hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases, which do not play independently but work zzso through complex interactions zzso zzso zzso the mechanism that is directly implicated in controlling zzso stress and inflammatory response could be an attractive strategy to prevent the onset and/or delay the progression of neurodegenerative zzso The zzso factor nuclear zzso zzso zzso is the zzso of zzso zzso by regulating a battery of zzso and phase II zzso zzso which are relevant to defense mechanism against zzso stress and inflammatory zzso In this study, we show that a recently identified zzso zzso zzso E zzso zzso zzso inflammatory responses in zzso zzso cells and protects zzso zzso cells from zzso zzso zzso activates zzso response element zzso system and zzso downstream zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso effects of zzso are attenuated in zzso zzso cells as well as in the presence with specific inhibitor of zzso or zzso zzso zzso also has zzso effect against zzso zzso zzso zzso in mice, with zzso of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso This study demonstrates that zzso is a potential zzso of the zzso zzso and is zzso relevant not only to zzso zzso but also inflammatory responses of zzso cells both in zzso and in zzso
