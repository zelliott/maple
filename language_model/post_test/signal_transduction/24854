zzso cells zzso differentiate into a zzso cell when simultaneously adhering to an zzso destined for zzso and zzso zzso We are interested in defining the signaling zzso activated by zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso we identified zzso zzso and zzso as components of a zzso leading to zzso gene expression and zzso zzso et zzso 1994, zzso Here, we show that focal zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso expressed by zzso zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso increases as zzso form zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso specifically zzso with zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso A subset of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso molecules reside in the zzso zzso fraction of zzso zzso zzso D, an zzso zzso agent, decreases zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and their association with zzso zzso and causes a zzso increase in the abundance of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso our work indicates that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso form an zzso complex in zzso adhering to zzso zzso in the presence of zzso This complex may be important for initiating the process of SC differentiation into a zzso zzso
