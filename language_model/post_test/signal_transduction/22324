zzso on missions are exposed to zzso zzso radiation and could receive high doses during solar particle events zzso This study investigated T cell function in response to zzso radiation and simulated zzso zzso zzso alone and in zzso 

zzso mice received zzso zzso zzso to a total dose of zzso Gray zzso at zzso zzso either with or without subsequent exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso delivered over zzso Mice were zzso on days 4 and 21 zzso T cells with cluster of differentiation 4 zzso were zzso isolated from zzso and activated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated for zzso proteins and zzso 

The most striking effects were noted on day zzso In the survival pathway, nuclear zzso zzso total and active zzso and zzso zzso activated protein zzso zzso total) were significantly increased and zzso zzso zzso zzso total and zzso was decreased when mice were primed with zzso zzso prior to zzso exposure zzso zzso of the T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso exposure zzso the high zzso zzso level of zzso specific protein zzso zzso zzso total and zzso on day 21 zzso for zzso zzso zzso while radiation had no effect on active zzso protein zzso 70 zzso There was increased production of zzso zzso and zzso and decreased transforming growth zzso in the zzso group compared to the zzso zzso 

The data zzso for the first time, that protracted exposure to zzso zzso can significantly modify the effects of zzso zzso on critical zzso proteins and zzso zzso produced by zzso T zzso
