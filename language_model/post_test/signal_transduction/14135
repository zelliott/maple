The tolerance of cancer cells to zzso depends on the combination of different zzso increase of zzso zzso zzso to zzso of zzso zzso zzso Less is known about the influence of zzso transition zzso and zzso pathways on the cell sensitivity to zzso The aim of this study was to explore the role of Snail zzso one of the key zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso response and regulation of cell sensitivity to zzso using as a model in zzso cultured breast cancer zzso Earlier we have shown that zzso zzso breast cancer cells differ from zzso zzso cells with increased expression of zzso and demonstrated zzso involvement into formation of zzso zzso Because zzso belongs to zzso zzso here we studied the influence of zzso signaling on the cell tolerance to zzso We found that zzso zzso cells were less sensitive to zzso growth suppression if compared with zzso line zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell viability after zzso zzso atmosphere for 3 zzso zzso zzso enhanced the zzso zzso of cell proliferation giving the direct evidence of zzso involvement into cell protection from zzso zzso The protective effect of zzso was shown to be zzso at least in a part, via zzso which positively regulated expression of zzso zzso Finally, we found that cell tolerance to zzso was accompanied with the failure in the zzso of zzso - the key energy zzso and demonstrated an inverse relationship between zzso and zzso zzso zzso our data show that zzso and zzso besides association with loss of hormone zzso protect cancer cells from zzso and may serve as an important target in the treatment of breast zzso Moreover, we suggest that the level of these proteins as well the level of zzso zzso may be considered as zzso of the tumor sensitivity to zzso zzso
