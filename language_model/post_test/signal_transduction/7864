zzso of zzso zzso programs for zzso causes differentiation block and promotes leukemia zzso Here, we show that zzso the most common zzso fusion product in acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso the activity of zzso acid zzso a zzso regulator of zzso zzso zzso in a protein complex with the zzso zzso alpha zzso at zzso regulatory regions on zzso which is a key zzso target gene zzso zzso zzso in zzso At these sites, zzso recruits zzso zzso DNA zzso and zzso binding activities that promote a zzso zzso zzso The link among zzso zzso zzso repression, zzso resistance, and zzso differentiation block is indicated by the ability of either zzso or the DNA zzso inhibitor zzso to zzso these zzso zzso and to restore zzso differentiation response in zzso zzso Finally, zzso is commonly silenced by zzso in primary zzso blasts but not in normal zzso zzso thus suggesting a role for the zzso repression of the zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso
