zzso zzso was cloned from mouse zzso body for its ability to induce growth of heart zzso zzso of its secondary structure indicate that zzso belongs to a family of zzso with a zzso bundle structure, and sequence comparisons reveal a weak zzso to leukemia zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso Using a reverse zzso chain reaction zzso with rat sympathetic zzso cultures, we find that zzso zzso and suppresses the expression of the same set of zzso and neurotransmitter synthetic zzso zzso as do zzso and zzso In addition, the effects of zzso and zzso are not zzso and zzso does not require a zzso component to mediate its zzso Our functional data confirm that zzso is a member of the zzso zzso family and suggest that the zzso zzso complex contains the zzso signal zzso zzso
