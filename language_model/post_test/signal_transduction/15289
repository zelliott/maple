zzso cell death, or zzso is a fundamental zzso process during normal development or in pathological zzso The zzso of zzso can be zzso by numerous zzso zzso Ras is known to mediate zzso signals by zzso zzso activity in the zzso zzso Here we report the isolation of a new zzso zzso zzso zzso which causes excessive zzso in the zzso zzso 

This new function is likely to be zzso through the zzso zzso since the zzso of zzso zzso can significantly suppress zzso zzso whereas the removal of hid only zzso suppresses the zzso Furthermore, the reduction of zzso zzso together with the expression of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso which blocks zzso activity, strongly suppresses the zzso cell zzso In addition, we find a strong correlation between zzso zzso in the eye disc and the zzso of zzso zzso 

In the zzso eye, Ras may protect cells from zzso by zzso both zzso and zzso zzso Surprisingly, reducing Ras activity in the wing, however, does not cause zzso but rather affects cell and organ zzso Thus, in addition to its requirement for cell zzso Ras appears to mediate different biological roles depending on the zzso context and on the level of its zzso
