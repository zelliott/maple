Cell signaling is a term used to describe a complex interactive system of signals that act to regulate or mediate a cellular zzso zzso that target cell signaling pathways have the potential to effectively reverse molecular deregulation underlying zzso The inherent complexity of cell signaling presents a major challenge to designing such therapies however, because zzso of pathways has the potential to produce dramatic adverse zzso zzso are in the primary position of detecting adverse responses in drug development and are essential members of teams whose goal is to determine the mechanisms underlying tissue zzso The pathologist therefore will be expected to integrate zzso interpretation with data obtained from several zzso methods and data derived from novel zzso zzso being used include several in zzso tools that provide access to public databases and signal zzso zzso that can serve to focus on key zzso zzso The main objective of this article is to discuss a basic zzso approach and methods that can be used to associate zzso of cell signaling pathways with zzso zzso The approach suggested begins with diagnostic pathology and uses global gene expression analysis in conjunction with zzso factor profiling and zzso protein technologies, to zzso pathways relevant to the biological zzso Another important objective is to highlight the use of in zzso technologies to prioritize laboratory efforts and focus these efforts on key zzso
