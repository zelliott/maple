In this study, the zzso effects of zzso isolated from the roots of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (the zzso of zzso and zzso (the zzso of zzso were evaluated on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso more zzso inhibited zzso zzso oxide zzso and zzso zzso zzso production than zzso zzso zzso with these findings, zzso reduced the zzso expressions of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso zzso at the protein and zzso levels in a zzso manner, as determined by Western zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the release of tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso expression levels of these zzso were reduced by zzso in a zzso zzso Moreover, zzso attenuated the zzso DNA binding activity and the zzso activity of nuclear zzso B zzso and this was associated with a decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the subsequent blocking of zzso and zzso protein zzso to the zzso Furthermore, zzso suppressed the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas the zzso of zzso was zzso These results suggest that the zzso properties of zzso are caused by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso due to zzso zzso via the suppression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso
