T cells orchestrate the zzso immune response, making them targets for zzso Although zzso therapies prevent disease zzso they also leave patients susceptible to opportunistic zzso To identify novel drug targets, we established a logical model describing zzso zzso zzso zzso However, to have a model that is able to predict new therapeutic approaches, the current drug targets must be zzso zzso as a next step we generated the zzso zzso zzso signaling network and developed a tool to merge logical zzso For zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso is independent of both zzso and zzso while zzso zzso depends upon both zzso and additionally requires novel zzso In addition, our merged model correctly predicted zzso zzso zzso The combined network also allows information transfer from one zzso to add detail to another, thereby predicting that zzso mediates zzso zzso in zzso zzso In zzso the merged model not only enables us to unravel potential zzso but it also suggests new experimental designs and provides a critical step towards designing strategies to zzso T zzso
