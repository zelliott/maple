The signaling network downstream of the zzso family of receptors has been extensively targeted by cancer zzso however, understanding the relative importance of the different components of the zzso network is zzso To explore the optimal way to zzso inhibit zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we built a zzso model of the zzso signaling network that describes the most effective zzso zzso as well as known and previously unidentified zzso zzso zzso analysis identified zzso as the key zzso in response to zzso that can bind either zzso or zzso zzso growth factor zzso We describe zzso a human zzso zzso that zzso the growth of tumor zzso in mice and, consistent with zzso inhibitor data, zzso zzso zzso zzso in a manner distinct from that of other zzso zzso zzso a previously unidentified zzso therapeutic designed using a systems approach, promises to benefit patients with zzso zzso zzso of the zzso signaling network that are not effectively treated by current therapies targeting zzso or zzso zzso
