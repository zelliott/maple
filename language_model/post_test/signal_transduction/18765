During development, zzso cell numbers are precisely adjusted to match the number of zzso It is essentially unknown which growth factors or receptors carry out this important control in zzso Here, we tested whether the type II transforming growth factor zzso beta zzso has a role in this zzso We generated a conditional zzso mouse in which the type II zzso zzso is specifically zzso only in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso evident at least from embryonic day 18, resulted in suppressed zzso cell death in normally developing and injured zzso zzso the zzso also showed a strong reduction in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso cell numbers in zzso and zzso nerves remained zzso Lack of zzso signaling did not appear to affect other processes in which zzso had been implicated zzso including zzso and response of adult nerves to zzso This is the first in zzso evidence for a growth factor zzso involved in promoting zzso cell division during development and the first genetic evidence for a zzso that controls normal zzso zzso cell zzso
