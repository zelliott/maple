zzso and the subsequent removal of dying cells are crucial processes for tissue development and zzso Although we are beginning to understand the signaling pathways that control the zzso clearance of zzso cells, the zzso relevance of these pathways is zzso During zzso over half of the developing germ cells eventually die by zzso yet the signaling pathways that regulate the zzso clearance of these dying cells or the impact of this clearance on development and maintenance of the germ cell population is not well zzso The zzso proteins form an zzso zzso signaling module that functions as a zzso zzso zzso exchange factor for the small zzso zzso The subsequent zzso zzso changes play an important role in the physical zzso of zzso zzso Recent findings demonstrate an in zzso role for zzso clearance in the zzso with implications for zzso Here we will discuss the role of zzso cell clearance during zzso with a particular emphasis on zzso zzso
