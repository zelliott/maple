zzso A is a small, zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso The sequence of a 10, zzso zzso region containing at least 12 open reading frames zzso 7 of which are predicted to play a role in zzso zzso is zzso The genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso A zzso the putative immunity zzso and the induction factor zzso zzso The deduced proteins zzso and zzso resemble the zzso zzso and response regulator proteins of zzso signal zzso systems of the zzso zzso The predicted proteins zzso and zzso are zzso to ABC zzso zzso zzso and accessory factors, respectively, of several other zzso systems and to proteins implicated in the zzso export of zzso coli zzso zzso Immediately downstream of the zzso and zzso genes are two zzso the product of one of which, zzso is very similar to the product of the zzso gene of zzso zzso and to zzso coli zzso IV, a signal zzso zzso known to be involved in outer membrane zzso zzso Another potential zzso is zzso in the opposite direction to the other genes in the zzso zzso This putative zzso zzso is similar to zzso one of the components of the zzso F zzso A deletion which included one of two direct repeats upstream of the zzso gene abolished zzso A activity, zzso and ability to induce zzso zzso zzso zzso upstream of the zzso gene also had the same effect, but this zzso could be zzso by zzso supplied induction zzso The putative zzso zzso was shown to be involved in the immunity to zzso zzso Cloning of a zzso zzso zzso all predicted zzso and regulatory regions resulted in zzso production of zzso A and induction factor in zzso zzso while a zzso construct zzso under the control of a zzso promoter resulted in zzso zzso A production in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso
