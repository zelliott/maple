Earlier studies have shown that zzso zzso virus 1 zzso blocks the zzso response zzso at least at two sites, by zzso the effects of zzso of protein zzso R by zzso zzso and zzso and through the degradation of zzso leukemia protein zzso since zzso has no zzso effects in zzso zzso Here we report on two effects of viral genes on other sites of the zzso signaling zzso zzso In infected cells, zzso zzso associated with zzso receptors and zzso associated with the zzso signaling zzso rapidly disappear from infected zzso The level of zzso alpha zzso is also reduced, albeit less drastically at times after 4 h zzso Other members of the zzso family of proteins were either decreased in amount or zzso processed in a manner different from those of zzso zzso The decrease in the levels of zzso and zzso may account for the decrease in the formation of complexes consisting of zzso or zzso and DNA sequences containing the zzso response elements after exposure to zzso zzso The disappearance of zzso and zzso was related at least in part to the function of the zzso host zzso zzso the product of the viral zzso zzso zzso with this zzso a zzso lacking the zzso gene and treated with zzso produced lesser amounts of a late protein zzso than the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso blocks the zzso signaling pathways at several zzso
