We previously determined that the cellular zzso of zzso zzso zzso plays a role in the maintenance of the mature zzso of vascular smooth muscle cells zzso This study aimed to identify the role of zzso in modulating the migration of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression inhibited the cellular migration of cultured zzso associated with zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso via the zzso transfer of short hairpin zzso promoted cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso attenuated the zzso and increased zzso of zzso growth factor zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated that both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were enhanced in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the effect of zzso zzso on zzso migration was zzso in a zzso manner by the addition of either zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso increase in zzso zzso promoted cellular migration in zzso via the zzso signal zzso Additionally, zzso of zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso attenuated the zzso of zzso in cells zzso zzso This indicates that zzso is involved in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso In zzso these data demonstrate for the first time that zzso plays a critical role in the zzso of zzso migration, as well as maintaining zzso in a mature zzso These results may provide a new therapeutic target for vascular disease associated with zzso zzso
