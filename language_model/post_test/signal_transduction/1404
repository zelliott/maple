In zzso zzso zzso Sol 8 zzso spontaneously form zzso and express the zzso zzso heavy zzso their main marker of terminal zzso This marker is zzso at 24 zzso and increases up to 72 zzso Our aim was to define zzso effects of zzso zzso growth factor zzso on zzso expression in Sol 8 zzso zzso (1 zzso added at time zero to zzso decreased zzso expression and completely inhibited zzso expression in Sol 8 zzso This zzso of zzso expression was progressively lost when zzso was added from 8 to 34 zzso After 34 zzso the cells were zzso zzso and zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso any zzso Two independent approaches showed that a zzso zzso regulatory loop retarded and partially impaired Sol 8 cell terminal zzso First, permanent zzso of the active zzso released by the cells into zzso increased zzso levels at 72 h compared with zzso zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso type II zzso was zzso in Sol 8 cells under the control of the zzso zzso Both the zzso zzso and the zzso gene were expressed after 24 h in zzso The delayed blocking of the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso was as effective as permanent zzso to promote zzso zzso To zzso zzso zzso Sol 8 cell terminal differentiation within a narrow time zzso zzso zzso that zzso with the onset of zzso zzso
