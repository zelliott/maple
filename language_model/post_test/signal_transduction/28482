The zzso checkpoint in the zzso zzso zzso is an zzso signal zzso zzso comprised of two branches that inhibit two different zzso transitions in cells treated with zzso drugs such as zzso The zzso is an integral component of the zzso branch of the zzso checkpoint zzso Current models propose that the zzso is required for both the establishment and maintenance of the zzso checkpoint but a role for the zzso in the maintenance of zzso checkpoint in zzso has never been directly zzso We used a temperature sensitive zzso zzso to zzso zzso before and after arresting cells in zzso to determine the role of zzso in the establishment and maintenance of the zzso zzso We show that both establishment and maintenance requires zzso function in response to zzso damage induced by zzso zzso Excess expression of the zzso protein zzso causes wild type cells and zzso cells to arrest in zzso Unlike the zzso checkpoint arrest activated by zzso this arrest can be maintained independently of zzso The arrest induced by excess zzso is independent of zzso zzso zzso arrest induced by excess zzso expression is due to the action of the zzso branch of the zzso checkpoint zzso and excess zzso acts downstream of the zzso
