zzso zzso zzso zzso is liberated in zzso cells and zzso zzso regulates energy zzso and zzso integrity in the gastrointestinal zzso whereas zzso action in the central nervous system remains poorly zzso We identified zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts by zzso in multiple regions of the developing and adult rat central nervous zzso zzso zzso transcripts were localized by in zzso zzso to the zzso zzso nucleus of the solitary zzso zzso nucleus, zzso nucleus, and zzso zzso The zzso form of zzso zzso was detected by zzso and zzso analysis in the fetal and adult zzso and zzso zzso zzso increases in zzso zzso in zzso d 8, but not embryonic d 14, dispersed zzso rat zzso zzso The actions of zzso were independent of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cell cultures from both zzso and zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso injury in zzso cells via a protein zzso zzso pathway, but had no effect on the rate of cell zzso These findings establish the presence of a functional zzso axis in the developing zzso brain and demonstrate that zzso exerts zzso actions in cells derived from the central nervous zzso
