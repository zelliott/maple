zzso growth factor alpha zzso is widely expressed in zzso as well as normal cells and is involved in regulating cell growth and zzso Although processing of zzso has been extensively studied in normal cells, there is little information regarding zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso we compared the processing of zzso in two human colon zzso cell zzso We found that there was a defective zzso pattern for the zzso precursor resulting in retention of partially processed zzso on the cell surface of both the zzso and zzso cell zzso This raised the possibility that signaling from the resulting defective zzso species could differ from that of soluble zzso The zzso zzso induced higher zzso of zzso on the cell surface of adjacent cells than equivalent levels of mature zzso The interaction of membrane bound zzso precursor with the zzso caused a slower zzso of activated zzso relative to the zzso of the soluble zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso was resistant to the ability of zzso zzso zzso to reduce zzso zzso zzso also contributing to higher zzso of zzso The enhanced zzso of zzso by the zzso form of zzso was reflected by higher zzso of zzso zzso and zzso downstream zzso of zzso zzso zzso The higher zzso of zzso by membrane zzso zzso indicates that defective zzso processing provides a mechanism zzso zzso cells can obtain a growth advantage over normal zzso
