Previous research has shown that zzso to zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells survive treatment with high doses of zzso (a zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the involvement of zzso zzso zzso in this zzso We observed that the zzso zzso coding for the zzso that zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso is important in governing the zzso resistance of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The addition of 10 zzso zzso zzso drastically reduced the zzso zzso concentration and significantly increased the zzso resistance of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating a protective effect of zzso against zzso cell death in zzso zzso At this concentration of zzso we did not observe any effect on the fluidity of the zzso zzso The protective effect of zzso was not observed when the zzso pumps were inhibited or when tested in a zzso without functional zzso zzso Also, the addition of zzso during zzso treatment increased the expression levels of genes coding for zzso pumps, leading to the hypothesis that zzso acts as a signaling zzso and enhances the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso
