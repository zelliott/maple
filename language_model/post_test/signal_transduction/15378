zzso zzso have revolutionized the treatment of psoriasis zzso as well as zzso and zzso arthritis and zzso zzso Despite our understanding that these agents block zzso their complex mechanism of action in disease resolution is still zzso 

To analyze globally the zzso effects of zzso zzso in patients with zzso and to compare zzso profiles of patients who responded or did not respond to zzso 

In a clinical trial using zzso zzso inhibitor to treat psoriasis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso were used to analyze gene profiles in zzso skin at multiple time points during drug treatment zzso and weeks 1, 2, 4, and zzso compared with zzso zzso Patients were zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 4) on the basis of zzso disease zzso zzso analysis was used to define gene sets that were modulated with similar magnitude and zzso over zzso 

In responders, 4 clusters of zzso genes and 3 clusters of zzso genes were zzso Genes zzso most rapidly reflected direct zzso of zzso lineage immune zzso zzso genes included the stable zzso cell population genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso revealed rapid zzso of innate zzso and zzso zzso cascade zzso in both groups, but only zzso zzso zzso zzso genes to baseline zzso 

Although both zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso cascade zzso response to zzso is dependent on zzso of zzso zzso cell genes and zzso of the zzso immune zzso
