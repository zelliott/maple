Class I alcohol zzso zzso are the zzso zzso for ethanol and vitamin A zzso metabolism in the zzso Because previous studies have shown that human zzso zzso may participate in zzso acid zzso we investigated whether the zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso X zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso In human zzso both the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid and synthetic zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso of a zzso active form of zzso induced zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso abolished the effects of zzso zzso on zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso studies and zzso mobility shift zzso revealed functional zzso response elements in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso thus indicating that both genes are direct targets of zzso These findings provide the first evidence for direct connection of zzso acid signaling and alcohol zzso
