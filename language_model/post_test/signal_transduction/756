The zzso growth factor I zzso has been implicated in breast cancer development acting through zzso growth factor I zzso zzso but also through zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso zzso synthesis by two human breast cancer zzso cell lines, the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso was studied alone and in combination with zzso Both cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in variable zzso zzso affects the synthesis of zzso by zzso cells by decreasing the amounts of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso the expression of cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso exerts this effect on zzso cells acting mainly through receptors with protein zzso zzso activity zzso In contrast, zzso stimulates the synthesis of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso cells, exhibiting only a slight suppression on synthesis of zzso zzso and zzso The regulatory effect of zzso on zzso distribution in zzso cells is zzso through a mix of zzso which involves both receptors with zzso activity and zzso zzso It is suggested that the effects of zzso on the synthesis and distribution of zzso by zzso breast cancer cells also depend on the presence or the absence of zzso The result of the zzso action is the balanced zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso in both cell lines, approaching a common zzso zzso
