Expansion of the zzso repeat region of the zzso zzso zzso results in Kennedy's disease, a neurological disorder typified by zzso of motor zzso in the brain stem and spinal zzso As the zzso has been shown to inhibit zzso dependent zzso zzso we asked if expansion of the zzso repeats might affect this property of the zzso Using the zzso reporter zzso we found that a zzso form of the zzso containing 51 zzso repeats showed a consistent, though zzso reduction in its ability to inhibit zzso transcription, in comparison to a zzso form with 20 zzso A reduced ability to inhibit zzso zzso may thus contribute in part to the underlying zzso of Kennedy's zzso
