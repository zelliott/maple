zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso is effective in the treatment of breast zzso Why zzso plays such a dominant role in breast cancer and represents such an excellent target remains to be zzso The ability of zzso to respond to multiple zzso and to control expression of multiple downstream genes may be one of the reasons why zzso is such a powerful target for breast cancer zzso The recent modest performance of a number of targeted therapies in breast cancer has raised the question whether we will ever develop therapies that have such success as zzso zzso therapies tend to inhibit a single zzso that is probably altered in only a subset of zzso Even within this zzso only a limited number of patients zzso The evidence that virtually all pathways can zzso and that they exhibit several layers of zzso reveals a complexity of signaling networks that may defy the generation of targeted therapies with efficacy similar to zzso However, there are clearly regulatory zzso that can integrate multiple upstream zzso and elicit diverse downstream zzso We provide evidence and rationales for zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso D1 as potential therapeutic zzso These zzso similar to zzso can integrate and coordinate multiple signals in breast cancer cells and thus mediate diverse aspects of breast cancer zzso New treatment targets will emerge in light of more global models of signal zzso that fully integrate all aspects of cell biology such as the role of the zzso zzso and will hopefully result in the development of targeted therapies that show efficacy similar to zzso
