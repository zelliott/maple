We previously proposed a dynamic scaffold model for inner nuclear structure zzso In this model, structures in zzso regions are maintained through dynamic interaction of protein complex zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins and others act as scaffolds for these protein zzso In this study, three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found in the nuclear zzso fraction and speculated to be present in the human zzso zzso of zzso zzso The results obtained as to their zzso zzso binding with each other, zzso and zzso were: zzso the majority of these proteins fused with zzso are localized to the zzso center region in zzso zzso these 3 proteins bind directly with each other in zzso zzso the movement of these proteins is very slow in living cells and independent of zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso at zzso by a zzso zzso egg zzso and binding with zzso and zzso is zzso These findings and others suggest that these 3 zzso proteins found in the zzso fraction bind directly with each other, bind tightly to zzso center regions, and comprise a part of the zzso zzso These results are also consistent with our dynamic scaffold zzso
