The pancreatic zzso cells are of particular interest for the study of zzso zzso signals, since they are zzso polarized and generate zzso zzso zzso zzso Recent data obtained by combining digital video imaging of zzso zzso with zzso zzso current recording have provided new information on the zzso relationships of the zzso zzso signals and the zzso zzso zzso Low zzso zzso evoke repetitive zzso local zzso spikes in the zzso pole region that activate zzso current zzso In the case of zzso stimulation the spikes are confined to this zzso When zzso is used the zzso local spikes zzso longer zzso zzso that spread to the whole of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso can mimic these zzso The zzso local zzso spikes are particularly sensitive to blockade by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results show that the zzso pole region has a particularly high sensitivity to zzso zzso probably due to zzso of high affinity zzso
