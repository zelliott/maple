zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso production by T helper type 1 zzso zzso Neither zzso nor zzso zzso alone induced production of zzso Although treatment with zzso alone induced full zzso of zzso in zzso cells, it was not sufficient for the production of zzso To examine the importance of zzso zzso in zzso production, we established zzso cells which expressed a zzso zzso zzso In these cells, zzso of zzso and production of zzso by zzso were zzso On the other hand, we examined the T cell zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso inhibited zzso production by zzso without any effect on the zzso zzso We conclude that dual signaling consisting of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is crucial for zzso production by zzso in zzso zzso zzso
