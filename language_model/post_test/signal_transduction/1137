zzso play a pivotal role in bone zzso The alkaline zzso zzso activity was decreased in zzso zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso 5 or 10 zzso The treatment of zzso inhibited zzso differentiation such as zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso increased zzso DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts of zzso The addition of zzso zzso zzso free radical scavenger, completely prevented zzso zzso of zzso In addition, zzso alpha and zzso beta were rapidly zzso allowing the activated zzso to enter the nucleus and promote gene zzso To determine whether zzso alpha signal zzso zzso is important in the zzso we generated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso did not show any regulation of zzso in zzso Here, we suggest that the zzso of zzso alpha and zzso beta and the following zzso of zzso are the targets of zzso and that zzso zzso factor is a pivotal clue to regulation of differentiation in zzso zzso
