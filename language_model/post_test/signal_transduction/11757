We have previously shown the incorporation of dietary omega-3 and zzso fatty acids from zzso oil and corn oil, respectively, into membrane zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of rat zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso 33, zzso We now demonstrate the influence of such incorporation on the regulation of G proteins and zzso zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso three protein peptides (Mr zzso zzso and zzso to different zzso in the two zzso We found zzso and zzso higher and zzso lower zzso of Mr zzso zzso and 46,000 zzso respectively, in zzso zzso of rats fed a diet containing zzso zzso oil zzso zzso compared to those fed zzso corn oil zzso zzso zzso distinctions between different forms of these peptides are not zzso zzso toxin also exhibited zzso of three peptides in the zzso zzso from normal or zzso zzso In these zzso zzso G proteins were not detected by zzso toxin dependent zzso zzso or by a low concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso which selectively activates zzso G proteins which inhibit zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso In group II zzso both zzso and zzso zzso activities of zzso zzso were found to be significantly higher than the corresponding values in group I zzso less than zzso In zzso toxin dependent zzso zzso of group I, zzso and zzso zzso activities of zzso zzso were significantly higher than those obtained in the absence of zzso toxin zzso less than zzso Surprisingly, corresponding values were found to be lower in zzso zzso of group zzso This could be due either to zzso changes in heavily zzso G zzso which alters zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso or due to zzso of excessive zzso beta gamma complex from alpha beta gamma complex upon the zzso of G zzso
