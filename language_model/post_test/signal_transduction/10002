A zzso clone of unknown function, zzso was isolated from zzso zzso tomato zzso zzso leaves by differential display zzso The zzso zzso is expressed in response to the programmed cell zzso zzso acid within 8 h following treatment of a tomato zzso 16 h prior to the development of visible cell zzso zzso transcript levels were also affected by the late blight zzso zzso zzso To gain further insight into the zzso regulation of zzso the promoter region was cloned by inverse zzso and was found to contain putative zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in roots, zzso and leaves, but not in zzso Leaf expression of zzso is regulated by zzso rhythms during long days with the peak occurring at midday and the low point midway through the dark zzso During short days, the rhythm is lost and zzso expression becomes zzso The predicted zzso protein has a zzso domain shared by the zzso motif zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso seed storage zzso and zzso transfer zzso A zzso fluorescent protein fusion protein localized to the plasma membrane in zzso and zzso experiments, suggesting that the native protein is associated with the zzso in intact zzso
