The acquisition of cell zzso zzso is a central feature of zzso differentiation and has important consequences for nervous system zzso To begin to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms, we have explored the role of zzso zzso in the zzso development of cortical zzso zzso of dominant negative zzso of zzso or zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso protein zzso zzso causes a marked reduction in the number of primary zzso in zzso zzso zzso and in the number of zzso zzso in zzso with zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso active zzso of zzso zzso or zzso leads to an increase in the number of primary and zzso zzso In cortical cultures, as in zzso zzso zzso leads to an apparent transformation from zzso to zzso zzso over zzso zzso this shift in favor of zzso zzso is also inhibited by the expression of dominant negative zzso of zzso and zzso and by zzso zzso These observations indicate that zzso zzso and zzso play a central role in zzso development and suggest that differential zzso of zzso zzso may contribute to the generation of zzso diversity in the developing zzso
