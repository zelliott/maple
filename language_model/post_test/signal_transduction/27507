zzso the mechanism which zzso the induction of zzso tolerance is crucial to the development of strategies for treatment of zzso diseases and zzso zzso Although the concept that T zzso cells zzso zzso the immune response has long been accepted, the existence of a distinct population of zzso that mediates suppression has not been convincingly zzso In previous studies, we have zzso human T cell lines zzso to analyze the zzso effects of zzso T cells in zzso zzso specific and zzso zzso In each case, zzso T cells inhibit proliferation of zzso T helper zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso These zzso T cells display the critical functional characteristics of T zzso zzso Similar to the induction of zzso zzso T cells zzso by zzso this process depends on zzso presenting cells zzso acting as a zzso between zzso I specific zzso and class II specific zzso T zzso A possible explanation of zzso suppression is their ability to zzso the function of zzso The present studies show that zzso zzso directly inhibit the zzso signaling zzso of zzso by a zzso mechanism that renders bridging zzso incapable of inducing zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso on the functional state of zzso supports the concept that the order in which zzso and zzso cells interact with zzso zzso determines the functional outcome of immune zzso
