zzso cells are a zzso of zzso cells that produce both zzso and zzso In order to study the selective regulation of zzso in zzso cells, a zzso cell zzso zzso was generated by fusing a zzso clone with the zzso zzso The pattern of zzso zzso by zzso was found to depend on the zzso presenting cells zzso used for zzso When zzso was zzso with zzso and zzso both zzso and zzso were zzso However, when the B cell zzso LB was used as zzso only zzso was zzso Although LB cells could not stimulate zzso production, they were more potent than were zzso cells at inducing zzso production, demonstrating that the difference between the two zzso populations was qualitative rather than zzso Similar results were seen upon stimulation with zzso A or zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso production paralleled regulation of zzso zzso The failure of LB cells to stimulate zzso production was not due to zzso or consumption of zzso and the activity could not be restored by adding zzso zzso cell zzso or zzso cells lacking the appropriate zzso zzso Finally, the parent zzso clone used in the fusion showed a similar inability to produce zzso in response to LB zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso signals can selectively affect zzso and zzso production in a zzso cell zzso zzso the choice of zzso may lead to selective stimulation of particular zzso by acting on zzso zzso
