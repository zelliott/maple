Some of the earliest zzso pathways to form in the zzso zzso are established as zzso and retinal zzso cross the zzso of the zzso and zzso To better understand zzso guidance in the zzso we characterized the zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso and retinal zzso guidance in the zzso Using a zzso cloning strategy, we determined that the bel locus encodes zzso zzso a zzso zzso factor expressed in the brain, eye and fin zzso We show that zzso function is required for patterning in the zzso zzso and eye, and that loss of bel function leads to zzso in regulatory gene zzso zzso in zzso guidance factors, and the absence of an zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our analysis reveals new roles for zzso in zzso zzso guidance, zzso patterning and eye zzso
