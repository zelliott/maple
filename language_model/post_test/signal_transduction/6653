Signal zzso for the characteristic long-term zzso of zzso receptors in zzso cells was investigated with wedge recordings from rat zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced specifically in the zzso zzso of zzso receptors following brief exposure to 100 zzso zzso It was abolished either by treatment of the rat with zzso toxin or by zzso of a slice with zzso zzso zzso or inhibitor of zzso zzso application of zzso alone did not cause zzso but in combination with zzso sodium zzso or zzso zzso produced zzso similar to that induced by zzso These results indicate that the zzso arises from zzso of zzso receptors in association with zzso of zzso zzso zzso the latter leading to zzso zzso to zzso oxide zzso production to zzso zzso and eventually to zzso of zzso
