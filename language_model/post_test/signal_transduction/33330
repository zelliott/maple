Our aim has been to understand the features of zzso zzso zzso and zzso assembly to develop approaches to disrupt zzso zzso We have developed a general approach to cause zzso zzso trans zzso of human zzso The zzso progression of human zzso to a more zzso zzso often involves the amplification and zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso We have selectively targeted the zzso in human zzso cells with zzso zzso of the zzso family derived from the zzso of the zzso zzso that are able to form zzso with zzso and inhibit zzso zzso In zzso zzso human zzso cells, expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso growth zzso induced DNA zzso zzso cell proliferation in the presence of zzso but not zzso growth zzso zzso the ability of zzso to form colonies in soft zzso and zzso transforming efficiency in zzso zzso These studies establish that zzso signal zzso is important in the maintenance of zzso zzso and that trans zzso zzso is a novel way to abrogate abnormal growth of these zzso zzso zzso will be useful in determining the manner in which the zzso contributes to zzso zzso and in the design of pharmaceuticals that zzso zzso family zzso In addition, these studies provide a rationale for the application of the zzso zzso in gene therapy approaches to human zzso zzso and, zzso to other systemic zzso zzso expressing zzso family zzso
