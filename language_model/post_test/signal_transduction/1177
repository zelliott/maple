Although the zzso center of an zzso is usually highly zzso there have been a few reports of proteins with zzso at essential zzso positions, which convert the zzso into a zzso inactive zzso Here, we report a large-scale analysis of zzso at zzso zzso sites in order to gain insight into the function and evolution of inactive zzso Our analysis revealed that inactive zzso are not an exception only found in single zzso families, but that they are represented in a large variety of zzso families and zzso among zzso zzso Even though they have lost their zzso activity, they have adopted new functions and are now mainly involved in regulatory zzso as shown by several case zzso This modification of existing zzso is an efficient mechanism to evolve new zzso The invention of inactive zzso in zzso has thereby led to an enhancement of complexity of regulatory zzso
