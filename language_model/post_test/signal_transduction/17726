zzso zzso is recognized as the primary regulator of zzso and zzso zzso Two alternative hypotheses for the mechanism of regulation have been zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso mass regulate circulating zzso levels by binding to zzso through zzso receptors zzso with subsequent zzso and degradation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso produced by bone zzso zzso zzso cells or zzso cells zzso blood zzso levels or zzso zzso In zzso disorders zzso including primary zzso zzso and essential zzso zzso elevated blood zzso levels occur despite increased zzso and zzso zzso zzso in these diseases, elevated blood zzso levels cannot be explained by the first zzso The present study, was designed to measure zzso zzso production by zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso cells using a relative zzso technique, to verify the second zzso We found no increase of zzso zzso production in either zzso cells or in zzso zzso cells in patients with zzso and zzso Furthermore, in those patients with zzso who had elevated plasma zzso levels, zzso zzso levels in bone zzso zzso zzso or zzso cells were not elevated as compared with zzso zzso we concluded that in patients with zzso the elevated plasma zzso levels are not due to enhanced production of zzso zzso either by zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso abnormalities including reduced zzso protein levels or defective zzso induced signal zzso pathways are the likely zzso
