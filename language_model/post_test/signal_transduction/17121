It is recognized now that zzso zzso proteins zzso which do not have unique zzso structures as a whole or in noticeable parts, constitute a significant fraction of any given zzso zzso are characterized by an astonishing structural and functional diversity that defines their ability to be universal regulators of various cellular zzso zzso cell death zzso is one of the most intricate cellular processes where the cell uses specialized cellular machinery and zzso programs to kill zzso This zzso mechanism enables zzso to control cell numbers and to eliminate cells that threaten the zzso zzso zzso includes several specific zzso such as zzso zzso and programmed necrosis zzso These zzso are not only tightly regulated but also intimately interconnected and are jointly controlled via a complex set of zzso zzso To understand the role of the intrinsic disorder in controlling and regulating the zzso several large sets of zzso proteins across 28 species were analyzed using a wide array of modern zzso zzso This study indicates that the intrinsic disorder phenomenon has to be taken into consideration to generate a complete picture of the interconnected zzso zzso and zzso that determine the essence of the zzso We demonstrate that proteins involved in regulation and execution of zzso possess substantial amount of intrinsic zzso We zzso functional roles of disorder across and within zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso regions are shown to be implemented in a number of crucial functions, such as zzso zzso interactions with other partners including zzso acids and other zzso are enriched in zzso modification sites, and are characterized by specific evolutionary zzso We mapped the disorder into an integrated network of zzso pathways and into the zzso of selected proteins that are involved in the zzso zzso signaling zzso
