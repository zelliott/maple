Sonic zzso zzso is a zzso zzso crucial for cell fate decision, cellular zzso and patterning during zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso a zzso spanning protein that belongs to the zzso coupled zzso zzso Among four families of zzso zzso zzso has been thought to be responsible for zzso zzso zzso while several lines of evidence indicated that other zzso pathways may be zzso We found that the zzso family of zzso G proteins and the small zzso zzso are involved in zzso cellular responses, including stimulation of target gene promoter and zzso of zzso outgrowth of zzso zzso We also found that the zzso zzso is responsible for zzso nuclear import of zzso which is thought to zzso zzso signals to zzso Furthermore, zzso of a zzso zzso protein in rat neural tubes leads to zzso of motor zzso and zzso development, mimicking the effects of decreased zzso zzso These results show that zzso zzso is zzso in part by zzso zzso family coupled zzso zzso The participation of zzso a pivotal molecular switch in many signal zzso zzso may help explain how zzso can trigger a variety of cellular zzso
