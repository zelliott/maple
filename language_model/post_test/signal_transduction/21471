zzso development of zzso zzso is an excellent model for zzso formation because it involves zzso signaling to coordinate formation of zzso zzso gene zzso and cellular differentiation into zzso The role of zzso an alternative zzso factor important for viability in stationary phase and for stress responses, was investigated during development by measuring signal production, gene zzso and zzso of a zzso zzso zzso alone and upon zzso with zzso cells or signaling zzso The zzso zzso responded to zzso by inducing zzso synthesis normally but was impaired for production of zzso an early cell density zzso and for production of the zzso zzso zzso of early zzso genes was greatly reduced, and expression of those that depend on zzso was not restored by zzso with zzso cells, indicating that zzso is needed for cellular responses to zzso Despite these early zzso zzso the zzso zzso responded to zzso supplied by zzso zzso cells by inducing a subset of late zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso for zzso of this zzso but a distinct regulatory class, which includes genes essential for zzso requires zzso zzso zzso or a gene under its control, cell zzso The level of zzso transcript in a zzso zzso during growth is much lower than in zzso cells, suggesting that zzso positively regulates zzso zzso in growing zzso The zzso transcript level drops in zzso cells after 20 zzso of zzso and remains low after 40 zzso but rises in a zzso zzso after 40 zzso suggesting that zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso early in zzso We conclude that zzso zzso during growth occupies a position near the top of a regulatory hierarchy governing zzso zzso development, analogous to zzso factors that control zzso formation of other zzso
