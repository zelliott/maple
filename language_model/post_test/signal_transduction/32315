An understanding of the biological roles of zzso will be advanced by zzso that can inhibit or even recruit zzso zzso To this end, zzso zzso zzso that function zzso to zzso zzso are being zzso The advantage of having such zzso is illustrated by the many roles of the protein zzso zzso is a zzso zzso displayed on zzso cells, where it binds to zzso and zzso to mediate interactions with other host cells or bacterial or viral zzso zzso engagement can zzso host immune responses zzso suppress zzso or benefit pathogens zzso promote zzso zzso zzso can bind to zzso zzso zzso cargo for zzso processing, and zzso zzso zzso zzso can serve as zzso as well as zzso of the zzso function, so they are especially valuable for zzso and controlling zzso roles in zzso We previously reported a small zzso that embodies key features of the carbohydrates that bind zzso Here, we demonstrate that this zzso zzso acts as a true zzso Using zzso zzso experiments, we found that the compound mimics zzso zzso It occupies the same zzso site and interacts with the same zzso acid zzso on zzso The zzso also is zzso It had been shown previously to antagonize zzso function, but here we use it to generate zzso zzso Specifically, appending this zzso to a protein scaffold zzso a zzso that elicits key cellular signaling zzso Thus, the zzso can give rise to functional zzso surrogates that elicit zzso zzso
