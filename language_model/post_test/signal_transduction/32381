zzso C can replace zzso in the zzso of the zzso of pig zzso provided that the reaction medium contains relatively high free zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the presence of 10 zzso free zzso the zzso zzso zzso reaches a zzso zzso of approximately zzso of that attained with zzso The zzso concentration for zzso C zzso is about 200 times greater than for zzso zzso C zzso the zzso concentration for zzso by zzso to zzso zzso and the zzso between the zzso binding sites to zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso and zzso zzso when zzso is zzso Both zzso proteins also elicit zzso by zzso at a zzso regulatory site, as well as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I prevents zzso of the zzso by zzso zzso A zzso of zzso C with the zzso zzso deleted zzso activates the zzso to the same extent and with the same zzso dependence as zzso zzso C zzso the zzso concentration for zzso by zzso is zzso times smaller than that for zzso We conclude that the structural features that distinguish the two zzso proteins affect their binding to the target zzso more than their ability to transform the zzso response to zzso or zzso The differences in the zzso zzso of zzso C and zzso cannot account for the differences in ability of these proteins to activate the target system used as a zzso
