The zzso patterns of zzso cell invasion are known as the secondary structures of zzso In this report, we propose a biologically based mechanism for the zzso formation of zzso secondary structures based on the differential expression of zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso at the invading edge of zzso The zzso zzso was highly expressed in zzso blood vessels, zzso regions, and white matter tracts that form the basis of zzso secondary zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso was highly expressed in invading zzso cells organized around zzso and blood vessels, in zzso regions, and along white matter zzso zzso and zzso cells exposed to vascular zzso growth factor zzso the expression of zzso zzso tumor cells migrated toward a zzso zzso in zzso whereas zzso of zzso expression decreased their zzso Similarly, zzso of zzso decreased levels of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso suggesting zzso involvement in zzso invasion zzso These studies offer one plausible molecular basis and explanation of the formation of zzso structures in zzso zzso
