When zzso grow towards their targets, their tips form a specialized dynamic structure called the growth zzso To establish their orientation, growth cones continuously explore their local environment for guidance zzso The growth cone sensor for immobilized signals displayed on the surface of cells or in the zzso zzso is a zzso complex of surface zzso signaling molecules and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are thought to play an important role as zzso zzso components of the zzso sensor of the growth cones in a number of zzso populations of the peripheral and central nervous zzso Both molecules are capable of specifically binding a number of other zzso molecules and cluster at the zzso contact area of the growth zzso when the zzso contains zzso or zzso Recent results indicate that zzso and zzso interact in the plane of the growth cone membrane and that their zzso is associated with a change in the associated zzso zzso The present review summarizes the recent developments of the concept that different clusters of zzso and zzso at growth zzso contacts elicit different zzso signals in growth cones and eventually determine the zzso choice of the growth zzso
