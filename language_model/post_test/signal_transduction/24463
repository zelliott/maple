When mouse zzso zzso cultures were exposed to zzso agents that increased zzso activity early in development, there was a doubling of the ratio of zzso zzso zzso profiles to zzso cell zzso profiles after two weeks in zzso which correlated with a decrease in spontaneous cortical zzso When similar cultures were maintained in medium with activity blocking agents, zzso cell zzso zzso were reduced to approximately half of control values and, after recovery from activity zzso the cultures discharged zzso By contrast, the full complement of zzso cortical zzso developed in the absence of zzso zzso These results support the concept that zzso activity is necessary for the complete development of zzso zzso When zzso cultures were simultaneously exposed to activity blocking agents and to zzso zzso or zzso both of which bound to the zzso zzso the numbers of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso were similar to those of zzso control cultures, and control rates of spontaneous cortical zzso were zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso did not promote zzso zzso development in the absence of zzso activity, and such cultures exhibited zzso cortical zzso These results are consistent with a role for zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso exposure of zzso cultures to zzso to the zzso domain of zzso induced an increased development of zzso cell zzso zzso while similar zzso zzso of zzso had no effect on zzso zzso The promotion of zzso zzso development by specific zzso zzso of zzso supports the concept that signaling for zzso zzso zzso is via the zzso zzso
