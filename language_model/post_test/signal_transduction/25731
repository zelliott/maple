zzso is a zzso virus that zzso zzso cells that line the surface of the small zzso It causes severe zzso illness in children and zzso deaths per year zzso We studied the mechanisms by which zzso zzso cells zzso sense zzso infection and signal zzso production, and investigated the importance of zzso production by zzso for controlling zzso production by zzso zzso and virus zzso in the zzso In contrast with most zzso zzso which interact with either zzso zzso gene I zzso or melanoma zzso gene 5 zzso inside cells, zzso was sensed by both zzso and zzso alone and in zzso zzso did not signal zzso through either of the zzso sensors zzso or zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso or their common zzso protein zzso zzso signaling protein zzso significantly decreased zzso production and increased zzso zzso in infected zzso zzso of laboratory of zzso and physiology 2, a zzso zzso that interacts with viral zzso but lacks the zzso zzso and recruitment zzso required for signaling through zzso significantly decreased zzso production and increased zzso zzso in infected zzso zzso mice lacking zzso but not those lacking zzso zzso or zzso produced significantly less zzso and increased amounts of virus in the zzso zzso and shed increased quantities of virus in the zzso We conclude that zzso or zzso signaling through zzso is required for the zzso of zzso production by zzso zzso and has a functionally important role in determining the magnitude of zzso replication in the zzso zzso
