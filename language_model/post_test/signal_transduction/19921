zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in normal and pathological functions such as cell zzso migration and zzso Recently, some studies have shown that zzso family zzso zzso were involved in neurological disorders and zzso pain states in which zzso zzso plays a zzso In the zzso test, we have reported that zzso undergo at least 2 distinct stages of zzso on the basis of signaling events regarding zzso zzso protein zzso zzso Here, we investigated the involvement of zzso signaling in a zzso pain animal model and the association with zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso were activated in the spinal zzso beginning 1 day after peripheral zzso injection lasting for zzso zzso with zzso specific inhibitor zzso could not inhibit zzso spontaneous pain zzso However, zzso inhibited zzso injury, induced persistent mechanical zzso and reversed zzso zzso expression as well using zzso and Western zzso at day 3 and 7 after zzso Our results suggested that the zzso of the zzso signaling cascade in spinal zzso contributed to late stage persistent mechanical zzso evoked by zzso injection into the zzso 

This study presents unique properties of spinal zzso zzso in a pain animal zzso This finding could potentially help clinicians to further understand the contributions of spinal zzso to acute and persistent pain zzso
