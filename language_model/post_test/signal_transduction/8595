Regulatory T cells zzso have been shown to prevent the development of allergic asthma; however, the role of zzso in asthma with established airway zzso is zzso To address this, we exploited an zzso chronic asthma mouse model wherein zzso were zzso transferred to the mice at chronic stage of the zzso We found that among the structural zzso of airway zzso zzso selectively reduced the vessel numbers in both zzso and zzso regions and the lung zzso zzso zzso deposition, zzso zzso muscular zzso and zzso as were also induced by chronic zzso challenge, were not affected by zzso zzso zzso of the lung sections revealed an increased zzso cell zzso zzso in mice receiving zzso transfers compared with their zzso zzso By using zzso zzso zzso we showed that zzso inhibited zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso and an zzso blocking zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso on zzso tube zzso In zzso decreased airway and lung vessel numbers as well as ameliorated airway zzso after zzso transfers were reverted when zzso zzso signal was blocked by the zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate a novel function of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso and suggest a therapeutic potential of zzso in alleviating airway zzso of chronic zzso
