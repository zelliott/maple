zzso cells zzso are important for presenting zzso to T cells, especially zzso T zzso It has recently been shown that blocking the zzso factor, nuclear factor zzso B zzso in human zzso inhibited the mixed zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of blocking zzso in zzso during presentation of zzso to memory T cells in zzso zzso blood zzso were differentiated into immature zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor, and zzso with an zzso zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso the zzso zzso were highly effective in presenting zzso to zzso T zzso However, stimulation with zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso inhibitor of zzso led to a significant reduction in zzso zzso and decreased production of zzso zzso and zzso whereas transforming growth zzso production was low zzso There was a significant increase in zzso of zzso T cells, even in the presence of zzso which was not found in resting T zzso Similar findings were observed using a zzso inhibitor to block zzso The effective zzso of zzso zzso responses following blockade of zzso in zzso could be a useful approach for zzso inflammatory zzso zzso
