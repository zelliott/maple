zzso acid zzso an active zzso of vitamin A, is a natural zzso involved in development and differentiation of the nervous zzso To zzso signaling mechanisms involved in zzso zzso we used human zzso zzso cells, an established in zzso model for studying zzso action, to examine the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 in zzso zzso and cell zzso From zzso experiments, we observed that zzso induced delayed but persistent zzso and zzso zzso (until 96 zzso that was reduced significantly by the specific zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso For the subsequent studies we chose 24 zzso as the reference zzso zzso of zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells and zzso zzso but significantly reduced cell zzso In addition, we analyzed the signaling zzso that mediates zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso zzso does not follow the classic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are possible alternative zzso involved in the zzso signaling zzso In fact, in the presence of the specific zzso inhibitor zzso zzso or the specific zzso zzso inhibitor zzso we observed a significant zzso reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell survival were reduced by zzso zzso in a zzso zzso These results suggest that rather than zzso and zzso it is zzso that plays an important role during early zzso of zzso zzso
