During zzso stem cell zzso conversion into zzso the zzso cocktail consisting of insulin, zzso zzso and zzso not only zzso zzso but also genes for zzso zzso zzso not all significantly expressed genes represent zzso marker zzso So, our aim was to filter only zzso out of all expressed zzso We zzso that exclusively zzso genes change their expression during zzso and reverse during zzso Thus, zzso were zzso differentiated and zzso 

zzso and reverse zzso was verified by Oil Red O zzso and expression of zzso and zzso Based on zzso zzso genes were zzso expressed during zzso and grouped in 4 zzso According to zzso analysis the relevance of genes with zzso biological zzso expression sites, molecular functions, signaling pathways and zzso factor binding sites was high in cluster 1, including all prominent zzso genes like zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso moderate in clusters zzso and negligible in cluster zzso During reversed zzso only zzso expressed genes zzso zzso were zzso including zzso genes not reported for zzso zzso We identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso as potential zzso zzso 

The model system of zzso linked to reverse zzso allowed the zzso of zzso zzso genes out of total zzso significantly expressed zzso Database analysis of zzso biological zzso zzso factors and signaling pathways further validated and valued our concept, because most of the filtered zzso genes showed affiliation to zzso Based on this approach, the selected and filtered genes would be potentially important for characterization of zzso and monitoring of clinical translation for zzso zzso Moreover, we report 4 new marker zzso
