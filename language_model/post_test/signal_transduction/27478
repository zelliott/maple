zzso signals of cellular differentiation from zzso cells play an important role in regulating the number and spatial distribution of distinctive types of cells in developing zzso Several types of zzso mechanisms of cellular differentiation have been identified by making full use of the zzso zzso of zzso compound zzso These zzso mechanisms are distinct from each other in their signal zzso zzso and/or their role in the pattern formation of the developing zzso zzso The following events zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso is required to zzso regular zzso of the founder cells, zzso cells, or zzso clusters in the developing eye disc via an unknown signal zzso zzso zzso the zzso is at least required for the zzso of the zzso cells within the zzso cluster possibly by preventing other cells in the equivalent groups from adapting fates as zzso zzso zzso activates a simple signal cascade zzso communication between the plasma membrane and nucleus not via protein zzso In contrast, a novel zzso zzso zzso was likely to be required subsequently to the selection of zzso zzso zzso was shown to inhibit the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso and the subsequent signal zzso in the zzso cascade (the third zzso zzso We proposed that the role of zzso is to regulate the number of differentiated cells by controlling cellular differentiation and subsequent programmed cell zzso The distinct roles of these zzso signals in the developing zzso eye are discussed in zzso
