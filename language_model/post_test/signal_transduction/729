The control of zzso and energy zzso including feeding zzso is tightly regulated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso nervous signals, as well as nutrients such as zzso We will review recent findings on the role of the gastrointestinal tract zzso and of portal vein zzso zzso we will review selected data on the action of zzso released zzso 

The involvement of zzso zzso zzso in zzso meal termination has been clarified using mouse models with selective zzso of genes required for development of zzso zzso These activate central zzso zzso zzso containing ascending pathways linking the zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso terminals comprise the zzso zzso zzso responsive to zzso released gastrointestinal zzso The mechanism by which the zzso zzso sensor stimulates zzso zzso by muscles was demonstrated, using genetically modified mice, to be zzso but to require zzso and zzso This sensor is a key site of zzso zzso action and plays a critical role in triggering first phase insulin zzso zzso and zzso target zzso receptors as they are zzso transported across the blood brain zzso The zzso functions of peripherally released zzso may however be zzso both via zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors in the zzso and zzso zzso 

These recent findings demonstrate that the use of improved anatomical and zzso techniques and animal models with targeted gene modifications lead to an improved understanding of the complex role of gastrointestinal signals in the control of energy zzso
