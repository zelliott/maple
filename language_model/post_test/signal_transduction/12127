zzso limbs of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are reconstructed along zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, a zzso limb of the zzso zzso does not have digits, and only a simple zzso structure referred to as a zzso is zzso This suggests that zzso along the zzso axis is absent in the zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso and its target genes are not expressed in the zzso zzso In this study, we activated zzso signaling in the zzso zzso and found that target genes of zzso were zzso in the zzso of limb zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso of the signaling had effects on zzso cell proliferation and zzso and resulted in the formation of multiple zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso of signaling that is absent in the zzso zzso is effective for improvement of limb zzso ability in the zzso zzso
