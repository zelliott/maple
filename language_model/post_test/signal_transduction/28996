zzso hormone zzso is a key regulator of calcium zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso contributes to skeletal development through regulation of zzso proliferation and differentiation during early bone zzso Both zzso and zzso act through the same zzso zzso A second zzso zzso has been identified although its function is comparatively zzso zzso zzso zzso bone zzso whereas intermittent injection of zzso increases bone zzso To explore the effects of genetic variation in the zzso pathway, we have zzso variations in zzso zzso zzso and zzso in relation to bone mass and fracture zzso in elderly zzso 

This study includes zzso elderly women, all 75 years old, from the zzso zzso Prospective zzso Assessment study zzso Single zzso zzso zzso from 4 genes and derived zzso in the zzso signaling zzso were zzso in zzso zzso 6 zzso in the zzso gene and 3 zzso each in the zzso zzso and zzso genes were investigated in relation to zzso zzso at zzso fracture zzso prevalent fractures of all types over zzso zzso and 174 incident fractures up to 7 years, X-ray zzso and serum zzso 

zzso zzso in the 4 zzso did not show any significant association with zzso Neither were zzso zzso and zzso zzso associated with zzso Three of 5 common zzso accounting for zzso of zzso at the zzso zzso were identified as independent zzso of zzso zzso 9 zzso was suggestive of an association with fractures of any type sustained during lifetime zzso with carriers of one or more copies of the zzso having the lowest zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and 5 zzso and 9 were suggestive of an association with fractures sustained between 50 and 75 years zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso 1 and 5 were more likely to suffer a fracture zzso 1, zzso zzso 5, zzso We zzso that while further zzso across the gene is recommended, in this cohort of elderly Swedish women, zzso in zzso may contribute to the risk of fracture through mechanisms that are independent of zzso
