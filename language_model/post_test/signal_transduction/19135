zzso zzso has been described to increase the resistance of cancer cells to radiation therapy and zzso It also supports the zzso and zzso potential of the zzso However, few data are available on the zzso zzso set up under zzso and leading to this resistance against zzso zzso zzso the main zzso factor activated by zzso has been recently shown to participate to this process although its role as an zzso or a zzso protein is still zzso In this study, we showed that zzso protected zzso cells against zzso zzso The effect of zzso on cell death was zzso by measuring different parameters of the zzso pathway, like DNA zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso The possible implication of zzso in the zzso role of zzso was investigated using zzso zzso Our results indicated that zzso is not involved in the zzso zzso zzso Another zzso factor, zzso was studied for its potential role in the zzso protection against zzso zzso zzso of zzso decreased the protection effect of zzso against zzso zzso Together, all these data underline that zzso could mediate its zzso role via different zzso factors depending on the cellular context and zzso zzso
