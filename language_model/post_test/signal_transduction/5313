Stage III melanoma is zzso to common therapies and shows resistance to the zzso activity of zzso in zzso We previously demonstrated that, for zzso of the zzso melanoma cell lines, zzso M zzso resistance is due to the zzso zzso of its zzso zzso Here we zzso on a larger panel of short-term cultures derived from zzso zzso zzso other mechanisms potentially implicated in zzso zzso For zzso of the cell lines, zzso resistance is associated with a zzso zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso on zzso zzso in zzso with defects in the zzso of various protein zzso C zzso zzso especially zzso For zzso of the cell lines, zzso resistance is associated with a zzso in the zzso of zzso on zzso By the use of zzso dominant zzso and small interfering zzso we show that the zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso appears necessary for zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we bring evidence that zzso or zzso zzso produced in zzso zzso and/or melanoma cells, could be involved in the establishment of zzso resistance during melanoma zzso These findings could be relevant for the prognosis and the treatment of stage III melanoma zzso
