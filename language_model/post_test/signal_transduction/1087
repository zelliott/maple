zzso interactions with zzso are essential for focal zzso zzso zzso contains three zzso zzso binding sites zzso that can bind individually to the zzso head zzso zzso Here we report the crystal structure of the human zzso complex, a validated model of the zzso structure, and zzso studies that demonstrate that all of zzso zzso activate zzso by provoking zzso bundle conversion of the zzso domain, which zzso the zzso tail zzso zzso Thus, zzso bundle conversion is a structurally zzso response in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso bind to zzso in a mutually exclusive manner but do differ in their affinity for zzso and in their ability to zzso zzso suggesting that the strengths of these interactions could lead to differences in signaling zzso These findings support a model in which zzso binds to and activates multiple zzso molecules to provoke rapid reorganization of the zzso zzso
