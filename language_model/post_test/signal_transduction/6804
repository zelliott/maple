The zzso signaling zzso is thought to regulate multiple stages of inner ear zzso zzso in the zzso signaling zzso cause disruptions in the number and arrangement of hair cells and supporting cells in sensory regions of the zzso In this study we identify an zzso zzso in the mouse zzso zzso a putative zzso factor, that results in mice with zzso and cochlear defects that are consistent with disrupted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso display zzso and circling behavior consistent with zzso zzso and significantly impaired zzso The zzso of newborn zzso zzso mice shows a significant reduction in outer hair cells and supporting cells and zzso inner hair zzso This zzso most closely resembles that seen in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso compound zzso have inner ear defects that are more severe than expected from simple additive effects of the single zzso indicating a genetic interaction between zzso and zzso In addition, expression of genes involved in zzso signaling in the inner ear are reduced in zzso zzso There is increased interest in how zzso affects inner ear development and zzso Our work is one of the first studies to suggest that a putative zzso factor has specific effects on zzso signaling zzso members and inner ear zzso
