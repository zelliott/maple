The potential zzso of zzso zzso signaling by zzso acid zzso has been investigated in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hybrid cells and zzso zzso zzso Acute incubation of zzso significantly attenuated delta zzso zzso zzso signaling induced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as measured by zzso of G proteins and zzso of zzso zzso The zzso by zzso was zzso and zzso and could be blocked by zzso of zzso zzso suggesting possible mediation through zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso G protein zzso was reversed by zzso of protein zzso C or by removal of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of zzso G protein zzso was independent of zzso zzso indicating that different zzso may zzso the zzso effect of zzso and zzso This notion was further supported by the results that zzso did not alter zzso zzso G protein zzso in zzso zzso cells but zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso cells with zzso of zzso receptors blocked the acute zzso of zzso zzso These data provide evidence that zzso may be involved in the zzso of zzso zzso signal zzso
