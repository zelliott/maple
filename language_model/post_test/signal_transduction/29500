The zzso zzso protein zzso and its zzso zzso counterpart zzso have been implicated in the zzso turnover of zzso E as well as the zzso family of zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso E promote zzso and zzso zzso in human zzso suggest that it may be a tumor zzso To generate an in zzso system to assess the consequences of such zzso zzso we generated mice deficient for zzso zzso mice die around zzso days post coitus because of a combination of deficiencies in zzso and vascular development and heart chamber zzso The absence of zzso results in elevated levels of zzso zzso concurrent with inappropriate DNA replication in zzso giant zzso zzso Moreover, the levels of both zzso 1 and zzso 4 zzso zzso were zzso leading to stimulation of downstream zzso pathways involving zzso zzso and zzso These data suggest essential functions for zzso in controlling zzso E and zzso signaling pathways in the zzso
