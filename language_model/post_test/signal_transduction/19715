zzso acids are the main zzso made by zzso These compounds have diverse functions and are immensely important in zzso zzso zzso compounds act as signaling molecules in the initiation of zzso zzso establishment of zzso zzso zzso and can act as agents in plant zzso zzso are a diverse class of zzso compounds that have received considerable attention as signaling molecules involved in zzso interactions compared to the more widely distributed, simple zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are both derived from the general zzso zzso This review describes the well-known roles attributed to zzso compounds as nod gene zzso of zzso zzso their roles in induction of the zzso gene in fungus for establishment of zzso zzso zzso their roles in inducing zzso gene expression in zzso and their roles as defense molecules operating against soil borne pathogens that could have great implications for zzso microbial zzso zzso plant zzso we have a lack of knowledge concerning the roles of zzso acids as signaling molecules beyond the relatively zzso roles of zzso This may be addressed through the use of plant zzso defective in zzso acids zzso or knock down target genes in future zzso
