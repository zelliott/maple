zzso induction has recently been shown to play a critical role in maintaining cell viability against several kinds of stress, including depletion of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso under specific experimental zzso However, the functional significance of zzso induction after stressful treatment has not been well zzso This article characterizes the different biological features associated with zzso induction by two kinds of stress agents, calcium zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso focusing on the association with zzso in human prostate cancer zzso Both IM and TM treatment resulted in marked induction of zzso zzso in zzso prostate cancer zzso cells maintained in medium without zzso but not in medium containing zzso as measured by Northern zzso and nuclear zzso zzso After zzso with tumor necrosis zzso which has potent zzso effects on zzso cells, both IM and TM could induce substantial increases in zzso zzso in zzso cells, even in medium containing zzso Under both experimental conditions zzso DNA fragmentation zzso showed a direct correlation between the onset of zzso in zzso cells after IM treatment and the initiation of zzso transcript zzso while induction of zzso expression preceded zzso zzso To zzso the functional differences of zzso induction by IM and zzso an zzso zzso zzso targeted against the zzso gene was designed to reduce zzso expression in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment substantially enhanced zzso of zzso cells induced by IM compared with mismatch control zzso treatment, whereas no marked differences were observed in zzso features induced by TM with zzso zzso and mismatch control zzso zzso Studies of additional zzso prostate cancer zzso cells also demonstrated a correlation between zzso induction and resistance to zzso after IM treatment, but not after TM zzso These findings suggest that there are at least two zzso signaling zzso which play different roles in resistance against zzso zzso
