zzso resistance and type 2 diabetes zzso are closely linked to zzso Numerous prospective studies have reported on weight gain, insulin resistance, and insulin signaling in experimental animals, but not in zzso We examined insulin signaling in zzso from lean volunteers, before and at the end of a zzso period of consuming a zzso zzso diet that led to weight zzso We also examined zzso from patients with zzso During the zzso diet, subjects gained zzso body weight and zzso total body fat, but stayed lean zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso and developed moderate systemic insulin zzso zzso to the situation in zzso subjects, in subjects on the zzso diet, the amount of insulin receptors was reduced and zzso of zzso at zzso and at zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso were zzso The amount of insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso at zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso were unaffected by the zzso Unlike the zzso subjects, in subjects on the zzso diet, likely zzso to the ongoing zzso zzso of zzso zzso became zzso to zzso To our knowledge this study is the first to investigate insulin signaling during zzso in humans, and it demonstrates that zzso effects on zzso insulin signaling already occur after 4 zzso of a zzso diet and that the effects in humans differ from those in laboratory zzso
