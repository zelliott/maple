zzso bond formation occurs in zzso proteins in zzso coli when the zzso zzso zzso a soluble zzso zzso zzso transfers a zzso to a zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is zzso by the zzso protein zzso To help identify the specificity zzso in zzso and to understand the nature of the kinetic barrier preventing direct zzso of newly zzso proteins by zzso we imposed selective pressure to find novel zzso in zzso that would function to bypass the need for the zzso carrier zzso We found a series of zzso localized to a short horizontal zzso anchored near the outer surface of the inner membrane of zzso that eliminated the need for zzso These zzso changed zzso zzso into zzso zzso We zzso that these zzso may act by decreasing the affinity of this zzso to the zzso The zzso zzso were dependent on the zzso zzso zzso a soluble zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso is not normally able to zzso zzso possibly due to a zzso clash that occurs between zzso and the membrane adjacent to zzso zzso must be in the reduced form to function as an zzso In contrast, zzso must remain oxidized to function as an zzso zzso zzso The lack of interaction that normally exists between zzso and zzso appears to provide a means to separate the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Our zzso in zzso may act by zzso zzso flow to take place through the zzso zzso
