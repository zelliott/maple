Although it is well established that both zzso assembly and the initiation of zzso growth in the zzso zzso occur independently of zzso hormone support, the factors controlling these processes remain poorly zzso We now report that zzso zzso signaling via zzso receptors are required for the growth of newly formed zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso the preferred zzso zzso are expressed in the infantile mouse zzso Initially, they are present in zzso but this site of expression switches to zzso cells after the newly assembled primordial zzso develop into growing primary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors are expressed at low and seemingly unchanging levels in the zzso and zzso cells of both primordial and growing zzso In contrast, a truncated zzso zzso lacking the zzso domain of the zzso is selectively expressed in zzso where it is targeted to the cell membrane as primary zzso initiate zzso Using zzso mice lacking all zzso zzso we show that the zzso of these mice or those lacking both zzso and zzso suffer a zzso zzso in early zzso development that compromises the ability of zzso to grow beyond the primary zzso zzso of zzso zzso for this zzso expression of zzso receptors zzso which reflects the degree of zzso differentiation of growing zzso are reduced in zzso zzso zzso from these animals grafted under the kidney capsule of zzso mice fail to sustain zzso growth and show a striking loss of zzso organization, preceded by massive zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso receptors are required for the early growth of zzso zzso and that they exert this function by primarily supporting zzso development as well as providing zzso cells with a zzso signal that requires zzso cell zzso zzso The predominance of truncated zzso receptors in zzso and their zzso pattern of zzso expression suggest that a significant number of zzso actions in the developing zzso zzso are zzso by these zzso
