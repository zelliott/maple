zzso zzso plays pivotal roles in plant response to zzso and environmental zzso During the past few years, the emerging evidence has led us to a new understanding of the signaling mechanisms and regulatory networks of the zzso zzso In this review, we focus on the major advances made in the past three years, particularly the findings leading to new zzso and the observations under zzso With the recent demonstration of the regulation of the protein stability of numerous key signaling components including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso we highlight zzso protein degradation as an essential regulatory mechanism that is widely adopted in the zzso signaling zzso We also discuss the implication of the negative feedback mechanism in the zzso signaling zzso in light of zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso Meanwhile, we zzso the controversy on the involvement of zzso cascade in the zzso signaling versus zzso pathway, and discuss the possible role of this zzso module in the zzso zzso Finally, we describe the complex interactions between zzso and other signaling pathways including zzso light, and plant innate zzso and propose that zzso act as a convergence point in the zzso signaling zzso
