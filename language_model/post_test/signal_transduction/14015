zzso species are produced during the zzso cellular metabolism of a normal zzso In turn, their presence is also attributed to pathological conditions including neurodegenerative zzso Many are the molecular changes that occur during the zzso of the zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso protein modifications zzso play a remarkable zzso In fact, several target proteins are modified in their zzso zzso zzso and expression after the cellular zzso Among zzso protein zzso represents a very important molecular modification zzso during zzso zzso It has been reported that this zzso modification is a fine sensor for zzso zzso Indeed, zzso zzso efficiency is affected by the exposure to zzso species in a different manner depending on the concentration and time of zzso Thus, we here report updated evidence that states the role of zzso in several pathological conditions, and we also outline the key involvement of zzso zzso zzso and small zzso modifier zzso cross zzso
