Deciphering global signaling networks is of great importance for the detailed understanding of cellular signaling processes controlling many important biological zzso Among signaling zzso zzso zzso has a central zzso At present, adequate techniques for the global characterization of the zzso zzso are zzso particularly for the analysis of small amounts of zzso By combining the power of zzso amplification with the unique properties of zzso zzso region 2 zzso zzso to specifically recognize zzso zzso we developed a new zzso approach, termed zzso multiplex zzso zzso For zzso multiple zzso zzso are labeled by zzso zzso zzso applied as zzso to complex protein zzso in a multiplex reaction and zzso interactions are zzso by zzso Using zzso we zzso zzso differential states of zzso zzso with high sensitivity and specificity in small amounts of whole cellular extracts as demonstrated for various tumor cell lines and human leukemia zzso
