The artificial selection of the directly acting or acute zzso tumor viruses for high transforming ability has led to the isolation of defective zzso zzso that have picked up, by accidental zzso some of the important genes that influence, trigger or regulate cell zzso These genes belong to at least four functionally different zzso Each of them can contribute to tumor development and/or progression after zzso by structural or regulatory zzso Growth factor genes may act as zzso following zzso zzso in a cell that normally responds to, but does not produce, the corresponding growth factor (the zzso model, exemplified by zzso Growth factor receptors may be fixed in a state of zzso faulty zzso by the zzso of their zzso zzso binding portion zzso zzso zzso Genes coding for proteins involved in signal zzso may be activated by point zzso in certain, important zzso zzso the zzso DNA binding zzso presumably involved in DNA replication may drive cell division after zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso or gene amplification zzso the zzso
