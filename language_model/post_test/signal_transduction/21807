zzso receptors zzso have recently been identified as the molecular entity underlying the cellular effects of zzso zzso In the present study we have investigated zzso zzso expression and zzso using cultured and acute slice zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso induced a transient increase in zzso zzso levels in both zzso and zzso via zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, a single application of zzso but not zzso nor zzso leads to prolonged zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in zzso zzso and zzso and zzso within cultures and acute zzso with prominent zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cultured zzso which exhibited the highest levels of zzso zzso also exhibited the largest zzso signals upon zzso zzso Given the importance of zzso zzso in zzso synaptic plasticity and zzso zzso may play a key zzso role in these zzso
