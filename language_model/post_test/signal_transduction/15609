Novel therapeutic strategies such as the zzso of zzso cell and zzso function have exhibited great potential in clinical zzso Human zzso zzso zzso is a zzso that plays a significant role in establishing complex mechanisms to protect zzso fetuses from rejection by the maternal immune zzso The unique characteristics of both zzso and soluble zzso of zzso the formation of zzso zzso with the potential to augment zzso zzso zzso and the function of zzso as a preferential zzso for the zzso transcript receptors make zzso very important in fundamental approaches for the zzso of immune responses to improve zzso graft survival in clinical zzso Experimental data from several groups as well as our data from experiments involving zzso human zzso zzso cells in zzso and zzso transgenic mice in zzso indicate that different zzso of zzso have various zzso effects through the zzso zzso This knowledge is crucial in understanding mechanisms of zzso of zzso zzso The analyses of zzso zzso and zzso receptors in patients with kidney zzso and the relationship among different zzso of zzso zzso zzso their zzso zzso and graft acceptance or failure will be discussed zzso
