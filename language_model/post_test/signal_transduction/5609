A role for zzso in B cell development and signaling has been suggested by previous work showing that zzso mice have defects in bone zzso B cell development and that zzso B cells are zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso Here we show that in addition to defects in early B cell development, zzso mice have defects in peripheral B cell development, including reduced percentages of zzso zzso cells as well as transitional and marginal zone B cells in the zzso It has been shown that zzso zzso activity increases upon B cell zzso zzso stimulation and that one of the targets of zzso zzso by zzso is zzso However, the consequences of zzso activity on B cell zzso and zzso signaling remain zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso B cells exhibit reduced calcium flux in response to zzso zzso consistent with a role for zzso in zzso zzso Additionally, we show that zzso B cells are defective in their ability to be activated in response to zzso zzso engagement, suggesting a functional role for zzso in zzso zzso signaling zzso
