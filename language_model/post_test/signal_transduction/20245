In zzso zzso zzso tissue cultures, two timely separated sequences of nerve fiber growth have been zzso The first appearing nerve fiber pattern is a long-distance outgrowth that occurs before zzso start to zzso and migrate to form an zzso zzso that finally surrounds the tissue zzso These long-distance growing nerve fibers are zzso as the zzso zzso and are followed by a secondary zzso The secondary outgrowth is persistent in time but reaches short zzso comparable with outgrowth seen from a zzso graft implanted to the zzso The present study was focused on the interaction between the zzso and the long-distance growing zzso associated nerve zzso Cross talk between zzso and zzso formation might occur through the zzso protein zzso zzso serves as a zzso for signal regulatory protein zzso zzso and as a zzso for the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso day 14 zzso zzso tissue from zzso and zzso mice was used to investigate zzso migration and the zzso zzso zzso -positive outgrowth that occurred remote from the zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso nerve fiber outgrowth in zzso cultures reached significantly longer distances and higher density compared to nerve fibers formed in zzso cultures at 14 days in zzso These nerve fibers often had a dotted appearance in zzso zzso No difference in the zzso migration was zzso Further investigations revealed that the presence of zzso in control culture did neither hamper zzso growth through zzso nor through zzso since similar outgrowth was found in zzso zzso cultures and in zzso cultures treated with blocking zzso against the zzso respectively, as in the control zzso In conclusion, long-distance growing nerve fiber formation is promoted by the absence of zzso even though the presence of zzso is not zzso
