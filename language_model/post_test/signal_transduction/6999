G zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso is a ubiquitous zzso protein zzso able to zzso and zzso the active form of several G zzso zzso Given the lack of selective zzso for zzso we investigated the effects zzso by zzso zzso in vascular responses using global adult zzso mice zzso The zzso responses to zzso or zzso were increased in zzso and zzso resistance arteries from zzso mice compared with zzso zzso zzso After zzso II zzso infusion, zzso mice were partially protected against hypertension, vascular zzso and mechanical zzso even when resting zzso blood pressures were not significantly zzso zzso infusion also zzso increased zzso levels in zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso increased zzso responses to zzso in zzso but not in zzso zzso and zzso decreased zzso responses to zzso and vascular zzso and zzso levels more in zzso than in zzso zzso zzso NO production and the zzso of zzso responses by zzso NO remained enhanced in zzso mice infused with zzso Thus, zzso mice are resistant to the development of vascular zzso and mechanical zzso zzso dysfunction, increased zzso responses, and hypertension induced by zzso at least partially through the preservation of NO zzso In conclusion, our results describe an important role for zzso in systemic hypertension and further establish that an zzso of zzso could be a beneficial treatment for this zzso
