zzso virus zzso zzso human primary B zzso and zzso and maintains proliferation of these cells efficiently in zzso zzso of zzso virus which express zzso nuclear zzso 2 zzso in a conditional fashion allow dissection of individual contributions of viral genes to B cell zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of cellular and viral zzso including the viral zzso membrane protein 1 zzso which is essential for B cell zzso and has zzso effects in zzso zzso To analyze the role of this gene in B cell zzso zzso was zzso expressed in B cells infected with zzso carrying a conditional zzso zzso In the absence of functional zzso zzso was incapable of sustaining B cell proliferation in two independent zzso but induced a zzso consistent with prolonged cell zzso zzso of zzso displayed a comparable zzso These data indicate that both zzso zzso and zzso expression may use a common zzso for B cell zzso zzso of human B cells, however, requires one or more additional signals triggered by zzso
