The vascular zzso is a key target of circulating bacterial zzso zzso zzso elicits a wide array of zzso responses, including the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and tissue factor, many of which are dependent on zzso B zzso In addition, zzso has been demonstrated to induce zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso Although the mechanism by which zzso activates zzso B has been well zzso the signaling zzso involved in zzso zzso remains zzso Using a variety of dominant negative zzso we have identified a role for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso signaling in human zzso zzso We also demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso B zzso and zzso occur independent of one zzso Together, these data suggest that the zzso signaling molecules involved in zzso zzso B zzso have a requisite involvement in zzso zzso and that the pathways leading to zzso B zzso and zzso diverge downstream of zzso
