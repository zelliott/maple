zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso is known to be involved in cellular functions relevant to brain health and disease, including zzso channel zzso zzso regulation, neurotransmitter release, synaptic zzso and zzso Brain aging is characterized by altered zzso molecular zzso and zzso communication in response to various zzso In the last few years we have provided evidence that in zzso despite no changes in zzso zzso levels (both calcium dependent and calcium zzso the zzso process of the zzso and zzso zzso and the content of the zzso protein zzso zzso for activated C zzso are deficient in zzso brain zzso Moreover, human studies have shown that zzso and its zzso protein zzso are also zzso in pathological brain aging zzso Alzheimer's zzso in fact, zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels are both deficient in an zzso zzso These data point to the notion that, in addition to a zzso zzso environment zzso changes in zzso interactions may impair the mechanisms of zzso zzso in zzso It is interesting to note that interventions to counteract the age-related functional loss also restore zzso zzso and the zzso protein machinery zzso A better insight into the factors controlling zzso zzso may be important not only to zzso the molecular basis of signal transmission, but also to identify new strategies to correct or even to prevent zzso zzso in zzso zzso
