zzso zzso working through zzso receptors have a differential ability to stimulate release of zzso calcium zzso and zzso of protein zzso C zzso Since targets of this zzso release could play a role in zzso zzso we first tested the hypothesis that zzso protein zzso II zzso is activated by some zzso and zzso zzso We report that zzso and zzso zzso that activate zzso release and zzso also activate zzso activity in zzso zzso while zzso and zzso zzso that activate zzso function do zzso This zzso occurs within 10 zzso after zzso zzso in a zzso zzso manner, zzso with zzso of zzso zzso Based on data that zzso and zzso are present zzso in zzso eggs, and activate zzso we then tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso in axis formation in the early zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity from zzso and zzso regions of zzso revealed elevated activity on the prospective zzso side, which was suppressed by a dominant negative zzso If this spatial bias in zzso activity were involved in promoting zzso cell fate one might predict that zzso zzso activity on the zzso side would inhibit zzso cell zzso while reducing zzso activity on the zzso side would promote zzso cell zzso zzso obtained by expression of zzso zzso were consistent with this zzso revealing that zzso contributes to a zzso cell zzso
