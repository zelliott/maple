zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso agent of soft rot disease on many plants, is a complex process involving several factors whose production is regulated by a complex, intertwined regulatory zzso In this work we characterized the zzso regulator, member of the zzso zzso system, as a global regulator which is required for disease expression but not for bacterial zzso in zzso during the first stages of the plant zzso zzso was shown to control the expression of plant cell zzso zzso and zzso genes in zzso Analysis of zzso gene expression during infection of zzso zzso revealed a coordinated expression of these zzso genes at 12 h post infection and showed that zzso is required for the appropriate production of zzso factors in zzso zzso might partly act by zzso controlling the expression of the zzso gene zzso the global zzso zzso indicating a hierarchy in the pathways involved in the zzso zzso regulatory zzso
