Multiple signal zzso pathways including protein zzso C, zzso zzso and an independent third signaling mechanism are involved in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the incubation of zzso cell with zzso induced maximum level of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was abolished by treating the cells with both zzso and zzso however, only a portion of the zzso expression was inhibited by zzso This is in accordance with the observation that zzso induced the expression of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Thus, a third signal zzso zzso other than protein zzso C or zzso zzso is involved in the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in human zzso zzso
