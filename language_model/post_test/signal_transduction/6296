The zzso zzso plays a critical role in the development of zzso However, the role of the zzso zzso in prostate cancer is not zzso zzso cancer is the second most prevalent cause of cancer death in American zzso zzso identification of novel therapeutic targets for prostate cancer has significant clinical zzso 

Here we report that zzso of the zzso zzso occurs frequently in advanced human prostate zzso We find that high levels of zzso target zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso are detected in over zzso of prostate tumors with zzso scores zzso but in only zzso of tumors with zzso scores zzso Furthermore, four available zzso tumors all have high expression of zzso and zzso To identify the mechanism of the zzso signaling zzso we examine expression of zzso zzso a negative regulator of the zzso zzso We find that zzso protein is zzso in 11 of 27 zzso positive tumors, two of them contain zzso zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, expression of sonic zzso protein is detected in majority of zzso positive tumors (24 out of zzso High levels of zzso target genes are also detected in four prostate cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso We demonstrate that zzso of zzso signaling by zzso zzso zzso suppresses zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso In addition, cancer cells expressing zzso under the zzso promoter are resistant to zzso zzso All these data suggest a significant role of the zzso zzso for cellular functions of prostate cancer zzso 

Our data indicate that zzso of the zzso pathway, through loss of zzso or zzso of sonic zzso may involve tumor progression and zzso of prostate zzso Thus, targeted zzso of zzso signaling may have significant implications of prostate cancer zzso
