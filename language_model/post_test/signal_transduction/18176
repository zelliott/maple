The signal zzso pathways initiated by zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in human zzso remain zzso In a previous study, we showed that the zzso of zzso by zzso is zzso zzso The present study demonstrates that the signals initiated by zzso involve zzso of zzso zzso zzso but not the formation of the zzso protein complex, zzso zzso of zzso activity by zzso is zzso by zzso gamma receptors zzso and not by complement receptors for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso activity zzso by either of the zzso or by both is similar to that of zzso zzso zzso and was detected as early as 15 s after zzso maintained a plateau for 10 zzso and decreased zzso zzso zzso was detected also within 15 s but decreased significantly 5 zzso after zzso The zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused a partial zzso during the time course of zzso activity, whereas their combination caused a total zzso Thus, although zzso zzso is significantly shorter than that of zzso zzso zzso it is equally required for zzso and maintenance of zzso activity by occupancy of a single zzso zzso or zzso
