zzso muscle protein synthesis rate decreases during zzso but the underlying regulatory mechanisms are poorly zzso It was hypothesized that there would be a coordinated regulation of zzso zzso factor 2 zzso and zzso initiation factor zzso protein 1 zzso zzso by zzso zzso downstream of rises in zzso zzso and decreased energy charge via zzso protein zzso zzso in contracting skeletal zzso When zzso skeletal muscles were contracted ex zzso using different zzso the suppression of protein synthesis correlated more closely with changes in zzso than zzso zzso Using a combination of zzso release agents and zzso zzso it was shown that the zzso suppression of zzso skeletal muscle protein synthesis during contraction was equally distributed between zzso and energy zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso completely blunted increases in zzso zzso and partially blunted zzso zzso the suppression of protein synthesis during zzso The 3- to zzso increase in skeletal muscle zzso zzso during zzso in zzso was rapid and sustained and restricted to working zzso The increase in zzso zzso and zzso zzso were downstream of zzso zzso but not other putative zzso factors such as a fall in zzso pH or zzso by protein zzso Furthermore, blunted protein synthesis and zzso zzso were unrelated to zzso activity during zzso which was exemplified by normal zzso of protein synthesis during zzso in muscles zzso zzso zzso In zzso in zzso skeletal muscle, the zzso of zzso activity by zzso downstream of zzso zzso partially contributes to the suppression of protein synthesis during zzso
