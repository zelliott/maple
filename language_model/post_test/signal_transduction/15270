zzso of zzso zzso proteins and import of those proteins into zzso are indispensable for zzso zzso One possible cellular mechanism that coordinates these two essential processes is retrograde signaling from zzso to the zzso However, the molecular details of how this signaling occurs remain zzso Using the zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso which lacks the zzso protein import zzso we demonstrate that the expression of zzso nuclear genes is tightly coordinated with their import into zzso zzso of zzso nuclear genes is also observed in zzso lacking other components of the zzso protein import zzso zzso studies indicate that the coordination of zzso protein import and nuclear gene expression is independent of proposed zzso signaling pathways such as the zzso of zzso IX and the activity of zzso zzso zzso Instead, it may involve zzso and the zzso factor zzso The expression level of zzso is tightly correlated with the expression of zzso nuclear genes in zzso defective in zzso protein zzso Furthermore, the activity of zzso appears to zzso the expression of zzso when zzso are zzso Based on these data, we suggest that defects in zzso protein import generate a signal that zzso zzso nuclear genes through repression of zzso expression but not through zzso of zzso
