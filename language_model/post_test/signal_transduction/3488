New cancer therapies are likely to arise from an in-depth understanding of the signaling networks influencing tumor zzso progression and zzso We show a fundamental role for zzso 2 zzso zzso 2 zzso in these processes in human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso and zzso breast zzso zzso of zzso eradicated breast zzso cells in zzso models, and zzso depletion also prevented invasion in three-dimensional cultures and in a zzso invasion zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in established breast tumors blocked their growth and reduced zzso zzso zzso activated zzso zzso factors, including zzso zzso viral zzso zzso zzso and zinc finger zzso binding zzso 1 zzso which resulted in the repression of zzso zzso and the expression of a set of zzso zzso zzso We found these genes to be simultaneously activated in a large subset of human primary breast tumors that are associated with invasive behavior and poor zzso These results provide new insights into the signaling zzso influencing zzso cells as well as a rationale for targeting zzso in breast zzso
