After the binding of zzso zzso or zzso to their respective receptors on activated human B cells, a zzso cascade of zzso events is initiated that results in the zzso of zzso However, it is not known whether these different zzso receptors use common or divergent signal zzso pathways to stimulate zzso zzso zzso we examined the signaling mechanisms used by a human zzso cell line arrested at a late stage of zzso zzso that zzso zzso following stimulation with zzso zzso or zzso zzso Our study demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso by zzso cells was inhibited by either the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso To investigate the early zzso events initiated by these zzso a zzso preparation from zzso cells was isolated in a manner that minimized the disruption of membrane protein complexes and then incubated with zzso zzso or zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the rapid zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, in contrast to the zzso and zzso proteins that remained zzso for up to 30 zzso zzso the zzso protein was rapidly zzso within 15 zzso of zzso The observation that zzso zzso of the same proteins was zzso by zzso zzso and zzso suggested that the zzso activated either different protein zzso with the same zzso specificity or the same protein zzso In addition, stimulation of intact zzso cells with either zzso zzso or zzso induced the zzso of two proteins with molecular masses of zzso to zzso and 85 to zzso Taken together, our data demonstrate that zzso of both a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso is involved in the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso by zzso cells and zzso of the same or a similar zzso protein zzso is an early step in the signal zzso zzso used by these zzso
