The negative factor zzso of human and zzso zzso viruses zzso zzso and zzso is required for high levels of zzso and progression to zzso Additionally, zzso leads to cellular zzso increased viral zzso and decreased expression of zzso on the cell zzso Previously, we and others demonstrated that zzso associates with a cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso Recently, it was demonstrated that zzso bears structural and functional similarity to zzso zzso zzso 

In this study, we demonstrate that zzso not only binds to but also activates zzso via the small zzso zzso and zzso First, the zzso zzso zzso via its zzso domain, and zzso zzso zzso and zzso block the ability of zzso to associate with and activate zzso Second, zzso active small zzso zzso and zzso zzso the effects of zzso Third, interactions between zzso and zzso result in several cellular zzso functions, such as zzso of the zzso zzso And finally, zzso zzso and zzso decrease levels of zzso production to those of virus from which the zzso gene is zzso 

By zzso zzso via small zzso and their downstream zzso zzso interacts with regulatory pathways required for cell growth, zzso zzso and zzso Thus, zzso could participate in the budding of new zzso the modification of viral proteins and the increased zzso of surface molecules such as zzso Moreover, blocking the activity of these zzso could lead to new therapeutic interventions against zzso
