The recent report of the crystal structure of zzso provides insights concerning zzso relationships in visual zzso and related G zzso receptors zzso The seven zzso zzso of zzso are interrupted or zzso at multiple zzso An extensive network of zzso interactions zzso the ground state of the zzso The zzso pocket of zzso is remarkably zzso and several zzso interactions were not predicted from zzso or zzso zzso The zzso movement model of zzso zzso which likely applies to all zzso of the zzso family, is supported by several structural elements that suggest how zzso zzso changes in the zzso pocket are transmitted to the zzso zzso The zzso domain of the zzso includes a zzso domain extending from the seventh zzso segment parallel to the zzso zzso The zzso surface appears to be approximately large enough to bind to the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The structural basis for several unique zzso properties of zzso including its extremely low dark noise level and high quantum efficiency, can now be addressed using a combination of structural biology and various zzso zzso Future high-resolution structural studies of zzso and other zzso will form the basis to zzso the detailed molecular mechanism of zzso signal zzso
