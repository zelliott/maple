Colony stimulating factor 1 zzso is the primary regulator of cells of the zzso zzso zzso zzso mice lacking zzso zzso have depleted populations of zzso in many zzso In addition, both sexes have reduced fertility with females having extended zzso cycles and poor zzso rates, whereas males have low circulating zzso and zzso In this study, we show that zzso was significantly delayed in zzso females compared with control zzso Restoration of circulating zzso over the first 2 zzso of life accelerated zzso and this treatment until zzso completely corrected the extended zzso zzso In a standard zzso surge induction zzso zzso females showed diminutive negative and no positive feedback response to zzso These data, together with that from male zzso mice that showed normal release of zzso with a zzso zzso indicate that the zzso is the site of the primary zzso causing fertility problems in zzso zzso In the zzso zzso are the only zzso zzso cells, and the recruitment of a full complement these cells is slightly delayed in zzso zzso These data suggest a role for zzso and its target cells, zzso in establishing the feedback sensitivity to circulating steroid hormones in the zzso of zzso
