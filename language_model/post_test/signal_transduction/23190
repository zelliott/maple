Natural killer zzso cell responses are regulated by a dynamic equilibrium between zzso and zzso zzso signals at the immune zzso (or zzso with target zzso Although the organization of receptors at the immune zzso is important for appropriate integration of these signals, there is little understanding of this in detail, because research has been hampered by the limited resolution of light zzso Through the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso to reveal the organization of the zzso cell surface at the zzso level, we report that the zzso zzso zzso is organized in zzso clusters at the surface of human resting zzso zzso zzso of zzso became smaller and denser upon engagement of the zzso zzso zzso establishing an unexpected zzso between zzso zzso signals and the positioning of zzso zzso These zzso in the zzso organization of surface zzso cell receptors were dependent on the zzso zzso Together, these data establish that zzso cell zzso involves a zzso reorganization of surface zzso which in turn affects models for signal integration and thresholds that control zzso cell zzso functions and zzso cell zzso
