The effects of initial zzso concentration and calcium zzso concentration on the zzso acid production by the parent strain, zzso zzso zzso were zzso The results of the experiments indicated that zzso and zzso zzso the cell growth and the zzso acid production by zzso zzso zzso A zzso acid zzso strain, zzso zzso zzso was screened by zzso the parent strain with ultraviolet zzso light zzso and selecting the high zzso and zzso calcium concentration repression resistant zzso Starting with a concentration of zzso zzso zzso the zzso produced zzso g zzso zzso acid after 60 h in zzso zzso higher than that of the parent zzso The zzso acid purity was zzso by weight based on the amount of total zzso zzso The culture of the parent strain could not be analyzed well by conventional zzso flux analysis techniques, since some zzso were accumulated zzso zzso a revised flux analysis method was proposed by introducing zzso zzso zzso Further studies demonstrate that there is a high level of zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso in the parent zzso The molecular mechanisms of the strain improvement were proposed, zzso the high level of zzso zzso activity was eliminated and the zzso rate of zzso was increased from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso the parent strain with zzso and therefore the zzso strain converts mostly zzso to zzso acid with a higher productivity zzso g zzso zzso than the parent strain zzso g zzso zzso
