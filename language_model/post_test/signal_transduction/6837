We investigated the expression of zzso zzso zzso 13 zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso in 98 breast cancer zzso patients with zzso duct zzso out of which 56 were found zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso and zzso showed a significant correlation with zzso zzso zzso to zzso transition zzso is highly associated with zzso we investigated zzso potential of zzso in BC cell zzso In zzso BC cells, expression of various zzso markers zzso zzso zzso regulators zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was increased, whereas the expression of zzso marker zzso was found to be zzso In addition, expression of zzso zzso of nuclear factor zzso zzso which is known to regulate zzso expression via zzso zzso was also significantly increased after zzso zzso Using specific protein zzso zzso we confirmed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression via zzso axis in BC cell zzso To further validate this zzso we examined gene expression patterns in primary breast tumors and detected significantly higher expression of various zzso markers and regulators in zzso zzso zzso zzso this study showed the zzso potential of zzso as well as demonstrated the zzso value of zzso zzso in primary zzso Moreover, zzso axis may present a therapeutic target in zzso positive BC zzso
