The mouse zzso cell line zzso is a well-established test system used to characterize the intrinsic activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso This cell line is zzso with a zzso expression zzso containing the gene of the rat zzso zzso (short zzso of the zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso In addition to the expression of high levels of the rat zzso zzso these mouse cells also express zzso binding zzso zzso affinities of zzso zzso zzso haloperidol, zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso binding sites as well as for the zzso zzso in zzso of zzso cells were zzso Using intact zzso cells, it was found that the influence of zzso zzso on zzso via the zzso zzso can be explained by their affinity for the latter zzso zzso zzso zzso did not influence zzso signal zzso in zzso zzso It is therefore concluded that the zzso cell is a suitable test model for determination of the intrinsic activity of zzso zzso zzso even if these compounds have affinity for zzso binding zzso
