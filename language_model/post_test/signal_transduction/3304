zzso signaling pathways are reported to maintain zzso in zzso stem zzso Mouse embryonic stem cells zzso respond to leukemia zzso factor zzso and bone zzso protein zzso activity, whereas human zzso depend upon zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso In the majority of zzso investigated, however, the signals that support stem cell zzso are not well zzso as is evident by the persistent difficulties in maintaining authentic stable zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso could provide an alternative way to produce zzso cells from zzso species, and facilitate identification of core zzso signaling zzso To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in zzso we zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso and zzso and maintained the resulting cultures in medium containing either zzso or zzso zzso zzso positive colonies with zzso mouse zzso zzso were zzso recovered using zzso medium supplemented with zzso These cell lines expressed the zzso stem cell zzso factors, zzso zzso and zzso and the cell surface marker zzso consistent with acquisition of an zzso zzso However, restricted differentiation potential, and persistent expression of zzso zzso indicated that zzso was zzso Interestingly, zzso activated both the zzso factor zzso and its target gene zzso and zzso cell growth, indicating functional zzso of the signaling zzso in these zzso This demonstration of zzso in zzso pig cells supports the notion that the connection between zzso signaling and the core regulatory network of zzso stem cells is a zzso zzso in zzso
