zzso zzso zzso alpha is zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso in approximately one third of zzso breast zzso which renders breast cancer cells expressing the zzso zzso hypersensitive for proliferation in response to low doses of zzso It is known that zzso is zzso modified by protein zzso and zzso by a number of secondary zzso signaling zzso The zzso zzso zzso resides at a major protein zzso site adjacent to a potential protein zzso A zzso zzso site at zzso zzso within the hinge domain of the zzso zzso of this zzso site to zzso acid to mimic zzso zzso blocks zzso of the zzso zzso site and generates an enhanced zzso response similar to that seen with the naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling by the zzso zzso zzso zzso analog zzso further enhances zzso sensitivity of the zzso zzso whereas a specific zzso inhibitor zzso this zzso We propose that the hypersensitive zzso zzso breast cancer zzso involves an integration of coupled zzso and zzso events by upstream signaling zzso
