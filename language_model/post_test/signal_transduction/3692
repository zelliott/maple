zzso genetic studies suggest that in the zzso zzso signaling pathway, the segment polarity gene products, zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso and zzso zzso work zzso zzso and zzso zzso regulate zzso which in turn zzso zzso To zzso analyze interactions between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which bind to zzso we zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso wing disc cell line, clone 8, which responds to zzso zzso zzso zzso led to zzso of zzso primarily in the zzso and zzso of zzso at cell zzso zzso of zzso and zzso forms of zzso decreased and increased zzso levels, respectively, indicating that zzso in zzso activity zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso with an zzso deletion elevated zzso levels, suggesting that zzso zzso zzso is caused by the zzso zzso induced by zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso and truncated zzso zzso of zzso protein was accompanied by a marked increase in the zzso levels of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso is activated by zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso elevated zzso levels by stabilizing zzso at zzso zzso
