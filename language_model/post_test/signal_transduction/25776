Loss of muscle mass with aging is a major public health zzso zzso zzso fatty acids stimulate protein zzso in animals and might therefore be useful for the treatment of zzso However, the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on human protein metabolism is zzso 

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on the rate of muscle protein synthesis in older zzso 

Sixteen healthy, older adults were randomly assigned to receive either omega-3 fatty acids or corn oil for 8 zzso The rate of muscle protein synthesis and the zzso of key elements of the anabolic signaling zzso were evaluated before and after supplementation during zzso zzso conditions and during a zzso zzso 

Corn oil supplementation had no effect on the muscle protein synthesis rate and the extent of anabolic signaling element zzso in zzso zzso fatty acid supplementation had no effect on the zzso rate of muscle protein synthesis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso before and after zzso zzso P zzso zzso but zzso the zzso increase in the rate of muscle protein synthesis (from zzso zzso zzso above zzso values to zzso zzso zzso above zzso values; P zzso zzso which was accompanied by greater increases in muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso fatty acids stimulate muscle protein synthesis in older adults and may be useful for the prevention and treatment of zzso This trial was registered at clinical zzso as zzso
