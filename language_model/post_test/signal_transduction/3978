The role of zzso B in regulating zzso zzso was investigated by using zzso zzso is a microbial zzso known to inhibit only the zzso activity of the zzso which is required for zzso B zzso When activated by immobilized zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells zzso zzso I zzso B zzso zzso zzso B into the nucleus, transcribed zzso genes and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and expressed zzso zzso zzso strongly blocked I zzso B beta degradation and the zzso of zzso B zzso zzso but had little effect on the expression of the zzso factors, zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso did not inhibit the nuclear zzso of zzso whereas zzso A inhibited the zzso of both zzso B and zzso The expression of zzso and zzso two zzso genes implicated in zzso gene zzso was blocked by zzso zzso the expression of zzso gene and zzso zzso was zzso zzso a well-known zzso zzso which zzso the zzso activities of the zzso and zzso zzso also inhibited zzso B zzso and zzso zzso However, these events were not inhibited by the highly specific zzso zzso inhibitor zzso These observations provide further evidence that zzso zzso is regulated by the zzso Furthermore, zzso must be added early in order to efficiently inhibit the induction of zzso zzso indicating that the early events are critical for zzso gene zzso Our study zzso the zzso I zzso B degradation and zzso B zzso into a T cell zzso cascade which results in zzso gene zzso and the expression of zzso zzso
