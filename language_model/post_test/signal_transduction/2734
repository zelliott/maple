An early consequence of T cell zzso is an increase in zzso calcium zzso Recent advances in video laser microscopic techniques enable the examination of individual cells over time following zzso Such studies have revealed that cells can undergo zzso distinct patterns of calcium zzso suggesting that different patterns of calcium flux may be associated with different signaling pathways and may zzso affect late events in cell zzso In this report, we identify distinct patterns of calcium zzso in zzso T cells following the zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso or following the zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso These effects can be further modified by the zzso of zzso We find that zzso zzso of zzso alone zzso a single spike in the vast majority of cells shortly after the addition of the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso alone zzso a delayed pattern of repetitive calcium spikes which are decreased in zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso a sustained increase in zzso calcium zzso which is dependent on the presence of zzso zzso This sustained increase in zzso calcium concentration is also seen following zzso zzso of zzso and zzso after T cell interaction with specific zzso and zzso zzso Finally, the simultaneous zzso of zzso zzso and zzso abrogates the sustained increase in calcium seen following zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that the qualitative nature of T cell zzso signaling can be modulated by the molecular association of other signaling zzso which may be part of the T cell zzso complex or zzso
