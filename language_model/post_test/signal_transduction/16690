zzso are small protein molecules that facilitate communication between cells of the immune system and other zzso Their zzso function elicits responses in other cells, ranging from DNA binding and tissue zzso to zzso the local cellular response to zzso The magnitude of the zzso response is regulated closely, because an zzso or zzso of zzso activity can impair organ function and cause shock and tissue zzso zzso molecular and zzso mechanisms protect the host from zzso zzso including the zzso system, and the zzso zzso zzso These zzso systems are zzso but they are relatively zzso zzso dependent, and not zzso We recently discovered that the zzso zzso zzso a nervous zzso zzso and locally acting zzso can inhibit the zzso zzso zzso transmitted via the zzso nerve zzso on zzso cells that express the zzso zzso zzso alpha 7 zzso zzso The zzso zzso is an essential component of the zzso zzso pathway, because zzso of this zzso prevents zzso zzso Advances in understanding the molecular structure and function of zzso have begun to provide a better understanding of potential mechanisms regarding its zzso zzso and zzso zzso It may be possible to exploit this zzso to therapeutic advantage for diseases caused by excessive zzso zzso
