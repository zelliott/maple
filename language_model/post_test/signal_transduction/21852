zzso proteins are zzso zzso zzso that promote degradation of zzso and zzso zzso proteins through the zzso zzso in animal zzso A zzso protein in zzso zzso also has zzso zzso zzso activity and has important roles to play under conditions of zzso zzso In an effort to study the mode of action of zzso in plant cells, proteins that physically interact with it were zzso Like its animal zzso zzso interacts with a unique class of zzso zzso zzso or zzso that belongs to the zzso zzso class in zzso zzso also interacts with other zzso including an A zzso of protein zzso 2A zzso This zzso zzso appears to be a zzso of zzso because it can be zzso by zzso in zzso and because the activity of zzso is increased in zzso plants in the dark or under zzso zzso Unlike the zzso zzso that has reduced zzso activity due to a zzso in one of the A zzso genes of zzso zzso plants are more sensitive to zzso zzso Since zzso was previously shown to be involved in zzso responses in plants, the zzso zzso observed in zzso plants might be partly due to the change in zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso zzso zzso may function upstream of zzso in zzso signal zzso pathways under conditions of low temperature or in the zzso
