Cell lines zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso were previously described by zzso These cell lines were generated by the introduction of the full length zzso coding for zzso into zzso zzso Here we show that zzso of zzso by zzso induced in these cells specific zzso of two cellular proteins zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso previously identified as a zzso for zzso was also zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins were associated with particulate zzso zzso and were zzso with the use of zzso zzso Time course analysis of zzso induced zzso of zzso and zzso revealed zzso stimulation of zzso after zzso zzso zzso acid analysis showed that zzso of zzso and zzso occurred mainly on zzso zzso zzso of zzso was also on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of both zzso and zzso the zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso growth factor zzso enhanced zzso of zzso but not zzso Thus, our studies showed the involvement of zzso in the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso and provided direct evidence for the role of zzso in cellular signaling by zzso and zzso Moreover, the fact that zzso of zzso was specific to zzso zzso zzso may suggest its involvement in tumor zzso zzso of zzso and zzso will enable us to reveal the zzso cascade activated downstream to zzso and to determine their role in zzso signaling and tumor zzso
