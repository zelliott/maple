zzso zzso responsible for initiating the formation of zzso embryonic structures such as limbs are not well zzso zzso formation occurs as a result of interplay between zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso What zzso these signaling zzso and thus limb bud outgrowth at defined locations along the zzso axis of the zzso is not zzso The zzso zzso factor zzso is important for normal heart and limb formation, but its role in early limb development is not well zzso We report that mouse zzso lacking zzso do not form zzso zzso although the patterning of the lateral plate zzso into the limb field is zzso zzso is not essential for an early establishment of zzso versus zzso zzso In the absence of zzso the zzso and zzso regulatory zzso required for limb bud outgrowth are not established, including initiation of zzso zzso zzso directly activates the zzso gene via a zzso binding site, providing a simple and direct mechanism for limb bud zzso zzso zzso signaling is not essential for initiation of zzso or zzso transcription, but is required in concert with zzso for maintenance of normal levels of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is not essential for the early establishment of the limb field in the lateral plate zzso but is a primary and direct zzso of zzso bud zzso These data suggest common pathways for the differentiation and growth of embryonic structures downstream of zzso zzso
