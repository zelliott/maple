zzso zzso zzso is generated on early zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso This zzso serves important regulatory functions in zzso zzso traffic, zzso zzso and microbial killing through the recruitment and zzso of a number of zzso zzso Almost all of these zzso contain zzso or zzso zzso functional protein zzso which are zzso from zzso to zzso zzso information is available regarding the binding of zzso and zzso zzso to zzso The two zzso are highly different, but they have in common that clusters of basic zzso mediate zzso binding through interactions with the zzso groups of zzso Most proteins that contain zzso or zzso zzso serve as regulators of zzso membrane trafficking, whereas others function as regulators of zzso zzso signal zzso microbial killing and other cellular activities of relevance for the immune zzso
