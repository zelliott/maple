zzso zzso of zzso are among the most frequently found genetic zzso in human zzso zzso Ras appears to be an attractive target for therapeutic intervention using gene zzso The protein zzso zzso acts as a direct downstream zzso of Ras and is involved in zzso cellular zzso Using the zzso zzso tumor cell line zzso which expresses zzso zzso we analyzed whether dominant negative zzso of zzso can inhibit zzso zzso zzso gene transfer was used to zzso zzso zzso cells with three different dominant negative zzso of zzso This resulted in zzso of the transformed zzso in zzso as evidenced by an increase in contact zzso and reduced zzso zzso However, tumor formation in nude mice was significantly delayed only by one of these zzso zzso dominant negative zzso of the zzso zzso which is known to zzso with zzso in tumor formation, were zzso into zzso cells expressing a dominant negative zzso zzso This leads to killing of the zzso These results indicate that although interference with zzso transformation using dominant negative zzso of zzso is feasible and effective in zzso using zzso zzso an additional block zzso that of zzso is necessary to kill zzso zzso These results also indicate that interference with zzso signaling is not sufficient for zzso of tumor formation of zzso cells in zzso
