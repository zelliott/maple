The expression of long-lasting synaptic plasticity requires synthesis of new zzso A critical locus for protein synthesis to support synaptic plasticity is the zzso Previous studies demonstrate that synaptic activity activates zzso protein zzso The mechanism by which synaptic activity stimulates protein synthesis in zzso is, however, poorly zzso This study is to determine the role of the zzso protein zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso protein zzso Using a green fluorescent protein reporter with zzso zzso and zzso regions, we show that zzso synthesis of the green fluorescent protein induced by zzso stimulation is abolished by zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso protein zzso zzso Our results suggest an important role of the zzso protein zzso signaling in zzso protein synthesis induced by zzso zzso zzso
