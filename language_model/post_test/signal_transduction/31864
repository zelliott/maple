zzso dysfunction has been associated with insulin resistance, obesity and zzso zzso and zzso are hallmarks of the zzso zzso We sought to determine the contributions of high insulin and saturated fatty acid exposure to zzso function and zzso in cultured zzso zzso zzso zzso were left zzso or exposed to chronic high insulin or high zzso zzso function was determined zzso oxygen consumption, zzso membrane potential, zzso content and zzso zzso oxygen zzso zzso We also determined the expression of several zzso zzso zzso insulin treatment of zzso caused insulin resistance with reduced zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment increased oxygen consumption but reduced zzso membrane potential and zzso zzso zzso cellular levels were maintained through an increased zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso 2) were not significantly altered in comparison with zzso cells, whereas expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso In contrast, saturated fatty acid exposure caused insulin resistance, reducing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso while increasing zzso of stress zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acids reduced oxygen consumption and zzso membrane potential while zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso chain zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression was not modified by zzso zzso cells also showed a reduced zzso zzso Taken together, our findings indicate that chronic insulin and fatty zzso insulin resistance zzso affect zzso zzso In both conditions, cells were able to maintain zzso levels despite the loss of membrane zzso however, different protein expression suggests different adaptation zzso
