The hypothesis that zzso zzso is an zzso zzso acid neurotransmitter in the zzso central nervous system is now gaining more support after the successful cloning of a number of genes coding for the signaling machinery required for this zzso at zzso in the zzso These include zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso output through zzso zzso Relatively little attention has been paid to the functional expression of these molecules required for zzso signaling in peripheral zzso and zzso zzso however, recent molecular biological analyses show a novel function for zzso as an zzso signal zzso in the zzso and/or zzso zzso Emerging evidence suggests that zzso could play a dual role in mechanisms underlying the maintenance of cellular zzso - as an zzso neurotransmitter in the central zzso system and an zzso signal zzso in peripheral zzso and/or zzso zzso In this review, the possible zzso signaling methods are outlined in specific peripheral zzso including bone, zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso
