zzso are an extensive group of natural products with diverse structures consisting of various numbers of five carbon zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We review here what is known about the zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

Recent primary literature is zzso 

zzso evidence points toward the presence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, similar to the one found in plants, which will produce zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso has been validated as a target in the related zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso in zzso has not been zzso zzso in the pathway, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has a central role in forming important zzso since zzso zzso zzso is a precursor of critical molecules with fundamental biological function such as zzso zzso zzso cholesterol, zzso proteins and zzso Strong evidence indicates that this zzso is a valid target for drugs since zzso which are specific zzso zzso inhibited zzso growth in zzso and in zzso Our hypothesis is that the zzso zzso constitutes a major novel target for the treatment of zzso
