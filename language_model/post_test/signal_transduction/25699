We tested the hypothesis of a role for the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso dysfunction induced by zzso zzso of protein zzso C zzso 

zzso zzso with insulin zzso zzso 1 zzso was induced in rats by zzso Total zzso and zzso activities, along with activity and expression level of the 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured in vascular tissue zzso by zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso was used to measure and correlate zzso interactions with zzso activity in the zzso zzso levels and zzso zzso of the inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were studied by Western zzso analysis and zzso zzso The zzso role of zzso alone in the process of zzso zzso zzso and actions was also zzso We found that in the type 1 diabetic zzso zzso selectively zzso the activity of the zzso zzso zzso studies confirmed a role for zzso and zzso in this zzso The functional implications of zzso zzso zzso were zzso of zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Our results uncover the role of zzso in the zzso dysfunction of zzso zzso may represent a novel molecular target for the treatment of zzso diabetic vascular zzso
