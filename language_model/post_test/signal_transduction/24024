zzso and zzso zzso stimulate zzso zzso in the collecting ducts by increasing the activity of the zzso zzso channel zzso Our laboratory has used zzso canine zzso cells to demonstrate that this effect is associated with an increase in zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Schmidt zzso and Thomas zzso zzso zzso 15: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso expression in a zzso manner, but had no effect on zzso or zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso inhibited zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso expression was also seen with zzso was blocked by zzso and was independent of protein zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso confirming that its effect was via an increase in zzso zzso The effect of zzso and zzso on zzso expression was abolished by zzso indicating an effect zzso via zzso zzso zzso with this zzso zzso increased zzso and zzso an upstream zzso of zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso These data confirm a model in which zzso activates zzso in zzso canine zzso cells to increase zzso gene zzso in a zzso zzso
