zzso expression is precisely regulated within the zzso axis through the complex interaction of zzso zzso zzso and both zzso and zzso zzso In the anterior zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acting both alone and in conjunction with zzso zzso hormone feedback also influences zzso expression via both direct and indirect zzso Evidence from zzso zzso suggests that zzso may be a target for zzso steroid zzso In the present study, we show that zzso markedly stimulates rat zzso zzso zzso activity in the zzso mature mouse zzso cell zzso zzso deletion analysis of reporter zzso identifies 2 regions of zzso responsiveness located at zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binds directly to DNA zzso in each of these regions in zzso zzso zzso of 3 zzso hormone response element zzso zzso the zzso to zzso region dramatically zzso zzso zzso promoter activity and prevents zzso binding at the zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso demonstrates that zzso zzso binds the zzso region on mouse zzso in zzso cells in both the presence and absence of zzso These data demonstrate that zzso stimulates zzso gene expression in the zzso zzso via direct binding of zzso to a specific cluster of zzso zzso hormone response elements in the zzso zzso gene zzso Thus, zzso regulation of zzso zzso expression may provide an additional layer of control over zzso expression within the zzso zzso
