Our previous work has shown that zzso plays a zzso function in two zzso cell death models: zzso zzso cells as well as zzso zzso mouse embryonic zzso zzso zzso This study aims to further explore the regulatory role of zzso in necrosis by examining the functional role of the zzso zzso zzso target of zzso zzso signaling zzso Our initial intriguing finding was that insulin is able to promote zzso cell death induced by zzso and zzso in zzso cells or by zzso in zzso zzso cells cultured in zzso zzso The zzso function of insulin was further supported by the observations that insulin is capable of abolishing the protective effect of zzso on zzso cell death induced by zzso in zzso zzso Next, we demonstrated that insulin acts on the zzso zzso to promote necrosis as the suppression of the above zzso by either chemical zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso is able to mitigate the zzso function of zzso Finally, we provided evidence that the zzso function of insulin is dependent on its zzso effect on zzso which serves as an important zzso function in zzso Taken together, here we provide compelling evidence to show that zzso of the zzso signaling zzso can promote zzso cell death via suppression of zzso at least in the necrosis models defined in our study in which zzso serves as a zzso zzso Data from this study not only further underscore the zzso function of zzso in zzso cell death, but also provide a novel insight into the intricate connections linking the zzso signaling zzso with cell death via zzso of zzso
