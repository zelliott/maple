zzso agents induce relaxation of zzso cells, in part through zzso zzso of large zzso zzso channels zzso zzso zzso in zzso patches, the response of zzso to zzso oxide, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is characterized by a zzso increase and then decrease zzso in open zzso Using the zzso method in conjunction with zzso zzso we investigated whether the zzso phase was the result of zzso by an zzso protein zzso In zzso patches, zzso acid zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso 1 zzso and 2A zzso at these zzso caused a significantly greater and sustained response of zzso to zzso Within 2 zzso the response of zzso to the combination of zzso acid and zzso was greater than the response to these agents added zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso acid for 20 zzso at a concentration (5 zzso specific for zzso increased the zzso open probability of zzso and completely inhibited rundown after zzso by zzso zzso with zzso A (10 zzso a more potent inhibitor of zzso did not affect zzso zzso In zzso patches, zzso plus zzso caused a sustained zzso of zzso that was inhibited by zzso zzso but not zzso It is concluded that either zzso or a tightly associated regulator of zzso is a common zzso for zzso zzso protein zzso which activates zzso and zzso which zzso zzso in human zzso zzso
