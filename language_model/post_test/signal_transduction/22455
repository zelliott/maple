zzso zzso controlled by zzso zzso have emerged as a particularly effective regulatory mechanism in a wide range of biological zzso Here we report the structures of both the zzso and trans zzso of a zzso switch in the zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso toggles zzso between two zzso an zzso zzso stabilized by the zzso association of two tandem zzso zzso in the zzso form, and an zzso activated zzso promoted by the trans zzso In addition to acting as a structural switch, the zzso zzso recruits zzso A, which zzso the zzso rate between the zzso thereby regulating the zzso of zzso zzso The data provide atomic insight into the mechanisms that zzso the functionality of this zzso switch and zzso its remarkable zzso The results also reveal new zzso binding surfaces, highlighting the binding versatility and expanding the zzso zzso repertoire of this important signaling zzso
