zzso zzso in zzso result in variable clinical presentations including intellectual disability zzso zzso and zzso zzso childhood onset schizophrenia and attention deficit zzso zzso zzso is a core member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that functions to rapidly degrade transcripts with premature termination zzso zzso zzso identified in thousands of human diseases, zzso were recently also found to be part of zzso genetic variation in human zzso Furthermore, many human transcripts have naturally occurring regulatory features compatible with zzso zzso strongly suggesting roles of zzso beyond zzso zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso and zzso in neural zzso We provide evidence that suggests zzso zzso zzso is regulated at multiple levels during development including regulation of expression and zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, complementary expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso the developing zzso zzso suggesting that alternative zzso and the related zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways are zzso zzso A loss of zzso in neural zzso cells zzso resulted in the expansion of cell numbers at the expense of their zzso In primary zzso zzso loss of zzso resulted in subtle zzso growth zzso Our data suggest that the cellular consequences of loss of zzso can be explained zzso by changes in expression of key zzso containing zzso which are commonly zzso also in patients with zzso zzso Our research identifies novel pathological mechanisms of zzso zzso and at least partly explains the clinical zzso of zzso zzso
