Our previous study revealed that zzso zzso is zzso in human prostate cancer, activates zzso zzso zzso and stimulates growth in prostate cancer zzso The purpose of this study is to further determine the potential role of zzso in prostate cancer development in genetically engineered mouse zzso We generated zzso transgenic mice by targeted zzso of a zzso active zzso in the zzso zzso We found that zzso of zzso led to development of mouse zzso zzso zzso and prostate cancer at the age of as early as 3 zzso The zzso signaling axis and zzso zzso signaling were elevated in the prostate zzso of zzso transgenic zzso In addition to prostate cancer, zzso transgenic mice developed significant zzso chronic zzso in the prostate zzso with notable zzso of zzso cells zzso zzso and plasma zzso which was associated with elevated zzso of prostate zzso DNA zzso and signaling zzso analysis revealed that the top diseases and disorders were inflammatory diseases and cancer of the prostate zzso in zzso transgenic zzso In zzso analysis showed that zzso of zzso in prostate cancer cells enhanced nuclear zzso zzso activity, implicating an underlying mechanism of innate inflammatory response induced by elevated zzso zzso These data showed that zzso zzso in the prostate zzso enhanced both the zzso signaling axis and zzso pathway, which potentially contributed to the development of zzso zzso and prostate zzso
