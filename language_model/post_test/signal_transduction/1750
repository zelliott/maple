Fluorescence resonance energy transfer zzso was used to reveal aspects of the mechanism of signal zzso by zzso growth factor receptors zzso The zzso of zzso growth factor zzso transforming growth zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso as measured by zzso show that zzso of zzso in zzso cells are zzso before growth factor zzso After binding growth factor and zzso these zzso zzso before releasing growth zzso Time courses of the zzso distances between zzso zzso zzso during signal zzso show a transient structural change in the zzso domain, which occurs simultaneously with the production of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso also show a slow increase in zzso of zzso zzso after growth factor zzso The structural change found in the zzso domain of zzso zzso is similar to that shown by others for EPO, zzso zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso and may therefore be a common property of the zzso of the zzso zzso
