It has been shown that cell zzso zzso which mediate zzso zzso have an ability to provide zzso signals in the zzso One of the representative zzso molecules on T zzso zzso zzso is comprised by several zzso sharing a common zzso zzso zzso which is defined by zzso zzso zzso We have demonstrated that zzso zzso function as a cell surface zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso such as collagen and zzso We also found that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso to promote proliferation of zzso T cell in a serum free culture system, and also induced an independent signal which would be distinct from the zzso signal zzso of zzso through the induction of an zzso zzso zzso Recent studies revealed that there is an zzso of zzso T cells, memory T cells as well as prominent increase of a variety of inflammatory zzso in the zzso fluid of patients with zzso arthritis zzso This suggests that zzso zzso may play an important role for the inflammatory mechanism in zzso zzso of signal zzso zzso by zzso molecules on zzso may be the possible effective way for controlling the pathological inflammatory process in zzso
