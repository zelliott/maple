zzso of muscle size is essential for proper development and zzso of adult zzso This regulation is zzso in large part by signal zzso pathways that promote the synthesis or breakdown of skeletal zzso zzso myostatin and zzso represent three such pathways that will be the focus of this zzso 

Recent reports solidify the requirement of the zzso zzso in the regulation of muscle zzso In response to IGF-1, zzso activates downstream zzso zzso and zzso to stimulate protein synthesis thereby increasing the zzso compartment in muscle zzso zzso was also identified as a novel zzso target, whose zzso and zzso by zzso may lead to an increase in cell zzso The mechanisms by which myostatin functions in muscle wasting was recently explored using zzso zzso of zzso zzso was found to repress zzso by zzso the synthesis and activity of zzso Paradoxically, myostatin expression is itself regulated by zzso binding to the myostatin zzso The zzso zzso factor also functions as a negative regulator of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso has been associated with muscle zzso but the mechanisms by which this regulation occurs remain for the most part zzso 

Recent cell culture and animal studies have provided insight on the mechanisms by which zzso myostatin, and zzso signaling pathways regulate muscle zzso Clinical intervention to boost zzso signaling or zzso myostatin and zzso activities may prove useful in diseases associated with chronic muscle zzso
