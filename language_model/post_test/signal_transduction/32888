In zzso zzso the fates of the six zzso zzso precursor cells zzso are specified by zzso zzso One zzso expresses the primary (1 degrees ) fate in response to a zzso zzso signal from the zzso The two zzso zzso the 1 degrees cell each express secondary (2 degrees ) fates in response to zzso lateral zzso The remaining three zzso each adopt the zzso zzso (3 degrees ) zzso Here I describe experiments examining how the selection of these zzso fates is affected by cell cycle arrest and cell zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso in two zzso decisions zzso by cell cycle zzso zzso must act prior to the end of zzso S phase to influence a 1 degrees versus 2 degrees cell fate choice, but must act after zzso S phase to influence a 3 degrees versus 2 degrees cell fate zzso zzso zzso decisions to cell cycle transitions may provide a mechanism for zzso or ordering choices of cell fates for zzso zzso
