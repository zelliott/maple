Visual zzso in zzso is a G zzso zzso zzso process that leads to zzso via zzso of the transient zzso potential zzso calcium zzso zzso D zzso is an zzso protein containing zzso zzso known to interact with zzso zzso studies indicate that zzso also binds to zzso protein zzso C and the zzso C, zzso A zzso By overlay zzso and zzso zzso we have defined the essential elements of the zzso association and identified three critical zzso in the zzso tail of zzso that are required for the zzso These zzso zzso constitute a novel binding motif distinct from the sequences recognized by the zzso domain in zzso To evaluate the functional significance of the zzso association in zzso we generated transgenic flies expressing a modified zzso zzso that lacks the zzso zzso The transgenic animals display a unique zzso zzso characterized by slow zzso and prolonged zzso Double zzso analysis suggests a possible zzso of zzso protein zzso C to zzso undermining the observed defective zzso and that delayed zzso may similarly result from zzso being unable to zzso in close proximity to the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso acts as a scaffold protein that zzso zzso interactions required for gating of the zzso channel in zzso zzso
