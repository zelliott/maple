Low delivery of many zzso drugs across the zzso barrier zzso is a limitation to the success of chemotherapy in zzso This is because of the high levels of zzso cassette zzso like zzso zzso which zzso drugs back to the zzso zzso is one of the few agents able to cross the zzso its effects on zzso cells zzso and zzso activity are not zzso We found that zzso at therapeutic zzso increased the transport of zzso zzso across human brain zzso zzso cells and decreased the expression of zzso By zzso the promoter of zzso zzso zzso lowers the zzso synthesis of zzso in zzso cells, zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and reduces the binding of zzso on the promoter of zzso zzso which encodes for zzso In zzso models of zzso cells and human zzso cells, zzso with zzso increases the delivery, zzso and zzso effects of zzso zzso and zzso three zzso of zzso that are usually poorly delivered across zzso Our work suggests that zzso increases the zzso zzso of drugs that are normally zzso by zzso back to the zzso These findings may pave the way to new zzso chemotherapy schemes in zzso
