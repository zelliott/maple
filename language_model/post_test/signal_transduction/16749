zzso zzso zzso family zzso zzso members zzso zzso and Yes are involved in various cellular events, often acting downstream of zzso zzso zzso such as vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso They are well known for their functional zzso any unique features remain largely zzso zzso zzso zzso we have selectively knocked down zzso zzso and Yes in human retinal zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with single zzso zzso showed that all three zzso were required for zzso zzso zzso zzso cell migration was significantly increased in zzso cells and decreased in zzso zzso Selective interference of zzso but not zzso or Yes, impaired zzso tube formation in zzso zzso in which all three zzso were targeted showed significant zzso of all three cellular zzso In addition, interference of zzso zzso and Yes did not affect the zzso effect of zzso in zzso as determined by DNA fragmentation zzso These results provide direct evidence that zzso zzso and Yes maintain distinct properties in the regulation of zzso zzso cell zzso
