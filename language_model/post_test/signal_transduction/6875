Besides the direct stimulation of zzso zzso zzso therapy in zzso anemia may also play a regulatory role in maintaining the zzso of zzso zzso It has been reported that EPO can stimulate zzso iron zzso However, the involvement of EPO in zzso folate zzso remains zzso The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of EPO on zzso transport of folate in zzso and to zzso the possible zzso involved in this zzso Transport zzso of zzso acid were performed in zzso zzso treated with zzso The effect of EPO on the expression of zzso involved in the folate zzso was zzso The possible involvement of three main EPO signaling zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso 2 zzso pathway, zzso signal regulated zzso zzso pathway, and zzso 3 zzso zzso pathway, in the zzso regulation was zzso The zzso flux zzso to zzso of zzso acid was enhanced by EPO treatment in a zzso manner, which was zzso with the significant zzso of reduced folate carrier zzso and zzso zzso coupled folate zzso zzso The zzso zzso to zzso of zzso acid was enhanced only by the high dose of EPO treatment, which was associated with the significant zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein 2 zzso The expression levels of all of these zzso were zzso by EPO treatment in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression in response to blocking EPO induced zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was changed to a different zzso As a conclusion, zzso folate zzso was enhanced by EPO treatment in zzso Our findings provided direct evidence to establish the correlation between EPO and folate zzso
