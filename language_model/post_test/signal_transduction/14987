zzso acid zzso sensitivity in zzso is one of the key factors in the seed dormancy of zzso Many zzso signaling genes have been isolated in zzso while only a few wheat zzso have been zzso In the present study, zzso wheat zzso to zzso zzso signaling genes were identified by in zzso analysis, and mapped them using a population of zzso wheat zzso zzso lines derived from a cross between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Four zzso wheat zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were located on zzso zzso and zzso was on the zzso region of zzso zzso In two consecutive year trials, one major zzso on the long arm of zzso two minor zzso on the long arm of zzso and one minor zzso on the long arm of zzso were zzso The zzso zzso explained zzso of the zzso variations and the other three zzso each accounted for approximately zzso of the zzso zzso zzso positions of the zzso of zzso and zzso matched the zzso zzso of the two zzso on zzso indicating that these two zzso are possible candidate genes for seed dormancy zzso Moreover, we have found two zzso result in zzso acid zzso in zzso between zzso and zzso zzso of the marker positions of zzso for seed dormancy of barley revealed that the largest zzso on zzso may be zzso to the barley seed dormancy zzso zzso whereas there seems no zzso zzso to the corresponding barley zzso zzso
