A fundamental strategy for zzso connections in the nervous system is the formation of neural zzso zzso formation has been most zzso studied in sensory systems where the central arrangement of zzso terminals reflects the distribution of sensory zzso cell bodies in the periphery or the sensory zzso This straightforward link between anatomy and function has facilitated tremendous progress in identifying cellular and molecular mechanisms that zzso map zzso Much less is known about the way in which networks that zzso locomotion are zzso We recently showed that in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso form a neural map, being arranged zzso in the zzso axis to represent the distribution of their target muscles in the zzso However, the way in which a zzso zzso map forms has not been resolved and whether zzso zzso are involved in establishing sets of connections has been relatively little zzso In this study, we show that zzso also form a zzso map in a second zzso zzso with respect to the zzso zzso and they achieve this by targeting their zzso to distinct zzso zzso We demonstrate that this map is zzso that is, it forms in the absence of zzso synaptic zzso or when zzso terminals have been zzso We show that the zzso zzso systems zzso and zzso are the main molecular mechanisms that zzso zzso targeting with respect to the zzso zzso and zzso are required zzso in zzso and the balance of their opposite actions determines the zzso target zzso A quantitative analysis shows that zzso zzso emerges as guidance cue receptors determine the distribution of the available zzso whose total length and branching frequency are specified by other cell intrinsic zzso Our results suggest that the formation of zzso zzso maps in response to zzso guidance cues may be a zzso strategy for zzso connections in motor zzso We further propose that sets of connections may be zzso at least to a degree, by global patterning systems that deliver zzso and zzso partner terminals to common zzso zzso
