Early detection of salt stress is vital for plant survival and zzso Still, the molecular processes controlling early salt stress perception and signaling are not fully zzso Here, we identified zzso zzso zzso a rice zzso zzso zzso factor zzso gene that shows a zzso induction upon salt and hydrogen zzso zzso zzso Loss of zzso zzso the zzso expression of genes zzso members of a zzso protein zzso zzso cascade and salt zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso genes are zzso responsive and demonstrate that zzso binds to the promoters of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso element zzso zzso and zinc finger zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso also directly zzso its own gene zzso In addition, zzso is a zzso target of zzso resulting in enhanced zzso activity of zzso toward its direct target zzso In agreement, plants deficient for zzso are more sensitive to salt stress compared with the wild type, while zzso zzso of zzso improves zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso the zzso oxygen zzso zzso cascade signal during the initial phase of salt stress and translates the zzso signal into an appropriate zzso response resulting in salt zzso
