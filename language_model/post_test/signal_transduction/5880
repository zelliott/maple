zzso affecting the zzso zzso domain of zzso 1 zzso are commonly found in zzso disease of bone zzso and impair zzso ability to bind zzso resulting in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso domain zzso are zzso and little is known about how they manifest their zzso We present the first characterization at the zzso zzso and functional level of a zzso domain zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequencing of zzso 7 of the zzso gene in an Italian zzso patient detected a zzso C to T zzso at position zzso resulting in an zzso to zzso substitution at zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the zzso region of zzso that contains zzso is important in zzso zzso affinity and that the zzso zzso exerts weak negative effects on zzso zzso zzso and binding analyses of longer zzso zzso containing zzso using zzso zzso and circular zzso showed this region of the protein to be largely zzso and confirmed its contribution to increased zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso with a cellular zzso indistinguishable from zzso Finally, effects of the zzso and zzso zzso on zzso signaling were assessed in zzso cells zzso with an zzso zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso zzso produced a level of zzso of zzso signaling greater than zzso and similar to that of zzso domain zzso indicating that zzso and zzso domain zzso may exert their effects through a common mechanism involving zzso zzso zzso
