zzso zzso possesses zzso and zzso mechanisms to survive NO during transmission and zzso zzso zzso possesses two zzso The first zzso is a zzso zzso zzso by gene zzso zzso zzso of which leads to hypersensitivity to zzso and zzso zzso of zzso is induced by zzso stress and zzso resistance to zzso presumably via a zzso zzso or zzso reaction that converts NO and oxygen to zzso zzso of zzso in response to NO is zzso via the zzso zzso factor zzso which regulates expression of a small zzso that includes zzso and zzso zzso the latter zzso the truncated zzso zzso The role of zzso is zzso it is not directly involved in NO zzso but is implicated in oxygen delivery or zzso Here, we describe attempts to define a function for zzso by examining the effects of a zzso zzso on the NO zzso and zzso gene expression during zzso and zzso zzso of zzso does not elicit major zzso zzso changes but relatively minor changes in genes involved in zzso zzso zzso transport and signal zzso We present and test the hypothesis that, by binding NO or zzso zzso zzso the response to NO under hypoxic conditions and limits zzso zzso perhaps because zzso function zzso NO zzso requires zzso zzso We report the zzso of zzso and specific binding to the zzso zzso zzso does not affect the high affinity of zzso for the zzso zzso
