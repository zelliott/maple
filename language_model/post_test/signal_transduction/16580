zzso is an unpleasant sensation experienced when zzso are zzso Thus, pain sensation in some way protects body from imminent threat or zzso zzso sensory nerves zzso to peripheral zzso initially respond to multiple forms of noxious or strong zzso such as heat, mechanical and chemical zzso In response to these zzso electrical signals for conducting the zzso neural signals through zzso are zzso These action zzso are then conveyed to specific areas in the spinal zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso fibers are zzso in many zzso For example, sensory nerves are classified as zzso zzso zzso and zzso according to their diameter and degree of zzso It is widely accepted that small sensory fibers tend to respond to vigorous or noxious stimuli and related to zzso Thus these fibers are specifically called zzso Most of zzso respond to noxious mechanical stimuli and zzso In addition, these sensory fibers also respond to chemical stimuli zzso et zzso zzso such as zzso Thus, zzso are considered zzso Recent advance in research on zzso channels in sensory zzso reveals molecular mechanisms underlying how various types of stimuli can be zzso to neural signals transmitted to the brain for pain zzso In particular, zzso studies on zzso channels characterize zzso properties of zzso channels in sensory zzso Furthermore, molecular biology leads to identification of genetic structures as well as molecular properties of zzso channels in sensory zzso These zzso channels are expressed in zzso terminals as well as in cell zzso When these channels are zzso inward currents or outward currents are generated, which will lead to zzso or zzso of the membrane causing increased or decreased zzso of sensory zzso In order to zzso the membrane of nerve zzso either inward currents should be generated or outward currents should be zzso So far, many zzso channels that are responsible for the zzso of sensory zzso are introduced zzso zzso of these channels in sensory zzso is evidently critical to the generation of zzso zzso The main channels responsible for inward membrane currents in zzso are zzso sodium and calcium channels, while outward current is carried mainly by zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso channels is also responsible for the zzso of sensory zzso Thus, zzso of zzso can be controlled by regulating expression or by modulating activity of these zzso
