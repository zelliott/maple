In zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso acts as the main provider of zzso to the cell using a zzso zzso zzso but also mediates rapid zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These two features led to recognition of zzso as a zzso Although the zzso role of zzso has been studied in depth, the mechanisms underlying the transport and sensor functions are zzso To obtain more insight into the zzso relationships of zzso we have rationally designed and zzso zzso zzso Using a three-dimensional model of zzso created on the basis of the zzso zzso zzso with multiple sequence zzso we selected zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso as zzso potentially involved in zzso or zzso binding respectively, during zzso We found that zzso zzso 7) and zzso zzso zzso are critical for the transport function, and might be part of the putative zzso pocket of zzso Moreover, we show that zzso zzso in the putative zzso site zzso are still capable of strongly zzso zzso zzso targets, despite their severely reduced transport zzso This indicates that zzso does not require transport and suggests that zzso of zzso acid zzso involved in binding of the zzso zzso may constitute a promising general approach to separate the transport and zzso functions in zzso
