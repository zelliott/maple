During zzso in zzso zzso the mother cell zzso migrate around the zzso in a zzso process called zzso zzso gene expression requires the successful completion of this key zzso zzso Here we show that zzso to zzso block the zzso of proteins zzso into the space between the mother cell and zzso zzso Our data support a model in which zzso defects cause the zzso clearance of these zzso zzso zzso we show that this zzso response is zzso once proper zzso is zzso zzso proteins again zzso In particular, we have found that the zzso zzso protein zzso fails to accumulate when zzso is impaired and, as a result, late mother cell gene expression under the control of zzso is zzso If zzso is zzso zzso accumulates and zzso zzso zzso Thus, this zzso zzso functions like a zzso checkpoint ensuring that mother cell gene expression does not zzso unless zzso proceeds zzso
