Both zzso and insulin are implicated in the zzso of diabetic zzso While it has been established for many years that the number of cell surface receptors impacts upon zzso and insulin action, little is known about the precise machinery and proteins driving zzso and zzso zzso Here, we investigate the role of zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a regulator of zzso trafficking, in zzso and insulin zzso We report that zzso expression of zzso increases zzso and zzso number and zzso zzso leading to amplification of their downstream zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso is required for zzso increases in zzso but not in zzso Furthermore, zzso is zzso in response to zzso and zzso We show that the zzso domain is required for zzso zzso in response to zzso but not to zzso zzso zzso zzso with both zzso and zzso and zzso with both in a manner independent of the zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation and acts zzso with zzso We conclude that zzso is a positive regulator of zzso and zzso signaling and that zzso expression of zzso protects both zzso and zzso from zzso
