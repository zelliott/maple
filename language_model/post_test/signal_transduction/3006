zzso variations in certain components of the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex have been associated with the development of stress-related affective disorders and individual zzso in therapeutic responses to zzso zzso that link zzso zzso and stress zzso are not well zzso Here, we show that the effects of zzso hormones on zzso behaviors are critically regulated via zzso zzso of zzso a key component of the zzso zzso zzso We provide pharmacological and genetic evidence indicating that the zzso zzso zzso zzso controls zzso zzso in the brain, and thereby zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso with a critical impact on zzso downstream signaling and zzso zzso deletion of zzso in zzso zzso the densest zzso cell group in the mouse brain, dramatically reduced acute zzso effects of the zzso hormone zzso in the zzso elevated plus zzso and social interaction zzso zzso depletion of zzso also blocked the expression of social avoidance in mice exposed to chronic social defeat and zzso prevented the zzso and zzso changes zzso in zzso zzso by this zzso model of traumatic zzso Together, these results identify zzso zzso as a potential new strategy for zzso and zzso interventions through regulation of the zzso zzso and focal prevention of zzso signaling in zzso zzso Our data thus uncover an alternate mechanism by which zzso zzso may regulate stress-related behaviors independently of their action on zzso
