zzso the biological processes of signaling pathways as a whole system requires an zzso software environment that has comprehensive zzso The environment should include tools for zzso design, zzso simulation and a knowledge base concerning signaling pathways as zzso In this paper we introduce a new zzso environment for the systematic analysis of signaling zzso 

This system includes environments for zzso design, zzso simulation and a knowledge base that combines biological and modeling information concerning signaling pathways that provides the basic understanding of the biological system, its structure and zzso The system is designed with a zzso zzso It contains a zzso designing environment and a simulation environment as upper layers with a zzso knowledge base as the underlying zzso 

The zzso zzso signal zzso zzso model was designed and tested using our zzso zzso It was also useful to define the structure of the knowledge zzso zzso analysis of this specific zzso was performed providing simulation zzso Then the model was extended showing promising initial zzso 

The proposed system offers a holistic view of pathways containing biological and modeling zzso It will help us to perform biological interpretation of the simulation results and thus contribute to a better understanding of the biological system for drug zzso
