zzso from the zzso zzso mouse are missing most of the zzso basic protein zzso zzso In zzso cultures, they produce membrane sheets with zzso assembled zzso and zzso zzso This suggests that an zzso gene product may have an important role in regulating the organization and stability of the zzso zzso zzso We now present evidence extending these zzso using cultured zzso that carry both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso which partially zzso their zzso zzso zzso that carry one dose of the zzso zzso zzso express zzso along major zzso zzso structures in processes and zzso zzso zzso that carry two doses of the zzso zzso contain two types of membrane sheet regions, zzso regions filled with zzso zzso zzso of zzso and regions with normal zzso of zzso zzso zzso data show that the distribution of zzso and associated zzso zzso zzso zzso is dependent upon how zzso is zzso zzso of zzso filaments occurs only around zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso along zzso structures also appears to be regulated by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso are observed, a likely result of the inability of dividing zzso to bundle zzso zzso In addition, the ability of zzso to mediate zzso signals that zzso zzso appears to be dependent upon zzso zzso zzso of the zzso signaling pathway, which results in the zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso occurs only in sheets containing zzso zzso The distribution of zzso however, does not affect the zzso protein signaling pathway, which results in growth of zzso structures and extensive zzso of the zzso zzso
