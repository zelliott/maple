zzso in vascular wall zzso are a typical complication in type 2 diabetes zzso due to an imbalance between cell proliferation and zzso In this context, we have previously shown that vascular smooth muscle cells zzso from diabetic patients were resistant to induced zzso zzso such as zzso seem to exert direct zzso effects on type 2 zzso Here, we aimed to study whether zzso was able to induce zzso in zzso from diabetic patients zzso and, if so, whether the transforming growth factor zzso zzso was zzso We isolated human internal zzso artery zzso from patients who had undergone zzso bypass zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso in human zzso from diabetic and zzso patients zzso analyzed by DNA fragmentation and by degradation of zzso in zzso medium (15 and 25 zzso This zzso effect was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso denoting that the zzso zzso was zzso zzso rapidly increased the zzso zzso levels and zzso induced zzso of zzso in zzso from zzso and zzso Thus, we demonstrated that zzso induced zzso in human zzso from zzso which are strongly resistant to the induced zzso This effect of zzso might contribute in the treatment of zzso of vascular zzso in type 2 diabetes zzso
