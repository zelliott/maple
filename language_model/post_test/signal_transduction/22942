The continuously growing mouse zzso is an excellent model to analyze the mechanisms for stem cell zzso We designed an organ culture method for the zzso end of the zzso and analyzed the zzso cell lineage by zzso and zzso zzso Our results indicate that stem cells reside in the cervical loop zzso consisting of a central core of zzso zzso cells surrounded by a layer of zzso zzso cells, and that they give rise to zzso progeny zzso into zzso forming zzso We identified slowly dividing cells among the zzso zzso zzso cells in specific locations near the zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso a zzso zzso modulating zzso zzso It is known from tissue zzso studies that in the mouse zzso the zzso regulates the continuous growth of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were restricted to the zzso underlying the zzso zzso cells and the zzso cells expressing their receptors zzso and zzso When zzso protein was applied with beads on the cultured cervical loop zzso it zzso cell proliferation as well as expression of zzso zzso We present a model in which zzso signaling from the zzso regulates the zzso zzso in dental zzso stem cells via stimulation of zzso fringe expression and, zzso has a central role in zzso the zzso and fate decision of stem zzso
