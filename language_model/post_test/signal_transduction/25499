zzso is an important target in multiple processes associated with tumor zzso In this study, virtual screening was employed for hit compound identification with chemical libraries using zzso zzso hit zzso for potent and selective candidate zzso zzso was performed through synthesis of diverse zzso zzso zzso zzso A novel compound zzso zzso was thus zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso was zzso at zzso and this was comparable to zzso a representative zzso zzso Moreover, zzso showed a positive correlation between zzso zzso and zzso zzso treatment in zzso cells strongly inhibited zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso reduced zzso protein levels, and finally induced zzso This suggests that compound zzso is a candidate inhibitor of zzso and its downstream zzso signaling zzso for zzso zzso In the zzso model, the zzso template of zzso the lead compound, occupied a zzso region such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the highly zzso hydrogen bond was created by zzso of the ring template, which binds to the zzso of zzso Moreover, zzso interactions were identified between zzso zzso and the zzso region formed by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Also, compound zzso more strongly inhibited zzso zzso in mouse embryonic stem cells than zzso Our study shows the successful application of virtual screening for lead discovery and we propose that the novel compound zzso can be an effective zzso inhibitor candidate for further zzso agent zzso
