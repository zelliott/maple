zzso loss, zzso zzso and vascular zzso are common zzso of zzso zzso injury in zzso zzso The present study was conducted to explore the ability of zzso to inhibit retinal zzso injury, and to investigate underlying mechanisms of the drug zzso 

Different zzso of zzso were zzso zzso injury was induced by zzso the zzso pressure for 60 zzso followed by zzso Cell bodies, zzso stained cells and zzso positive zzso cells in the zzso cell layer zzso were zzso and the number of zzso zzso was zzso The zzso of zzso cells was measured by the expression level of zzso Signaling pathways including zzso zzso zzso and the expression levels of zzso III and zzso were measured by western zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso in diets significantly inhibited zzso cell loss in zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso of retinal zzso zzso zzso cell death in the zzso zzso stained cell loss, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso This dose showed no effect on zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso administered 2 days after the injury also showed a zzso zzso 

zzso protects retinal zzso and zzso against zzso zzso The beneficial effects of zzso on zzso zzso may occur through its zzso effects on zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and on zzso of zzso zzso may therefore serve as a promising candidate for retinal zzso zzso
