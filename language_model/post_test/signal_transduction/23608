zzso zzso cancer zzso is one of the most lethal zzso zzso the majority of zzso is the zzso zzso and diagnosed at advanced zzso zzso is the zzso that has been found most frequently associated with zzso and progression of zzso zzso zzso is a zzso and zzso factor, and high plasma levels of zzso in advanced stage zzso correlate with poor zzso The objective of the present study was to identify zzso zzso genes and gene zzso in zzso 

We applied zzso tools on 7 publicly available data sets containing the gene expression profiles of zzso zzso zzso By zzso correlation analysis we identified, in zzso an zzso gene signature containing 40 genes mainly associated with zzso 33 of 40 genes were also significantly correlated in low zzso potential zzso zzso while 7 zzso named zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso only in advanced stage zzso Among the zzso signature zzso zzso zzso genes of the zzso family members and genes zzso for negative feedback regulators of growth factor signaling were zzso The results obtained by Gene Set zzso and zzso zzso zzso enabled the zzso respectively, of gene sets associated with zzso growth factor zzso for the zzso signature, and a biological network related to zzso and cardiovascular zzso for the zzso zzso In agreement with these results, selected genes from the identified signatures were validated in zzso by real time zzso in zzso zzso cell lines upon stimulation with zzso 

zzso zzso independently of their zzso zzso zzso expression together with that of genes associated to growth factor zzso arguing for the hypothesis that common zzso driven by zzso zzso characterize both zzso and zzso zzso Only zzso zzso appeared to be characterized by a scenario that involves genes which are so far associated with zzso and cardiovascular disease, thus suggesting that this zzso is implicated in the growth and/or spread of more aggressive zzso We have discovered novel activated signaling pathways that drive the expression of zzso and of zzso genes and are possibly involved in the zzso of zzso
