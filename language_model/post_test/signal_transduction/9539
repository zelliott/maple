According to the stem cell niche zzso hypothesis zzso for the zzso zzso system, spatial specificity of niche signals is zzso by zzso restricting zzso to zzso zzso junctions between individual niche and stem zzso However, such a zzso has never been observed directly, in part, because tools to detect active growth factor receptors with zzso resolution were not zzso Here we describe a novel zzso reporter that directly zzso bone zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and show that in the zzso zzso a zzso niche signal is transmitted zzso at zzso junctions between hub and zzso stem cells, resembling the proposed zzso zzso zzso zzso involves the zzso complex and the zzso zzso zzso both of which are also required for zzso trafficking towards zzso zzso zzso therefore, propose that local generation of the zzso signal is achieved through shared use of the zzso transport zzso
