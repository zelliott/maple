The adverse effects of zzso zzso are zzso primarily by tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso production by zzso zzso is regulated at the levels of both zzso and zzso It has previously been shown that several zzso protein zzso zzso are activated in response to zzso We set out to determine which zzso signaling pathways are activated in our system and which zzso pathways are required for zzso gene zzso or zzso zzso zzso We confirm zzso of the zzso family members zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso as well as zzso of the immediate upstream zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and 4 zzso and zzso We demonstrate that zzso also activates zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso which zzso the production of zzso including zzso significantly zzso zzso induction of zzso activity but not that of zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso also blocks the zzso but not zzso stimulation of zzso zzso A zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso blocked translation of zzso as determined by using a zzso zzso reporting zzso Finally, zzso of zzso zzso was able to overcome the zzso block of zzso zzso These data confirm that three zzso family members and their upstream zzso are zzso by zzso and demonstrate that zzso is required for zzso translation of zzso zzso A novel mechanism by which zzso zzso translation of zzso is also zzso
