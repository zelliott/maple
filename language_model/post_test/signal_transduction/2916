Currently, zzso chemical signaling in bacteria, known as zzso zzso is described for several species of zzso however, for many clinically important pathogens this significant sensory mechanism remains zzso Among such pathogens are the zzso zzso that include groups A and B zzso zzso zzso Evidence now points to a family of zzso factors, known as zzso can serve as receptors for zzso zzso Within the zzso of zzso zzso four zzso zzso can be identified, two of which zzso and zzso were shown to rely on short zzso peptides zzso to control zzso of their target zzso zzso were found to promote zzso development and could offset zzso effects caused by zzso Since zzso zzso are present in zzso throughout zzso species, their newfound ability to serve as zzso zzso offers a potential opportunity to manipulate bacterial behaviors by interfering with communication zzso
