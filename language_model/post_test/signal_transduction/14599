zzso hormones, zzso and zzso are zzso signaling molecules that play central roles in zzso signal transmissions between various cells, zzso and zzso These factors are primarily translated as inactive precursor proteins according to the genetic zzso These precursor proteins are then zzso by various zzso including signal zzso and processing zzso to produce matured zzso zzso During these zzso various fragmented peptides are also produced from the same precursor zzso Such fragmented peptides may have various unexpected biological activities that have not been identified yet because these peptides are considered to be produced and released along with mature factors at the same secretary zzso Recently, we found that various fragmented peptides of zzso proteins that are produced during the maturation zzso such as fragments of zzso c zzso activate zzso whose functions are distinct from their parent zzso These findings suggest the existence of many different functional peptides whose functions have not been identified zzso These unidentified peptides may play a variety of roles in various regulatory mechanisms, and therefore, they are expected to provide novel regulatory and signaling mechanisms, zzso zzso
