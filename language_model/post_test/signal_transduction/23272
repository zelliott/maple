zzso play key roles in development, zzso and zzso through regulation of specific target genes by the zzso acid zzso X zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso contribute to its zzso control by creating the appropriate zzso environment, but the precise composition of these nuclear zzso complexes remains to be zzso Using an zzso zzso genetic screen in mouse zzso cells, we identified the zzso zzso zzso zzso binding protein 2) as a zzso critically required for zzso acid zzso zzso zzso suppression by zzso interference zzso resistance to zzso differentiation in diverse zzso and human zzso zzso we find that zzso associates with zzso at zzso target gene promoters and is essential for their zzso in response to zzso We show that zzso is indispensable to create a zzso environment conducive for zzso zzso by recruiting the zzso zzso zzso Our data reveal an unexpected function of the zzso zzso as a zzso for zzso in zzso zzso
