We have shown previously that zzso extracts from actively dividing zzso cells are capable of inducing DNA synthesis in isolated zzso One of the factors involved in this activity, zzso appears to be a greater than 90 zzso zzso zzso zzso extracts prepared from zzso zzso express little to no zzso zzso However, zzso activity can be generated in these extracts by brief exposure to a zzso fraction of spontaneously proliferating, zzso human T zzso zzso zzso This suggests that zzso activity is present in the resting zzso in an inactive or precursor zzso This in zzso generation of zzso activity can be inhibited in a zzso manner by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of both zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and protein zzso C zzso However, more specific zzso of zzso protein zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso had little to no effect on the in zzso generation of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso from zzso cells depleted of zzso by long-term exposure (24 zzso to zzso zzso and calcium zzso were unable to induce zzso activity in resting peripheral blood zzso zzso The results of these studies suggest 1) zzso activity is present in resting cell zzso in an inactive or precursor zzso and 2) zzso activity can be induced in this resting zzso through a mechanism involving a zzso protein zzso possibly zzso The ability of alkaline zzso to zzso the activity of zzso zzso suggests the possibility that zzso itself is zzso
