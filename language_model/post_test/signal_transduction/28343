The molecular mechanisms governing zzso zzso and lineage zzso remain zzso zzso profiling is likely to provide insight into these processes but, as yet, has been confined to zzso molecular profiles of stem and zzso zzso We now provide a comprehensive, statistically zzso and zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso cells undergoing zzso in response to zzso zzso and zzso differentiation in response to zzso zzso zzso undergoing zzso zzso zzso displayed striking complexity, including expression of genes associated with different lineage programs, suggesting a highly responsive compartment poised to rapidly execute zzso or zzso initiated cell fate zzso A remarkable general feature of early differentiation was a resolution of complexity through the zzso of gene zzso Although zzso genes characteristic of mature cells were zzso late, zzso with zzso changes, zzso changes in gene expression were observed prior to this, identifying genes which may provide early zzso of zzso zzso Of particular interest were genes that displayed differential behavior irrespective of the lineage zzso many of which were rapidly zzso within 4 to 8 h after exposure to a differentiation zzso These are likely to include genes important in zzso the maintenance of zzso or the negative regulation of differentiation per zzso
