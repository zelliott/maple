zzso acid zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso We have previously reported that zzso can reduce the number and size of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso mouse zzso In this study, we evaluated the effect of zzso on human zzso zzso zzso Its efficacy and toxicity were compared with those of the zzso zzso drug zzso 

The zzso of cancer cell growth was estimated by zzso and zzso zzso Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by the flow zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso probe zzso were performed to determine the zzso zzso Further experiment was carried out in mice with zzso zzso zzso was orally administered for zzso The zzso zzso were removed for zzso zzso and western zzso zzso Blood was obtained for clinical chemical analysis, and samples of zzso were zzso for microscopic zzso 

zzso significantly inhibited human colon zzso growth, showing arrest of the cell cycle in zzso and induction of zzso zzso administration in mice effectively delayed the growth of zzso zzso without signs of zzso The activity of zzso was more potent than that of zzso Western zzso suggested that this activity may arise from its multiple effects on the zzso of zzso zzso suppression of inflammatory zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso signaling pathways in the zzso zzso 

zzso prevents the growth of zzso zzso through zzso of multiple signaling zzso 

zzso could be a promising agent in the prevention of zzso zzso
