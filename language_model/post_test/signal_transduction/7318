zzso growth factor signaling plays a significant role in the developing eye, regulating both patterning and zzso Members of the zzso of zzso zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso that are downstream targets of zzso zzso but whether they are required for eye development is zzso We show that in the developing zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed at the onset of retinal zzso We found that zzso is not required for eye zzso but is required for the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso factors, and is also required for retinal zzso zzso Using transgenic reporters we show that the zzso zzso zzso which is required for the initiation of zzso expression in the zzso zzso is responsive to both zzso signaling and zzso zzso Thus, we conclude that zzso acts downstream of zzso signaling to regulate the initiation of zzso in the zzso zzso
