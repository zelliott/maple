To analyze the basis of affinity zzso of zzso function, we studied cloned stable Chinese zzso zzso cell lines expressing zzso zzso of the beta 3 family zzso zzso beta 3 and alpha v beta zzso zzso and zzso recognition zzso of the zzso receptors resembled those of the native receptors found in zzso or zzso zzso The alpha zzso beta zzso cell line zzso bound zzso peptides and immobilized zzso zzso but not soluble zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso beta 3 zzso indicating that it was in the affinity state found on resting zzso Several zzso zzso failed to alter the affinity state of zzso zzso alpha zzso beta zzso The binding of soluble zzso and zzso however, was zzso in both zzso and A5 cells by addition of zzso zzso products zzso fragments of certain beta zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso fixed under conditions rendering them unresponsive to other zzso zzso of these zzso to zzso alpha zzso beta 3 also zzso specific zzso zzso These data demonstrate that certain zzso 3 zzso activate alpha zzso beta 3 by acting directly on the zzso possibly by altering its zzso Furthermore, they indicate that the zzso state of alpha zzso beta 3 is a property of the zzso itself rather than of the surrounding cell membrane zzso
