zzso an zzso zzso derived from a zzso precursor protein zzso 2 zzso was originally identified in zzso zzso involved in the regulation of food zzso It was recently reported that zzso is a novel depot specific zzso zzso produced by subcutaneous zzso with zzso and food zzso zzso Although a relation between zzso cancer mortality and obesity has been previously established, a role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso remains zzso The aim of the present study is to examine the effect of zzso on zzso zzso cells zzso We found that zzso zzso the proliferation and growth of zzso cells by zzso phase arrest, this zzso could be abolished by zzso zzso zzso zzso enhances zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso target of zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso block the effects of zzso zzso therefore reverses the zzso of zzso cell proliferation by zzso In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that zzso can inhibit the proliferation in human zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso cells through inducing zzso via zzso and zzso signaling zzso This study provides a novel regulatory signaling zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso growth and may contribute to zzso cancer prevention and therapy, especially in obese zzso
