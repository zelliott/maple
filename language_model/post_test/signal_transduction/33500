The third zzso loop is a crucial site of physical contact between some G zzso receptors zzso and their respective G zzso However, interactions not only occur among these proteins but also involve a number of additional protein binding zzso zzso of these zzso interactions may represent an important new avenue of zzso through which signaling of zzso can be zzso In the current issue of zzso zzso Liu et zzso zzso zzso report that zzso zzso receptors interact with the zzso binding protein zzso Using the third zzso loop of the zzso zzso zzso as bait in a bacterial zzso system, zzso was determined to be a potential binding zzso They used pull-down zzso both in zzso and in zzso to confirm the interaction and define its zzso Neither the zzso nor the zzso zzso expresses the motif zzso the interaction, and peptides based on the third zzso loop of the zzso zzso did not pull down zzso Some groups might stop there, but Liu and colleagues moved on to demonstrate zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso were then used to show that zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso increases the ability of zzso receptors to activate zzso and to inhibit zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso may serve as an important zzso of zzso zzso signaling efficacy in the zzso These interactions contribute to zzso zzso and zzso differences in zzso zzso zzso
