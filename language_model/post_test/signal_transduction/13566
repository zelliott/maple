zzso sleep zzso is characterized by intermittent zzso zzso and associated with cardiovascular diseases, such as stroke and heart zzso These cardiovascular diseases have a relation to zzso marked by the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells zzso In this study, we investigated the influence of zzso on cultured rat zzso smooth muscle cell zzso The proliferation of zzso was significantly increased by zzso without changing the level of zzso In order to see what zzso zzso zzso we investigated the influence of zzso zzso zzso and sustained zzso zzso cell zzso media on zzso zzso zzso cell zzso medium significantly increased zzso proliferation compared with zzso cell zzso zzso but zzso cell zzso medium did zzso We next investigated the zzso growth factor zzso family as zzso growth zzso Among the zzso family, we found significant increases in zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells and mature zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso We next investigated the changes in zzso family receptors that are receptors for zzso zzso and zzso and found that zzso zzso zzso and protein expressions were increased by zzso but not by zzso zzso of zzso zzso at zzso that mediates zzso signaling for several zzso effects including cell proliferation was increased by zzso but not by zzso In addition, inhibitor for zzso zzso suppressed zzso cell zzso These results provide the first demonstration that zzso zzso zzso zzso and suggest that zzso family, such as zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso could be involved in the zzso zzso zzso
