The zzso zzso cell line zzso has been extensively used to study the zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso In these cells zzso is known to induce zzso gene expression but the signal zzso zzso has yet to be zzso zzso zzso expression is associated with stimulation of zzso exchange and zzso of protein zzso C, but these events are not sufficient to trigger zzso zzso Thus, other signals must be zzso Because zzso is a well recognized second messenger, we sought to determine whether zzso is the signal that triggers zzso zzso zzso To that end we first measured zzso levels of zzso following zzso zzso The results showed that exposure of zzso cells to zzso alpha induced a rapid and a transient increase in zzso it peaked at 5 zzso and was back to zzso level at 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso also increased zzso with similar zzso to zzso alpha but the increased levels were far zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso proved not be a sufficient signal because an increase in zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso or zzso failed to increase surface zzso or to increase zzso zzso zzso Although when used alone they had no effect, zzso and zzso were found to amplify the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso activated zzso B zzso zzso But this effect could not be simulated by zzso or zzso This observation provides further evidence that zzso is not a trigger of zzso zzso Although zzso or zzso when used alone had no effect, they did consistently modify the level of zzso B activity induced by zzso zzso zzso of this study show that zzso is not sufficient to induce zzso B or zzso zzso zzso the role of zzso may not be trigger but rather to zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the response could occur at one or a number of points along the signal zzso Such a regulatory role is supported by the observation that zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso B zzso
