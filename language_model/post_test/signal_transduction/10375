zzso coli zzso are type I membrane receptors that have a zzso sensing domain, a zzso signaling domain, and two zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is different in that both its sensing and signaling regions are proposed to be zzso This zzso has a zzso zzso segment that is thought to form a membrane zzso Most zzso prediction programs predict a single zzso segment, but such a zzso is inconsistent with recent studies indicating that there is direct communication between the membrane zzso zzso and zzso zzso We studied the overall zzso and membrane boundaries of the zzso membrane anchor by a zzso zzso The proximity of 48 zzso zzso replacements in zzso zzso was determined in zzso by measuring the rate and extent of zzso zzso after adding the zzso copper zzso both at room temperature and to decrease lateral diffusion in the zzso at 4 degrees zzso zzso boundaries were identified in membrane zzso using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To map zzso zzso accessible zzso were blocked in whole cells by zzso with zzso 2' zzso acid before the cells were zzso in the presence of zzso The data were consistent with two zzso zzso separated by a short zzso zzso Although the membrane anchor contains a central zzso zzso that reaches the zzso its position was zzso to several zzso acid and zzso zzso
