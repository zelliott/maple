Loss of the zzso fragile X protein zzso X mental zzso protein zzso results in a spectrum of cognitive deficits, the fragile X syndrome zzso while aging individuals with decreased protein levels present with a subset of these symptoms and zzso The broad range of behavioral deficits likely reflects the ubiquitous distribution and multiple functions of the zzso zzso loss is expected to affect multiple zzso proteins and zzso signaling zzso whose identity and interactions are essential in understanding and zzso zzso zzso We used zzso zzso and targeted zzso zzso zzso in zzso to uncover molecular pathways affected by zzso zzso We present evidence that zzso loss results in excess zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, attributable at least in part to zzso of the protein in affected zzso Using high-resolution zzso zzso and zzso zzso we present evidence that excess zzso upon zzso zzso is linked to the zzso zzso reported in patients and models, and zzso zzso zzso learning and memory zzso Furthermore, our data indicate positive zzso regulation of the fly zzso gene by zzso via protein zzso A, likely through the zzso factor zzso Because the human zzso gene also contains zzso binding sites, the interaction of zzso excess and zzso signaling defects we present suggests novel zzso pharmaceutical approaches to symptom zzso upon zzso zzso
