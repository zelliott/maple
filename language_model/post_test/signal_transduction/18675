zzso oxygen species zzso are a diverse family of molecules generated by all zzso zzso may serve as important zzso molecules in the cerebral zzso Indeed, in contrast to systemic zzso major products of zzso zzso including hydrogen zzso are powerful cerebral zzso raising the possibility that zzso represent important molecules for increasing local cerebral blood zzso Two major zzso of the overall effects of zzso on cerebrovascular tone are the rate of production of the parent zzso zzso and its rate of metabolism by zzso zzso Although the major zzso source of zzso in cerebral arteries has not been zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced form zzso along with zzso and zzso are probably the primary zzso In cerebral zzso zzso of zzso elicits both an increase in zzso production and zzso The identity of the zzso zzso responsible for the zzso effects may be hydrogen zzso generated from the zzso of zzso zzso activity and function appears to be profoundly greater in cerebral versus systemic zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso partly contribute to zzso zzso and may offset zzso zzso zzso of cerebral zzso consistent with the hypothesis that zzso zzso may play a zzso role in the control of cerebrovascular zzso
