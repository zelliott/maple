zzso zzso tissue zzso wraps blood vessels and zzso zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso target of zzso complex 2 zzso has been shown to control inflammation and is expressed in zzso zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso deletion of zzso and thereby zzso of zzso in zzso may zzso vascular function by increasing inflammation in zzso 

zzso an essential zzso zzso was deleted specifically in mouse zzso tissue zzso zzso of zzso downstream target zzso at zzso zzso was reduced in zzso from zzso mice but unaffected in zzso zzso zzso zzso functional analysis of zzso zzso revealed increased zzso and impaired zzso in rings with zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso knockout increased gene expression and protein release of zzso zzso inflammatory zzso and tumor necrosis zzso in zzso as shown by quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction and zzso analysis for the zzso in the zzso media, zzso Moreover, gene and protein expression of zzso zzso oxide zzso was zzso without affecting zzso zzso in zzso from zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso vascular zzso in zzso rings from zzso mice with no effect in zzso zzso Interestingly, in zzso and zzso zzso zzso high-fat diet feeding induced zzso of zzso gene zzso 

Here, we identify zzso as a critical regulator of zzso protection of normal vascular zzso zzso of zzso activity in zzso tissue may be a potential therapeutic approach for zzso vascular zzso
