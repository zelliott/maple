zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso that causes the disease zzso It resides within host cells in a zzso zzso distinct from the host cell zzso zzso zzso zzso was used as a model to investigate how zzso zzso zzso alter their gene expression in response to the host immune response during infection compared to growth in host cells in zzso While bacterial pathogens clearly alter gene expression to adapt to the host environment during infection, the degree to which the external environment affects gene expression by zzso zzso pathogens zzso within host cells is less zzso The global zzso of zzso zzso was analyzed in zzso in the presence and absence of the zzso host innate immune zzso The zzso in zzso zzso was also compared to its zzso in zzso in zzso zzso Our results indicate that the zzso zzso is significantly altered during in zzso infection in the presence, but not absence, of zzso immunity compared with zzso infected in zzso Many of the zzso genes increased in zzso appear to be common to an early general stress response by the zzso surprisingly putative zzso stage specific genes were also disproportionately increased during zzso
