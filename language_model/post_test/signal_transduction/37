zzso requires zzso hormone, yet the mechanisms and targets of zzso hormone action during embryonic stages remain zzso We previously showed that the zzso hormone zzso zzso rapidly increases zzso sodium current in zzso zzso cells zzso a primary sensory zzso zzso present during embryonic zzso Here, we determined essential components of the rapid T4 signaling zzso by identifying the involved zzso zzso the targeted sodium channel zzso and the spatial and zzso expression pattern of the zzso zzso zzso T4 zzso 

We first tested which signaling pathways mediate zzso rapid zzso of sodium current zzso by zzso specific pathways associated with zzso zzso hormone zzso We found that pharmacological blockade of protein zzso 1 and the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso decreased and increased zzso sodium current zzso respectively, and blockade of either zzso rapid responses to acute T4 zzso We next tested for the zzso channel target of rapid T4 signaling via zzso zzso of specific sodium channel zzso We found that selective zzso of the sodium channel zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso acute zzso We also determined the spatial and zzso distribution of a zzso T4 zzso zzso zzso At 24 hours post zzso zzso zzso zzso showed no specific zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso However, by 48 zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso in zzso and primary zzso zzso with this zzso zzso T4 modulated RB zzso at 48 but not 24 zzso We next tested whether T4 rapidly modulated zzso of zzso primary zzso which express the zzso zzso and target zzso of rapid T4 zzso In response to zzso zzso primary zzso rapidly increased sodium current peak zzso zzso 

zzso zzso regulation of sodium current occurs in different zzso zzso requires the activity of specific zzso zzso and requires both zzso zzso and zzso Our in zzso analyses identify molecules required for zzso rapid regulation of zzso sodium zzso
