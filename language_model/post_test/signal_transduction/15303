zzso zzso zzso possesses an exceptional capacity of adaptation to zzso zzso Recently, using a transient global zzso model in the adult zzso we identified a zzso zzso cascade in the zzso zzso involving zzso protein zzso IV zzso zzso zzso response element zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso a major regulator of zzso We have shown that zzso injections of zzso and zzso are sufficient to cause substantial zzso damages and zzso deaths in late periods zzso zzso after zzso zzso we provide zzso and zzso evidence that zzso impairment of the protective zzso zzso zzso an apparent duality of response in the zzso zzso The experimental protocol is performed as zzso zzso rats are zzso and zzso arteries are zzso by zzso zzso on the following day, transient global zzso is produced by zzso of carotid arteries for 25 zzso zzso finally, rats are infused with the zzso agents into the left cerebral zzso and then zzso at different time points after zzso for zzso and zzso zzso After infusion with zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso occur at 6 h after zzso without presence of any zzso zzso and cellular zzso In contrast, infusion of zzso or zzso surprisingly results in a remarkable stimulation of zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso activities at zzso h zzso This is accompanied by the disappearance of zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest that: zzso zzso of a zzso cascade at early periods zzso may be capable of causing a short transient protective effect in the zzso zzso zzso zzso might be implicated in zzso of activity of molecules such as zzso zzso and zzso at late periods zzso thereby promoting injuries and cell deaths in the zzso cell zzso
