zzso activates the release of membrane zzso second zzso such as free zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the present study, we analyze the effect of cortical impact injury of zzso severity applied to the rat frontal right zzso zzso zzso on the zzso of free fatty acids zzso and zzso in eight brain areas 30 zzso and 24 hours after the zzso At these times, zzso of zzso and zzso occurred mainly in the damaged zzso The zzso was the only other brain area that displayed a significant zzso of zzso by day one zzso By 30 zzso zzso of free AA in the zzso displayed the greatest relative increase zzso over sham zzso followed by free zzso acid zzso zzso zzso while both zzso and zzso were increased zzso over sham zzso At day one, free zzso and zzso showed the greatest increase zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso elicits the zzso of zzso enriched in excitable zzso targeting early on zzso (by 30 zzso zzso zzso and followed 24 hours later by preferential zzso of zzso These zzso zzso changes may contribute to the initiation and maturation of zzso and fiber track zzso observed following cortical impact zzso
