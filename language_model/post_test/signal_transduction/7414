zzso pulmonary zzso is the most devastating zzso diffuse zzso lung disease which remains zzso to pharmacological zzso zzso novel treatments are urgently zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that mediates critical zzso pathways in pathology and zzso zzso lung zzso has been shown to be diminished in zzso zzso The purpose of this study is to investigate whether pharmacological zzso zzso is a potential therapeutic option to combat pulmonary zzso 

Pulmonary zzso was induced by zzso zzso of zzso into zzso mice with or without a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso that blocks the zzso zzso Fibrosis was assessed by zzso analysis, zzso quantitative zzso and western zzso for zzso markers zzso 

We first show that zzso effectively zzso zzso zzso responses in zzso Next, we show that once daily treatment with zzso zzso or 10 zzso zzso reduced the severity and extent of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso These findings correlated with significant decreases in zzso collagen and zzso smooth muscle zzso expression at the zzso and protein level in treated zzso To further establish the potential clinical zzso of zzso zzso we zzso zzso in mice treated with zzso 1 or 7 days after zzso zzso Interestingly, when administered 7 days after the induction of fibrosis, zzso was as effective in limiting the development of pulmonary zzso as when administration was started before zzso zzso 

Overall, targeting zzso may be a promising treatment for pulmonary zzso
