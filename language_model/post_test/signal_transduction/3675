zzso of zzso colony stimulating factor zzso to its zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso domain of the zzso resulting in zzso of zzso zzso zzso used as zzso sites for zzso signaling proteins that relay growth and development zzso To determine whether a distinct signaling zzso is responsible for the zzso differentiation signal versus the growth zzso we sought new molecules involved in zzso signaling by performing a zzso screen in zzso using the zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso containing zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were frequently isolated and shown to interact with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which is also the binding site of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso At zzso with previous reports, zzso induced rapid and transient zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells and this zzso required the activity of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso strongly decreased this zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso decreased both binding and zzso of zzso but not that of zzso Since the zzso zzso zzso abrogates the differentiation signal when expressed in zzso cells and since this zzso could be reproduced by a specific inhibitor of zzso we propose that a balance between the activities of zzso and zzso in response to zzso is required for cell zzso
