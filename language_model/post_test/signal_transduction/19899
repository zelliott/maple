zzso is frequently found in oral zzso zzso zzso zzso but the pathways leading to zzso are zzso 

This study focused on analysis of zzso expression which is essential for zzso zzso of zzso 2, 3, 8, 9, and 12 was studied in 70 biopsy samples from zzso zzso to identify which cascade pathway, zzso or zzso is of importance in zzso in zzso 

zzso expression was present in every sample, and zzso of the zzso cells were positive in zzso of the zzso More than zzso of the zzso cells expressed zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso expression was shown totally in zzso of the zzso No zzso expression was found in 57% of the samples, and zzso expression was absent in the entire zzso zzso 

The high frequency of intrinsic zzso zzso markers zzso 2 and 12 indicates zzso stress in zzso zzso zzso zzso
