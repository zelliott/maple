zzso stress in the zzso zzso zzso zzso many degenerative and zzso diseases involving zzso of vital zzso A well-established example is zzso dominant zzso zzso zzso an age-related retinal degenerative disease caused by zzso zzso Similar zzso zzso of zzso zzso also impose stress on the zzso and cause age-related retinal zzso in that zzso zzso zzso responses to zzso stress, referred to as the unfolded protein response zzso induce various zzso quality control genes that can suppress such retinal zzso However, how cells activate cell death programs after chronic zzso stress remains poorly zzso Here, we report the identification of a zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso required for zzso zzso zzso of these genes specifically suppressed zzso without affecting other protective branches of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and together, they activate the zzso zzso for zzso Moreover, disruption of this zzso can delay the course of age-related retinal zzso in a zzso model of zzso These findings establish a previously zzso branch of zzso response zzso involved in degenerative zzso
