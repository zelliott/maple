The total mass of zzso of zzso is reduced in individuals with type 2 diabetes, possibly contributing to the zzso of this zzso Although the regulation of zzso mass is complex, recent studies have suggested the importance of a signaling zzso that includes the insulin or zzso growth zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso 1 zzso is a zzso zzso that mediates signaling downstream of zzso zzso Here we show that mice that lack zzso specifically in pancreatic beta cells zzso zzso develop progressive zzso as a result of a loss of zzso zzso The mice show reductions in zzso density as well as in the number and size of zzso zzso of the gene for the zzso factor zzso resulted in a marked increase in the number, but not the size, of cells and resulted in the restoration of zzso zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is important in maintenance of pancreatic cell mass and zzso zzso
