We have demonstrated previously that zzso of zzso receptors causes increased zzso zzso to zzso zzso receptors and increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results led to the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso thereby shifting them to a higher affinity zzso The present study investigated three questions regarding this zzso signaling zzso zzso does zzso of zzso receptors cause a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso does zzso signaling require that participating receptors couple to the same family of zzso zzso and zzso does zzso signaling occur in cell types other than zzso It was found that zzso zzso zzso caused a shift in the zzso zzso zzso binding data from a zzso model to a zzso model zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso 10 zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It also was found that zzso of zzso zzso receptors also caused a shift of zzso zzso binding data from a zzso model zzso zzso zzso zzso to a zzso model zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso manifestation of this zzso signaling between zzso and zzso zzso receptors was a synergistic zzso of human zzso zzso Finally, the present results established that zzso of zzso cell zzso receptors shifts zzso zzso zzso affinity from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that cells other than zzso have the capability to signal between zzso zzso
