Plants have evolved highly complex sensory mechanisms to monitor their surroundings and adapt their growth and development to the prevailing environmental zzso The integration of information from multiple environmental cues enables the zzso of development with zzso seasonal conditions and, ultimately, determines plant zzso Light signals, perceived via the zzso zzso and zzso zzso families, are especially important environmental zzso zzso of function among zzso and their interaction with blue light zzso enhance sensitivity to light signals, zzso the accurate detection of, and response to, environmental zzso In this review, current understanding of zzso zzso functions will be zzso in particular, the interactions among the zzso and the integration of light signals with directional and temperature sensing zzso
