zzso zzso the zzso agent of plague is a highly invasive zzso being able to invade zzso zzso zzso Its zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in zzso of bacteria by zzso zzso The aim of this study was to zzso the zzso zzso processes and zzso zzso events associated with zzso zzso caused a 50% decrease of zzso at zzso concentration pointing to the involvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso a potent inhibitor of protein zzso zzso and with zzso a specific zzso zzso inhibitor decreased the number of zzso bacteria about zzso and zzso respectively, indicating the involvement of zzso including zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso D, an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of small zzso zzso and zzso a zzso inhibitor also involved in zzso zzso strongly reduced the number of zzso bacteria revealing the role of zzso events in the invasion zzso All the tested zzso changed the invasion but not the zzso pattern of the zzso producing zzso zzso zzso zzso could also be zzso also with zzso zzso
