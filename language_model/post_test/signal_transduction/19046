zzso is a natural zzso analogue that elicits zzso effects leading ultimately to cell's death by a largely zzso zzso Previous works have shown that this drug zzso a rapid zzso of the zzso the final zzso protein zzso zzso of the zzso cell integrity zzso In this work, we showed that this zzso did not zzso the main cell wall sensors zzso and zzso but was abolished upon deletion of zzso zzso a zzso exchange factor of zzso We also showed that the zzso zzso of zzso was accompanied by a negligible zzso of its main downstream target, the zzso zzso zzso This result was consolidated by the finding that the loss of zzso had no consequence on the increased resistance of zzso cells to zzso indicating that the cell wall modification caused by this drug is largely independent of zzso zzso of zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso zzso by caffeine resembled that of zzso a potent inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso with this analysis, we found that the zzso zzso of zzso was lost in a zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso zzso was, like zzso defective in components of the zzso zzso highly sensitive to zzso However, the hypersensitivity of a zzso zzso zzso to this drug was rescued neither by zzso nor by zzso which was found to zzso caffeine effects specially on zzso in the zzso zzso Altogether, these data indicated that zzso zzso is a target of caffeine, whose zzso zzso activates the zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso are largely dependent on zzso of zzso cellular zzso Finally, we found that caffeine zzso in a zzso manner, a transient drop in zzso levels of zzso that was followed by change in expression of genes implicated in zzso zzso This result may pose zzso as a zzso in the interplay between zzso and the zzso zzso
