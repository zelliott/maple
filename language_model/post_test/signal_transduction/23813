Head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso is an aggressive cancer with a zzso survival rate of zzso With the use of a custom zzso system coupled with zzso parallel sequencing, we have now investigated transforming mechanisms for this zzso The zzso of zzso genes zzso were zzso from a human zzso cell line zzso zzso and subjected to zzso zzso and the clinical relevance of zzso zzso thus identified was evaluated with zzso reporter zzso A zzso zzso zzso with a novel zzso point zzso that results in the substitution of zzso for zzso at zzso 325 was identified, and the zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to activate nuclear zzso zzso signaling to an extent far greater than that achieved with the zzso zzso Moreover, forced expression of zzso zzso suppressed the growth of zzso zzso cells without notable effects on zzso We further found that most zzso zzso previously detected in various zzso tumors also increase the ability of the protein to activate zzso zzso Such zzso zzso was shown to be zzso through the zzso region of the second death zzso domain of zzso Although zzso zzso associated with cancer have been thought to promote zzso as a result of zzso of the zzso function of the zzso our results now show that most such zzso including the novel zzso identified here, separately zzso a gain of function with regard to zzso of zzso zzso indicating another role of zzso in the transformation of human zzso including zzso
