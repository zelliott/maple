zzso protein zzso zzso zzso controlled by protein zzso zzso and zzso is a critical element in signal zzso pathways regulating a wide variety of biological zzso including cell growth, zzso and zzso We have previously reported that zzso belonging to the zzso family zzso zzso zzso becomes zzso at zzso zzso zzso and thereby activated during zzso differentiation of human zzso zzso cells zzso zzso In this study, to zzso the role of zzso zzso zzso we examined whether zzso zzso and zzso zzso both potent and selective zzso zzso affected the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso paradoxically increased the zzso activity of zzso zzso together with zzso of zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso and functional zzso as determined by induction of zzso zzso such as zzso growth factor binding zzso and zzso zzso also advanced zzso along with zzso of the active form of zzso whose zzso was zzso In contrast to zzso and zzso zzso A, a zzso zzso inhibitor with less specificity for zzso showed little enhancing effect on the expression of both zzso and active zzso These results suggest that zzso including zzso may play a significant role in zzso cell zzso providing a clue for a possible therapeutic strategy to zzso zzso function by targeting signaling zzso involving zzso
