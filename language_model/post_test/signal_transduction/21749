zzso disorders affecting up to zzso of the human population represent pathological changes to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso evidence in the literature suggests complex zzso and/or zzso zzso accompanying zzso zzso zzso treatment with zzso doses of zzso zzso zzso psychotic zzso that can be used as an animal model in the study of this zzso zzso A belongs to a specific group of zzso zzso zzso zzso We focused on the analysis of molecular events occurring in the brain of zzso rats after administration of zzso A with zzso zzso The complex experimental approach allowed us to correlate the use of low molecular weight substances with a zzso fingerprint in the prefrontal zzso We found 63 genes to be zzso and 22 genes zzso with zzso zzso and zzso showing the highest degree of zzso Our results suggest the possibility that zzso A belongs to the group of zzso compounds, inducing massive changes in neurotransmitter zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso and second zzso systems, and leading to the plastic reorganization of brain zzso zzso pathways and zzso
