Recently, it has been demonstrated that zzso and zzso peptides enhances insulin sensitivity and zzso metabolism in zzso Here, we show that a synthetic zzso zzso zzso derived from repetitive zzso acid sequence of zzso improves zzso transport and exerts beneficial zzso zzso effects in zzso zzso zzso increases both zzso and zzso zzso zzso through enhancement of zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment also led to a significant reduction in the expression of zzso genes including zzso regulatory element binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and fatty acid zzso zzso in mature zzso zzso which was zzso with decreased zzso zzso by zzso zzso Additionally, in cells undergoing zzso zzso levels of zzso genes including zzso and zzso binding protein zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso were suppressed by zzso Furthermore, zzso increased zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso The latter effect was supported with evidence showing increased zzso zzso in zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso Together, our data suggest that zzso has multiple beneficial effects on zzso and zzso zzso and would control zzso without the adverse effect of weight zzso
