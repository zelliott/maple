Cell zzso are structurally heterogeneous, composed of discrete zzso with unique physical and biological zzso zzso zzso can form through a number of mechanisms involving zzso and zzso zzso One type of membrane domain is the zzso membrane zzso How zzso form remains a current topic in membrane zzso We review here evidence of structuring of zzso by the cortical zzso zzso This includes evidence that the zzso zzso associates with zzso and that many of the structural and functional properties of zzso require an intact zzso zzso We discuss the mechanisms of the zzso raft organization, and the properties of the zzso zzso in regulating zzso signaling zzso We end with a discussion of membrane zzso and the zzso zzso in T cell zzso which function zzso to initiate the zzso immune zzso
