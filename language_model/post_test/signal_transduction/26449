In zzso zzso zzso zzso that are activated by the zzso zzso signaling zzso all contain two types of zzso factor binding sites: those for the zzso zzso factor zzso of zzso zzso and those for one or more zzso or cell zzso factors called zzso zzso The use of different zzso plus local zzso motif combinations, or codes, is critical to ensure that only the correct subset of the broadly zzso zzso zzso target genes are activated in each zzso zzso However, much less is known about the role of zzso zzso number, order, zzso and orientation of its component zzso factor binding zzso determining the zzso zzso Here we investigate the relationship between architecture and function for two zzso enhancers with zzso distinct activities, each of which includes five zzso zzso zzso We find that the first, which is active specifically in the zzso cells of external sensory zzso is largely resistant to zzso of its zzso By contrast, the second zzso active in the zzso cells of the zzso clusters from which neural precursors zzso is sensitive to even simple zzso of its zzso factor binding sites, responding with both loss of normal specificity and striking zzso zzso Thus, diverse cryptic zzso can be inherent in an zzso particular combination of zzso factor binding zzso We propose that for certain types of zzso architecture plays an essential role in determining zzso not only by permitting zzso synergies necessary to generate the desired activity, but also by preventing other zzso synergies that would otherwise lead to unwanted zzso
