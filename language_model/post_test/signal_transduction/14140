zzso signaling via the zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso the zzso acts to shape many regions of the developing zzso One intriguing consequence of zzso signaling is the control of mixing between discrete cell populations in the developing zzso contributing to the formation of zzso zzso Since the zzso is also a zzso structure comprised of discrete zzso might zzso signaling play a parallel role in cell segregation in this brain zzso zzso of expression reveal that several zzso family members are expressed in the forming zzso and that cells expressing particular receptors form cellular groupings as development zzso Specifically, expression of receptors zzso or zzso and zzso zzso is localized to distinct zzso zzso zzso and zzso are often zzso in regions of the forming thalamus, with each zzso marking discrete zzso zzso In contrast, zzso is expressed by a limited group of zzso zzso Within the zzso thalamus, zzso is present broadly, occasionally overlapping with zzso zzso zzso is more restricted in its expression and is largely zzso with zzso In zzso mice lacking one or both receptors or zzso the appearance of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso nuclear complex is altered compared to wild type zzso These in zzso results support a role for zzso family members in the definition of the zzso zzso In zzso in zzso analysis reveals a hierarchy of mixing among cells expressing zzso with cells expressing zzso alone, zzso and zzso together, or zzso zzso Together, these data support a model in which zzso molecules promote the zzso of discrete zzso zzso by limiting the extent of cell zzso
