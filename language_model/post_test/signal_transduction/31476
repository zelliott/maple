The zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso is rapidly induced upon T cell zzso Although the critical role of zzso in zzso T cell responses is well zzso little is known of the zzso signaling pathways and mechanisms that regulate zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso and zzso signaling influence zzso expression as various chemical zzso such as zzso that targets zzso zzso zzso that targets zzso and zzso A or zzso that targets zzso and thereby affects zzso zzso T cell zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso expression of zzso or a zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso core region of the zzso promoter in zzso reporter zzso We also identify a site on the zzso promoter that is sensitive to zzso signaling and further show that zzso can bind the zzso promoter in zzso and that this binding is diminished when zzso signaling is zzso The normal zzso of zzso but reduced nuclear zzso of zzso in zzso zzso T cells further suggest that zzso and zzso act in a common zzso separate from that involving zzso to drive zzso zzso Taken together, our findings indicate that zzso and zzso are two independent signaling pathways that cooperate to control T cell zzso zzso zzso
