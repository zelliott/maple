zzso and zzso of zzso cells provide for effective and harmless clearance of unwanted or damaged cells in the zzso zzso zzso of one particular class of zzso zzso zzso is a typical trait of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is likely to play an important role in zzso either by affecting zzso zzso acting as an zzso zzso signal or by more effective recognition of zzso cells by zzso zzso This implies that antioxidants effective in zzso zzso zzso may affect zzso zzso and/or effective removal of zzso zzso zzso it is essential to determine whether vitamin zzso the major zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and hence blocks zzso To test this, we studied the effects of vitamin E on zzso zzso and signaling using a model of zzso zzso in zzso T zzso We found that incubation of cells with vitamin E zzso zzso zzso resulted in its integration into cells to reach zzso relevant zzso Using labeling of cell zzso with zzso and fluorescent zzso acid zzso we found that zzso exposure caused significant and selective zzso of zzso in zzso T cells zzso zzso zzso of its content in zzso zzso Vitamin E protected zzso against zzso in a zzso way such that at 25 zzso M and 50 zzso M, a complete zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso At all zzso used, vitamin E had no effect on either zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso or zzso of zzso zzso cells by zzso zzso We conclude that vitamin E does not significantly interfere with zzso zzso zzso pathways of zzso and does not affect zzso of zzso zzso zzso
