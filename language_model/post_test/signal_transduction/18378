Most transformed cells have lost zzso and serum dependence for growth and zzso Previously, we established that when serum is zzso zzso survival signals zzso by focal zzso zzso zzso suppress zzso zzso in primary zzso and zzso cells zzso et zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso The present goals are to identify survival sequences in zzso and signaling molecules downstream of zzso required for zzso survival of primary zzso We report that binding of the zzso domain of zzso to zzso region 1 of zzso is required to support survival of zzso on zzso when serum is zzso The zzso complex activates zzso zzso zzso zzso via a zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso in focal zzso of zzso cultured on zzso which supports their survival, but not in zzso cultured on zzso which does zzso zzso often survive in the absence of zzso zzso if serum factors are zzso In that case, we confirm work of others that survival signals are zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso B zzso However, when serum is zzso zzso and zzso are not involved in the zzso survival zzso documented zzso Thus, survival signals from zzso zzso and serum are zzso by zzso via two distinct zzso
