The knowledge of the mechanism of zzso differentiation in culture is still zzso The emergence of new technologies, such as zzso zzso or zzso zzso followed by mass zzso analysis, has allowed the identification of genes and proteins expressed in biological processes in zzso Here, we report a zzso wide analysis of zzso versus differentiated human zzso zzso We found that genes and proteins which take part in the cell cycle control, zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso pathways were regulated in differentiated zzso zzso In addition, we identified seven proteins and 33 transcripts that had not been previously described as zzso expressed in zzso versus differentiated zzso zzso Furthermore, some of these transcripts or proteins were similarly regulated in human primary zzso and in human zzso The present study opens new areas of investigation in the comprehension of zzso zzso
