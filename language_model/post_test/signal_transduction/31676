A zzso zzso in the promoter region of the zzso gene coding for zzso zzso is a strong zzso of disease severity in zzso muscular zzso zzso The rare G zzso of zzso alters gene promoter function and reduces zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso To dissect the molecular mechanisms of increased disease severity associated with the G zzso we characterized zzso zzso and protein in zzso muscle zzso of patients with defined zzso zzso We did not find significant differences in zzso zzso or protein expression between patients carrying the T zzso zzso or zzso zzso at zzso The G zzso was significantly associated with reduced zzso and zzso cells on patient muscle zzso We also zzso transforming growth zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso muscle zzso given the ability of zzso and zzso to activate zzso promoter region and their role in zzso zzso The amount of zzso and zzso zzso did not predict the amount of zzso zzso or zzso while a zzso in the zzso gene zzso was found to be a strong predictor of zzso zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso mediates inflammatory changes in zzso and that zzso zzso has a role in the complex regulation of zzso zzso
