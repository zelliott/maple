zzso is a zzso repeat zzso zzso that functions as a zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and as a negative regulator of programmed cell zzso zzso has been shown to zzso on numerous zzso sites in zzso as well as to zzso associated zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso In the present study we identify zzso in the zzso domain of zzso as a major site of zzso that is zzso in zzso and requires a zzso zzso zzso of zzso in transgenic plants lacking the zzso zzso and its functional zzso zzso produced plants that were viable but extremely small and generally resembled zzso signaling zzso whereas an zzso substitution for zzso to mimic zzso restored normal zzso Several lines of evidence support the notion that zzso signaling is impaired in the zzso plants, and are consistent with the recently proposed sequential zzso model for zzso interaction and zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso of zzso growth by the zzso zzso occurred normally in the zzso zzso However, expression of many defense genes was dramatically reduced in zzso plants and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was able to grow rapidly in the zzso These results indicate that zzso of zzso is required for some but not all functions of zzso and adds significantly to the emerging notion that zzso zzso could play an important role in plant zzso zzso zzso
