We hypothesized that loss of zzso growth factor binding protein 3 zzso signaling would produce zzso changes in the zzso similar to early zzso 

To understand better the role of zzso in the zzso zzso knockout zzso mice were evaluated for zzso zzso and functional changes compared to zzso zzso We also cultured retinal zzso cells zzso in zzso or zzso to determine the interaction between zzso and zzso as data indicate that both proteins are regulated by zzso receptors and respond zzso We also treated some cells with zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso we have reported previously to regulate zzso and zzso 

zzso analyses showed decreased zzso and zzso potential zzso in the zzso zzso mice, corresponding to increased zzso zzso thickness and cell numbers in the zzso cell layer were reduced in the zzso zzso zzso As expected, loss of zzso was associated with increased zzso zzso When zzso and zzso were applied to zzso they worked zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso promoting zzso Due to their zzso nature, results suggest that zzso of zzso may depend upon which protein zzso versus zzso is zzso 

Taken together, loss of zzso signaling results in a zzso similar to zzso changes observed in diabetic zzso in the early zzso including increased zzso zzso
