The proportion of stem cells versus differentiated progeny is well balanced to maintain tissue zzso which in turn depends on the balance of the different signaling pathways involved in stem cell zzso versus zzso zzso In a screen for genes that regulate cell lineage determination in the zzso zzso we identified that the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex regulates zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso of the zzso complex result in zzso stem cell zzso expansion as well as zzso zzso cell zzso We further demonstrated that zzso regulates zzso zzso and differentiation into zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso commitment to differentiation into zzso cells by regulating the expression of zzso an zzso cell fate zzso Our data uncover a unique mechanism zzso the commitment of stem cells to discrete lineages is zzso regulated by zzso zzso
