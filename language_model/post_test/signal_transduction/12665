The zzso target of zzso zzso signaling zzso plays a central role in cell growth, proliferation and survival not only under zzso conditions but also in a variety of tumor zzso zzso the zzso axis may be a critical target for cancer zzso 

This review discusses how zzso signaling network is zzso active in acute zzso leukemia zzso where it strongly influences zzso survival and zzso of zzso cells, and how effective targeting of this zzso with pharmacological zzso used alone or in combination with existing drugs, may result in suppression of zzso cell growth, including zzso stem zzso 

We searched the literature for articles dealing with zzso of this zzso in zzso and highlighting the efficacy of small molecules directed against the zzso signaling zzso 

The limit of acceptable toxicity for standard chemotherapy has been reached in zzso zzso new therapeutic strategies are zzso zzso the zzso signaling network with small zzso zzso alone or in combinations with other drugs, may result in less toxic and more zzso treatment of zzso zzso Efforts to exploit selective zzso of the zzso zzso that show effectiveness and safety in the clinical setting are currently zzso
