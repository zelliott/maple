This paper describes the construction and characterization of a system of zzso reporter genes for monitoring the activity of signaling pathways and gene regulation mechanisms in intact zzso dissected zzso or cultured zzso zzso integration of the reporters into the zzso zzso was performed in a zzso manner, using zzso zzso This strategy avoids variable position effects and assures low base level activity and high signal zzso zzso integration sites zzso enable the zzso to compare the activity of different reporters in one zzso The reporter zzso have a modular design to facilitate the combination of promoter elements zzso zzso factor binding sites or natural regulatory zzso reporter genes zzso or zzso and zzso integration zzso The system was used to analyze and compare the activity and signal response profiles of two stress zzso zzso factors, zzso and zzso To complement the transgenic reporter fly lines, tissue culture zzso were developed in which the same synthetic ARE and zzso elements control the expression of zzso zzso
