The zzso zzso involved in the zzso zzso in zzso zzso is a type II membrane protein of the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso depends on retrieval from the zzso through a mechanism that involves zzso A zzso consisting of the zzso domain of zzso fused to the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso was localized in the zzso zzso of zzso cells and in the zzso of zzso by indirect zzso The zzso system was used to determine if there is an interaction between zzso and zzso in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells resulted in zzso of the reporter zzso protein zzso detected by western zzso analysis and by expression of zzso zzso zzso another zzso zzso protein that depends on zzso for its zzso also zzso with zzso using the zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso protein zzso showed no zzso A weak interaction was observed between zzso and zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso domain of zzso is sufficient for zzso zzso zzso zzso and that zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso system demonstrates that the zzso of zzso is in the zzso
