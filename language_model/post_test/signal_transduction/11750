Recent evidence indicates that a major fraction of zzso that is produced in zzso zzso cells arises by zzso zzso via the sequential action of zzso D and zzso acid zzso zzso We have previously reported that zzso bases stimulate zzso D activity in zzso zzso The evidence presented here demonstrates that in zzso zzso cells, elevated zzso acid levels are accompanied by a zzso zzso and zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso a known inhibitor of zzso exerted similar effects, suggesting that the action of zzso may have been due to zzso of zzso zzso This prediction was confirmed in in zzso experiments in which it was demonstrated that zzso is as potent an inhibitor of both zzso and zzso zzso activity as zzso The hypothesis that zzso bases may exert a dual action in zzso signal termination is zzso
