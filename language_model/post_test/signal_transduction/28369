The recent identification of candidate zzso genes for sweet, zzso and bitter taste in zzso has opened a door to zzso the molecular and zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso provides a suitable system to study the zzso zzso and behavioral aspects of taste, as sophisticated molecular genetic techniques can be zzso A gene family for putative zzso receptors has been found in the zzso zzso We discuss here current knowledge of the zzso physiology of zzso Taste cells in insects are primary sensory zzso zzso each zzso zzso responds to either sugar, salt or zzso We found that particular zzso zzso zzso respond to bitter zzso zzso studies indicate that zzso zzso on the zzso and zzso are zzso in terms of their taste zzso zzso of the molecular bases for this zzso could lead to an understanding of how the sensory information is processed in the brain and how this in turn is linked to zzso
