Organization and function of the zzso signaling zzso in zzso are best understood with respect to its role in the process of selection of neural zzso zzso However, there is evidence that, besides zzso the zzso signaling zzso is involved in several other zzso zzso one of which is the selection of muscle zzso zzso Thus, the number of these cells is increased in zzso zzso and it has been proposed that muscle zzso cells are selected from clusters of equivalent cells expressing genes of the zzso gene complex zzso Here, I present evidence for the participation of additional elements of the zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso zzso expression of a zzso zzso zzso and zzso shows that the selection of muscle zzso cells obeys principles apparently identical to those acting at the selection of neural zzso zzso
