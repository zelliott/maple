The receptors zzso the zzso to both zzso applied zzso and electrical field stimulation zzso were characterized in horse isolated penile resistance zzso The alpha zzso zzso zzso caused competitive rightward shifts of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso The alpha zzso zzso also displaced to the right the zzso to the alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused zzso zzso zzso which were enhanced in the presence of zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso but not affected by mechanical zzso cell zzso In experiments performed in the presence of zzso zzso inhibited zzso to zzso while zzso zzso enhanced the zzso zzso zzso added zzso induced zzso which were not changed in zzso zzso but significantly increased in the presence of zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso while zzso did not change the response to zzso either alone or in the presence of zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso adrenaline and the beta zzso zzso zzso zzso relaxed penile resistance zzso while the relaxations to zzso and zzso which activate beta zzso were zzso zzso relaxations were not changed in the presence of the beta zzso zzso zzso zzso but competitively inhibited by the beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The present results indicate that stimulation of zzso nerves in horse penile resistance arteries releases zzso which zzso zzso through a zzso zzso of alpha zzso while zzso alpha zzso apparently play a minor zzso zzso beta zzso are also present in these zzso
