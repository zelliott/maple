zzso display techniques using random zzso interactions have supported the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso as part of a zzso zzso for both zzso stress and an zzso zzso Little is known about the interaction of zzso zzso with other zzso zzso have been implicated in the development of chronic zzso infections by zzso zzso products arising from host immune initiated zzso oxygen species zzso zzso In this study we attached one of the key zzso expressed in the model zzso zzso zzso to an affinity support zzso and directly identified major interacting proteins by two-dimensional zzso and zzso mass zzso before and following zzso zzso zzso zzso does not appear to be a zzso zzso and interacts with many types of proteins in both normal and zzso stress zzso zzso zzso presents a flexible, label free, rapid and economical zzso without zzso zzso fishing equipment to identify protein binding zzso
