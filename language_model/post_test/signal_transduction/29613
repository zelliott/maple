The zzso zzso zzso factor zzso plays an important role in zzso development, zzso and zzso However, only a limited number of zzso target genes have been zzso To delineate the molecular mechanism regulated downstream of zzso we aimed to define zzso zzso We engineered a rat zzso zzso cell line, zzso with minimal zzso zzso expression to express zzso zzso The gene expression patterns for zzso cells and control cells were examined using zzso zzso In the present study, differential expression of 23 genes was confirmed by a zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso analysis using zzso zzso Increased expression of genes was involved in the zzso signaling pathway, zzso zzso zzso associated with tumor suppression, zzso binding zzso zzso signal zzso and zzso zzso The wide-ranging collection of such inducing genes suggests to the functions of zzso in cell fate decision and maintenance of zzso zzso
