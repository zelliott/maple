Many cellular signaling pathways are involved in the development of zzso Depending on the tumor entity, the nature as well as the mode of zzso can zzso Some signaling pathways frequently show changes as all tumor cells have to fulfill some basic requirements such as independence from growth factors or zzso against zzso In this review, the possibilities of a tumor to manipulate signaling pathways to reach these goals are exemplified based on an zzso melanoma zzso In addition, new therapeutic options based on the knowledge of signaling pathways will be zzso
