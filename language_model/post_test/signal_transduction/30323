The zzso virus zzso protein zzso is considered to be a functional zzso of the zzso zzso However, in contrast to the latter, zzso is a zzso active signaling zzso To compare B zzso zzso and zzso signaling in an zzso manner, we generated transgenic mice zzso expressing a zzso fusion zzso which retained the zzso zzso tail but has lost the zzso activity of zzso and needs to be activated by the zzso zzso We show that zzso signaling can completely substitute zzso signaling in B cells, leading to normal zzso development, zzso and immune responses including zzso zzso zzso center formation, and zzso zzso In addition, the zzso domain has a unique property in that it can induce zzso zzso to zzso independent of zzso Thus, our data indicate that zzso has evolved to imitate zzso cell function allowing zzso zzso and differentiation of zzso B cells independent of T zzso
