zzso biological nitrogen zzso and carbon dioxide zzso are three fundamental biological processes zzso by zzso zzso In the present study, it is shown that zzso strains of the zzso purple zzso bacteria zzso zzso and zzso zzso containing a zzso in the primary CO2 zzso pathway, zzso the synthesis of components of the nitrogen fixation zzso complex and abrogate normal control zzso The absence of the zzso zzso reductive zzso zzso CO2 fixation zzso removes an important route for the dissipation of excess reducing zzso Thus the zzso strains develop alternative means to remove these reducing zzso resulting in the synthesis of large amounts of zzso even in the presence of zzso This response is under the control of a global zzso signal zzso system previously found to regulate zzso zzso and the zzso of genes required for CO2 fixation through the zzso zzso and alternative zzso In addition, this zzso system directly controls the ability of these bacteria to grow under zzso zzso These results indicate that there is a molecular link between the zzso and nitrogen fixation process, allowing the cell to overcome powerful control mechanisms to remove excess reducing power generated by photosynthesis and carbon zzso Furthermore, these results suggest that the zzso system zzso the expression of genes required for the three processes of photosynthesis, nitrogen zzso and carbon dioxide zzso
