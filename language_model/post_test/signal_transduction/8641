zzso oxygen species zzso exert zzso effects on a wide array of signaling proteins that regulate cellular growth and zzso This study shows that long-term treatment with a low concentration of zzso leads to the zzso of signaling pathways involving zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and protein zzso D zzso that increase zzso binding response element protein zzso zzso at zzso in zzso Although zzso zzso typically mediates zzso increases in zzso target gene zzso the zzso increase in zzso zzso is accompanied by a decrease in zzso protein abundance and no change in zzso reporter zzso zzso studies indicate that zzso decreases zzso protein abundance via a mechanism that does not require zzso zzso Rather, the zzso decrease in zzso protein is prevented by the zzso inhibitor zzso by zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso or protein zzso C activity, or by zzso delivery of a small interfering zzso that decreases zzso zzso A zzso mechanism that links zzso stress to decreased zzso protein abundance is predicted to contribute to the zzso of heart failure by influencing cardiac growth and zzso zzso
