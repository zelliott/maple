zzso with variations in network dosage is crucial for maintaining optimal function in gene zzso We explored how network structure zzso zzso dosage zzso By using the zzso zzso network as a model, we zzso deleted one of the two copies of its four regulatory genes and found that network activity was robust to the change in network zzso A mathematical analysis revealed that a zzso genetic circuit with elements of opposite regulatory activity zzso and zzso constitutes a minimal requirement for zzso zzso zzso interaction zzso and a zzso interaction zzso between the zzso and zzso agents were additional essential elements zzso dosage zzso This mechanism of zzso zzso could represent a general design for gene network structure in zzso
