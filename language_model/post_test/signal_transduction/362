To unravel the zzso effect of the zzso zzso protein zzso on zzso cells, an zzso analysis approach, combining zzso zzso data and zzso zzso databases, was proposed with the emphasis on identifying the potentially crucial zzso The potentially crucial pathways were selected based on a composite criterion characterizing the average significance and zzso properties of important zzso The analysis results suggested that the regulatory effect of zzso was at least involved in cell zzso cell zzso cell survival, and zzso of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso cells, in particular, was significantly decreased to zzso with zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the focal zzso zzso was identified as the potentially zzso zzso and 58 of 65 important genes in this zzso were zzso by zzso zzso Using zzso we have confirmed the changes in the expression levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that these proteins may play an essential role in the zzso process in the zzso zzso zzso
