The maintenance of zzso in stem cells appears to be distinct from the induction of proliferation of the terminally differentiated zzso zzso because it is believed that the latter are unable to zzso However, proliferation is a necessary step in both zzso Interestingly, the small zzso zzso zzso is the first pharmacological agent shown to maintain zzso in human and mouse embryonic stem zzso To determine whether a zzso that can maintain stem cell properties can also participate in controlling the zzso capability of the highly differentiated zzso we examine the effect of zzso in zzso cardiac zzso Here, we show that zzso promotes proliferation in zzso zzso Our demonstration of a second role for zzso suggests that the maintenance of stem cell zzso and the induction of proliferation in differentiated zzso may share common molecular zzso
