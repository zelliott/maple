In the limb zzso patterning along the zzso zzso axis is controlled by Sonic zzso zzso a signaling zzso zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso an organizer tissue located in the zzso margin of the limb zzso We have found that the zzso factors zzso and zzso which are key regulators of cell identity, are expressed in an anterior to zzso zzso in the early limb zzso raising the possibility that zzso zzso factors may play an additional role in patterning this zzso While both zzso and zzso are expressed in an zzso zzso in the zzso zzso the zzso buds principally express zzso in an zzso zzso Thus, to specifically examine the role of zzso in limb patterning we generated zzso zzso mice, which zzso delete zzso from their developing limb zzso We found that these animals display zzso expression of both zzso and its zzso targets specifically in the anterior zzso of the zzso zzso Loss of zzso in the developing limbs results in the formation of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso forced expression of zzso throughout the limb bud zzso expression of zzso and results in zzso zzso We have found that zzso can bind to zzso zzso from limb zzso zzso either zzso or zzso regulatory elements that drive expression of these genes in this zzso and demonstrated that zzso works zzso with zzso zzso to repress expression of zzso reporters driven by these zzso Most significantly, we have found that conditional loss of zzso in limb buds lacking zzso prevents development of zzso zzso in these compound zzso zzso indicating that zzso expression in the anterior region of the limb bud blocks zzso zzso by zzso zzso expression of zzso
