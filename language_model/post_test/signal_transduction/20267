Plant zzso are zzso that protect crops from zzso They zzso durable resistance to a broad range of diseases by zzso intrinsic immune mechanisms in zzso To obtain leads regarding useful compounds, we have screened a chemical library using an established method that allows selective identification of zzso zzso Here, we report the zzso of one of the isolated zzso zzso and its structural zzso zzso zzso functions as a weak analogue of salicylic acid zzso and activates the expression of zzso zzso However, it lacks zzso activity toward zzso zzso zzso relationship analysis suggests that zzso and C2 can be zzso to zzso acid and zzso acid, respectively, to function in zzso We also found that zzso and C2 and their potential functional zzso acted as partial zzso of zzso Thus, zzso compounds could be useful tools for zzso zzso signal zzso zzso
