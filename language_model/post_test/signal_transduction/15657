zzso is a key zzso compound in plant zzso that is zzso in wounded zzso In this work, we have found that this zzso is also a strong zzso for the zzso bacteria zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid induced the expression of a subset of bacterial genes possibly involved in zzso in the plant zzso and bacterial cells zzso with zzso showed increased zzso in chicory and zzso zzso We also showed that tissue wounding induced bacterial spread through the leaf zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was more resistant to bacterial invasion by zzso zzso than zzso zzso These results are consistent with the hypothesis that sensing zzso acid by this zzso helps the pathogen to zzso inside plant zzso
