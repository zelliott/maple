zzso cell zzso zzso play a key role in specifying zzso immune responses tailored to the type of pathogen encountered and the local tissue zzso However, little is known about how zzso perceive the local zzso We investigated whether zzso zzso signaling could affect DC responses to zzso zzso We demonstrate that concurrent zzso and zzso stimulation results in a unique zzso profile in mouse bone-marrow derived zzso characterized by enhanced zzso and zzso and reduced zzso expression compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso production occurred through a zzso zzso signaling pathway, independent of zzso zzso zzso required de zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso and zzso activity were necessary for enhanced zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso required only zzso zzso Further, we show that this zzso zzso zzso can induce zzso zzso In contrast, expression of the zzso zzso target gene zzso was suppressed in zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, our data suggest that zzso acts as an zzso signal that zzso zzso expression of zzso through a zzso zzso and therefore has the potential to tailor the subsequent zzso immune response in a zzso and/or zzso zzso
