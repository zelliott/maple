Most diversity in animals and plants results from the modification of already existing zzso Many organ systems, for example, are permanently modified during evolution to create zzso and zzso diversity, but little is known about the evolution of the underlying zzso zzso The theory of zzso systems drift proposes that the development of zzso zzso structures can involve large-scale modifications in their regulatory zzso We test this hypothesis by comparing zzso induction in two genetically zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Previous work indicated that the zzso is induced by zzso growth factor zzso and zzso signaling in zzso and zzso zzso Here, we show that the evolution of zzso induction involves major molecular zzso and that this shift of signaling pathways involves a novel wiring of zzso signaling and the acquisition of novel zzso in otherwise zzso receptors in zzso zzso zzso First, zzso acts as an zzso of zzso signaling and suppresses the zzso zzso by zzso zzso Second, zzso zzso zzso signaling and requires zzso zzso domain binding zzso unknown from zzso Third, zzso signaling involves zzso and zzso and zzso is zzso to zzso These results confirm zzso system drift as an important theory for the evolution of organ systems and they highlight the significance of protein zzso in signal zzso and the dynamics of signaling zzso
