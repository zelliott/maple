Little is known regarding how the kidney shifts from a sodium and water zzso state zzso to a state where sodium and water are eliminated zzso In human zzso zzso zzso cells, sodium zzso is decreased by the zzso zzso receptors zzso and the zzso type 2 zzso zzso whereas the zzso type 1 zzso increases sodium zzso zzso control of these opposing systems is thought to lead to sodium retention and, zzso zzso We show that zzso stimulation increased plasma membrane zzso zzso via a zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso specific signaling zzso zzso stimulation also reduced the ability of zzso II to stimulate zzso zzso zzso an effect that was partially reversed by an zzso zzso zzso did not increase zzso recruitment in zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso from zzso zzso suggesting a role of zzso in zzso these zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso increased zzso and zzso production, protein zzso 2A zzso zzso zzso and sodium transport zzso These studies shed new light on the regulation of zzso sodium transport by the zzso and zzso systems and potential new therapeutic targets for selectively treating zzso
