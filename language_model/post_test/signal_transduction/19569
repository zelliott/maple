We sought to determine the molecular basis for the zzso activities of zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso traditionally used in Thailand for a variety of zzso As little as 1 zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso zzso zzso zzso head and neck, zzso breast, zzso and myeloma cancer cell zzso zzso also suppressed the zzso ability of tumor cells, with 50% zzso occurring at a dose less than 10 zzso zzso induced zzso and zzso cell cycle arrest, increased the levels of zzso and zzso and reduced the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited zzso and zzso zzso zzso 3 beta zzso zzso reduced cell survival zzso and induced zzso as indicated by zzso V zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso -9 and zzso Overall, our results demonstrate that zzso zzso suppression of cell proliferation through zzso of zzso pathways and induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso
