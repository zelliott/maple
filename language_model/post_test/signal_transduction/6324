The role of zzso signaling in zzso can zzso zzso acts as an zzso in some zzso and a tumor zzso in zzso Here, we show that different zzso receptors can have opposite effects in a single tumor zzso zzso of zzso zzso active zzso or zzso in zzso brain tumor cell lines caused zzso effects on tumor zzso Cell zzso soft zzso colony formation, and zzso growth were all promoted by zzso and inhibited by zzso We also found that zzso zzso transcripts are highly expressed in zzso zzso brain tumors such as zzso whereas zzso is scarce or zzso This parallels normal zzso development, during which zzso is predominantly expressed in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso Given the zzso effects of zzso we analyzed its gene dosage in 40 zzso brain tumors, detecting an increased copy number in zzso of zzso zzso gene amplification was confirmed by zzso in zzso zzso in one case with extremely high zzso zzso zzso In addition, expression of the zzso zzso target gene zzso in zzso was associated with significantly shorter patient survival zzso zzso zzso Finally, pharmacological zzso of zzso signaling suppresses growth of zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso and zzso can have opposite effects on the growth of a single tumor type, and show that zzso can be zzso after gene amplification in human zzso
