Nerve growth factor zzso is a zzso zzso factor for developing sympathetic and zzso sensory zzso zzso promotes growth and survival of zzso via zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We used zzso cultures of sympathetic zzso to address the mechanism of zzso signaling from zzso zzso and terminals to zzso zzso and cell zzso Our results demonstrate that an zzso zzso complex forms in zzso zzso and is zzso transported as a complex to cell bodies of sympathetic zzso Although a minor fraction of both zzso and zzso is zzso zzso a large fraction of the zzso that is zzso transported is found zzso with zzso transported zzso Interestingly, the metabolism of the zzso complex is dramatically different in young, zzso sympathetic zzso as compared to older, zzso sympathetic zzso After withdrawal of zzso from zzso zzso of young zzso zzso within zzso zzso as well as within zzso zzso and cell bodies, zzso zzso In contrast, after withdrawal of zzso from zzso zzso of older zzso zzso within zzso zzso zzso completely, although more slowly than that in young zzso whereas zzso of zzso within zzso zzso and cell bodies occurs markedly more slowly, with at least one-half of the level of zzso remaining 2 d after zzso zzso Thus, zzso within the cell bodies of young, zzso sympathetic zzso is derived from zzso zzso A more stable zzso complex within cell bodies of mature sympathetic zzso may contribute to the acquisition of zzso independence for survival of mature sympathetic zzso
