Defining the molecular interactions required to program activated zzso T cells to survive and become memory cells may allow us to understand how to augment zzso zzso zzso zzso virus entry zzso is a member of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso family that interacts with zzso in the zzso family, LIGHT and zzso and in the zzso family, B and T zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso family members initiate zzso signaling when engaged with zzso but may also activate survival gene zzso Using a model of zzso virus infection, we made the unexpected finding that zzso in zzso or zzso profoundly impaired zzso zzso T cell survival and development of protective immune zzso Mixed adoptive transfer experiments indicated that zzso expressed in zzso zzso cells functions as a zzso zzso that delivers positive zzso through zzso expressed in T zzso Our data demonstrate a critical role of zzso zzso zzso system in zzso defenses by driving the differentiation of memory zzso T zzso
