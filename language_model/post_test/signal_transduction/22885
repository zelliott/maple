zzso zzso zzso play a critical role in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that degrade the plant cell wall by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is due (at least in part) to zzso antibiotics whose synthesis is regulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso the product of an AHL zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso to the zzso of transgenic tobacco plants caused the synthesis in plants of the zzso AHL signaling molecules zzso and zzso The zzso produced by the transgenic plants were sufficient to induce target gene expression in several zzso bacterial AHL zzso and to restore zzso activity to an zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso was restored to an zzso zzso strain rendered zzso as a consequence of a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The ability to generate bacterial zzso signaling molecules in the plant offers novel opportunities for disease control and for manipulating zzso zzso
