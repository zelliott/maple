zzso zzso cells zzso are the major cell type involved in liver zzso zzso zzso signaling through zzso zzso 4 zzso in zzso has been identified as a key event in liver fibrosis, and as the molecular link between inflammation and liver zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso one of the main medicinal components of zzso on the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso from rats were isolated and cultured in zzso modified zzso medium zzso Following treatment with zzso zzso showed a strong zzso zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso with enhanced collagen zzso zzso by transforming growth zzso zzso zzso significantly and zzso reduced zzso zzso production, as well as the zzso and protein synthesis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso as determined by quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso western zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso further reduced the zzso zzso and translation zzso zzso of the gene coding for collagen type I zzso zzso in zzso zzso Following zzso zzso the zzso of the nuclear zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and consequently, the nuclear zzso of zzso were markedly increased in the zzso and these changes were reversed by zzso with zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso Our results provide new insight into the treatment of zzso zzso through regulation of the zzso signaling zzso
