In this study, zzso zzso at low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the differentiation of zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso while zzso at high zzso zzso zzso zzso causes the zzso of these zzso The zzso with zzso (a zzso selective zzso not zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso reduces the zzso generation of zzso in the cultured zzso zzso On the other hand, either of the above two zzso zzso is capable of suppressing the zzso zzso of zzso zzso However, only the inclusion of zzso zzso not zzso prevents the cells from serum zzso cell zzso Although the membrane zzso of conventional zzso zzso and zzso zzso was observed in the zzso zzso zzso only zzso exhibits a zzso zzso activity among those zzso responsive to zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso was also detected in the zzso zzso zzso indicating the involvement of a zzso signaling zzso in the zzso cell zzso of zzso zzso Together with our previous findings that the selective zzso of zzso or zzso zzso the differentiation of zzso zzso into zzso or zzso cells zzso respectively, the results in this study further demonstrate that zzso zzso is responsible for relaying the zzso signal to intrinsic zzso zzso signaling zzso in the zzso zzso It is likely that the selective zzso of specific zzso zzso provides a new strategy to manipulate the differential cell fate commitment of zzso zzso zzso towards zzso or differentiation into zzso zzso and other cell zzso
