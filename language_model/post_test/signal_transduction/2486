The zzso domain of the zzso alpha zzso contains a zzso motif of five zzso acid zzso zzso We deleted this motif from the human zzso zzso and found that in zzso cells this zzso cannot associate with the zzso zzso and is retained in the zzso zzso Point zzso in the zzso motif of the zzso zzso or the two highly charged zzso zzso or deletion of the zzso and zzso zzso had no effect on the ability of zzso to interact with zzso and to be expressed at the cell zzso In contrast, by replacing either of the two zzso with zzso or by deletion of both of these zzso zzso was incapable of zzso with zzso The zzso point zzso that associated with zzso were expressed in zzso cells and their responsiveness to zzso factors was zzso None of these zzso bound spontaneously to zzso but binding could be induced by either zzso or the stimulating zzso zzso zzso to the same extent as that of the zzso zzso The ability of these zzso to initiate zzso formation in zzso cells zzso on zzso zzso also appeared to be zzso Thus the zzso of zzso zzso involving the zzso zzso or zzso zzso was indistinguishable from that of zzso zzso both in zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, deletion of the zzso domain of zzso zzso of the zzso motif resulted in a loss of responsiveness of zzso to zzso stimulation and formation of focal contacts on zzso However, this zzso was targeted to focal contacts formed by other zzso even when they had not bound zzso Together, these results suggest that the two zzso zzso of the zzso motif provide a site for interaction of the zzso zzso with zzso whereas the zzso domain zzso of this motif is involved in the regulation of zzso zzso via zzso
