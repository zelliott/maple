zzso zzso and zzso were first identified as proteins that have the ability to zzso G zzso receptors zzso However, it has recently been found that zzso can activate signaling pathways independent of G protein zzso The diversity of these signaling pathways has also been zzso This leads to an appreciation of zzso zzso which is a new class of drugs that selectively activate zzso signaling without G protein zzso In this review, we will discuss the recent advance of zzso signaling zzso including a brief account of different biased zzso their pharmacological applications, and novel zzso zzso
