zzso of zzso into the zzso of inactive promoters has been shown to poise genes for their zzso Here we provide strong evidence that zzso is incorporated into the promoter regions of zzso zzso zzso target genes only upon gene zzso and that, in a zzso zzso Moreover, members of the human zzso complex, zzso also follow the same gene recruitment zzso as zzso zzso cellular depletion of zzso or zzso leads to a severe zzso in zzso zzso including loss of zzso cell zzso We find that incorporation of zzso within zzso promoter zzso allows zzso to adopt preferential positions along the DNA zzso zzso Finally, we provide evidence that zzso is essential to allow zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our results provide strong zzso insight into how zzso regulates zzso gene expression and provide a novel link between zzso and zzso gene regulation and zzso zzso
