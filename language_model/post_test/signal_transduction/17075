zzso is an important zzso process in insects, usually along with synthesis and degradation of zzso zzso zzso an insect hormone, has been reported to contribute to many processes including zzso However, little is known about the link between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso zzso and zzso and their new target genes are critical for zzso zzso zzso in a zzso insect zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso were targets of zzso and zzso respectively, through zzso analysis and experimental zzso The levels of zzso and zzso were reduced, whereas the levels of zzso and zzso were zzso in response to zzso In addition, zzso and zzso were zzso zzso by an zzso zzso the zzso zzso in the zzso signaling zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso and zzso led to a significant reduction in the survival rate along with a zzso obstacles zzso zzso caused by zzso mimics zzso and the zzso content of zzso was simultaneously zzso Thus, zzso and zzso act as molecular link that tune the zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso
