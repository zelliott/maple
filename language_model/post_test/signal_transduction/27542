zzso of zzso to zzso zzso with zzso cells was studied to investigate the role of zzso in cell zzso zzso of zzso to zzso cells induced the formation of zzso zzso zzso and elevated the zzso zzso concentration zzso The rise in zzso was due to the influx of zzso from the zzso medium and release from zzso zzso zzso The zzso influx zzso did not allow the zzso of zzso or zzso The influx was inhibited by zzso a specific blocker of zzso zzso channels, whereas zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso channels, did not have any zzso Thus, zzso appears to activate a zzso zzso channel in zzso zzso The zzso zzso release was inhibited by zzso of cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso toxin zzso which also inhibited the zzso formation in zzso zzso zzso of caffeine neither elevated the zzso nor affected the zzso zzso zzso The data reveal that the binding of zzso to zzso cells activates zzso C via a zzso G zzso which leads to formation of zzso and release of zzso from zzso zzso pool of zzso zzso zzso also arrested the differentiation of zzso cells in culture and significantly zzso their zzso This zzso effect of zzso on cell proliferation was blocked by zzso but not by zzso suggesting that the influx of zzso was essentially required for cell zzso Our data suggest a role for zzso in the regulation of zzso signaling events and cell zzso
