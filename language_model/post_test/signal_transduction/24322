Over 20 years ago, it was reported that liver zzso contains at least two distinct proteins that transfer zzso in zzso zzso transfer protein zzso and a pH zzso zzso fraction containing zzso carrier zzso zzso In contrast to zzso there has been minimal progress on the structural and functional significance of zzso in zzso zzso As shown zzso highly zzso zzso zzso zzso up to zzso the rapid zzso transfer of zzso zzso zzso from zzso donor zzso to highly curved zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso in zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso zzso resulted in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso to the plasma zzso zzso enhancement of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso down regulation of zzso Like zzso zzso binds two zzso required for zzso budding from the zzso zzso and fatty zzso zzso Double zzso zzso zzso showed zzso significantly zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso and plasma membrane of zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these data show for the first time that zzso plays a zzso zzso role in zzso zzso transfer, distribution, and zzso
