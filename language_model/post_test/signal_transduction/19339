The formation of complex zzso during embryonic development is often accompanied by directed cellular migration towards a target zzso zzso mutual recognition between the zzso cell and its target tissue leads to the arrest of the cell migratory behavior and subsequent contact formation between the two interacting cell zzso Recent studies implicated a novel family of surface proteins containing a zzso domain and single zzso repeat zzso domain in zzso recognition and the arrest of cell zzso Here, we describe the involvement of a novel zzso surface zzso zzso in targeting zzso muscles towards their corresponding zzso cells in the zzso zzso zzso is specifically expressed by the target zzso cells and is essential for arresting the migratory behavior of the muscle zzso Additional studies in zzso zzso cultured cells suggest that zzso forms a protein complex with the zzso zzso zzso essential for guiding muscles towards their zzso zzso zzso analysis supports a model in which zzso performs its activity zzso through its interaction with the zzso receptors expressed on the muscle zzso These results suggest a novel mechanism of zzso recognition through interactions between zzso family members and zzso zzso
