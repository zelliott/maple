zzso zzso 1 zzso can zzso zzso oxygen species zzso generated from zzso zzso zzso to catalyze zzso zzso This study was performed to identify a novel zzso of zzso in zzso the zzso injury following zzso zzso zzso zzso In a rat model of zzso zzso the zzso size, serum zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso activity, zzso and zzso expression were zzso In a cell zzso zzso zzso zzso model of zzso zzso the zzso zzso activity, zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso levels were zzso In zzso zzso caused zzso zzso zzso % zzso size in zzso accompanied by elevated activities of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression and high numbers of zzso zzso zzso these effects were attenuated by zzso with the inhibitor of zzso In zzso zzso of zzso or zzso of zzso or zzso expression significantly suppressed zzso cellular zzso zzso with decreased zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso of zzso led to a decrease in zzso production accompanied by a decrease in zzso expression and zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso expression did not affect zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was partially reversed by zzso or zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate a novel zzso of zzso in zzso where zzso coordinates with zzso and zzso the role of zzso zzso in zzso injury following zzso
