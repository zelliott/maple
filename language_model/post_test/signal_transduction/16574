zzso are an ideal model for studying a rapid zzso change in response to various signal zzso zzso zzso changes via the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso have been investigated zzso In contrast, zzso via zzso zzso is less well zzso Here, we provide the first zzso evidence that zzso zzso and zzso of zzso are associated with different membrane zzso We also demonstrate that zzso activated by zzso zzso show dynamic change by actively forming zzso and never fully spreading over a period of more than an zzso In addition, zzso activated by zzso zzso are different from those activated by zzso zzso in terms of zzso contact and in their distribution pattern of zzso zzso and various zzso zzso The zzso appearance of zzso produced through zzso zzso zzso is highly dependent on zzso zzso zzso but less dependent on zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity in zzso zzso activated zzso zzso an increase in zzso activity and more zzso zzso However, both zzso and zzso activity are higher in zzso activated by zzso zzso than in those activated by zzso zzso Taken together, this study demonstrates that the signals induced by zzso zzso zzso at the level of zzso and zzso activity to allow zzso to actively form zzso
