Although cigarette smoking is the major risk factor for lung cancer, only zzso of female lung cancer patients in Taiwan have a history of zzso The genetic mechanisms of zzso in nonsmokers are zzso but zzso have been suggested to play a role as lung tumor zzso This report is a comprehensive analysis of the molecular signature of zzso female lung cancer patients in Taiwan, with a particular focus on the zzso gene zzso 

Sixty pairs of tumor and adjacent normal lung tissue specimens were analyzed by using zzso zzso expression zzso zzso expressed genes in tumor zzso were identified by a paired zzso test and validated by reverse zzso and zzso zzso analysis was conducted by using zzso zzso Analysis as well as gene set enrichment analysis and zzso zzso zzso survival analyses were used to evaluate the association of zzso expression and clinical zzso 

We identified 687 zzso expressed genes in zzso cell lung zzso zzso Many of these zzso most notably the zzso family, were participants in the zzso guidance signaling zzso The zzso of zzso in tumor zzso both at the zzso and zzso levels, was associated with poor survival among zzso women with zzso 

In zzso several zzso gene family members were identified as potential therapeutic targets, and zzso may be useful as a zzso zzso for zzso which may also be gender specific in Taiwanese zzso 

A novel zzso for zzso is zzso
