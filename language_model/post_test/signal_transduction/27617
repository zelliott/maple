Recently, it has been shown that zzso zzso has a late phase that may be blocked by protein synthesis zzso To understand the mechanisms underlying the late phase, we zzso with the zzso of zzso factors that might couple synaptic zzso to protein zzso zzso zzso of cultured zzso zzso with an expression zzso zzso a dominant zzso form of zzso resulted in a nearly complete blockade of the late zzso zzso that activate zzso were zzso and zzso was zzso zzso of zzso or the zzso zzso were without effect on the late phase, while zzso designed to interfere with zzso function attenuated the late zzso These results indicate that the zzso of zzso and zzso are necessary to establish a late phase of zzso zzso
