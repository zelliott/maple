An analogue of zzso retinal in which zzso zzso is blocked by a carbon bridge from zzso to zzso was incorporated into the zzso of sensory zzso I zzso and sensory zzso II zzso also called zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso retinal analogue forms zzso and zzso analogue zzso with similar zzso zzso as the native zzso zzso zzso prevents the formation of the zzso intermediate of the zzso zzso zzso and those of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso A computerized cell tracking and motion analysis system capable of detecting zzso of native zzso activity was used for assessing zzso zzso Introduction of the locked analogue into zzso or zzso zzso in zzso did not restore zzso responses through any of the three known zzso systems zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso We conclude that unlike the zzso zzso of zzso zzso which has been reported to mediate zzso responses without specific zzso zzso of its retinal zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso and zzso zzso zzso
