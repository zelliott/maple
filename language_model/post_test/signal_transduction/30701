Previously, we reported that a zzso zzso from the sequence of the zzso zzso heat shock protein zzso zzso can serve as a carrier in zzso vaccines with zzso zzso zzso molecules of various zzso These zzso vaccines were effective injected in PBS without added zzso We now report that zzso zzso to zzso zzso type 4 zzso zzso innate zzso zzso it zzso mouse zzso to zzso zzso and induced the late appearance of zzso on the zzso surface in a zzso manner; zzso alone or zzso to other carriers did not stimulate zzso in zzso The injection of zzso zzso zzso on the surface into mice induced long-term resistance to lethal zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso could also induce the late appearance on the surface of zzso zzso and resistance to challenge in injected zzso Resistance was not induced by zzso containing only zzso zzso or by zzso zzso that had been zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso did induce resistance to lethal zzso Moreover, bone zzso zzso cells activated by zzso and zzso with zzso zzso were also effective in inducing resistance to lethal zzso Resistance induced by the zzso bone zzso zzso cell was specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 or type 4) and was associated with the induction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
