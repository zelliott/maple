The control of cell number during animal development is a longstanding zzso Recent studies in the fruit fly zzso zzso have defined a new signaling zzso that restricts cell proliferation in zzso zzso The zzso proteins zzso and zzso which play a role in cell zzso and structure, control the zzso of the zzso zzso complex, which in turn activates the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso that positively regulates cell growth, survival, and zzso This zzso signaling zzso contains several zzso genes and regulates the contact zzso of proliferation in cultured zzso
