Advanced zzso end products zzso were implicated in the zzso of zzso dysfunction in diabetic vascular zzso Our previous study found that a novel compound zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study was conducted to explore the possible protective mechanisms of zzso on zzso zzso zzso In binding experiments, zzso zzso and zzso polarization zzso showed no significant difference or changes of zzso on zzso intensity and polarization in the zzso of zzso In zzso formation experiments, zzso was incubated with zzso precursor compounds zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the formation zzso However, high performance liquid zzso zzso analysis showed no new zzso compounds formed in the reaction zzso The results of zzso analysis also showed that zzso did not inhibit the zzso zzso However, the zzso with zzso could significantly decrease zzso or zzso group zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso oxygen species zzso in human zzso vein zzso cells zzso Our results suggested that zzso might block the zzso signal zzso rather than inhibit zzso formation or bind to zzso and change its structure to prevent zzso dysfunction in diabetic vascular zzso
