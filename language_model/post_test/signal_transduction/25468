zzso bone dimensions are important zzso of bone zzso Gender differences in cortical bone size caused by greater zzso expansion in males than in females during the zzso growth spurt are well established both in humans and in experimental animal zzso However, the mechanism by which gender influences cortical bone size is still a matter of zzso The role of zzso and zzso in zzso bone growth has been examined in human disorders as well as animal models, such as zzso or sex steroid zzso knockout zzso Based on the findings that growth hormone zzso and zzso growth factor I zzso are major regulators of zzso skeletal growth, we and others have predicted that sex hormones interact with the zzso axis to regulate cortical bone zzso However, studies conflict as to whether zzso and zzso impact cortical bone size through the zzso pathway, through zzso without zzso zzso through zzso without zzso zzso or independent of zzso We review recent data on the impact of sex steroids and components of the zzso axis on sexual zzso in bone zzso While the zzso axis is a major player in regulating peak bone size, the relative contribution of zzso mechanisms to sex differences in cortical bone size remains to be zzso
