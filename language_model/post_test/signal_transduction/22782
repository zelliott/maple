The steroid hormone zzso regulates zzso development and metamorphosis in zzso zzso through a complex genetic hierarchy that begins with a small set of early response zzso Here, we present data indicating that the zzso response hierarchy also mediates egg chamber maturation during zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in a zzso manner while zzso expression is ubiquitous throughout zzso zzso or increasing the zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso or zzso zzso results in corresponding changes in early gene zzso The stage 10 zzso cell expression of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso egg chambers reveals regulation of zzso by both the zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso analysis indicates a zzso requirement for zzso gene zzso zzso clones of zzso zzso arrest and zzso during zzso and zzso zzso clones exhibit a similar zzso demonstrating a functional requirement for zzso responsiveness during the zzso phase of zzso Finally, the expression of zzso zzso zzso increases during zzso and zzso analysis confirms that this zzso zzso is required in the zzso for egg chamber zzso Together these data suggest that the zzso expression profile of zzso zzso and zzso may be a functional reflection of zzso levels and that zzso provides zzso signals regulating the progression of zzso and proper zzso of zzso zzso cell zzso
