Changes in the local expression and signaling activity of the zzso growth zzso zzso axis regulate growth and survival of zzso vascular smooth muscle cells zzso and influence plaque zzso Recent evidence suggests that zzso of low density zzso zzso in zzso during the progression of zzso is linked to local changes in zzso zzso We investigated the effects of LDL on the biological actions and downstream signaling pathways zzso by this growth factor in A10 zzso 

We first characterized the effects of LDL on the zzso and zzso actions of zzso in A10 zzso Native LDL were zzso and zzso enhanced DNA synthesis induced by zzso from zzso zzso up to zzso while having no effect on its zzso zzso In contrast, oxidized LDL, at zzso levels that did not modify these actions by themselves, significantly reduced the zzso and survival effects of zzso by zzso and zzso zzso These observations correlated with opposite changes exerted by native and oxidized LDL on the insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso response to zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling response was not zzso 

Our study demonstrates a previously unidentified zzso of the actions of zzso on A10 zzso by LDL, dependent on their extent of zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the differential zzso of the zzso zzso response to zzso play a pivotal zzso
