A theory for an zzso phase transition in a driven zzso network is zzso The theory is based on the chemical master equation zzso zzso of zzso zzso reactions and the mathematical method of large zzso The large zzso theory provides an zzso tool connecting the zzso zzso of an open chemical system with the zzso dynamics of its zzso zzso It shows a corresponding zzso phase transition among multiple zzso zzso As an example, in the zzso zzso system with feedback that exhibits zzso we show that the zzso zzso zzso phase transition has all the characteristics of classic equilibrium phase zzso Maxwell construction, a zzso zzso of the zzso energy zzso zzso zero for a generating function and a critical point that matches the cusp in zzso zzso zzso To the zzso system, the mathematical analysis suggests three distinct zzso and needed levels of zzso They are zzso molecular zzso zzso zzso network zzso zzso and zzso cellular zzso For finite zzso systems such as a cell, motions associated with zzso and zzso are zzso while that with zzso is zzso Both zzso and zzso are emergent properties of a dynamic zzso zzso
