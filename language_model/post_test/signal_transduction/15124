Patients with classic zzso zzso zzso a disorder characterized by extensive zzso zzso bone formation, share a zzso zzso zzso within the zzso domain of zzso a bone zzso protein type I zzso Through a series of in zzso zzso using several zzso cell lines and chick limb bud zzso cultures, we determined that zzso zzso zzso activated zzso signaling in the absence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that was enhanced by zzso We further investigated the interaction of zzso zzso zzso with zzso a zzso zzso protein that prevents leaky zzso type I zzso zzso in the absence of zzso The zzso protein exhibited reduced binding to zzso in zzso zzso kidney cell line zzso suggesting that increased zzso zzso activity in zzso cells with zzso zzso is due, at least in part, to decreased binding of this zzso zzso zzso with these findings, in zzso analyses of zzso zzso showed zzso zzso of zzso signaling in response to the zzso zzso resulting in increased embryonic zzso These data support the conclusion that the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso patients is an zzso zzso that zzso zzso signaling in a zzso and zzso manner to promote zzso consistent with the zzso zzso bone formation in these zzso
