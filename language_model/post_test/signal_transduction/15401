zzso signal zzso in cellular systems is a central issue in systems zzso Numerous experiments from different laboratories generate an abundance of individual components and zzso interactions zzso environmental and zzso zzso However, for many signal zzso systems there is insufficient information on the overall structure and the molecular mechanisms involved in the signaling zzso Moreover, lack of kinetic and zzso information makes it difficult to construct quantitative models of signal zzso zzso zzso dynamic zzso combined with network analysis, provides an effective way to integrate zzso knowledge of regulatory interactions into a zzso mathematical model which is able to describe the time evolution of the system without the requirement for kinetic zzso This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of discrete dynamic zzso particularly focusing on zzso dynamic zzso We describe this method zzso in the context of cellular signaling zzso Several zzso of zzso dynamic models including threshold zzso networks and zzso linear systems are also covered, followed by two examples of successful application of discrete dynamic modeling in cell zzso
