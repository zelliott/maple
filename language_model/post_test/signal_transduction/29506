The molecular events regulating the elimination of cells to create a hollow zzso during tissue development are poorly zzso By using an in zzso zzso model in which zzso human zzso zzso cells form hollow zzso structures, we have observed both zzso zzso and zzso associated with cells that are lost during zzso zzso Here, we show that the tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates induction of zzso processes associated with zzso zzso TRAIL is zzso during zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso cultures and zzso of TRAIL signaling during zzso blocks the formation of zzso zzso In addition, treatment with zzso TRAIL zzso extensive zzso in zzso and zzso zzso When combined with zzso of zzso 3 activity (by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso results in zzso zzso Thus, TRAIL regulates an zzso program during zzso zzso which together with zzso zzso events, results in zzso formation during zzso zzso
