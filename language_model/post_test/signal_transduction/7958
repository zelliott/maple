zzso is recognized as a zzso stress, and indeed it is known to stimulate zzso zzso zzso a representative zzso system, in patients with diabetes zzso or in animal models of zzso Thus, we tried to clarify the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso axis zzso 

We studied the effect of high zzso on the zzso regulation of zzso zzso gene that encodes zzso hormone, a central zzso of zzso zzso using zzso zzso cell line in zzso 

We found that high zzso concentration (24 zzso significantly zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso The effect was zzso and was zzso by nuclear zzso zzso or zzso promoters but not by zzso element or zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso effect of high zzso on zzso gene was eliminated by zzso and zzso zzso suggesting the involvement of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso has the zzso zzso consensus zzso and gel shift zzso showed the binding of zzso to the zzso Finally, the effect of high zzso was completely abolished by treatment with a radical zzso zzso zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso activates zzso gene zzso at least partly, via zzso and that zzso free radical generation may mediate the zzso of these zzso factors, which in turn stimulates the zzso of zzso zzso
