The zzso of DNA sequence information from large-scale zzso and random library sequencing projects is leading to the rapid identification of many putative zzso virtual transcripts and zzso of unknown zzso There is therefore an increasing need for high zzso sensitive and robust methods for identification and zzso of zzso and/or their products, based on zzso We describe a high zzso functional expression screen based on zzso analysis of enhanced green fluorescent protein expression in single cells by zzso zzso The zzso was implemented in a zzso format, requiring around zzso zzso The system was validated by zzso of a series of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso with a zzso reporter containing a zzso responsive zzso The majority of the test plasmids gave a zzso signal above background at a pool size of zzso zzso tests indicate that the zzso is zzso at this pool zzso At this level we demonstrate that large zzso zzso libraries can be zzso zzso
