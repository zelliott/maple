zzso zzso zzso zzso is a fatal disease without effective zzso or therapeutic zzso Although the role of zzso zzso in initiating development of zzso is well established, downstream targets of zzso Ras signaling are poorly zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to be an important prerequisite for development of pancreatic zzso zzso zzso a common precursor to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso which controls zzso zzso can be activated by zzso is zzso in several human zzso and is required for zzso zzso changes in zzso We investigated effects of loss of zzso in zzso pancreatic zzso in zzso 

Using a zzso approach, we deleted zzso from pancreatic zzso cells in different mouse models of zzso and in mice with zzso acute zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso mice were used to investigate the role of zzso in zzso 

zzso expression increased in mouse and human pancreatic tumors, particularly in the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso in mice reduced formation of zzso zzso and tumors and significantly prolonged zzso zzso zzso zzso was accompanied by zzso zzso of zzso along with zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso that lacked zzso or that were incubated with zzso of zzso zzso had a reduced ability to undergo zzso in zzso zzso 

In mice, zzso is required for early zzso changes and zzso zzso zzso in development of pancreatic zzso zzso might be developed as a diagnostic marker or therapeutic target for zzso
