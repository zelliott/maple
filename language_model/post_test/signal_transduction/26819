zzso zzso signaling is one of the hallmarks of zzso zzso stimulating factor zzso a zzso growth factor that controls proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells, may contribute to the development of zzso In the present study, we evaluated the expression of zzso and its zzso zzso in various grades of zzso samples and primary cell culture derived from a zzso patient as well as different human zzso cell zzso We showed that zzso and zzso were widely expressed by zzso samples, primary zzso cell culture and zzso cell zzso The expression levels of zzso and zzso were not significantly different between different grades of zzso zzso promoted zzso migration and invasion of zzso zzso zzso of zzso with its zzso inhibited growth and zzso of zzso cells in zzso We also showed that zzso of signal zzso and zzso zzso 3 zzso 3) as well as expression of several of its downstream zzso was regulated by zzso Taken together, the present results suggest that zzso contributes to zzso progression that may be linked to zzso genesis and zzso
