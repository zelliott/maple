Although zzso is known to be an important factor for bone zzso particularly in inflammatory bone diseases, the relevance between zzso and zzso in zzso remains zzso In this study we examined the mechanism of zzso induced zzso and its downstream zzso We show that zzso is suppressed by zzso and zzso zzso type I zzso and in zzso and zzso mice using in zzso culture zzso zzso zzso of mouse zzso derived zzso precursor cells zzso with zzso zzso pure zzso culture and zzso zzso cells in presence of zzso Furthermore, zzso production in zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso in zzso induced zzso and zzso zzso rates of zzso and zzso were significantly decreased in zzso and zzso zzso during zzso These results indicate that zzso is induced by zzso in zzso and serves as an zzso factor promoting zzso through zzso and zzso zzso
