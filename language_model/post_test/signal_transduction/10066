In this report, we describe the expression and function of human zzso a member of the zzso family of zinc finger zzso zzso Like other family members, the zzso protein contains a zzso zinc finger DNA binding domain at the zzso Our experiments employing zzso fusion proteins reveal multiple zzso zzso including a zzso activity domain, an intrinsic repressive element, and a zzso synergistic zzso zzso expression of zzso was noted in several human tumors including zzso zzso gastric cancer, and colon zzso To study the effects of the zzso protein on growth properties of human cancer cells and facilitate the identification of its downstream zzso we combined an zzso gene expression system with zzso analysis to screen for its zzso zzso Transfer of zzso into zzso cells that expressed no zzso zzso zzso protein zzso significant growth promotion zzso Several of the zzso zzso genes have been associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso signaling pathways zzso zzso zzso AES, and zzso This information could be zzso for further zzso research and for devising zzso therapeutic strategies against human zzso
