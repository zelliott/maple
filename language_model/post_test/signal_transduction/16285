The Sonic zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the maintenance of stem or zzso cells in many adult zzso zzso abnormal zzso zzso zzso is also associated with initiation of zzso but its role in tumor growth is still zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso a zzso zzso product used to inhibit the zzso signaling pathway, reduces the Side zzso zzso obtained by zzso zzso zzso dye zzso In addition, zzso is able to zzso along with zzso and other products, the zzso zzso by increasing zzso and zzso zzso zzso if the SP is solely measured as a zzso dye zzso zzso this may be significantly modulated by the zzso of zzso transport zzso independently from the action of zzso on the zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso may act in the upstream regulation of the zzso signaling zzso to protect the zzso of the SP zzso giving support to the cancer stem cell hypothesis and suggesting that zzso is not only critical for increased resistance to zzso zzso
