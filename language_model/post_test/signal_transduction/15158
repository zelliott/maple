We have reported previously a zzso action of zzso zzso which stimulates the zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso the regulatory zzso of zzso in human skin zzso The aim of the present study was to zzso the mechanism by which zzso activates zzso and to investigate the zzso role of this zzso action in zzso zzso We found that zzso activates zzso through zzso First, zzso rapidly induced the zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso cells expressing zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso and both were attenuated by either the addition of a zzso inhibitor or zzso zzso In contrast, a zzso inhibitor could only block the zzso of zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso complex formation, which was also zzso by a zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso contributes to the zzso effect of zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, it was also observed in primary cerebral cortical zzso that zzso induced the zzso of zzso and suppressed zzso zzso Together, the findings of the present study demonstrate a novel zzso action of zzso on zzso cell survival, and provide new insights into the mechanism underlying this action, which involves zzso zzso and zzso complex zzso
