The zzso system, also named the second vascular system, plays a critical role in tissue zzso and zzso The past two decades of intensive research have led to the identification and detailed understanding of many molecular players and mechanisms regulating the formation of the zzso zzso during embryonic zzso Furthermore, clinical and experimental data clearly demonstrate that the formation of new zzso vessels by zzso zzso from pre-existing zzso vessels, or by the de zzso formation of zzso zzso also occurs in various pathological conditions, such as cancer and organ transplant zzso while zzso is zzso in primary zzso In cancer, zzso vessels are one major gateway for invasive tumor cells to leave the primary tumor site and to establish distant organ zzso zzso the specific targeting of the zzso zzso at the tumor site could be a promising approach to prevent zzso zzso
