The influence of specific zzso zzso zzso zzso on growth zzso cell behavior is often difficult to zzso in traditional cell culture due to the random, zzso nature of zzso zzso from zzso We hypothesized that chemically zzso cell culture zzso could be used to study the influence of zzso zzso on human zzso stem cell zzso zzso Specifically, we used zzso zzso zzso zzso chemically modified with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso as stem cell culture zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso in a zzso manner, and zzso zzso binds specifically and in a zzso manner to zzso zzso These zzso zzso enhance zzso proliferation by amplifying zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso and enhance zzso zzso differentiation by amplifying zzso bone zzso protein zzso zzso The effects of zzso are similar to the effects of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is maintained over multiple population zzso on zzso zzso in growth zzso while zzso zzso differentiation is enhanced in a bone zzso zzso manner on the same zzso during culture in zzso induction zzso Together, these observations demonstrate that the influence of the zzso on stem cell zzso is sensitive to the culture medium zzso Our results also demonstrate that enhanced zzso proliferation can be zzso localized by patterning the location of zzso on the zzso zzso the use of chemically zzso zzso in this study eliminated the zzso factor of random, zzso zzso zzso and identified zzso zzso as a key zzso of zzso response to zzso growth zzso
