In peripheral nerve zzso or zzso immature zzso cells expressing zzso play zzso roles in the support and zzso of zzso zzso zzso Hoffman zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Only one of four to six zzso cells participate in zzso of damaged or zzso zzso The rest of the cells, or zzso zzso cells, show severe zzso and gradually decrease in number, zzso a zzso zzso cell relationship zzso G, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Recent reports demonstrated that severely zzso zzso zzso cells are eliminated by zzso during zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Calle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The mechanism to induce selective death of zzso zzso cells without causing any damage to zzso zzso cells or zzso remains to be zzso In this article, we report that zzso the zzso zzso for all members of zzso signals both cell differentiation and zzso through zzso zzso zzso The final response is dependent on the zzso zzso level and zzso cells zzso their response by changing expression level of zzso This effect was selective for nerve growth factor zzso Taken together, the present study suggests that zzso contributes both to zzso regulation and to elimination of the zzso zzso cells, while supporting survival or zzso of certain types of zzso during peripheral nerve repair or zzso
