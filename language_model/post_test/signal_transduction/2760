zzso zzso events that mediate the zzso signal zzso leading to cell zzso are largely zzso Limited evidence suggests the possible involvement of one or more zzso zzso zzso in zzso cellular responses, including zzso However, so far, a zzso responsible for the zzso zzso zzso of cellular zzso has not been identified and the role of the zzso in the zzso zzso remains zzso To examine the roles of zzso and Lyn in zzso signal zzso and zzso zzso we analyzed zzso or zzso zzso B cells along with zzso cells following zzso When zzso B cells were exposed to radiation, the activity of zzso zzso dramatically increased and reached a maximum with zzso zzso zzso (15 zzso and then zzso whereas Lyn zzso activity increased and reached a maximum with a dose of zzso zzso (1 zzso However, an apparent difference was not observed in zzso zzso among zzso zzso and zzso zzso B zzso These results indicate that zzso and Lyn zzso are involved in zzso signal zzso with different zzso In addition, our results revealed that functional zzso of zzso or Lyn alone is not sufficient to prevent zzso zzso Thus, it is suggested that the zzso of zzso or Lyn zzso alone may be sufficient to mediate the zzso zzso in zzso B cells, or both zzso may not be required for this biological zzso
