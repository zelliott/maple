Heart failure is a problem of increasing importance in zzso An important characteristic of heart failure is reduced zzso zzso zzso activity zzso zzso due to both diminished zzso number zzso down zzso and impaired zzso function zzso zzso These changes in the zzso zzso zzso system, may in part account for some of the abnormalities of zzso function in this zzso zzso contraction is closely regulated by zzso coupled zzso receptors through the action of the second zzso zzso The zzso receptors themselves are regulated by a set of specific zzso termed the zzso zzso zzso zzso The study of this complex system in zzso has recently been advanced by the development of transgenic and gene targeted zzso mouse zzso Combining transgenic technology with sophisticated zzso zzso of cardiac zzso is an extremely powerful strategy to study the regulation of zzso zzso in the normal and failing zzso
