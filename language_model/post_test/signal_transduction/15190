There is significant overlap in the genes and pathways that control liver development and those that regulate liver zzso zzso zzso cell expansion, response to injury, and zzso Additionally, defects in liver development may zzso some zzso and zzso liver zzso Thus, studying zzso is important for understanding not only how the liver forms, but also how it zzso zzso work in mice has uncovered a host of zzso factors and signaling molecules that govern the early steps of zzso zzso however, the inherent difficulty of studying zzso in zzso has driven zzso biologists to seek new zzso The rapidly developing zzso zzso is a favorite model for zzso The power of forward genetic screens combined with live real-time imaging of development in transparent zzso zzso has highlighted zzso processes essential for zzso and has uncovered some exciting new zzso This review presents the advantages of zzso for studying liver development, zzso how studies in zzso and mice complement each zzso In addition to their value for studying development, zzso models of zzso and zzso diseases are zzso and using these small, inexpensive zzso for drug screening has become de zzso zzso provide a shared platform for zzso biology and zzso research, offering innovative methods for studying liver development and zzso The story of zzso has something for zzso It involves zzso regulation, zzso interaction, signaling zzso control of cell proliferation and zzso plus zzso processes that zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso to form the multifaceted zzso Decades of research on liver development in mice and other zzso offer valuable lessons in how the zzso zzso is programmed to form a functional zzso Of equal importance are insights that have illuminated the mechanisms by which zzso zzso are activated in a damaged liver, how the adult liver zzso and, zzso the basis for engineering liver cells in zzso for cell transplantation to sustain patients with liver zzso Moreover, processes that are key to liver development are often zzso during zzso zzso reviewing zzso is zzso for both basic and zzso zzso In this review, we bring to light the many advantages offered by the tropical freshwater zzso zzso zzso zzso in studying zzso By comparing zzso and mice, we highlight how work in each system zzso the other and emphasize novel zzso that have been uncovered using zzso Finally, we highlight exciting efforts using zzso to model zzso zzso
