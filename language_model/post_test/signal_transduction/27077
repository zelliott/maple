After a detailed description of early zzso membrane and zzso events in rat zzso zzso collecting duct cells when exposed to zzso a synopsis on organic zzso transport properties, possible trigger mechanisms, and the cellular location of transport pathways is zzso From the data currently available on zzso and zzso cells, it is concluded that zzso zzso of all organic zzso appears to be zzso by transport proteins which share a variety of properties more typical for channels than for zzso A large diversity seems to exist, however, for the zzso zzso Such diversity allows the cells to regulate the zzso concentration of different organic zzso independently of each other, giving flexibility to the spectrum of zzso zzso The site of release also varies from cell to zzso here conservation of organic zzso for future zzso or further metabolism appears to be the major zzso
