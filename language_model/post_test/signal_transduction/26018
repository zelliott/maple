zzso modification zzso of lens proteins is believed to play various roles in age-related lens function and zzso Among the different types of zzso zzso is most noteworthy to play a major role in the regulation of various zzso pathways in relation to zzso processes and cellular zzso The present study reported the quantitative analysis of the in zzso zzso profiles of human normal and zzso zzso with the aim of identifying specific zzso sites which may provide insights into the zzso significance of zzso in relation to cataract zzso 

To improve detection sensitivity of low abundant zzso we first adopted zzso zzso zzso of lens extracts to identify and compare the protein compositions between normal and zzso lenses, followed by zzso zzso enrichment of zzso by immobilized metal affinity zzso zzso and zzso zzso coupled tandem mass zzso zzso zzso 

By zzso screening of the zzso in normal and zzso lenses, we identified 32 zzso and 73 zzso zzso The most abundantly zzso proteins are two zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso was found to be the most abundantly zzso zzso zzso in comparison with zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the lens zzso The quantitative analysis revealed significant and distinct changes of 19 zzso corresponding to 28 zzso sites between these two types of human lenses, including 20 newly discovered novel zzso sites on lens zzso 

The shotgun zzso approach to characterize protein zzso may be adapted and extended to the comprehensive analysis of other types of zzso modification of lens proteins in zzso The identification of these novel zzso sites in lens proteins that showed differential expression in the zzso lens may bear some unknown zzso significance and provide insights into zzso human eye diseases, which warrant further investigation in the zzso
