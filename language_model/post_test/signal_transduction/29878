Previous studies have shown that the zzso apparatus plays an important role in insulin zzso zzso of zzso zzso leads to a decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and insulin zzso Thus, zzso pH could function as a zzso of insulin signaling in zzso In the present study we show that in primary zzso zzso with zzso there is an zzso of zzso zzso zzso of these cells with insulin was followed by an zzso of zzso activity but an zzso of zzso zzso activity and a decrease in zzso DNA and zzso zzso zzso treatment inhibited zzso recycling to the plasma membrane without affecting zzso zzso zzso zzso recycling correlated with a decrease in insulin zzso We suggest that zzso zzso zzso sequesters activated zzso in an zzso zzso where signaling is zzso This implies that zzso zzso trafficking plays a role in regulating signal zzso
