zzso including zzso play an important role in regulating zzso responses in zzso zzso When confronted with an environmental stimulus such as zzso zzso or poor zzso zzso zzso receives and zzso external signals through its nervous system zzso zzso zzso which zzso and translates them into biological zzso Here it is shown that a suppressed zzso zzso level caused by zzso zzso leads to a significant increase zzso in the mean lifespan of adult zzso zzso through zzso zzso factor family O zzso zzso A reduced zzso zzso level was found to be caused by an increased zzso zzso activity at the zzso zzso Our results using zzso zzso zzso with specific deficits in zzso and zzso zzso system suggest a mechanism in that zzso zzso and zzso signaling interact to zzso produce the zzso zzso zzso and zzso causing suppression of the zzso zzso and promoting lifespan zzso Our findings provide not only a new mechanism of zzso induction of longevity in adult zzso zzso but also a possible therapeutic strategy for zzso disease, which has been likened to brain zzso
