Members of the protein zzso C zzso family are shown to positively and zzso regulate zzso zzso Although positive regulatory roles are extensively zzso negative regulatory roles of zzso are poorly zzso We investigated the mechanism and specific zzso involved in zzso negative regulation of zzso functional zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso generation as well as zzso zzso and zzso calcium zzso zzso 2 signaling zzso upstream of zzso zzso Thus, zzso inhibit zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Because the inhibitor of classic zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso generation, we investigated the role of novel class of zzso zzso zzso zzso generation, calcium zzso and zzso zzso were zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso from zzso zzso Interestingly, when zzso release is zzso zzso zzso in zzso knockout and zzso was similar, suggesting that zzso does not affect zzso zzso zzso zzso knockout mice exhibited shorter times to zzso in an zzso zzso injury model and shorter bleeding times in zzso zzso 

We conclude that zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso generation in zzso and offers protection against zzso
