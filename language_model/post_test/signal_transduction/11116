The functional properties of four zzso zzso zzso were compared using zzso zzso based on the protein zzso a zzso Ras zzso zzso 1 and 2, synthetic zzso of zzso 1, were compared to authentic zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso The two zzso were able to activate zzso signaling rapidly in cultured cells and isolated mouse zzso They zzso expression of the T cell zzso marker zzso in human T zzso zzso zzso promptly recruited zzso to cell zzso but they did not induce zzso zzso zzso 1 and compounds 1 and 2 appeared to be less potent than zzso at inducing zzso of mouse zzso a zzso zzso zzso In addition to sharing potential zzso properties with zzso 1, compounds 1 and 2 might be clinically useful as zzso of the immune zzso
