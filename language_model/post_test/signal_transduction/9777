zzso beta zzso zzso zzso and its derivatives have attracted the attention of the scientific community as candidate vaccines for Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso Recent studies suggested that zzso modulated the immune system by inducing zzso zzso cells zzso with reduced zzso zzso However, it remains elusive how zzso impacts zzso zzso We therefore investigated the zzso by short zzso peptides of zzso from zzso zzso Two new zzso a tandem repeat of zzso zzso sequences with or without an addition of a zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso presenting function and producing zzso were zzso Both peptides increased zzso of immature zzso and zzso II zzso zzso T cell zzso in zzso zzso In addition, they exhibited decreased production of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Overall, the two peptides demonstrated strong zzso but did not stimulate zzso zzso These results support the use of short zzso zzso in zzso zzso
