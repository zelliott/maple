In the nervous system, a perfect balance of zzso and zzso is required, for example, to enable coordinated zzso In zzso zzso zzso and zzso motor zzso zzso effect waves of zzso muscle contraction and zzso zzso zzso zzso muscle as well as zzso zzso projecting to the opposite side of the body, at zzso zzso Only a few connections exist from zzso to zzso zzso emphasizing that zzso signaling is mainly directed toward zzso Yet, a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso was shown to affect zzso likely by feedback zzso of zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso In the present study, we examined whether the zzso zzso could also affect short-term plasticity in zzso zzso with the use of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso contributes to acute body relaxation, evoked by zzso of zzso zzso and to effects of zzso on locomotion zzso Loss of the plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso as well as acute zzso zzso release, affected zzso MN function in opposite zzso zzso stimulation of zzso zzso had subtle effects on zzso zzso depending on stimulus duration and zzso Thus zzso receptors serve mainly for linear feedback zzso of zzso zzso but also evoke minor plastic zzso
