zzso excess can cause toxicity symptoms, zzso root growth zzso in zzso plants such as zzso zzso hormonal and zzso mechanisms in the course of development are poorly understood; therefore this study set out to investigate the possible hormonal and zzso processes using transgenic and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed in the root architecture of the zzso plants, due to the loss of cell viability in the root zzso During mild zzso zzso the plants showed symptoms of the zzso response: primary root zzso zzso and increased initiation of zzso ensuring better zzso and water zzso and stress zzso As well as lower zzso cell activity, the second reason for the zzso growth hindrance is the hormonal zzso since the in zzso expression of the zzso zzso and consequently the zzso levels, significantly zzso while that of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso It is assumed that zzso and zzso might positively regulate zzso zzso since reduced levels of them resulted in zzso Moreover, high zzso levels caused notable zzso zzso During early zzso development, zzso oxide zzso contents decreased but hydrogen zzso levels increased reflecting the antagonism between the two signal molecules during zzso zzso High levels of NO in zzso lead to zzso zzso while low NO production in zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso NO derived from the root nitrate zzso activity is responsible for the large-scale zzso tolerance in zzso
