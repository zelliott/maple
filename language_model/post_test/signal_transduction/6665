Nine distinct alpha zzso of zzso zzso binding proteins zzso have now been identified by zzso zzso Each of these functions to allow zzso of information between zzso receptors in the plasma membrane and zzso systems which are either zzso channels or zzso which regulate the zzso concentration of second zzso As the individual zzso are highly similar in primary zzso it is pertinent to ask what degree of specificity of interaction each of these display with the various receptors and zzso zzso zzso of tissue location defines that the rod and cone zzso zzso and zzso zzso act as the zzso proteins between zzso and cone zzso and their zzso zzso zzso zzso and that zzso is the zzso which zzso signals from zzso receptors to zzso zzso in zzso sensory zzso However, many of the other identified zzso are zzso in a single tissue or zzso zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso by bacterial toxins from zzso zzso and zzso zzso has allowed a further subdivision of the zzso family, this approach is limited as these toxins have multiple zzso zzso As the extreme zzso of the alpha zzso of each zzso appears to be a key domain for the interactions of receptors and zzso we have generated a series of zzso zzso zzso against this region and then have used these zzso to attempt to interfere with zzso zzso With this approach we have been able to demonstrate that a delta zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso is zzso specifically by zzso and in the same cell that alpha 2 zzso zzso of zzso currents is zzso by zzso Similar strategies are likely to be of universal significance, for example in the identification of the zzso zzso which regulates the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to allow pharmacological manipulation of the levels of expression of various zzso in the zzso of cells are also zzso Such approaches are also likely to assist in the identification of zzso of defined zzso
