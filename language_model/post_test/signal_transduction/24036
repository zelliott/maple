zzso proteins regulate the zzso of zzso zzso target zzso zzso studies in mouse have shown that zzso is not essential for zzso whereas zzso acts as an zzso of zzso target zzso In contrast, zzso studies in zzso and cultured cells have suggested that zzso can act as an zzso of zzso zzso whereas zzso might function as a zzso of a subset of zzso zzso To clarify the roles of zzso genes during zzso development, we have analyzed the requirements for zzso and zzso during zzso zzso We report that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso In contrast to mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso injected with zzso zzso zzso zzso display defects in the zzso of zzso target genes in the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso truncated zzso We find that these truncated proteins act as dominant zzso of zzso zzso in part by blocking zzso zzso In contrast, blocking zzso function by eliminating full-length zzso results in minor zzso signaling defects and zzso a zzso function of zzso in the zzso In addition, we find that zzso and zzso have zzso functions during zzso and neural zzso These results reveal divergent requirements for zzso and zzso in mouse and zzso and indicate that zzso zzso is an zzso of zzso zzso while zzso zzso has minor roles as a zzso or zzso of zzso zzso
