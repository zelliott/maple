The zzso zzso is involved in diverse signal zzso including the initiation of the rapid release and processing of zzso zzso the induction of zzso zzso and zzso factor zzso zzso we investigated whether blocking the zzso zzso would prevent the zzso death induced by status zzso zzso 

We performed seizure induction and drug zzso After tissue processing, we executed zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 1 : zzso zzso zzso MA, USA rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 : zzso zzso 

In control animals, zzso zzso zzso zzso had small cell bodies with thin zzso zzso Seven days after SE, zzso zzso zzso in zzso was significantly elevated in the zzso zzso and the zzso appeared zzso or zzso At this point, loss of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso was even more zzso indicating that the network of zzso was disrupted and a large empty zone was zzso Treatment with zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso 20 and 200 zzso zzso zzso zzso but not completely, inhibited zzso zzso following zzso The zzso of zzso was similar to that of the zzso in that they appeared zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso treatments effectively prevented zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso death induced by zzso zzso zzso may be an important zzso zzso in zzso
