Class zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been implicated in the regulation of several cellular processes including cell division, cell survival and protein zzso The size of zzso zzso discs zzso structures that give rise to adult zzso is maintained by factors that can compensate for zzso induced changes in these zzso zzso zzso zzso of the gene zzso the zzso class zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso discs, however, results in enlarged adult zzso These observations have led us to investigate the role of zzso and its zzso zzso in the control of zzso disc cell size, cell number and organ zzso 

zzso zzso in zzso and zzso were generated and used to demonstrate that they are essential genes that are autonomously required for zzso disc cells to achieve their normal adult zzso In addition, modulating zzso activity increases or reduces cell size in the developing zzso disc, and does so throughout the cell zzso The zzso of zzso activity reduces the rate of increase in cell number in the zzso discs, suggesting that zzso normally promotes cell division and/or cell zzso Unlike direct manipulation of zzso zzso manipulation of zzso activity in one compartment of the disc influences the size of that compartment and the size of the disc as a zzso 

We conclude that during zzso disc development, zzso and zzso regulate cell size, cell number and organ zzso Our results indicate that zzso and zzso zzso can affect growth in multiple ways, which has important implications for the function of zzso through class zzso zzso zzso
