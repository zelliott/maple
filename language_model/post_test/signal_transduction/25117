Signal zzso processes regulating zzso production in the zzso trout zzso organ were investigated by zzso and zzso demonstration of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and calcium zzso zzso levels were tightly controlled by light and zzso zzso of zzso zzso levels by zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased the levels of zzso and zzso in zzso or zzso zzso zzso in zzso Without pharmacological treatment, the levels of zzso and zzso zzso remained constant for several hours before and after light zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibitor I did not prevent the zzso zzso suppression of zzso zzso However, changes in the zzso calcium concentration by drugs affecting zzso calcium channels of the L type and zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso Bay K zzso had dramatic effects on the zzso zzso changes in zzso zzso These effects were not accompanied by changes in zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso changes in zzso levels in the trout zzso organ are regulated apparently by a novel calcium signaling zzso and do not involve changes in zzso zzso levels, zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso
