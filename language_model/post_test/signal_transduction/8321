In the past few years, accumulating evidence in the literature supports the existence of pathways of zzso programmed cell death zzso These pathways are likely to be acting as zzso backup zzso that ensure effective removal of defective cells from the zzso Similar to classical zzso zzso zzso programmed cell death zzso the zzso is the main zzso orchestrating the series of events which are required for the induction of zzso In addition, the zzso proteins zzso and Bid are also key participants in zzso However, contrary to zzso zzso involves executioners other than the zzso which include the zzso the zzso and zzso zzso The protein zzso may also play an important role in the induction of zzso In this review we report current knowledge on zzso and provide evidence for its regulation by zzso agents currently used in the clinic and under investigation in clinical zzso Lastly, we discuss how the study of natural and synthetic agents triggering zzso may help in the pharmacological design of a new generation of more effective zzso zzso The use of such drugs zzso both zzso and zzso pathways should achieve a more successful zzso of zzso cells and the zzso of lower levels of tumor zzso
