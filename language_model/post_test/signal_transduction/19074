Members of both zzso and bone zzso protein zzso families of signaling molecules are important in heart zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso a key downstream zzso of the zzso zzso signaling pathway, zzso the zzso boundary of the cardiac compartments in an zzso zzso We hypothesized the progression involves zzso zzso signaling and reflects development of the primary body axis of the zzso A similar zzso signaling wave leading to cardiac cell zzso involves zzso signaling by zzso zzso by the underlying zzso in anterior bilateral zzso Any zzso that zzso the normal balance of zzso and zzso zzso within the heart field may be expected to affect early heart zzso The zzso zzso signaling step zzso by zzso involves zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Klein and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that lithium, zzso and an inhibitor of zzso zzso affect early heart development at the cardiac zzso zzso We demonstrate that normal expression patterns of key signaling molecules as zzso and zzso are altered in the anterior zzso within the heart fields by a one-time exposure to lithium, or by zzso zzso of zzso at zzso and Hamilton zzso stage 3 during chick embryonic zzso The severity of zzso defects is greatest with exposure to zzso or zzso at zzso stage 3 and decreases at zzso stage zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that there are zzso responses and differential sensitivities to zzso exposure during early heart zzso
