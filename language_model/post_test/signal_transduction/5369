zzso and zzso T cells play an important role in zzso responses in multiple sclerosis and the model system experimental zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso in the periphery and zzso in the zzso are responsible for zzso polarization and expansion of this T cell zzso Our results indicate that in zzso administration of a signal zzso inhibitor that targets zzso to mice with zzso led to a decrease in zzso zzso of zzso zzso T zzso Since this approach does not target T cells directly, we assessed the effects on the zzso that are involved in generating the T cell zzso Since in zzso and multiple zzso both zzso and peripheral zzso are likely to contribute to disease, we zzso a bone zzso zzso system to distinguish between these two zzso These studies show that peripheral zzso are the primary target but that zzso are also modestly affected by zzso as numbers and zzso states of the cells in the zzso are decreased after zzso Our results also showed a decrease in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso as well as a decrease in expression of zzso zzso We further determined that levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are signaling molecules that have been implicated in these zzso were zzso Thus, use of this class of signal zzso zzso may represent a novel method to treat zzso by zzso the zzso polarizing condition driven by zzso
