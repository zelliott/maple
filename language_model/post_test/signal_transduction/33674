zzso a member of the zzso protein zzso zzso is activated by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in response to environmental zzso In the present study, the effects of zzso treatment on zzso zzso and zzso expression were examined in mouse embryonic stem zzso cells lacking the zzso zzso the zzso zzso or zzso Following zzso exposure, the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was suppressed in zzso zzso zzso When zzso or zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso of either zzso or zzso was markedly reduced, while a weak reduction in zzso zzso was observed in zzso zzso Thus, both zzso and zzso are required for zzso zzso whereas their role in zzso and zzso zzso could overlap with that of another zzso We also observed that zzso zzso expression was abolished in zzso zzso cells, was reduced in zzso cells, and was enhanced in zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso of heat shock factor 1 zzso was decreased in zzso zzso and zzso cells, but was increased in zzso zzso zzso with zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso or zzso resulted in further zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso expression is zzso by zzso and zzso by zzso through distinct zzso zzso in mouse zzso cells treated with zzso
