The ability of cells to survive freezing and zzso is expected to depend on the zzso conditions experienced prior to zzso We examined factors affecting zzso cell survival during zzso stress, including those associated with growth phase, requirement for zzso functions, and prior stress zzso and the role played by relevant signal zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was frozen at zzso degrees C for 2 h zzso rate, less than 4 degrees C zzso and thawed on ice for 40 zzso zzso occurred without reducing cell survival and was followed by zzso Loss of viability was zzso to the freezing zzso indicating that freezing is the main zzso of zzso zzso Regardless of the carbon source used, the zzso strain and an zzso petite zzso zzso zzso showed the same pattern of zzso tolerance throughout growth, zzso high resistance during lag phase and low resistance during log phase, indicating that the response to zzso stress is growth phase specific and not controlled by zzso zzso In addition, respiratory ability and functional zzso are necessary to zzso full resistance to zzso zzso Both nitrogen and carbon source zzso led to zzso zzso The use of strains affected in the zzso zzso zzso zzso or supplementation of an zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso with zzso showed that the zzso response of zzso is under the control of the zzso zzso zzso did not adapt to zzso stress following repeated zzso treatment with or without a recovery period between zzso cycles, nor could it adapt following zzso by cold zzso However, zzso tolerance of zzso cells was induced during zzso and respiratory growth by zzso with zzso zzso mild heat zzso or zzso indicating that cross protection between zzso stress and a limited number of other types of stress zzso
