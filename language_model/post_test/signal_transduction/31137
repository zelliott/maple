zzso in breast cancer 1 zzso is a member of the zzso family of nuclear zzso zzso zzso Recent studies have reported that high-level zzso production is involved in the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso for progression to zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that, in zzso zzso chicken zzso loss of zzso results in induction of zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in addition to the zzso of DNA zzso In contrast, high-level zzso production prevents zzso zzso of the zzso signal zzso zzso and zzso DNA replication through zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso under cellular stresses such as zzso zzso or serum zzso Moreover, we have found that zzso is essential for the zzso of zzso zzso at zzso 10, which is associated with the signal zzso to zzso leading to the transient expression of zzso genes in response to zzso zzso Our results therefore suggest that zzso directly links to cell cycle control mechanisms in concern with the balance between zzso and zzso
