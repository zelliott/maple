zzso zzso tumors zzso are a family of primary zzso brain tumors that include zzso Although genetic models of a subset of zzso are documented over the past decade, the molecular basis of other zzso of zzso remains zzso As elevated zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling and dysfunction of zzso are seen in human zzso we investigated what role these abnormalities have in the formation of zzso zzso these zzso we generated zzso zzso zzso in mice using zzso cell gene zzso We show that zzso arise from zzso cells by forced zzso expression combined with zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes tumor progression and zzso divergent zzso These zzso zzso are zzso similar to large zzso zzso and can occur in both zzso and zzso Furthermore, we have obtained one zzso with marked zzso differentiation having zzso resemblance to zzso zzso zzso in this zzso Our results in mice suggest that zzso with varied differentiation and large zzso zzso may be two tumor groups with similar genetic zzso These data provide insights into the biology and zzso of human zzso and suggest that multiple tumor types or zzso can be generated from a fixed set of genetic zzso
