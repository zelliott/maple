In this study, we investigated the expression and distribution of zzso zzso receptors zzso and the different signaling pathways associated with zzso zzso in zzso isolated from adult and zzso zzso zzso stimulation of zzso in both zzso and adult rat zzso led to a negative zzso response with zzso of zzso zzso an increase in zzso zzso levels, and a decrease in zzso zzso zzso However, compared with adult zzso zzso zzso showed hypersensitivity in the zzso effect induced by zzso zzso analysis with zzso zzso indicated that zzso and zzso zzso zzso are important zzso of the response to zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, in adult zzso the effect of the zzso was coupled only to the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, an increased number of total zzso was labeled in zzso zzso zzso compared with those of zzso Although a zzso zzso zzso population is expressed in zzso at both stages of development zzso competition binding parameters calculated for zzso indicated the presence of zzso binding sites, with higher affinity in zzso than in zzso These results suggest that the differences observed between zzso and adult zzso in their response to a zzso zzso may be related to differential expression of zzso zzso and/or changes in functional zzso of zzso zzso during zzso
