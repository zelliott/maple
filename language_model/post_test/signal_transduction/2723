zzso and zzso proteins are involved in running the cell zzso zzso spikes and signals from zzso focal zzso complexes and zzso receptors on the cell surface along with zzso zzso begin the cycle of zzso protein zzso zzso These zzso expressed zzso stimulate the coordinate expression of zzso zzso activate replication zzso zzso replication zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activate the zzso complexes at the end of the zzso zzso and when replication is complete they and a zzso spike trigger zzso zzso Another zzso surge at the end of zzso triggers the destruction of the zzso zzso and starts zzso zzso finally stimulates zzso division zzso However, zzso does more than this in zzso cells, such as those lining the zzso and skin zzso These cells also need zzso zzso signals, and only a small amount zzso zzso zzso of external zzso to start DNA zzso zzso from their surface zzso receptors trigger a combination of differentiation and zzso zzso when external zzso concentration reaches their zzso The zzso steep, zzso directed, zzso zzso has a low concentration in the zzso layer to allow stem and precursor zzso to zzso and higher zzso in the zzso layers to trigger the zzso zzso mechanism that converts zzso cells into zzso zzso dead zzso A similar zzso zzso may exist in the colon zzso allowing the stem cell and its amplifying transit or precursor offspring to cycle in the lower parts of the zzso while stopping proliferation and stimulating terminal differentiation in the upper zzso and flat zzso Raising the amount of zzso in zzso water above a critical level reduces proliferation and thus zzso zzso in normal rats and some high-risk zzso But during zzso the zzso sensors malfunction or their signals become zzso high zzso does not stop, and may even zzso the proliferation of initiated zzso zzso zzso may either not zzso or even zzso the growth of zzso cells in zzso rat colon and human zzso zzso Clearly, a much greater understanding of how zzso controls the proliferation and differentiation of zzso cells and why initiated cells lose their responsiveness to zzso are needed to assess the drawbacks and advantages of using zzso as a zzso
