It is thought that the zzso expression of the zzso genes zzso and zzso control the subdivision of the growing wing zzso disc of zzso into anterior and zzso lineage zzso At present, the cellular mechanisms by which separate lineage compartments are maintained are not zzso Most models have assumed that the presence or absence of zzso gene expression autonomously drives the expression of zzso zzso or recognition molecules that inhibit zzso between zzso However, our present understanding of zzso zzso from zzso to anterior cells raises some interesting alternative models based on a cell's response to zzso We show here that anterior cells that lack zzso and thus the ability to receive the zzso zzso no longer obey a lineage restriction in the normal position of the zzso zzso Rather these clones extend into zzso zzso territory, without any changes in zzso gene zzso We have also examined clones lacking both en and zzso these too show complex behaviors near the normal site of the compartment boundary, and do not always cross entirely into zzso anterior zzso Our results suggest that zzso is a complex process involving zzso zzso models based on changes in affinity or growth will be zzso
