To zzso a role of zzso in breast cancer, the expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in 50 clinical breast cancer specimens using zzso zzso was highly expressed in a subset of breast cancer with zzso zzso We then zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso and zzso its cancer stem zzso features after zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells increased the percentage of zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso and led to increased cancer cell zzso zzso zzso growth, and the zzso of zzso grown in zzso In addition, zzso zzso cancer cells were more drug zzso Further studies suggested zzso zzso of the zzso zzso may play a role in these zzso zzso zzso confirmed that zzso could directly bind to zzso In clinical breast cancer zzso the expression level of zzso was also found to positively correlate with the expression level of zzso Our results suggest that zzso might serve as a tumor initiating zzso factor in breast zzso
