zzso infection in humans evokes a potent zzso zzso response, which is important for clearance of the virus but may also exacerbate pulmonary zzso We have previously shown in mice that zzso zzso expression of zzso is required for severe and lethal lung injury following recognition of an influenza zzso expressed by zzso zzso zzso Since zzso is first expressed as a zzso protein that is then zzso processed to release a soluble form, we sought to characterize the role of zzso processing in zzso zzso zzso In this study we observed that zzso of zzso processing of zzso by zzso T cells significantly attenuated the diffuse zzso damage that occurs after zzso transfer, resulting in enhanced zzso This was due in part to diminished zzso zzso as zzso processing was required for lung zzso cell expression of zzso and the subsequent inflammatory zzso We confirmed the importance of zzso expression in acute lung injury by transferring zzso zzso T cells into transgenic mice lacking zzso These mice exhibited reduced airway zzso attenuated lung injury, and enhanced zzso zzso studies describe a critical role for zzso processing by zzso T cells in the initiation and severity of acute lung injury, which may have important implications for limiting zzso during influenza infection and other human infectious or inflammatory zzso
