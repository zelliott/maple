Changes in the structure and function of zzso spines contribute to numerous zzso processes such as synaptic transmission and zzso as well as behavior, including learning and zzso Moreover, altered zzso spine zzso and plasticity is an zzso of many zzso and zzso zzso zzso the molecular mechanisms that control spine plasticity and pathology have been under intense investigation over the past few zzso A series of recent studies has improved our understanding of spine dynamics by establishing zzso as an important regulator of zzso spine development as well as structural and functional zzso providing a model for the molecular control of structural plasticity and implicating zzso in synaptic pathology in several disorders including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's zzso
