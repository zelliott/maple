Upon a wide range of cellular zzso zzso is activated and zzso zzso transformation through the zzso regulation of its target genes related to zzso cell cycle arrest, and DNA zzso However, its involvement in zzso modifications of proteins has not yet been well zzso Here, we report the novel role of zzso in the regulation of protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type 4 zzso through an zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes an zzso catalyzing the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso expression of zzso or zzso induced protein zzso In addition, various proteins were zzso in response to DNA damage, but zzso of zzso or zzso remarkably inhibited their zzso indicating the regulation of protein zzso in a zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso 197 zzso in zzso under zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso resulted in its zzso from the zzso to the zzso whereas zzso did not alter the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso expression of zzso inhibited tumor cell growth, and zzso the zzso of zzso attenuated zzso zzso activity, demonstrating the significance of zzso protein zzso in the zzso signaling zzso
