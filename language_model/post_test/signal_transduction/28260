The influence of hormones on plant growth and development has been clearly documented over the past 50 zzso Now, with molecular zzso the genes that convert changes in hormone levels into a cellular response are beginning to be zzso However, recent studies have demonstrated that the zzso context in which the hormones act plays a large influence on their synthesis and zzso In this review, examples are given where known hormone response genes have been shown to have broader zzso roles as well as examples where genes that regulate zzso decisions, such as differentiation and fate, also influence hormone zzso The early conclusion of these studies is that an understanding of hormone signal zzso cannot be achieved in the absence of a zzso zzso
