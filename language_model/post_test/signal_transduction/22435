zzso results from an overwhelming response to infection and is a major contributor to death in intensive care units zzso In recent years, we and others have shown that zzso functionality is impaired in zzso This zzso with zzso severity and contributes to zzso of zzso by zzso bacterial zzso zzso oxide zzso is a major contributor to the impairment of zzso function in zzso However, attempts to inhibit NO synthesis in zzso resulted in increased death despite restoring zzso zzso This could be in part attributed to a reduction of the zzso zzso activity of zzso In zzso the beneficial effects resulting from the zzso of soluble zzso zzso zzso a downstream target of zzso have long been appreciated but poorly zzso However, the effects of zzso zzso on zzso function in zzso have never been zzso In the present study, we show that zzso zzso in human zzso leads to decreased zzso which correlated with zzso zzso zzso and increased G zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso in a process involving the zzso zzso G zzso We also demonstrate that zzso of zzso activity increased survival in a zzso model of zzso which was paralleled by restored zzso migratory function and increased bacterial zzso Finally, the beneficial effect of zzso zzso could also be demonstrated in mice treated after the onset of zzso Our results suggest that the beneficial effects of zzso zzso in zzso could be at least in part attributed to a recovery of zzso zzso
