zzso zzso plays a critical role in zzso proliferation and zzso Using various cultured cell lines, several recent studies have implicated the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso In the study reported here, we examined the role played by zzso zzso activity in a zzso cell line zzso and in primary zzso zzso In both systems, zzso zzso protein zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso zzso was rapidly induced by zzso zzso To identify the zzso domain responsible for zzso zzso zzso cells expressing truncated forms of the zzso zzso were zzso zzso of zzso did not require elements of the zzso signaling domain zzso to Box 2 and was not dependent on zzso of the adapter protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso was zzso at 10 minutes and was markedly decreased over the subsequent 3 zzso Next, the zzso consequences of zzso zzso were zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blockade of zzso activity substantially reduced zzso proliferation in zzso cells and markedly decreased mean zzso zzso in zzso To exclude an indirect effect of zzso zzso on zzso cells in whole bone zzso zzso cells were selected and then cultured in zzso The number of zzso zzso derived from the zzso cells was also significantly reduced by zzso zzso as was their geometric mean zzso These studies show an important role for zzso in zzso zzso and underscore the value of primary cells when studying the zzso effects of signaling zzso
