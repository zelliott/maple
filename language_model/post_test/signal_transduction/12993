Multiple zzso are induced in the primitive embryonic zzso excised from zzso stage zzso zzso zzso under the strict control of zzso inducing zzso This in zzso system is useful for exploring the mechanisms of zzso In this study, the function of zzso zzso signaling in the development of zzso cells was zzso An optimal zzso cell induction system was established to evaluate the influence of growth factors on zzso It was found that zzso zzso enhanced zzso in zzso induced by zzso and bone zzso protein zzso and increased the number of both zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso completely inhibited the expansion of zzso cells zzso by zzso and the zzso specifically recognized zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso acts on zzso zzso induced in zzso and the zzso zzso in zzso mediates the cellular function of zzso We also found that forced expression of zzso in zzso promoted zzso in the zzso blood island and the zzso lateral plate zzso These results suggest that zzso stem and zzso cells are regulated by zzso signaling from when they appear in their zzso They also suggest that zzso signaling play a crucial role in the formation of zzso cells in zzso
