zzso zzso is an attractive guidance zzso for cortical zzso zzso To zzso the role of zzso in zzso zzso formation, we examined the zzso expression pattern in the zzso zzso formation and analyzed zzso zzso of the brains from young adult zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was predominantly expressed in the zzso plate and the inner marginal zone at the initial period of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso components for zzso were also localized in the same zzso The zzso zzso method revealed that in zzso mice more than zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso extended a single trunk or zzso trunks zzso in stratum zzso Seven percent of the zzso zzso showed zzso zzso of zzso trunks in stratum zzso or at the border of the stratum zzso and stratum zzso In zzso zzso mice, zzso zzso zzso zzso were increased to zzso while the single zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso We designate this zzso in zzso zzso mice as zzso zzso In the zzso culture system, approximately half of the zzso zzso from zzso mice resembled zzso zzso which possess a long, thick, and tapered zzso In contrast, only zzso of the zzso from zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was also increased in the zzso mice of zzso an zzso of zzso zzso 5 zzso Thus, zzso may facilitate the initial growth of zzso zzso zzso via the zzso of zzso which may in turn signal zzso zzso
