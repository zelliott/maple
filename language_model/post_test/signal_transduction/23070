To zzso the roles of zzso we generated transgenic zzso mice expressing a dominant negative zzso lacking protein zzso zzso domain zzso On examining two lines of zzso mice identified by Southern zzso the zzso product was expressed in skeletal muscle, liver, and zzso zzso and zzso association of insulin zzso zzso 1 with zzso zzso was zzso confirming that zzso has a dominant negative zzso The zzso zzso loading test demonstrated an increase in blood zzso levels in zzso zzso Plasma insulin levels in zzso mice after 4 h zzso were 3 times greater with comparable blood zzso zzso To estimate insulin sensitivity by a constant zzso insulin, and zzso infusion, steady state blood zzso levels were higher, suggesting the presence of insulin zzso Furthermore, we observed the impairment of zzso zzso zzso in muscle and zzso in the presence of zzso zzso of zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of insulin zzso zzso and stimulation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities by insulin were attenuated in muscle and zzso These results indicate that the zzso of zzso zzso function by the zzso of a dominant negative zzso may lead to impaired insulin sensitivity of zzso zzso and thus zzso may function to zzso insulin signaling in target zzso
