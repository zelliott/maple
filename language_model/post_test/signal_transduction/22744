The involvement of zzso in various aspects of zzso zzso cells functions has been extensively zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso types expressed in zzso cells, of any species, are not yet zzso The present study was undertaken to identify zzso types present in bovine zzso cells and their regulation by various zzso zzso zzso 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 were detected in the bovine brain by Northern zzso analysis, whereas the bovine corpus zzso zzso only expressed zzso and 6 zzso with zzso being more abundant than zzso The use of zzso zzso in zzso reaction verified the presence of zzso zzso in both bovine and rat zzso tissue as well as in bovine zzso zzso zzso Because these two zzso zzso zzso and 6, exhibit distinct regulatory patterns we have next examined the effects of various signaling pathways on zzso activity in zzso zzso These studies have shown that: 1) zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso markedly elevated zzso zzso synthesis zzso effects were inhibited by addition of highly specific zzso zzso zzso 2) depletion of zzso from the incubation medium inhibited zzso zzso 3) zzso zzso of zzso zzso (up to 5 zzso significantly zzso zzso production in zzso zzso and 4) the effects of zzso on zzso synthesis were evident only in the presence of zzso These regulatory characteristics of zzso activity are consistent with the molecular identification of zzso indicating the presence of zzso in zzso zzso The reported data may delineate the zzso between zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso (such as zzso zzso and zzso and other zzso (such as zzso and zzso which indirectly zzso zzso zzso zzso the identification of zzso zzso present in zzso cells is an important step toward understanding the mode of action of a wide array of hormones regulating zzso zzso
