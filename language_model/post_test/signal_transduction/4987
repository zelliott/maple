zzso A zzso zzso zzso is thought to be a zzso disease with active destruction of liver zzso zzso zzso is a zzso produced principally by zzso T zzso However, whether zzso zzso zzso responses are involved in zzso Con zzso liver injury remains zzso In this study, we found that zzso expression was highly elevated in liver zzso during Con zzso zzso The increased levels of zzso were paralleled with the severity of liver injury reflected by zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as the zzso of tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso zzso of zzso significantly ameliorated Con zzso zzso while zzso of zzso zzso resulted in massive zzso necrosis in zzso Furthermore, zzso of an zzso zzso zzso fusion protein significantly attenuated liver inflammation after acute Con A zzso High expression of zzso on zzso cells was also observed along with the production of zzso including zzso and zzso zzso of zzso cells by zzso zzso completely prevented Con zzso liver injury and zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso T and natural killer T cells were greatly increased in Con zzso mice compared with that in zzso Overall, our results indicate that zzso signaling is critically involved in the zzso in Con zzso zzso and blockade of zzso signaling zzso may represent a novel therapeutic intervention in human zzso zzso
