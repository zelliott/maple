The zzso zzso is in direct contact with the zzso fluid and has tight zzso The zzso tight junctions function as a barrier to restrict fluid flux via the zzso membrane during zzso in the zzso However, during late pregnancy, zzso fluid volume significantly decreases in association with the disruption of zzso tight zzso The disruption of zzso tight junctions is caused by zzso in the zzso zzso on zzso Day 17 zzso In this study, we examine the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso We found that from zzso the number of activated zzso that express high levels of zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso was zzso from zzso zzso On zzso zzso zzso cells expressing zzso became zzso positive, suggesting that zzso signaling may initiate zzso To further confirm the role of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso was injected into the zzso cavity and was found to significantly reduce the numbers of zzso cells in the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso a specific nuclear zzso B zzso was found to inhibit zzso production in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Finally, we showed that injection of zzso into the zzso cavity zzso early onset of zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso is induced by the zzso zzso via zzso expressed in the zzso zzso cells and that zzso of zzso may trigger zzso zzso
