The wide use of zzso and zzso in zzso clinical treatment makes it necessary to find zzso for identifying patients who can benefit from zzso or zzso In present study, zzso a zzso cell line with different sensitivity to zzso and zzso was applied to DNA zzso expression profiling analysis at different time points of lower dose treatment with zzso or zzso And the complex signaling pathways regulating the drug response were identified, and several novel zzso markers were zzso dynamic changes of responding genes showed that zzso effect is acute but that of zzso is durable at least for 48 hours in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the genes with altered expression showed that zzso responding to these two drugs were dramatically zzso Gene expression changes induced by zzso treatment were mainly enriched in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and focal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso while the expression zzso responding to zzso were highly zzso to cell surface zzso linked signal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso interaction zzso and zzso and cell cycle regulation zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, we also confirmed some different expression patterns with real time zzso Our study will provide the potential zzso for zzso and zzso therapy in clinical zzso
