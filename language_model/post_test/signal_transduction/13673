Growing evidence suggests that the zzso of the zzso system contributes to depression zzso a hypothesis that might hold strong clinical zzso zzso more than zzso of depressed patients fail to achieve zzso which poses the necessity to identify systems that may represent novel targets for zzso zzso goal of this study was to evaluate the ability of the zzso zzso to zzso specific components of the immune response in the rat brain following an inflammatory challenge with zzso zzso To this aim, adult male rats were chronically treated with zzso before being acutely challenged with zzso 16 h after the last drug zzso zzso were sacrificed 2, 6, or zzso after the challenge and several components of the inflammatory response have been investigated by using real-time zzso or zzso We found that zzso significantly reduced the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the rat brain as well as at peripheral zzso At central level, these effects are associated to the zzso of zzso zzso as well as to zzso of mechanisms responsible for zzso zzso In addition, we found that zzso was also able to alter the expression of zzso related to the zzso zzso that are thought to represent important zzso to zzso zzso These data disclose novel properties that may contribute to the therapeutic effect of zzso providing evidence for a crucial role of specific components of the zzso system in the zzso response and thereby in depression zzso
