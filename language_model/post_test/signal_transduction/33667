zzso transport proteins of the zzso family include microbial and plant zzso members, crucial for ammonium zzso and animal zzso factors likely involved in ammonium zzso Recent structural information on two bacterial zzso proteins has revealed the presence, in the zzso conducting zzso of a pair of preserved zzso proposed to play an important role in zzso zzso by participating either in zzso zzso or in shaping the zzso Here we highlight the existence of two functional zzso zzso distinguishable according to whether the first of these zzso is zzso as in zzso zzso or replaced by zzso as in zzso Replacement of the native zzso of zzso with zzso leads to conversion from zzso to zzso zzso This includes a zzso zzso of the optimal pH for transport and an increase of the transport rate, consistent with zzso of an zzso zzso Similar effects are observed when the same substitution is introduced into the zzso coli zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso is proposed to play an additional signaling role in the induction of zzso growth, a zzso change often associated with zzso in zzso zzso We show here that the zzso to zzso substitution in zzso leads to zzso of the transport and sensor functions, suggesting that a zzso transport mechanism might be responsible for zzso Our overall data suggest the existence of two functional groups of zzso proteins with different transport mechanisms and distinct impacts on cell physiology and zzso
