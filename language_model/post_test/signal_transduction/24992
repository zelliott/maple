zzso of the zzso family regulate zzso zzso in response to zzso stimulation and are involved in the establishment and maintenance of zzso cell zzso We recently showed that zzso is able to zzso zzso activity and that the zzso balance between zzso and zzso activity is a major zzso of cellular zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Using zzso pull-down zzso we analyzed the effect of transient and sustained zzso Ras signaling on the zzso state of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso of zzso by growth zzso Ras zzso we found that sustained signaling by zzso zzso permanently zzso zzso activity, which leads to zzso of zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso Ras decreases zzso activity through sustained zzso zzso zzso which causes zzso zzso of zzso an zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity by expression of zzso or zzso leads to zzso of zzso activity and restores an zzso zzso in zzso zzso or zzso zzso The present data reveal a novel mechanism by which zzso Ras is able to interfere with the balance between zzso and zzso activity to achieve zzso transformation of zzso zzso
