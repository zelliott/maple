zzso immunity is the earliest response to invading microbes and acts to contain infection in the first minutes to hours of zzso Unlike zzso immunity that relies upon zzso expansion of cells that emerge days after zzso challenge, the innate immune response is zzso zzso zzso including complement components and the zzso binding zzso zzso make an important contribution to innate immune protection and work along with zzso zzso cellular defenses such as zzso and zzso receptors that trigger zzso signaling zzso These four aspects of the innate immune system act in concert to protect from pathogen zzso Our work has focused on understanding the protection provided by this complex defense system and, as discussed in this review, the particular contribution of soluble zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso Over the past two decades both human zzso data and mouse models have indicated that zzso plays a critical role in innate immune protection against a number of zzso As demonstrated by our recent in zzso work, we show that zzso and the innate immune signaling triggered by the zzso zzso receptors zzso the zzso receptors zzso are linked by their spatial zzso to the zzso These observations demonstrated a novel role for zzso as a zzso zzso and establishes a new paradigm for the role of zzso which we propose to function not only to increase microbial zzso but also to zzso zzso amplify, and zzso innate immune defenses zzso In this review we discuss both the attributes of zzso that make it a unique soluble pattern recognition zzso and also highlight its broader role in zzso innate immune zzso
