Although zzso and zzso T cells play roles in the zzso of fixed drug zzso zzso not much is known about zzso death and its precise mechanism in zzso 

Our aim is to zzso the mechanism that zzso zzso death in zzso that is, the role of zzso and its zzso zzso 

We first examined the involvement of zzso in the active zzso zzso by terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis of zzso We then examined the expressions of zzso and zzso zzso zzso to deduce the possible upstream zzso zzso of zzso if zzso were zzso We finally characterized the infiltrated zzso zzso in the active zzso zzso 

In the active zzso zzso zzso zzso was strongly observed in the zzso zzso and also zzso observed in the upper zzso infiltrates as well as in a few zzso in the zzso zzso The distribution of zzso cells was similar to that of the strong zzso of active zzso zzso was found mainly in the zzso and some infiltrated zzso cells, whereas zzso was identified predominantly in the zzso and zzso infiltrated cells and in some zzso zzso Overlapping expression of zzso and zzso was accompanied by zzso in the zzso zzso Many of the infiltrated zzso cells were zzso zzso was rarely observed in the zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso of the zzso is highly likely to be involved in the zzso of zzso and this zzso might be predominantly zzso by the zzso of the zzso zzso T cells, possibly also playing an inflammatory zzso
