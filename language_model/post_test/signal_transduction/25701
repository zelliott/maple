zzso zzso zzso zzso has been reported to decrease vascular zzso zzso However, the critical role of vascular smooth muscle cell zzso zzso in vascular zzso formation following transplantation is not well zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso zzso signaling in zzso vascular zzso zzso 

zzso arteries from smooth muscle zzso zzso knockout zzso zzso and zzso mice were transplanted to zzso recipient zzso The recipient mice received a control diet or zzso zzso zzso reduced vascular zzso formation in transplanted zzso but not in zzso zzso carotid zzso zzso analysis suggested that zzso zzso vascular zzso formation through zzso zzso as evidenced by the increase of zzso inflammatory cells and tumor necrosis zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed increased inflammatory cell rolling and attachment to zzso cells in small blood vessels of zzso zzso mice following zzso zzso zzso zzso mice, as shown by Western zzso have elevated vascular cell zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso demonstrated zzso zzso zzso have increased zzso 

Loss of zzso in zzso promotes zzso vascular zzso formation through increased zzso zzso zzso zzso also mediates zzso vascular zzso zzso
