zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso function was thought to be restricted to enhancing zzso differentiation and development of zzso cells from other zzso However, recent studies have revealed a critical role for zzso during skeletal muscle growth and zzso Although zzso has been implicated in regulating zzso little is presently known about the role and, for that matter, the zzso of action of zzso in regulating zzso zzso Here we report for the first time, using a zzso zzso zzso and the zzso mouse model, that zzso enhances zzso zzso through increasing both zzso proliferation and zzso In addition, we have identified zzso zzso and differentiation zzso serum zzso as a novel downstream target of zzso in skeletal zzso In agreement, reduced zzso expression was detected in zzso mice muscle zzso We further report that a functional zzso element within the zzso zzso zzso promoter region is critical for zzso regulation of zzso zzso has been reported to bind to and inhibit the activity of zzso consistent with this, we found that enhanced zzso of zzso increased zzso myostatin interaction and significantly reduced myostatin activity upon zzso zzso of zzso Moreover, we analyzed the ability of zzso to regulate zzso independently of zzso zzso The results revealed that zzso protein treatment enhances zzso proliferation and zzso whereas zzso of zzso results in defective zzso Taken together these data revealed that zzso is a positive regulator of skeletal muscle zzso which functions through zzso modulating myostatin activity via a mechanism involving zzso
