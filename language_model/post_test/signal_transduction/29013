The zzso factor zzso is expressed in zzso and vascular muscle where it may exert zzso and zzso zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso plays a protective role in the zzso by examining vascular structure and function in zzso zzso mice expressing the zzso dominant negative zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso responses to the zzso zzso zzso zzso were not affected, but there was an increase in contraction to zzso zzso and zzso In cerebral blood vessels both in zzso and in zzso zzso produced zzso that was markedly impaired in zzso zzso zzso levels were elevated in cerebral zzso from zzso mice and responses to zzso were restored to normal with a scavenger of zzso zzso of zzso zzso cerebral zzso was less, whereas wall thickness and zzso area was greater in zzso mice, indicating cerebral zzso underwent zzso and zzso Thus, interference with zzso signaling produces zzso dysfunction via a mechanism involving zzso stress and causes vascular zzso and inward zzso These findings indicate that zzso has vascular effects which are particularly profound in the cerebral circulation and provide genetic evidence that zzso plays a critical role in protecting blood zzso
