zzso zzso cells in culture respond to zzso zzso zzso zzso by increasing their zzso zzso concentration zzso The effective concentration of zzso that zzso a zzso response equal to 50% of the zzso response zzso was zzso zzso zzso of zzso from a zzso to form a local zzso of zzso increased zzso of individual cells in a sequential zzso zzso closest to the zzso showed an immediate increase in zzso while more zzso cells displayed a delayed increase in zzso This response to the local release of zzso appeared as a wave of increasing zzso that spread to several cells and, in this respect, was similar to the zzso communicated zzso waves initiated by mechanical stimulation in airway zzso cells zzso et zzso Cell zzso 1, zzso zzso In the presence of a zzso fluid flow, the zzso response to a local release of zzso was biased such that virtually all the cells responding with an increase in zzso were downstream of the release zzso By contrast, an identical fluid flow did not bias the zzso propagation of zzso zzso waves induced by mechanical zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso did zzso the zzso response induced by zzso but did not block the propagation of mechanically induced zzso zzso zzso from young cultures zzso zzso or those at the leading edge of an outgrowth elevated their zzso in response to zzso However, these cells do not respond to mechanical stimulation by the propagation of a zzso zzso From these results we conclude that the zzso zzso waves zzso by mechanical stimulation are not the result of zzso or another compound released from the zzso cell, zzso through the zzso zzso This conclusion is consistent with previous experimental evidence suggesting that zzso zzso signaling in zzso cells is zzso by the movement of zzso zzso through gap zzso
