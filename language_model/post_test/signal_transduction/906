To investigate the role played by the zzso zzso zzso Y zzso in zzso responses to zzso zzso we measured zzso zzso and hormonal responses to this stimulus in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso After administration of insulin at a dose zzso zzso zzso sufficient to cause moderate zzso zzso zzso levels, 40 zzso 3 and 37 zzso 2 zzso for zzso and zzso mice, zzso P zzso not zzso zzso food intake was increased zzso in zzso mice relative to zzso zzso By comparison, the increase of intake in zzso mice was far smaller zzso and did not achieve statistical significance zzso zzso zzso zzso feeding in response to zzso zzso was therefore markedly attenuated in mice lacking zzso and a similar feeding deficit was detected in these animals after zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso A role for zzso in zzso feeding is further supported by our finding that zzso zzso content zzso by real-time zzso increased zzso in the zzso of zzso mice by 7 h after insulin zzso Unlike the feeding deficits observed in mice lacking zzso the effect of zzso to increase plasma zzso and zzso levels was fully intact in these animals, as were both the zzso zzso value and time to recovery of zzso after insulin injection zzso zzso not zzso We conclude that zzso signaling is required for zzso zzso but not neuroendocrine responses to moderate zzso
