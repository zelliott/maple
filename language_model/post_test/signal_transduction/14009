There is broad interest in designing zzso materials that can interact with cells and regulate key downstream zzso In particular, materials with zzso features may enable control over zzso zzso which involve the simultaneous binding of multiple zzso on one entity to multiple receptors on another and are ubiquitous throughout zzso Cellular signal zzso of growth factor and zzso cues (which have critical roles in regulating cell function and zzso often begins with such zzso binding of zzso either zzso or zzso to target cell zzso leading to zzso zzso Cellular mechanisms that orchestrate zzso zzso are complex, however, so the capacity to control zzso interactions and thereby zzso key zzso events within living systems is currently very zzso Here, we demonstrate the design of potent zzso zzso that can organize stem cell receptors into zzso clusters and control stem cell zzso in zzso and in zzso The zzso of zzso normally an integral membrane protein zzso was zzso to a soluble zzso to yield zzso zzso zzso that zzso induce zzso in neural stem cells and promote their zzso differentiation both in culture and within the zzso zzso zzso analysis yielded insights into the organization of the zzso clusters at the zzso We also found that synthetic zzso zzso of zzso strongly enhance human embryonic and induced zzso stem cell differentiation into functional zzso zzso zzso zzso are therefore powerful tools and potential zzso zzso for controlling the zzso of target stem cells in zzso and in zzso
