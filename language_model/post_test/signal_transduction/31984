zzso zzso play momentous roles in various biological processes including cell zzso However, little is known about the role of zzso in human dental pulp cells zzso during zzso zzso The aims of this study were to investigate the expression of zzso in the primary culture of zzso when incubated in zzso zzso 

The potential characteristics of zzso were investigated by zzso zzso and real-time reverse zzso zzso chain zzso zzso zzso target zzso Gene zzso analysis, and zzso Encyclopedia of Genes and zzso mapping zzso were applied for predicting the complementary target genes of zzso and their biological zzso 

A total of 22 zzso were zzso expressed in which 12 zzso zzso and 10 zzso zzso in differentiated zzso compared with the zzso The target genes of differential zzso were predicted to associate with several biological functions and signaling pathways including the zzso protein zzso zzso and the zzso signaling zzso 

The differential expression zzso may be involved in governing zzso zzso zzso thus contributing to the future investigations of regulatory mechanisms in zzso zzso formation and dental pulp zzso
