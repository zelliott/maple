zzso growth factors are critically involved in multiple zzso processes via zzso zzso Although zzso proteins have been applied to dissect the zzso functions of these factors, variation of activities among different protein preparations remains an zzso To further zzso the roles of one of these growth factors, bone zzso protein 15 zzso in zzso zzso molecular and cellular events and to explore its potential clinical application, we engineered the human zzso sequence to efficiently produce zzso zzso human zzso zzso The zzso zzso site of the zzso precursor was zzso to facilitate the production of the mature zzso and a zzso was placed at the zzso of the mature region to ease zzso and avoid potential interference of the tag with the zzso knot zzso The zzso protein was zzso using zzso zzso affinity zzso Our results demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso was efficiently processed in zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso could activate zzso and induce the zzso of genes zzso zzso zzso transcripts zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, our zzso containing a genetically modified zzso sequence and an zzso zzso can be efficiently produced, processed and zzso in a zzso expression zzso The zzso zzso is also biologically active and very stable, and can induce the expression of a variety of mouse zzso cell zzso
