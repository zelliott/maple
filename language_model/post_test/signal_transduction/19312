Virtually all zzso cells contain at least one and usually several types of zzso zzso These are varied in protein structure and type of zzso but the total number of zzso genes zzso zzso zzso core proteins is less than zzso Some core zzso including those of the zzso always possess zzso coupled zzso others do zzso zzso has a long evolutionary history, as it is present in zzso but many other zzso zzso are zzso zzso The variety of proteins and their zzso chains is matched by diverse zzso However, all assume roles as zzso often working alongside zzso growth factor receptors or zzso receptors such as zzso Other common themes are an ability to signal through their zzso zzso often to the zzso zzso and linkage to zzso protein zzso Many zzso zzso associate on the cell surface with zzso zzso and can be shed by zzso Work with model systems in zzso and in zzso reveals roles in growth, zzso migration, and zzso Furthermore, a wide range of zzso for the core proteins has been obtained in mouse knockout zzso Here some of the latest developments in the field are examined in hopes of stimulating further interest in this fascinating group of zzso
