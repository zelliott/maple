zzso tissue is an important insulin target organ, and zzso cells are a model cell line for zzso In this study, we have used zzso short hairpin zzso zzso for functional gene zzso in zzso zzso to assess the molecular mechanisms of insulin zzso We chose to target zzso to validate this zzso We showed that zzso efficiently delivered zzso and small interfering zzso zzso into fully differentiated zzso zzso We established a strategy for identifying efficient zzso sequences for gene zzso by zzso zzso cells with the target gene fluorescent fusion protein zzso along with a zzso that expresses zzso Using these methods, we identified highly efficient zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso zzso against zzso reduced zzso zzso expression to almost zzso levels in zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso was only reduced by zzso suggesting that another zzso zzso mediates part of this zzso When zzso was introduced into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was essentially zzso indicating that both zzso and zzso contribute to zzso zzso transport in zzso zzso We also found that zzso zzso led to impaired zzso zzso protein expression that was dependent on whether zzso was knocked down in the zzso or differentiated zzso We further found that zzso expression was not required for zzso differentiation but was necessary for full zzso capacity of differentiated zzso These studies indicate that zzso zzso zzso provide an excellent approach to deliver functional zzso into zzso zzso for studying insulin signaling and zzso zzso
