One zzso response to increased zzso availability is the zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso form of the key zzso buffer zzso It remains unclear how this potentially important zzso stress response impacts on the different zzso zzso zzso We addressed this question by using two independent in zzso zzso zzso techniques in zzso wild type zzso and the zzso zzso zzso A comparison of in zzso zzso with zzso zzso and in zzso zzso with zzso zzso revealed that, whereas in zzso zzso of zzso leaf zzso was complete within 2 h zzso about 50% of leaf zzso remained zzso to zzso in zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed that this correlated tightly with the zzso zzso state, pointing to significant in zzso pools of zzso in zzso that were unavailable for zzso zzso zzso zzso of leaf sections to estimate zzso zzso distribution showed that the accumulated zzso in zzso was associated with only a minor increase in zzso zzso but with a 3- and zzso increase in zzso and zzso pools, zzso The data are used to estimate zzso zzso zzso under optimal and zzso stress conditions, and the implications for zzso zzso and zzso are zzso
