zzso is a potent regulator of zzso zzso zzso To examine if zzso which usually zzso insulin, regulates zzso we assessed the levels of zzso by Western zzso from zzso cells exposed to zzso with or without zzso zzso alone zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso effect on zzso We also assessed the effect of zzso zzso a zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso inhibitor on zzso zzso While zzso (5 zzso blocked zzso zzso it failed to block stimulation of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso inhibited zzso but not zzso zzso whereas protein zzso inhibitor had an opposite zzso Thus, insulin acts primarily via zzso and zzso apparently stimulates through a zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso intensity of zzso seen exclusively in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso in both nucleus and zzso after zzso zzso Finally, as judged by zzso to specific zzso insulin but not zzso zzso zzso of zzso Thus, unique signaling mechanisms mediate the response of zzso to zzso in the presence or absence of zzso
