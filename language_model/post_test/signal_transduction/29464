zzso airway inflammation develops in the context of innate immune cells that express zzso receptors zzso zzso recognize microbial components and evoke diverse responses in immune and other respiratory cells through distinct signaling zzso zzso and viral infection in the airway zzso the extent of allergic zzso zzso stimulation controls T helper zzso 1, zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso production in mast cells, and zzso of zzso via direct and indirect zzso zzso signals in zzso cells increase expression of major zzso complex proteins and zzso zzso resulting in greater zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso signals in mast cells increase their release of zzso and zzso signals in airway zzso cells enhance airway generation of zzso zzso Although these responses play an important protective role in infection, they may exacerbate allergic zzso Under some conditions, zzso zzso especially via zzso reduces zzso allergic inflammation through induction of zzso zzso zzso understanding the regulatory role of zzso in the zzso of allergic airway inflammation may shed light on improving inflammation control in zzso zzso
