zzso is an zzso zzso protein that possesses an zzso domain in its zzso zzso We have now investigated the role of zzso in the regulation of zzso cell spreading and zzso zzso is zzso with zzso at zzso zzso sites of zzso zzso A zzso switch experiment showed that zzso was zzso and then zzso to zzso zzso sites in a similar manner to zzso Such polarized zzso of zzso required the multiple spanning region of this zzso zzso expression of zzso induced cell spreading with marked zzso formation and resulted in both partial disruption of zzso zzso and enhancement of the zzso growth zzso scattering of zzso canine kidney zzso The zzso cell spreading was blocked by zzso of zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso Thus, these results suggest that zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso and cell migration through reorganization of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso This function of zzso is zzso by the zzso of zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso
