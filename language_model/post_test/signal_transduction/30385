The zzso zzso system is composed of peptides that are zzso from the zzso precursor zzso zzso Recent zzso and genetic evidence suggests that zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso responses to ethanol and ethanol zzso Because ethanol decreases zzso zzso levels, we determined if exposure to an zzso diet zzso would significantly reduce central zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso We also determined if ethanol exposure would alter the zzso of zzso protein zzso an zzso zzso zzso 

Male zzso rats were given 18 days of access to normal zzso zzso or a control diet zzso or short-term (4 zzso or long-term (18 zzso access to an zzso At the end of the study, rats were zzso with zzso zzso and their brains were zzso into two sets for processing with zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso exposed to an zzso showed significant reductions of central zzso zzso relative to rats exposed to a control diet zzso or normal zzso zzso zzso reductions of zzso zzso were zzso and were noted in regions of the zzso and extended amygdala, as well as the zzso nucleus of the zzso Because there were no differences in body weights or caloric intake between the CD and zzso groups, reductions of zzso zzso in zzso rats are best explained by ethanol exposure rather than altered energy zzso No significant zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

The present study shows that ethanol site specifically reduces zzso zzso in rat zzso These zzso in tandem with recent zzso and genetic studies, suggest that the zzso zzso system zzso zzso responses to zzso Thus, compounds which target zzso may prove to have therapeutic value in the treatment of excessive ethanol consumption and/or the symptoms associated with ethanol zzso
