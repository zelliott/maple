In the zzso cell zzso zzso that surrounds the zzso egg, a complex set of cell signals specifies two cell fates that pattern the zzso the anterior zzso zzso that produce the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso that produce the main body eggshell zzso We have previously shown that the long-range zzso zzso zzso the expression of the bunched zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes a zzso of zzso zzso in turn zzso anterior gene expression and zzso zzso signaling to restrict zzso zzso fates in zzso zzso From a screen for novel targets of zzso repression we have identified the zzso zzso slow border cells zzso At stage zzso zzso expression zzso zzso in anterior zzso by stage zzso they repress each other's expression to establish a sharp zzso expression zzso The precise position of the zzso expression boundary is sensitive to zzso zzso which is required for both zzso zzso and zzso zzso As zzso migration proceeds from stages zzso zzso zzso its own expression and both zzso zzso zzso and zzso approaches reveal that zzso is required to coordinate zzso migration with nurse cell zzso We propose that in anterior zzso exposed to a zzso zzso zzso high and low levels of zzso and zzso respectively, are established by zzso of zzso signaling to direct threshold cell zzso zzso among zzso zzso and zzso resemble a zzso signaling cassette that regulates zzso zzso zzso
