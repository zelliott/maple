The zzso capacity of cells may limit the lifespan of key systems in the zzso It has long been known that normal human cells have a finite lifespan when placed in cell culture, and their lifespan is dependent on the age of the individual zzso The mechanism of the genetic program that times this process has been zzso The zzso hypothesis of cell aging proposes that the length of the zzso repeat array at zzso zzso can time replication number and signal cell cycle arrest when critical zzso lengths are zzso The erosion of zzso DNA in normal zzso appears to be due to the lack of expression of components of the zzso maintenance zzso zzso the key zzso involved in zzso zzso is not expressed in zzso zzso but is expressed in germ cells, where zzso length is zzso zzso so that viable zzso can be transmitted to the next zzso Evidence is reviewed that zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, and the manipulation of zzso length with cell zzso capacity and cellular zzso Strong circumstantial evidence exists that indicates a role for zzso biology in the control of zzso capacity and in zzso
