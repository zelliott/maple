We have shown that zzso zzso is a potent zzso regulator of zzso gene zzso and proposed that the accumulated zzso zzso within the zzso is a major factor in determining zzso zzso In the present report, we examined the effect of zzso on the action of zzso and zzso with special focus on the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso syndrome gene zzso by zzso We show that expression of zzso and zzso are zzso regulated by zzso concentration and exposure zzso In addition, we found that zzso gene was induced by zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso Based on these results, we propose a model for the zzso turnover of zzso function that is zzso regulated by zzso
