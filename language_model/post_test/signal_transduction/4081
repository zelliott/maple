zzso zzso is known to be readily oxidized and to act as a scavenger of zzso oxygen species produced, zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso or during the respiratory burst of zzso One major zzso product formed under these conditions, the zzso zzso zzso zzso was suggested to have zzso properties and to contribute to zzso damage in neurodegenerative zzso It is shown in the present study that the zzso zzso signal measured after stimulation of the respiratory burst activity of cultivated rat zzso cells by the addition of zzso zzso zzso is suppressed by zzso in a zzso zzso During this process, zzso is oxidized to zzso Neither the zzso injection of zzso nor the addition of zzso to cultured zzso zzso or zzso cells was found to cause measurable zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso zzso locally released from zzso and zzso nerve endings at sites of brain damage or zzso through its zzso effect on the release of zzso oxygen species during the respiratory burst of activated zzso may contribute to zzso secondary tissue damage in the zzso
