The zzso acid zzso zzso for zzso zzso is the primary scavenger zzso for zzso and zzso zzso in zzso The two human zzso of zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso which are type I zzso membrane zzso are highly expressed in zzso zzso cells of zzso zzso liver, and zzso Their identical zzso zzso zzso contain four candidate zzso zzso signaling motifs as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 1, 2, or 3) had decreased zzso zzso rates of approximately 49, approximately 39, and approximately zzso respectively zzso to wild zzso In contrast, zzso cells zzso zzso 4) showed no change in zzso zzso zzso zzso of motifs 1 and 2 or of 1, 2, and 4 decreased the rate of zzso zzso by only approximately zzso zzso was approximately zzso decreased in zzso lacking all four zzso zzso expressing a zzso zzso of the zzso motif retained zzso of wild type zzso whereas this zzso in the triple motif zzso decreased zzso to approximately zzso of wild zzso zzso in zzso is thus important for zzso All zzso zzso showed similar zzso binding and degradation of the zzso zzso indicating that altering zzso motifs did not affect zzso binding of zzso or targeting of zzso zzso to zzso We conclude that, although zzso may be the most important zzso it functions together with two other zzso zzso thus three signal sequences zzso zzso and zzso provide zzso to mediate coated pit targeting and zzso of zzso
