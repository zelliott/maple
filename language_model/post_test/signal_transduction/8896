To investigate the effects of nuclear factor zzso B zzso on insulin signaling in skeletal muscle cells of rat with zzso 

zzso rats were randomly divided into two groups: control group and zzso zzso model was reproduced by zzso zzso and puncture in zzso zzso At 8, 16, 24, 48 and 72 h after operation, the zzso was zzso Conventional HE zzso was used to observe the zzso of skeletal muscle zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso were detected by Western zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in skeletal muscle cells were detected by zzso mobility shift zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso in zzso group was significantly lower than in control group zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso of zzso in zzso group was significantly higher than in control group zzso zzso zzso In zzso group, zzso activity in skeletal muscle cells was significantly higher than in control group zzso zzso zzso There was significant negative correlation between activity of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was significant positive correlation between activities of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

There is no inflammatory cell zzso in skeletal muscle cells with zzso But the activity of zzso in skeletal muscle cells is obviously zzso and it is closely related with disorder of insulin signaling in skeletal muscle cells of rat with zzso
