zzso of G protein zzso zzso zzso are members of a large family of zzso proteins that are zzso expressed in various cell types and accelerate the termination of zzso G protein zzso To identify zzso proteins that may affect zzso regulation of zzso zzso we screened the expression of zzso zzso genes zzso zzso A, B, C, and zzso in single spontaneously beating rat zzso zzso maintained in primary zzso zzso profiling by zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso analysis revealed that seven distinct zzso genes are zzso expressed in zzso zzso which were also identified in zzso zzso from rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Other zzso transcripts were detected in zzso zzso zzso but not single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and therefore are likely to originate from zzso sources in zzso zzso The zzso zzso experiments also led to the identification of putative zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso using zzso zzso confirmed the presence of selected zzso proteins in the cultured zzso zzso These results demonstrate a rich diversity of zzso expression in zzso zzso whose specific role in zzso signaling is yet to be zzso The identification of zzso zzso proteins in zzso zzso will facilitate targeted suppression and/or deletion studies to determine how each zzso protein may affect zzso zzso and its short-term and long-term regulation by zzso signaling zzso
