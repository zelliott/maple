Exposure of rats to intermittent zzso determines different responses at tissue and cell zzso Heart mainly zzso the effects of hypoxic injury and its response is determined both by the relationship between oxygen supply and demand and by its functional zzso Since molecular mechanisms mediate cells sensing and response to low zzso zzso here we explore the role played by zzso zzso C alpha zzso zzso in the signal zzso mechanisms leading to the occurrence of zzso responses in rat zzso young and old heart subjected to intermittent zzso Along with a key role for zzso zzso factor and vascular zzso growth factor in the occurrence of continuous state of dynamic adaptation of zzso zzso alpha presumably zzso zzso in rat zzso and hypoxic zzso hearts, supporting the hypothesis of a rescue strategy carried out against zzso together with an zzso zzso In hypoxic young heart zzso alpha zzso paralleled by sustained zzso zzso and zzso zzso along with reduced zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggests that the young early and deeply zzso the effects of lowered oxygen zzso In addition, since no modifications concerning zzso alpha driven zzso system are evidenced in both the experimental conditions, we suggest an oxygen impaired sensing during zzso
