The zzso process, zzso the dissemination of cancer cells throughout the body to seed secondary tumors at distant sites, requires cancer cells to leave the primary tumor and to acquire migratory and invasive zzso In a process of zzso transition zzso besides changing their adhesive repertoire, cancer cells employ zzso processes to gain migratory and invasive properties that involve a dramatic reorganization of the zzso zzso and the zzso formation of membrane zzso required for invasive zzso The molecular processes underlying such cellular changes are still only poorly zzso and the various migratory zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso still require a better functional and molecular zzso zzso direct experimental evidence linking the formation of migratory membrane zzso and the process of zzso and tumor zzso is still zzso In this review, we have summarized recent novel insights into the molecular processes and players underlying zzso on one side and the formation of invasive membrane zzso on the other zzso
