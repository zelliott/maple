Restoration of blood flow to the zzso liver zzso may paradoxically exacerbate tissue injury, which is called zzso zzso injury zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso expressed on several liver cell types, and the nuclear zzso B zzso signaling zzso are crucial to zzso zzso inflammatory zzso Because zzso is essentially a kind of profound acute inflammatory reaction evoked by many kinds of danger signals, we investigated zzso signaling zzso zzso in a zzso model of partial zzso zzso 

zzso mice zzso zzso or zzso zzso mice zzso were subjected to 45 minutes of partial zzso zzso followed by 1 hour, 3 hours of zzso zzso group accepted the same procedure without the obstruction of blood zzso At the end of zzso the compromise of liver function and the zzso change of liver sections were measured as the severity of liver zzso The level of zzso in the portal vein was measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined by zzso mobility shift zzso zzso The levels of tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso zzso in systemic blood after zzso zzso were assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The compromise of liver function and the zzso injuries in zzso mice were relieved more markedly than those in zzso mice after partial zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice was stronger than that in zzso zzso mice, and both were stronger than those in the sham operated mice zzso zzso zzso zzso in each group was zzso The levels of zzso and zzso in systemic blood were elevated in both zzso but lower in the sham operated zzso These zzso were significantly decreased in zzso zzso mice compared with those in zzso mice zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso signaling zzso may mediate zzso zzso triggered by zzso danger zzso zzso of the zzso zzso may be a potential therapeutic target for attenuating zzso tissue damage in some clinical zzso
