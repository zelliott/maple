zzso and sustained cardiac zzso drive occurs in heart failure and zzso in part, to the progression of left zzso zzso dysfunction and zzso that are characteristic features of this disease zzso zzso sympathetic drive in heart failure can lead to zzso and zzso of cardiac zzso receptors with a zzso impairment of zzso reserve and exercise zzso This zzso zzso can also lead to cellular abnormalities in the failing heart zzso by defects in calcium cycling within the zzso zzso by defects in zzso zzso and by ongoing loss of zzso through necrosis or zzso zzso overdrive in heart failure can also trigger the induction of the fetal gene program, a zzso that can lead to further compromise of the zzso zzso zzso treatment with zzso in patients with heart failure and in animals with zzso heart failure has been shown to reverse, zzso or at the very least, arrest many, if not all, of these adverse zzso zzso improve function of the failing zzso prevent or reverse progressive zzso zzso chamber zzso and zzso and consequently positively impact cardiac zzso zzso also reduce heart rate and zzso wall stress leading to reduced zzso oxygen consumption, a clear benefit to the failing zzso zzso can also improve the intrinsic zzso function of zzso and have also been shown to improve zzso zzso in heart failure possibly through a desirable shift in zzso zzso Recent studies from our laboratories have also shown that chronic therapy with zzso in heart failure can zzso zzso zzso Finally, chronic therapy with zzso has been shown to abrogate induction of the fetal gene zzso These benefits provide strong reinforcement to the clinical findings that zzso are highly beneficial in the management of patients with chronic heart failure and, when properly used, afford unequivocal reductions in mortality and morbidity in this patient zzso
