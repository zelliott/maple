The Kit zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that is expressed in a variety of different zzso and mediates zzso biological effects through its zzso stem cell factor zzso zzso zzso of Kit as well as zzso zzso mechanisms of the zzso zzso have been implicated in a variety of zzso where its primary contribution to zzso is in enhancing tumor growth and reducing zzso For example, Kit is frequently zzso and activated in gastrointestinal zzso tumors zzso and there is zzso zzso of Kit in some lung zzso Kit is a convenient target in zzso tumors and zzso of this zzso with the small zzso drug zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso has shown dramatic zzso Unfortunately, past experience has demonstrated that chemotherapy of zzso with a single drug often leads to resistance of the zzso Further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso transformation is therefore important and may lead to the identification of further novel drug zzso These zzso signaling pathways may then be targeted to overcome potential drug zzso This review will focus on our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in transformation by zzso The potential mechanisms by which Kit zzso cellular transformation are zzso We will also discuss the role and expression of Kit in various zzso Ultimately, the understanding of zzso biology, zzso and zzso analysis will lead to better zzso
