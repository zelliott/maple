Current models of zzso zzso suggest that formation of a signaling complex, or zzso composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso protein B cell zzso protein zzso is critical for transmission of signals from the zzso However, impaired B cell development in mice lacking each individual zzso component has made it difficult to study the functional consequences of the formation of this complex in mature B zzso zzso genetic systems, commonly used in zzso define signaling pathways by combining partial loss of function zzso in the components of zzso This allows genetic interactions to be observed in the absence of zzso or lethal effects of complete zzso of either zzso We used this approach to demonstrate that zzso and zzso are limiting components of a common signaling zzso that mediates the zzso response of mature B cells to zzso B cells from transgenic mice expressing a limiting dosage of zzso zzso have normal numbers of mature B cells that have reduced, but zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not affect the development of zzso B zzso However, it exacerbated their defects in zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation, and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and A1 leading to dramatic impairment of B cell zzso zzso In contrast, no effect of reduced zzso and zzso dosage was observed on zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the signals regulating the maintenance and zzso of mature B cells are zzso sensitive to the strength of the signal emanating from the zzso
