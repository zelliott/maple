The zzso of the genetic code allows for multiple zzso to zzso the same zzso zzso However, alternative zzso and zzso acids are used zzso among zzso a phenomenon termed zzso zzso Genes regulating zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso an extremely zzso zzso were studied in order to determine the synonymous zzso usage zzso zzso responsible for zzso usage variation among the genes were investigated using zzso usage zzso and zzso statistical zzso zzso zzso usage data analysis indicated that zzso ending in G and/or C were zzso among the zzso zzso statistical analysis showed that there was a single major trend in the zzso usage variation among the zzso which had a strong positive correlation zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso with zzso + zzso content of the zzso Further, correlation analysis indicated that genes with higher expression level and showing a greater degree of zzso usage bias were zzso and preferred zzso with C or G zzso at the third zzso A set of thirteen zzso were identified through zzso test as optimal zzso which were preferred in highly expressed zzso It could be concluded that zzso bias had a profound effect on zzso usage zzso In addition, zzso selections also operated with a proper balance, making the genes zzso more zzso The frequency of these zzso appeared to be correlated with the level of gene expression and might be a useful indicator in the case of genes (or zzso whose expression levels are zzso
