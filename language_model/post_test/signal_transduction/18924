zzso receptors belong to a unique family of zzso channels in terms of their molecular architecture, in which the channel zzso has two zzso zzso with a large zzso loop keeping zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso modifications of zzso receptors could diversify cellular responsiveness induced by zzso zzso in anterior zzso cells and other cell zzso Recently, we found a spliced zzso zzso transcript, termed zzso in mouse zzso The zzso has a shorter zzso zzso tail than those of full-length zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso induced rapid responses in all zzso zzso channels, the current induced by zzso declined significantly faster than those by zzso or zzso In this article, we zzso functional zzso of zzso receptors after zzso zzso zzso of different zzso zzso zzso to form zzso and zzso channels could be a molecular mechanism for promoting functional zzso of zzso cellular zzso
