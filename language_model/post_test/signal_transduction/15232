Previous studies have shown that zzso zzso such as tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso and zzso 6 zzso are zzso induced in primary mouse zzso by mouse zzso virus strain zzso zzso and zzso However, the signaling events that trigger zzso and zzso induction in these cells upon zzso infection remain zzso In this study, we explored the potential signaling zzso We found that induction of zzso and zzso occurred as early as 2 h zzso and was completely dependent on viral zzso Using zzso specific for three zzso protein zzso we showed that induction of zzso and zzso by zzso infection was zzso through zzso of the zzso zzso zzso signaling pathway, but not through the zzso zzso zzso or zzso signaling zzso This finding was further confirmed with zzso experiments using small interfering zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, while nuclear factor zzso zzso a key zzso factor required for the expression of zzso zzso in most cell types, was activated in zzso during zzso infection, disruption of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso did not significantly inhibit zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, experiments using zzso viruses demonstrated that the viral spike and zzso zzso which play important roles in zzso zzso in mice, are not responsible for the differential induction of the zzso These results illustrate the complexity of the regulatory mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso zzso in primary zzso
