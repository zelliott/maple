zzso syndrome zzso is a disorder that is caused in the majority of cases by zzso in the gene zzso zzso zzso Children with zzso are generally characterized by normal development up to the first year and a half of age, after which they undergo a rapid zzso marked by a zzso of head growth, the onset of stereotyped hand movements, irregular breathing, and zzso Animal models of zzso with good construct and face zzso are zzso Their analysis showed that zzso regulation of zzso gene is necessary for normal zzso functioning and that multiple complex pathways involving different zzso and zzso cell types are disrupted in zzso zzso However, it is increasingly clear that zzso zzso mechanisms zzso at synaptic level zzso synaptic transmission and zzso We review novel findings showing how specific synaptic mechanisms and related signaling pathways are affected in zzso zzso
