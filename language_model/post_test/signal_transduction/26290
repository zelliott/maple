zzso zzso play a central role in embryonic development by regulating the movement and signaling of zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso are the zzso for zzso signaling in the zzso zzso zzso but their function in the zzso zzso zzso is still poorly zzso In this study, we have generated a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso an essential zzso zzso for zzso Although zzso zzso is expressed normally in the zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to excessive zzso of zzso zzso which fails to elicit an zzso signaling response or budding zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso This is supported by genetic rescue experiments in which the zzso zzso zzso zzso is ameliorated by zzso Ras zzso in the zzso but not in the zzso We further show that zzso zzso development requires the zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso but not the zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that zzso zzso controls zzso zzso induction by restricting the diffusion of zzso
