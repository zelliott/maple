zzso between taste zzso cells and primary sensory zzso fibers transmit the output signal from taste buds to the central nervous zzso The synaptic zzso cycle at the zzso involves zzso zzso zzso fusion, zzso and zzso Many kinds of synaptic zzso proteins participate in synaptic zzso zzso One of these, zzso 1, binds zzso zzso with high affinity and plays a role in zzso regulated neurotransmitter release in the central and peripheral nervous zzso However, the expression patterns of zzso 1 in rat taste zzso have not been zzso We therefore examined the expression patterns of zzso 1 and several cell specific markers of type II and III cells in rat taste zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso 1 zzso was expressed in zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso against zzso 1 yielded the labeling of a subset of taste bud cells and zzso and zzso nerve zzso Double labeled experiments showed that zzso 1 positive cells zzso type III cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso nerve processes positive for zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso all zzso 1 expressing cells did not zzso type II cell zzso zzso or zzso These results show that zzso 1 may play some regulatory roles in zzso membrane fusion events with the plasma membrane at the zzso of type III cells in rat taste zzso
