zzso use a variety of zzso to respond to external zzso including second zzso that amplify primary signals and elicit zzso changes in a zzso zzso of the second zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are regulated by a variety of environmental stimuli and play a critical role in regulating cellular processes such as zzso formation and cellular zzso zzso zzso signaling systems have been largely characterized in zzso zzso however, proteins that can impact the synthesis or degradation of zzso are prominent in zzso species and yet remain largely zzso In zzso many putative zzso synthesis or degradation zzso are found in genes that also harbor zzso signal input zzso suggesting that light is an important signal for altering zzso zzso Indeed, zzso zzso are often the second most common output domain in zzso only by a zzso zzso output zzso zzso differ from other bacteria regarding the number and types of zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso Due to the widespread distribution of zzso zzso in zzso we investigated the evolutionary origin of a subset of zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso signaling systems were present early in zzso and zzso genes were both vertically and zzso inherited during their zzso Finally, we compared zzso levels of zzso in two zzso species under different light qualities, confirming that light is an important factor for regulating this second zzso in zzso 

This study shows that many proteins containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso are associated with zzso zzso Although the functional roles of zzso zzso proteins in zzso are only beginning to emerge, the abundance of these zzso proteins in zzso that occupy diverse zzso ranging from freshwater to marine to soil environments suggests an important role for the regulation of zzso in these zzso Indeed, we showed that light distinctly regulates zzso levels in zzso zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso Our findings are consistent with the occurrence of zzso zzso based on evolutionary origin and as an adaptation to specific habitat zzso zzso analyses of these zzso clearly separate two distinctive zzso one composed of zzso belonging predominantly to zzso and the other belonging to a mix of zzso and other zzso We further demonstrate that in zzso the acquisition of zzso signaling zzso occurred both vertically and zzso
