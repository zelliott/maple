zzso is a zzso zzso found on the surface of most T zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso production and cell proliferation when combined with an additional signal such as treatment with zzso zzso an zzso of protein zzso zzso Recent studies have established that after zzso zzso the zzso domain of zzso can bind to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso There is a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso activity that may be important in zzso zzso Despite the requirement of zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso function, we have found, however, that treatment of zzso T cells with the zzso zzso zzso dramatically zzso zzso the association of zzso zzso with zzso zzso the ability of zzso zzso zzso to be zzso by zzso zzso and zzso the induction of zzso zzso activity after stimulation of the cells with the zzso zzso zzso zzso These changes occur within minutes of zzso treatment and are zzso In addition, we have found that zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso does not interfere with the induction of zzso after stimulation of zzso T cells with zzso zzso zzso and zzso We conclude that zzso zzso activity may not be required for zzso zzso production from zzso T cells in the presence of zzso
