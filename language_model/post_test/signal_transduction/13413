zzso zzso is a zzso zzso complex catalyzing the last two steps of zzso zzso The natural zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso of the zzso zzso It has been shown recently, that the zzso zzso acids zzso and zzso acid are both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso is only an zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The crystal structures of zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso acid show that both zzso bind to the active site such that the zzso zzso is positioned similarly as the zzso group of the natural zzso As a consequence, the zzso of the zzso site that interact with the zzso are the same as observed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso binding leads to closure of loop zzso of the zzso a key structural element of zzso zzso This is in keeping with the zzso role played by these zzso The structure of the zzso complex with zzso is quite zzso Due to the zzso lateral chain, this zzso adopts a new orientation in the zzso zzso In this case, closure of loop zzso is no longer observed, in agreement with its functioning only as an inhibitor of the zzso zzso
