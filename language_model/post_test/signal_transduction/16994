Many signal zzso zzso are initiated by zzso receptors with the presence or absence and abundance of receptors dictating cellular zzso We provide a validated array of quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso for zzso profiling of the presence and relative abundance of transcripts for zzso zzso receptors in the human zzso We found that the zzso array had greater sensitivity and specificity for the detected zzso transcript profiles compared to conventional zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso array also distinguished functional zzso presence versus absence more accurately than deep sequencing of zzso zzso species by zzso sequencing zzso By applying zzso zzso transcript profiling to 40 human cell lines representing four main zzso zzso skin, breast, and zzso we identified clusters of cell lines with enhanced signaling capabilities and revealed a role for zzso zzso in defining tissue zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso in melanoma cells engaged an zzso zzso loop not otherwise present in this cell type, which altered zzso gene zzso and cellular responses to zzso zzso Our array provides a zzso zzso and convenient means for assigning a zzso signature to any human cell or tissue zzso
