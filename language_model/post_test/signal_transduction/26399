The zzso is a zzso protein complex whose primary function is the degradation of abnormal or foreign zzso Upon exposure of cells to zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso are induced and incorporated into newly zzso zzso zzso which are thought to function solely as critical players in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso However, the observation that zzso are present in several zzso zzso under normal conditions and/or following pathological events zzso against the view that its role is limited to zzso class I zzso In support of this concept, the recent use of genetic models deficient for zzso zzso or zzso has uncovered unanticipated functions for zzso in innate immunity and zzso zzso zzso we review recent data in an attempt to clarify the role of zzso beyond zzso class I zzso presentation with emphasis on its involvement in the regulation of protein zzso cell zzso and zzso gene zzso
