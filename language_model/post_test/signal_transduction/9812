To investigate the effect of total zzso of zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso sodium zzso colitis in zzso 

zzso experimental colitis was induced by administration of 4 cycles of zzso zzso Fifty mice were randomly distributed into 4 groups zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by a random number table with body weight zzso Mice in the normal group zzso and zzso colitis control group zzso received control treatment of 20 zzso distilled zzso zzso plus zzso zzso and zzso groups zzso each) were treated with zzso solution (20 zzso at the doses of 60 zzso and 30 zzso zzso The severity of colitis was assessed on the basis of clinical signs, colon zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso A zzso and zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso linked zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso gene expressions were analyzed by quantitative reverse zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso using zzso green zzso and nuclear factor zzso B zzso zzso expression and zzso and zzso interaction with the promoter of zzso gene were assessed by Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso administration significantly attenuated the damage and substantially reduced zzso zzso and maintained the level of zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso gene expression and had no effect on zzso gene zzso Also, zzso was able to reduce zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso B zzso protein zzso however, it had no effect on the zzso of I zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso and inhibitor of zzso B zzso (I zzso B zzso Moreover, zzso inhibited the zzso recruitment to the zzso gene zzso 

zzso had a protective effect on zzso zzso Such effect may be associated with its zzso of zzso B zzso and blockade of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso
