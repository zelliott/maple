Adult zzso persists in the zzso zone and the zzso zzso and can be induced upon central nervous system zzso However, the final contribution of newborn zzso to zzso networks is zzso Here we show that in neural stem cells, stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso does not trigger zzso but unexpectedly leads to increased stem cell survival and zzso zzso These effects are zzso via zzso of the zzso signaling pathway, ultimately leading to a global increase in protein zzso zzso of zzso by zzso was further confirmed in the zzso zzso region, in the zzso zzso zzso and after forced expression of zzso in the adult zzso zzso Lack of zzso zzso resulted in a reduction in zzso and working memory zzso Following global zzso zzso brain repair rescued behavioral zzso Thus, we identify the zzso system as an zzso signal for ongoing and zzso zzso
