Recent advances in the understanding of zzso translation have facilitated molecular studies on the regulation of protein synthesis by nutrients and the interplay between nutrients and hormonal zzso Numerous reports have established that, in skeletal muscle, the zzso zzso acids zzso have the unique ability to initiate signal zzso pathways that zzso translation zzso Of the zzso zzso is the most zzso zzso administration of zzso to zzso rats enhances muscle protein zzso in part, through zzso of the zzso binding step of translation zzso Interestingly, zzso signaling in skeletal muscle differs from that in liver, suggesting that the responses may be tissue zzso The purpose of this paper was to briefly review the current knowledge of how zzso act as regulators of protein synthesis in zzso important zzso with particular focus on the mechanisms by which zzso regulate translation zzso
