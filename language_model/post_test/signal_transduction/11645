zzso is a recently identified member of zzso weight complexes containing zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was shown to be required for zzso signaling in the early zzso In addition to the zzso embryonic lethal zzso zzso zzso animals also display an zzso zzso We show that this latter zzso is related to the zzso zzso zzso We also show that zzso and zzso genetically interact and cooperate to regulate zzso signaling in the development of the zzso zzso In addition, zzso and zzso genetically zzso We illustrate a new role for zzso in zzso zzso signaling in the zzso zzso thus providing evidence that zzso is involved in both zzso and zzso signaling zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso can partially substitute for zzso suggesting a conservation of function between these zzso
