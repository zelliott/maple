The response to DNA damage involves regulation of several essential processes to maximize the accuracy of DNA damage repair and cell zzso zzso has the potential to interfere with repair by inappropriately adding zzso to DNA zzso It was unknown whether cells zzso zzso in response to DNA damage to increase the accuracy of zzso Here, we report that zzso action is regulated as a part of the cellular response to DNA zzso breaks zzso Using zzso we show that the main zzso DNA damage zzso zzso regulates zzso action at zzso After DNA damage, zzso zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso Using a separation of function zzso zzso we show that this zzso is specifically required for the zzso zzso zzso that takes place at DNA breaks, but not for that at zzso Hence DNA damage zzso zzso zzso action at DNA breaks through zzso zzso thus preventing zzso healing of broken DNA ends by zzso These findings uncover a new regulatory mechanism that coordinates competing DNA zzso activities and thereby promotes DNA repair accuracy and zzso zzso
