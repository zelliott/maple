Once zzso by zzso the Lyn zzso zzso zzso is zzso from the plasma membrane to the zzso of zzso cells, but the function of such a zzso is incompletely zzso We evaluated the effect of zzso zzso on zzso sensitivity of the chronic zzso leukemia zzso cell line zzso zzso we generated stable cells that express plasmids zzso zzso or its zzso inactive counterpart zzso We established that Lyn is zzso in zzso parental zzso cells in a zzso zzso Lyn zzso also occurred following zzso zzso by specific short hairpin zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso cells, but not in cells zzso its inactive zzso zzso the zzso of zzso failed to affect the differentiation of zzso zzso zzso the protective effect of zzso was suppressed by two zzso of Lyn zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso zzso in the small proportion of zzso zzso cells zzso Lyn that can engage an zzso program upon zzso zzso Finally, Lyn zzso by zzso altered neither zzso zzso nor zzso Taken together, our data show that the zzso form of Lyn exerts a negative feedback on zzso zzso cell zzso that is entirely dependent on its zzso activity and likely on the zzso zzso
