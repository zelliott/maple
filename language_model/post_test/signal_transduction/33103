In response to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the marine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso undergo zzso zzso breakdown zzso and are arrested again at zzso zzso We examined the pharmacological characteristics of zzso receptors and the signal zzso zzso following zzso stimulation in oyster zzso Among zzso zzso tested, only zzso zzso a zzso zzso induced zzso although it was 1000 times less sensitive than zzso The rank order of the potency of zzso zzso to inhibit zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results are quite different from those reported for other zzso suggesting the presence of unique zzso receptors on oyster zzso Using the fluorescent zzso zzso zzso 2 and calcium green and the pH indicator zzso acid, we examined changes in zzso zzso zzso and zzso pH zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso did not trigger any changes in zzso However, an increase in zzso was observed during the zzso zzso zzso The increased zzso level was rather small before zzso and not necessary for zzso because lowering zzso by sodium zzso seawater zzso zzso did not prevent zzso zzso zzso of the zzso activity toward a zzso zzso specific to zzso demonstrated that zzso factor zzso was activated in accordance with the occurrence of zzso in response to zzso zzso it is likely that in oyster zzso the signal zzso pathways and zzso zzso participating in zzso zzso zzso via the zzso of zzso are insensitive to zzso and zzso
