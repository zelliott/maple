We have used the zzso zzso cell as a model system for understanding the molecular events involved in signal zzso through zzso zzso This zzso cell line expresses zzso zzso receptors zzso that interact with a zzso protein to regulate zzso C, rapidly increasing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is also increased following zzso stimulation but the increase in zzso is not significant until several minutes after addition of the zzso zzso zzso To determine the role of zzso and zzso in the zzso of protein zzso C zzso we assessed zzso zzso in the intact cell by measuring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to a zzso increase in zzso binding which is zzso transient and temporally correlated with the increase in zzso zzso When the rise in zzso zzso is zzso with zzso or zzso the increase in zzso binding is zzso Studies using zzso zzso to zzso reveal only the zzso and confirm that zzso stimulation causes zzso of zzso zzso to a particulate cell fraction only when zzso is zzso Our data suggest that the relatively slow increase in zzso is not the trigger for zzso zzso and may be secondary to the zzso of zzso Thus, when zzso cells are zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso to activate zzso there is a rise in the cellular zzso zzso In addition, in cells treated with zzso to zzso zzso zzso no longer significantly increases zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso is a zzso in the generation of zzso Analysis of the fatty acid composition of the zzso formed in response to zzso stimulation suggests that it is mostly derived from zzso zzso rather than from zzso zzso We examined the effect of zzso stimulation on PC metabolism in zzso zzso zzso were zzso with zzso which was incorporated into PC and released into the medium when the cells were zzso with zzso or with zzso zzso release increased throughout a zzso zzso zzso zzso abolished both zzso and zzso zzso zzso These data support the hypothesis that zzso stimulation leads to zzso zzso PC zzso through zzso of zzso zzso of zzso D zzso was demonstrated by the finding that zzso acid increased in response to zzso or zzso prior to the increase in zzso In addition, zzso was formed in response to zzso and zzso in cells exposed to zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
