zzso Y zzso in the acute zzso responses to immune challenge, since zzso zzso knockout zzso mice are particularly sensitive to the short-term zzso effect of bacterial zzso The present exploratory study addressed the involvement of zzso and zzso receptors in the long-term zzso responses to immune zzso A single zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso to control mice did not affect open field zzso 3 h zzso but enhanced zzso zzso in zzso as well as zzso zzso Four weeks zzso this zzso effect of zzso persisted in zzso mice but had gone in zzso zzso zzso zzso in the forced swim test was enhanced 1 day zzso in control and zzso mice, but not in zzso zzso Four weeks zzso the zzso effect of zzso had waned in control mice, persisted in zzso mice and was first observed in zzso zzso In zzso knockout of zzso and/or zzso receptors zzso the ability of a single zzso injection to cause a delayed and prolonged increase in zzso and/or zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso Y acting via zzso and zzso receptors prevents the development of long-term zzso and zzso zzso caused by acute immune zzso
