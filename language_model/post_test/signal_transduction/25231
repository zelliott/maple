The present study examines zzso second zzso signaling driven by zzso in isolated zzso zzso zzso To this end, we implemented zzso fluorescent zzso zzso imaging of single zzso cells in zzso zzso of 388 cells with zzso (5 zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso signal in zzso of individual zzso cells zzso zzso 11 zzso Among 337 zzso cells, we identified four zzso zzso modes of zzso zzso 1) zzso zzso with zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso 2) a zzso spike followed by a sustained plateau zzso 3) a zzso spike only zzso and 4) a zzso plateau only zzso The zzso but not the zzso or frequency, of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was dependent on the zzso zzso zzso availability of zzso zzso induced by treatment with zzso or zzso zzso did not block the zzso but zzso abolished ongoing zzso zzso zzso of zzso or increased the mean zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso with zzso (10 zzso also abolished or zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells were not zzso by overnight zzso with zzso zzso We conclude that 1) zzso cells (unlike earlier findings in zzso zzso manifest a diverse array of zzso signaling responses to zzso at the single cell zzso 2) zzso can dose zzso recruit an increasing number of individually zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) zzso zzso is required for zzso to sustain (but not zzso frequent and high zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and 4) these signaling actions of zzso are zzso via zzso C, but not a zzso sensitive zzso zzso the present data extend the apparent complexity of zzso zzso second zzso signaling and identify at the single cell level zzso zzso drive of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
