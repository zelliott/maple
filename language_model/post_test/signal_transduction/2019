Control of cellular survival and proliferation is dependent on zzso signals and is a prerequisite for ordered tissue development and zzso zzso of the zzso responsive element binding protein zzso by zzso has been implicated in the survival of zzso zzso To define its roles in the mouse central nervous system, we disrupted zzso in brain of developing and adult mice using the zzso zzso Mice with a zzso background and lacking zzso in the central nervous system during development show extensive zzso of zzso zzso By contrast, mice in which both zzso and zzso are disrupted in the zzso zzso show progressive zzso in the zzso and in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is reminiscent of Huntington disease and is consistent with the zzso role of zzso signaling in zzso zzso
