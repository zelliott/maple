zzso scale zzso of zzso receptors play an important role in cell zzso Central questions concern the stability of these zzso and the mechanisms leading to the domain zzso In zzso zzso zones, zzso of short zzso complexes form next to zzso of significantly longer zzso zzso The length mismatch between the zzso complexes leads to membrane zzso and has been suggested as a possible cause of the domain zzso The domain formation is a nucleation and growth process that depends on the line tension and free energy of the zzso Using a combination of zzso calculations and zzso Carlo simulations, we derive here general expressions for the line tension between zzso of long and short zzso complexes and for the zzso free energy of the zzso We argue that the length mismatch of zzso complexes alone is sufficient to drive the domain formation, and obtain zzso minimum sizes for stable zzso that are consistent with the domain sizes observed during zzso zzso
