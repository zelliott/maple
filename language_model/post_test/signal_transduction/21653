zzso growth factor zzso zzso is expressed in many zzso and is associated with poor zzso zzso zzso pathways have been well zzso using zzso cell lines and are known to involve zzso zzso through zzso zzso of downstream zzso zzso such as zzso zzso regulated zzso 1 and 2) and zzso zzso zzso B), leads to enhanced zzso cell survival and zzso Although zzso expression has been determined in neuroendocrine zzso zzso its zzso and subsequent effects on the downstream zzso zzso zzso and zzso have not been zzso We therefore planned to determine the role of zzso in neuroendocrine zzso zzso by determining its pattern of expression and zzso and the subsequent zzso of downstream zzso molecules zzso and zzso zzso zzso tissue was available from 98 patients with zzso zzso zzso 42 zzso four zzso five zzso and four of unknown zzso zzso evaluation was performed for the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso percent of zzso samples were positive for zzso zzso zzso were positive for activated zzso zzso were positive for activated zzso and zzso were positive for activated zzso zzso the zzso score for the zzso of zzso and zzso correlated with the zzso score for activated zzso These data provide a rationale for considering zzso zzso in the treatment of zzso Additionally, direct zzso of zzso and zzso may provide further therapeutic options in the treatment of zzso in the zzso
