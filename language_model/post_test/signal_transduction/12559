Prior studies of zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso levels have implicated zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso of schizophrenia and bipolar zzso Here we investigate whether genes involved in zzso zzso regulation might interact with genes that respond to zzso zzso to enhance risk for these psychiatric zzso zzso genes were selected from prior studies of genetic association, gene expression profiling and animal zzso A single zzso zzso zzso in each of six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was tested for association with zzso zzso zzso 88 African Americans with zzso 97 zzso 3 African Americans with bipolar zzso 191 zzso 49 African American zzso An A zzso in zzso was significantly associated with schizophrenia and with schizophrenia plus bipolar disorder combined, odds ratios zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of disease risk was found for the complex zzso zzso which zzso an OR zzso for the combined diagnostic category of schizophrenia plus bipolar disorder zzso zzso carried by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso an OR zzso for schizophrenia alone zzso zzso carried by zzso of schizophrenia zzso The combined risk posed by these zzso complex zzso is greater than any identified single locus and may derive from zzso of the zzso zzso by interacting zzso a lack of adequate zzso zzso of the zzso zzso or the production of zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso
