zzso is a zzso inhibitor that can zzso with zzso zzso to induce zzso in melanoma cells in zzso and inhibit tumor growth in zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso may be an effective means to sensitize melanoma cells to the direct effects of zzso zzso of human melanoma cells with zzso led to significantly increased zzso of zzso genes as determined by real-time zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses indicated that the enhanced direct actions of zzso on melanoma cells were the result of prolonged zzso of zzso zzso on both the zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, the enhanced zzso zzso was not observed in peripheral blood zzso cells that were zzso with zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso represents a mechanism to enhance the direct effects of zzso on melanoma cells thereby zzso its zzso zzso
