zzso stress on retinal zzso zzso zzso cells is thought to play a crucial role in the development and progression of age-related zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso that shows significant zzso zzso This study was designed to investigate the protective effect of zzso on zzso cells against zzso stress and the possible underlying zzso 

zzso cells exposed to different doses of zzso were incubated with various zzso of zzso and cell viability subsequently detected with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso rate and zzso levels of zzso oxygen species zzso were measured with flow zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression were examined with real-time zzso and western zzso The nuclear zzso of nuclear factor zzso zzso 2 zzso protein and the expression levels of zzso zzso and protein zzso B proteins were evaluated with western zzso 

zzso clearly reduced zzso cell viability loss, cell zzso and zzso generation of zzso Furthermore, treatment with zzso activated the zzso zzso by inducing zzso nuclear zzso zzso Phase II zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and proteins were zzso zzso inhibited expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso was involved in the protective effect of zzso on the zzso zzso 

zzso protected zzso cells against zzso zzso stress via zzso zzso of the expression of Phase II zzso involving the zzso zzso
