zzso are a family of zzso molecules that are important for zzso outgrowth and guidance in the developing nervous zzso However, the signaling mechanisms that lie immediately downstream of zzso receptors remain poorly zzso Here we report that the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso interacts with the focal zzso zzso zzso a zzso implicated in regulating cell zzso and zzso zzso was expressed in developing brains and was localized with zzso in cultured zzso zzso induced zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling abolished zzso zzso outgrowth and attractive growth cone zzso Taken together, these results indicate a new signaling mechanism for zzso in which zzso is activated upon zzso stimulation and mediates zzso zzso they also identify a critical role for zzso in zzso zzso
