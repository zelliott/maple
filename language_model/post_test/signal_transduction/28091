We studied the role of the zzso zzso nuclear import carrier (also known as zzso zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso accumulated zzso in the zzso within minutes of zzso zzso addition and returned to the nucleus after zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso distribution was unaffected regardless of zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso nuclear zzso by a factor 80 and its shuttling by a factor zzso These zzso movements were not due to zzso zzso zzso The mechanism involved was zzso zzso but zzso and zzso zzso and zzso cells displayed no zzso zzso zzso zzso In pancreatic zzso cells, the zzso movements of zzso zzso and the stimulation of zzso gene zzso were simultaneously lost between passages 28 and zzso Thus, zzso zzso regulates a nuclear transport zzso by increasing the nuclear zzso and shuttling of zzso zzso in cells in which zzso can stimulate the zzso of zzso zzso
