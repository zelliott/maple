The zzso protein zzso has been implicated as a zzso of multiple signaling pathways that are activated by a variety of zzso zzso zzso and zzso We have previously proposed that zzso growth factor 1 zzso stimulation of zzso zzso of zzso and recruitment of zzso zzso zzso are zzso by an indirect mechanism in which the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a critical zzso In this report, we explore the role of zzso in zzso signaling by using mouse zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso or zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso is essential for zzso stimulation of both zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso while zzso zzso protein zzso zzso stimulation is not affected by zzso zzso To test the indirect mechanism for zzso stimulation of zzso zzso and zzso we use a zzso zzso protein composed of the membrane targeting signal and the zzso domain of zzso fused to the zzso portion of zzso the region including the binding sites for the complement of signaling proteins that are recruited by zzso We demonstrate that expression of the zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso responses, while expression of the zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso stimulation of both zzso and zzso These experiments underscore the essential role of zzso in zzso stimulation of the zzso zzso signaling zzso and provide further support for the indirect mechanism for zzso stimulation of zzso zzso involving regulated assembly of a zzso zzso
