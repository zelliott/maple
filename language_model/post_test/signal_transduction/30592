zzso to type 1 diabetes zzso is determined by interactions of multiple genes with unknown environmental zzso Despite the characterization of over 20 zzso regions for zzso identification of specific genes in these regions is still a formidable zzso In 2004, we first reported the cloning of a novel, small zzso modifier zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso on zzso zzso and presented strong genetic and functional evidence suggesting that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso studies have consistently confirmed this association in multiple Asian populations despite controversial observations in zzso In this review, we will update the genetic evidence supporting zzso as a zzso zzso gene and discuss the possible explanations for the zzso associations observed in zzso We will then discuss the mechanisms through which zzso contributes to the zzso of zzso
