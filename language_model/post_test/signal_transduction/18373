zzso evidence suggests that zzso function as major zzso cells in the pathological process of various human zzso We examined here the role of nuclear zzso zzso and zzso in the regulation of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso cell line, zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso stimulation also increased the expression of both zzso and zzso in zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso also increased the expression of zzso inhibitor of zzso protein zzso in zzso suggesting an zzso action for zzso on the zzso cascade in zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso showed a significant increase of nuclear zzso activity in zzso zzso When a potent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was added to zzso cell culture in the presence of zzso zzso was triggered by zzso of zzso which was induced by zzso zzso zzso expression was markedly suppressed in zzso zzso in the presence of zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso mostly inhibited zzso of zzso treated with zzso in the presence of zzso Furthermore, a zzso of zzso treated with zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso inhibitor was almost identical to that of zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso pathways involved in the zzso and zzso of human zzso could be zzso regulated by the use of zzso and zzso zzso thus enabling the control of zzso function and zzso
