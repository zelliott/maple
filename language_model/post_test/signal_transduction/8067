The development of zzso presents a major set of opportunities and challenges for the future progress of biological and life scientific zzso Major new tools are required and corresponding demands are placed on the zzso data generated and used in these zzso Nowhere is the demand greater than in the semantic integration of these zzso zzso Web tools and technologies afford the chance to achieve this semantic zzso Since zzso knowledge is central to much of the scientific research today it is a good zzso for semantic zzso Within the context of biological zzso the zzso initiative, part of a broader movement towards the zzso and integration of life science databases, forms a necessary prerequisite for its successful application of zzso in health care and life science zzso This paper examines whether zzso an effort to overcome the barrier of disparate and zzso zzso data sources, addresses the needs of zzso 

We demonstrate how zzso zzso data can be used to ask and answer some useful biological zzso We find that zzso comes close to meeting a broad range of zzso needs, but certain semantic weaknesses mean that these goals are zzso We make a series of recommendations for zzso some aspects of zzso to better meet these zzso 

Once these semantic weaknesses are zzso it will be possible to integrate zzso information in a manner that would be useful in zzso
