The suspect role of the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso was zzso by the discovery of a membrane zzso zzso that was also an zzso zzso factor zzso It is now established that the membrane zzso zzso zzso system is linked to the signaling of zzso factors, zzso and emerging evidence suggests that a new neural zzso zzso of membrane zzso zzso exists whose mechanism of signal zzso is different from those of the other membrane zzso This review will briefly discuss the zzso albeit zzso history of this signal zzso field, which will be followed by its current status and finally the direction it is zzso
