To investigate the zzso stress and inflammation in zzso cells zzso by different chain length fatty zzso 

zzso zzso cells cultured in zzso were divided into five groups, which were incubated with zzso medium without free fatty acid zzso short chain fatty acids zzso medium chain fatty acids zzso long chain fatty acids zzso very long chain fatty acids zzso Then cells in each group were zzso by zzso zzso reduced form of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and were subdivided as each zzso zzso group, zzso and zzso zzso Expressions of zzso and protein of zzso and zzso 2 zzso in zzso cells were detected by real-time zzso and western zzso 

zzso The zzso expression of zzso in zzso + zzso zzso + zzso zzso + zzso zzso + zzso zzso + zzso zzso + zzso group were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the protein expressions were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with other groups, the zzso and protein expressions of zzso in zzso + zzso zzso + zzso group were increased zzso zzso zzso Compared with zzso + zzso group, zzso and protein expressions of zzso in zzso + zzso and zzso + zzso group were significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso Compared with zzso + zzso group, zzso and protein expressions of zzso had no difference in zzso + zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso + zzso group was significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso but there was no difference in protein expression zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso in zzso + zzso zzso + zzso zzso + zzso zzso + zzso zzso + zzso zzso + zzso group were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the protein expressions were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with other groups, zzso and protein expressions of zzso in zzso + zzso and zzso + zzso group were significantly increased zzso zzso zzso Compared with zzso + zzso group, zzso and protein expressions of zzso in zzso + zzso and zzso + zzso group were decreased zzso zzso zzso Compared with zzso + zzso group, zzso and protein expressions of zzso in zzso + zzso and zzso + zzso group were all decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso The correlation analysis showed that there were significantly positive correlations between the zzso and protein expressions of zzso and zzso in zzso group zzso zzso zzso There were significantly positive correlations in protein expression zzso zzso zzso but no correlation in the zzso expression between zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso groups zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso stress and inflammation may exist in zzso cells which were zzso by zzso and zzso zzso signal zzso zzso may contributed in this zzso
