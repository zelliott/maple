We report a zzso analysis of zzso material from zzso and zzso zzso cancer, zzso zzso zzso proteins between patient matched normal zzso primary zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels of 1808 proteins changed significantly between normal and cancer zzso a much larger fraction than that reported in zzso zzso zzso cells exhibit extensive zzso in the zzso and nuclear zzso zzso similar changes in the zzso were observed comparing rapidly growing and differentiated zzso zzso In contrast, there was minimal zzso zzso between primary cancer and zzso suggesting that no drastic zzso changes are necessary for the tumor to zzso in a different tissue zzso Additionally, we introduce a new way to determine protein copy numbers per cell without protein zzso Copy numbers estimated in zzso and cancer cells are in good agreement with zzso and zzso cells and with the literature zzso Our zzso data set zzso allows mapping quantitative changes of functional protein classes, enabling novel insights into the biology of colon zzso
