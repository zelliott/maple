Although the development of the zzso system of humans and zzso model organisms has been well zzso relatively little is known about how the zzso zzso system zzso We define zzso milestones during zzso of the zzso zzso zzso liver, and zzso and identify important differences in the way the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso is zzso Such differences account for the finding that the zzso zzso system is assembled from individual organ zzso whereas the zzso zzso of zzso arise from a primitive gut zzso Despite differences of organ zzso zzso molecular programs regulate zzso zzso liver, and zzso development in zzso and zzso Specifically, we show that zzso zzso is a functional zzso of zzso a gene that is essential for the formation of the zzso and avian zzso Further, zzso zzso activity is required for this function in zzso as has been shown in other zzso We also show that a zzso zzso that zzso sonic zzso causes defects in the development of the esophagus that parallel those associated with targeted disruption of this gene in zzso zzso of sonic zzso also affects zzso liver and zzso development, and these effects occur in a zzso fashion, as has been described during zzso liver and zzso zzso zzso Together, these data define aspects of zzso system development necessary for the characterization of zzso zzso Given the similarities of zzso and zzso zzso physiology and zzso these findings have implications for zzso and evolutionary studies as well as research of human diseases, such as diabetes, liver zzso and zzso
