zzso cancer is among the three most common zzso in females in zzso zzso In the majority of cases, the tumor is confined to the zzso at the time of diagnosis and presents a good zzso However, after primary surgery, zzso to zzso of these tumors recur and have limited response to systemic zzso We carried out gene expression profiling of high-risk recurrence zzso zzso to identify new therapeutic approaches targeting the molecular pathways involved in the acquisition of an aggressive tumor zzso A zzso zzso analysis on a total of 51 human zzso zzso revealed 77 genes specifically altered in high-risk recurrence tumors zzso zzso zzso The zzso analysis of zzso interactions and molecular relationships among these genes pointed to a prominent role for zzso signaling in the acquisition of an aggressive zzso We further showed that zzso has a principal role at the initiation of zzso zzso invasion through the promotion of the zzso to zzso transition that leads to the acquisition of an invasive zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of this initial step with zzso a specific zzso zzso precluded further persistent zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, we showed that the characterization of the molecular changes associated with the acquisition of an aggressive zzso represents a realistic strategy for the rational identification and characterization of new potential therapeutic targets in an effort to improve the clinical management and the outcome of high-risk zzso cancer zzso
