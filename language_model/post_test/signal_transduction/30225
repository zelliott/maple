zzso were initially described some 50 years zzso For many decades, they remained predominantly of interest to structural zzso The identification of a molecular marker for these zzso zzso combined with the possibility to isolate such zzso and zzso regions as zzso membrane complexes paved the way to more rigorous characterization of zzso regulation, and zzso zzso with zzso mice for the zzso genes clearly demonstrate the importance of zzso and zzso in formation of zzso Nonetheless, zzso zzso are also found in cells lacking zzso expression and are referred to here as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were shown to represent membrane compartments enriched in a large number of signaling molecules whose structural integrity is essential for many signaling zzso zzso is an essential structural component of cell surface zzso important for regulating trafficking and mobility of these zzso In addition, zzso is found at many other zzso zzso Variations in zzso zzso are paralleled by a plethora of ascribed functions for this zzso Here, more recent data addressing the role of zzso in cellular signaling and the development of diseases like cancer will be zzso zzso
