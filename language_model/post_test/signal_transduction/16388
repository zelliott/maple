zzso is a critical early event in inflammatory arthritis, zzso zzso migration into the zzso resulting in invasion and destruction of zzso cartilage and zzso This study investigates the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso and invasion using zzso zzso cells and zzso whole tissue zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso zzso ex zzso were cultured with the zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso tissue was assessed by zzso zzso tube formation was assessed using zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured by zzso zzso cell surface expression was assessed by flow zzso Cell migration was assessed by wound repair scratch zzso zzso invasion, zzso and -9 expression were assessed using zzso invasion chambers and zzso To examine if the zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso induced zzso tube formation, invasion and migration zzso were performed in the presence of a specific zzso zzso (10 zzso and matched zzso zzso control zzso (10 zzso 

zzso and zzso were zzso to zzso zzso blood vessels, and zzso was zzso to zzso zzso blood vessels, zzso infiltrates and the lining zzso zzso significantly increased zzso tube formation zzso and zzso zzso production in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced cell surface expression of zzso from zzso level of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso induced an zzso fold increase in cell invasion compared to control zzso zzso also induced zzso cell migration and induced zzso and -9 from zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso tube formation and invasion zzso 

zzso zzso promotes zzso cell zzso and invasion, effects that are in part zzso through the zzso zzso pathway, key mechanisms involved in the zzso of zzso
