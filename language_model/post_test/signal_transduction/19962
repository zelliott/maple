zzso zzso is an essential zzso for all living zzso zzso zzso zzso is an important human food, animal feed and energy crop throughout the world, and enormous quantities of zzso fertilizer are required for zzso zzso Thus, it is important to improve the efficiency of the use of zzso fertilizer for zzso 

In this study, we analyzed the zzso root response to zzso zzso and performed a zzso analysis of the zzso zzso lateral root zzso zzso In the growth of plants, the zzso ratio zzso was reduced in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso solutions, but the ratio zzso exhibited by the plants in the LP solution was higher than that of the SP zzso The growth of primary roots was slightly promoted after 6 days of zzso zzso whereas the numbers of lateral roots and lateral root zzso were significantly reduced, and these differences were increased when associated with the stress caused by zzso zzso Among the results of a zzso analysis of the zzso lateral root zzso zone, there were two zzso 1) zzso signaling participated in the response and the modification of root zzso under zzso conditions, which may occur via local concentration changes due to the zzso and transport of zzso and zzso domain proteins may be an zzso between zzso signaling and root zzso and 2) the observed zzso of lateral root development was the result of zzso of DNA zzso transcription, protein synthesis and degradation and cell zzso 

These results indicated that zzso roots show a different growth pattern than zzso under zzso conditions, as the latter species has been observed to halt primary root growth when the root tip comes into contact with zzso zzso Moreover, our findings enrich our understanding of plant responses to zzso deficits and of root zzso in zzso
