The role of the zzso signaling members zzso zzso and zzso in zzso pancreatic development is not well zzso We therefore analyzed conditional zzso zzso and combined zzso knockout mice using zzso mice crossed with zzso zzso or zzso zzso Mice were analyzed at different embryonic stages for pancreatic zzso and zzso zzso The absence of zzso in pancreatic zzso cells impaired zzso zzso development up to embryonic day zzso and led to premature differentiation of pancreatic zzso into zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso formed during late embryonic and zzso development, suggesting an essential role of zzso in early but not late zzso zzso to this severe zzso the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso only moderately disturbed the proliferation of pancreatic zzso cells during early embryonic development, and did not inhibit pancreatic zzso Our results show that, in contrast to zzso zzso and zzso are not essential for zzso These data favor a zzso role of zzso in the development of the zzso zzso Furthermore, our findings suggest that in late stages of pancreatic development zzso cell differentiation and maintenance are independent of zzso
