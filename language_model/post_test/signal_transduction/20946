zzso zzso zzso C represents a family of zzso and zzso zzso which zzso the zzso transfer of zzso from zzso to zzso and zzso zzso on zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso a zzso change and thereby a modification of its functional zzso zzso zzso family consists of at least twelve members, divided in three zzso zzso zzso beta I, beta II, zzso new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The three zzso differ in zzso requirements and tissue zzso these differences in zzso dependency and regional distribution account for the differential zzso profile of the various zzso zzso zzso Different molecules involved in the zzso signaling network are zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso Many target proteins show a preferential pattern of zzso by the different zzso zzso zzso Through zzso zzso zzso the functional activity of many different zzso signaling systems which transport zzso messages from the membrane to the zzso zzso The induction of zzso processes by the protein zzso inhibitor zzso indicates a possible role for zzso in the zzso of the zzso mechanisms leading to zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso in both levels and activity of zzso recently found in some chronic neurodegenerative zzso lead to the possibility that zzso dysfunction could be involved in the zzso mechanisms of zzso
