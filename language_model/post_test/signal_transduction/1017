zzso T cells may play a key role in zzso production in zzso B zzso In addition, accumulating evidence has shown that zzso T cells participate in the attack on target cells or zzso through the overproduction of zzso zzso or an increase in zzso zzso Thus, the functional zzso of zzso T cells appears to be pivotal to an understanding of zzso zzso zzso evidence suggests that potential defects may reside in the zzso signal zzso around the zzso zzso We have demonstrated that the expression of zzso zzso chain is significantly decreased in peripheral blood T cells from zzso zzso To explore the mechanism of defective expression of zzso zzso chain, we examined zzso of zzso zzso and found that two alternatively spliced zzso such as zzso 7 zzso and short zzso are detected in zzso We review the possible role of the zzso zzso defects in zzso and discuss how the zzso zzso lead to zzso protein expression of zzso zzso zzso
