In mice, the zzso becomes zzso receptive to the hatched zzso on the day of zzso to allow its attachment to the zzso zzso and subsequent invasion into the zzso This zzso preparation for zzso is regulated by zzso and zzso acting through their zzso factor zzso Using zzso mice treated with zzso regimens of these hormones, combined with methods to isolate zzso specifically from the zzso zzso followed by zzso analysis on zzso zzso 222 genes whose transcript abundance was specifically increased by zzso and zzso treatment were zzso Gene zzso analysis revealed an emphasis on genes involved with immune responses, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso to zzso sections isolated through the first 6 d of pregnancy identified novel sets of genes such as Bach, zzso zzso zzso and zzso whose expression was restricted to the zzso zzso during the zzso zzso Particularly notable was the expression of the zzso for members of the signaling zzso from the zzso receptors to its downstream targets such as zzso The identification of these genes showing a cell type zzso regulated pattern of expression in the zzso suggests novel functions for them during zzso
