The nuclear factor of zzso zzso is a ubiquitous zzso factor that is key in the regulation of the immune response and zzso T cell zzso zzso zzso is in part required for zzso of zzso which is dependent on the zzso and degradation of zzso By using zzso and primary human T zzso we demonstrate that the simultaneous zzso of two second zzso of the zzso signal zzso protein zzso C zzso and zzso results in the synergistic zzso of the zzso zzso zzso complex but not of another putative zzso zzso zzso We also demonstrate that the zzso complex, but not zzso is responsible for the in zzso zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso of zzso and zzso Each second zzso is necessary, as zzso of either one reverses the zzso of the zzso complex and zzso zzso in zzso zzso of dominant negative forms of zzso and zzso demonstrates that only zzso is the target for zzso and zzso These results indicate that within the zzso signal zzso zzso both zzso and zzso are required for the effective zzso of the zzso complex and zzso in T zzso
