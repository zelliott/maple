zzso are zzso cells formed by multiple steps of cell differentiation from zzso cells of zzso zzso zzso in zzso differentiation is considered as an effective therapeutic approach to the treatment for bone diseases involving zzso In this study, we found that the organic compound zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was observed in mouse bone zzso cell cultures supported either by zzso with zzso or by adding zzso colony stimulating factor zzso and zzso zzso of nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activate the zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso and zzso suppressed this zzso zzso also inhibited the bone zzso activity of differentiated zzso It attenuated bone zzso zzso ring formation, and survival of mature zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and decreased induction of zzso were observed in mature zzso treated with zzso Thus, this novel zzso zzso may be useful for treating zzso zzso
