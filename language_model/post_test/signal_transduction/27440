Although one would normally expect a given regulatory element to perform best when it fully matches its consensus zzso this is generally far from being the zzso Usually, almost none of the actual sites fits the consensus exactly, and some of those that do fit do not perform zzso The main reason for that is the very nature of the sequences and the messages zzso they zzso Normally, any given stretch of the sequence with one or another regulatory site not only carries this regulatory message, but several more messages of various types as zzso These messages overlap with the regulatory element in such a way that the letter zzso which actually appears in any given sequence position simultaneously belongs to one or more additional zzso Apart from numerous individual codes zzso zzso specific for a given species or zzso there are many different general zzso sequence codes all interacting with one zzso These are the classical zzso code, DNA shape code, zzso code, gene zzso code, zzso code and many more, including those that have not yet been zzso Examples of overlapping of different codes and their interaction are discussed, as well as the role of zzso of the codes and the sequence complexity as a function of code zzso
