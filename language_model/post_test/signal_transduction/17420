Here, we aimed to clarify the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 in zzso zzso factor zzso effects after zzso zzso and zzso As a zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified to activate multiple zzso including zzso and zzso In models of zzso zzso zzso exerts both zzso effects and protective effects in zzso Similarly, zzso displays opposing effects in resident versus circulating zzso 

Using bone zzso zzso we generated zzso mice with zzso bone zzso inflammatory cells and zzso zzso resident cells zzso zzso zzso and zzso bone zzso cells zzso and zzso controls zzso with zzso bone zzso zzso All groups were treated with zzso or zzso control zzso before they underwent zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso increased zzso size and impaired cardiac function in zzso and zzso mice but ameliorated functional parameters in zzso mice, as analyzed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso blockade or zzso zzso zzso zzso was blunted in zzso mice and reduced by zzso blockade in zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso blockade attenuated collagen content in all groups in a zzso zzso 

The zzso and opposing effects of zzso after zzso zzso and zzso are largely zzso by zzso Although zzso zzso protective effects by improving zzso healing and function through zzso in resident cells, thereby zzso zzso effects through zzso protein zzso it exerts zzso effects on zzso inflammatory cells by increasing zzso zzso and zzso heart zzso These zzso findings should be considered when developing novel therapeutic strategies to treat zzso zzso
