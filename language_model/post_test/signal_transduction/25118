zzso zzso zzso an abundant nuclear zzso has been described as an important candidate for mediation of zzso by zzso zzso However, in cerebral zzso excessive zzso zzso may lead to energy depletion and zzso of zzso zzso We examined the effect of zzso zzso on the zzso degree of cerebral injury, zzso process of inflammatory responses, and zzso functional outcomes in a zzso rat model of focal zzso We demonstrate that administration of zzso a zzso zzso leads to a significant reduction of zzso zzso 63 zzso 2 zzso versus 28 zzso 4 zzso zzso The zzso effects currently observed 48 h zzso hold up at 7 and 17 days of survival time and zzso neurological zzso zzso of zzso activity, demonstrated by a reduction in zzso zzso formation, also reduces zzso recruitment and levels of zzso an indicator of zzso zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that zzso zzso reduces zzso damage and local inflammation associated with zzso and may be of interest for the treatment of zzso zzso
