Exposure of zzso cells to increases in zzso zzso activates the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso results in induction of a set of zzso responses, which allow cells to survive in zzso zzso Little is known about how the zzso zzso results in induction of these responses, mainly because no direct zzso for zzso have been zzso We conducted a zzso screening using zzso as a bait to identify zzso for the zzso and the zzso protein zzso was identified as an zzso for zzso Both zzso analyses and zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso binds strongly to the zzso region of zzso Upon zzso stress, zzso was zzso in zzso in a zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was able to zzso zzso when activated both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso occurred specifically at zzso a zzso located within the zzso putative zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso at zzso by zzso resulted in an increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso partially suppressed the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cells, suggesting that zzso is acting downstream of zzso zzso growth arrest caused by zzso of the zzso zzso was abolished by deletion of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of a zzso impaired (presumably dominant zzso zzso zzso resulted in a decrease of zzso in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso acts downstream of zzso controlling a subset of the responses induced by the zzso upon zzso zzso
