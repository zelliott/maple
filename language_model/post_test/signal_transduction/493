zzso tissue growth factor zzso zzso is zzso in systemic sclerosis zzso and has been hypothesized to be a key zzso of the pulmonary zzso frequently observed in this zzso zzso is induced by transforming growth factor beta zzso and is a zzso of some zzso effects of zzso in zzso This study was undertaken to investigate the role of zzso in enhanced expression of type I collagen in zzso lung fibrosis, and to delineate the mechanisms of action underlying the effects of zzso on zzso zzso gene type I zzso in this mouse model and in human pulmonary zzso 

zzso mice that were carrying zzso and zzso reporter genes driven by the zzso zzso and the zzso promoter, respectively, were injected with zzso to induce lung zzso (or saline as zzso and the extracted pulmonary zzso were incubated with zzso blocking zzso In zzso transient zzso zzso zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso were used to determine the mechanisms of action of zzso in pulmonary zzso 

In the mouse lung zzso zzso expression and promoter activity peaked 1 week after zzso challenge, whereas type I collagen expression and zzso promoter activity peaked 2 weeks zzso zzso isolated from the mouse lungs 14 days after zzso treatment retained a zzso expression pattern, characterized by greatly elevated levels of type I collagen and zzso protein and increased promoter zzso In zzso zzso of zzso by specific small interfering zzso and zzso zzso reduced the collagen protein expression and zzso promoter zzso Moreover, in zzso zzso zzso applied after zzso challenge significantly reduced the zzso promoter activity by approximately zzso The enhanced zzso promoter activity in zzso from zzso lungs was partly dependent on zzso zzso whereas zzso acted on the zzso promoter by a mechanism that was independent of the zzso binding site, but was, instead, dependent on the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect was mapped to the zzso promoter region surrounding the zzso zzso box, possibly involving zzso and zzso In human lung zzso the human zzso promoter responded in a similar manner, and the mechanisms of action also involved zzso and zzso zzso 

Our results clearly define a direct zzso effect of zzso and demonstrate its contribution to lung zzso through zzso zzso of zzso zzso strategies revealed the signaling mechanisms zzso These findings show zzso to be a rational target for therapy in zzso diseases such as zzso
