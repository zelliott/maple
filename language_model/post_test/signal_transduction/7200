zzso muscle overload zzso the expression of zzso factors such as vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso leading to new zzso zzso We found that the zzso increase in zzso as well as increases in zzso zzso and zzso transcripts were zzso in muscle zzso zzso mice, highlighting the critical role of zzso zzso in controlling this zzso The upstream zzso that contribute to zzso expression of zzso have yet to be zzso We found that muscle overload increased zzso zzso a precursor of zzso zzso II, and that zzso II signaling played an important role in zzso zzso production in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso released from zzso induced the zzso of zzso cells, as evidenced by elevated zzso cell zzso zzso We also found that zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso transcript levels in zzso zzso Interestingly, these responses also were observed in skeletal muscle zzso cells in response to zzso II treatment, indicating that these cells also can respond directly to the zzso The involvement of zzso II in muscle zzso zzso was zzso We found that blockade of zzso zzso II signaling using zzso did not zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, increased levels of zzso protein were detected in overloaded muscle from zzso zzso Similarly, we observed elevated zzso production in cultured zzso cells treated with zzso alone or in combination with zzso zzso These studies zzso establish the requirement for muscle derived zzso in zzso zzso and highlight a role for zzso II in zzso zzso production in skeletal zzso However, while zzso II signaling is activated following overload and plays a role in muscle zzso production, zzso of this zzso is not sufficient to halt zzso zzso indicating that zzso signals maintain zzso production in zzso zzso
