zzso is a critical zzso of cell death in many chronic and acute liver diseases and zzso zzso in primary zzso in zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso fails to provoke cell death in isolated zzso but has been implicated in zzso zzso during liver diseases associated with chronic zzso Here we report that zzso zzso primary zzso zzso cultured on collagen to zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso is zzso and is specifically zzso by zzso zzso itself is essential for the zzso but neither zzso zzso nor zzso zzso is responsible for this zzso Although zzso is shown to induce zzso zzso in zzso cultured on zzso the zzso effect of zzso is clearly dependent on zzso Moreover, both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso another B cell zzso 2 zzso domain 3 zzso zzso are crucial zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and Bid activate the zzso amplification loop and induce zzso c release, a hallmark of type II zzso The mechanism of zzso zzso is supported by a mathematical model that correctly reproduces the biological zzso Finally, our results are zzso relevant because zzso also zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso liver zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso can cooperate with zzso to induce zzso zzso by zzso the zzso proteins zzso and zzso
