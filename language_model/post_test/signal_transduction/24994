zzso growth is an zzso response of the heart to diverse pathological stimuli and is characterized by zzso enlargement, zzso zzso and zzso of a fetal program of cardiac gene zzso A variety of zzso signal zzso pathways have been implicated in cardiac zzso but whether these pathways are independent or zzso and whether there is specificity among them are zzso Previously, we showed that zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso or its target zzso factor zzso was sufficient to evoke zzso zzso in zzso Here, we show that activated zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso and zzso also induce zzso responses in zzso in zzso and that zzso zzso mice develop cardiac zzso with increased left zzso zzso diameter and decreased fractional zzso Crossing this transgenic line with mice expressing a zzso activated form of zzso revealed zzso between these signaling zzso We further show that zzso activates the zzso factor zzso through a zzso mechanism in the zzso heart in zzso zzso zzso is a less efficient zzso of zzso transcription, suggesting that the zzso and zzso pathways act in zzso These findings identify zzso as a downstream target for zzso signaling in the zzso heart and suggest that the zzso and zzso pathways zzso target different zzso factors to induce cardiac zzso
