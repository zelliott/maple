The zzso hormone zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso interact in the zzso to regulate neuroendocrine function and synaptic zzso Previously, our laboratory showed that 2 d zzso treatment zzso zzso expression and promotes zzso enhancement of zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso area zzso and zzso zzso This study examined the hypothesis that zzso aspects of female zzso function, including zzso expression and function in the zzso and zzso are zzso by brain zzso receptors zzso in female zzso zzso rats were implanted with a guide zzso aimed at the third zzso and treated in zzso with vehicle or zzso daily for 2 d before zzso zzso infusions of zzso a selective zzso zzso were administered every 12 zzso beginning 1 zzso before the first zzso zzso Administration of zzso during zzso zzso completely blocks zzso zzso hormone release and partially zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso behavior is restored by zzso infusion of zzso the second zzso implicated in zzso zzso of zzso In addition, blockade of zzso during zzso zzso prevents zzso increases in zzso binding density and zzso acute zzso enhancement of zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso These data document the existence of a novel mechanism by which zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso signaling in the zzso and zzso after zzso zzso These events may help coordinate the timing of zzso with the expression of sexual zzso
