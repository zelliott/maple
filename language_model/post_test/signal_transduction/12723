Bone zzso is zzso by complex interactions between tumor cells and resident zzso cells in the bone zzso The functions of zzso in zzso zzso remain poorly defined despite their zzso role in zzso degradation and tumor zzso Here, we show a mechanism zzso two distinct zzso a zzso and zzso with zzso motifs zzso and zzso zzso zzso orchestrate a zzso signaling cascade to zzso the bone zzso in favor of zzso and bone zzso zzso release of zzso zzso growth factor zzso growth factors, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and transforming growth factor alpha zzso from tumor cells suppress the expression of zzso zzso in zzso and subsequently zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso block zzso bone zzso by targeting zzso signaling in bone zzso zzso Furthermore, elevated zzso and zzso expression is associated with increased risk of bone zzso in breast cancer zzso This study established zzso and zzso in tumor cells, as well as zzso signaling in zzso as promising therapeutic targets for zzso bone zzso of breast zzso
