zzso a classical zzso is an zzso zzso in zzso junctions and has important functions in zzso zzso and cell zzso Recently we reported that a zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso an zzso in zzso zzso zzso associates with zzso and activates zzso which results in zzso zzso of zzso junction zzso However, the nature of such an interaction and its role in zzso zzso remain zzso In this report, we provide direct evidence that it is the zzso zzso zzso that regulates the activity of zzso and its association with zzso in zzso junction zzso zzso of zzso levels, either by zzso zzso or zzso alters zzso activity and its association with zzso zzso zzso caused zzso of zzso zzso junction assembly and a reduction of zzso protein zzso Furthermore, we provide evidence that this zzso zzso is involved, at least in part, in the zzso of zzso Along with the reduced expression of zzso loss and disruption of zzso and a zzso decreased zzso zzso was identified in the zzso zzso surrounding the zzso in zzso These findings suggest a novel function for zzso in the control of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
