Signal zzso zzso virtually every cellular function of zzso organisms, and its deregulation leads to a variety of zzso This intricate network of molecular interactions is zzso by proteins that are assembled into complexes within individual signaling zzso and their composition and function is often regulated by different zzso zzso zzso approaches are commonly used to analyze biological complexes and networks, but often lack the specificity to address the dynamic and hence transient nature of the interactions and the influence of the multiple zzso modifications that govern these zzso Here we review recent developments in zzso research to address these limitations, and discuss several technologies that have been developed for this zzso The zzso between these zzso and zzso tools, when applied together with global methods to the analysis of individual zzso complexes and zzso may allow researchers to unravel the underlying mechanisms of signaling networks in greater detail than previously zzso
