zzso tumors that produce abnormal zzso structures are repeatedly observed in zzso of mice that carry both zzso and zzso zzso The earliest zzso appear among the zzso ligament zzso cells, but later zzso include an zzso zzso zzso tumor development zzso the process of normal tooth formation, which requires multiple sequential cell signals, and results in cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso produce zzso zzso consistent with an zzso origin of these zzso As zzso regulatory sequences direct zzso expression in these mice, our findings also suggest that some of the zzso present in normal teeth may be locally produced and have a role in tooth mineral zzso The zzso of this zzso makes these mice an excellent model for studies of both normal and zzso zzso
