zzso anemia is a severe bone zzso failure syndrome resulting from zzso zzso of zzso anemia zzso zzso Gene and cell therapy trials using zzso stem cells and zzso have been hampered by poor zzso of zzso to peripheral blood in response to zzso Using a zzso model of zzso anemia zzso zzso we found that the zzso zzso was associated with a profound zzso in zzso stem cells and zzso zzso in response to zzso in absence of bone zzso failure, which zzso with the findings of clinical trials in zzso anemia zzso This zzso zzso was overcome by zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso suggesting that zzso signaling is implicated in the retention of zzso zzso stem cells and zzso in the bone zzso In view of these data, we propose that targeting zzso signaling may enhance zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
