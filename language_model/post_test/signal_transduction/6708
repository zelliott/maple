zzso zzso zzso of the zzso duct are still poorly characterized regarding zzso their molecular zzso during the development to invasive zzso zzso their zzso zzso and zzso their biological zzso We performed a zzso study that analyzed these issues in a large European zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso duct from 45 patients were graded and zzso using zzso markers and zzso In addition, tumors were analyzed for common zzso zzso and the findings were correlated with zzso and zzso Data were compared with those from 22 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a development from zzso low- to high-grade zzso zzso to invasive zzso zzso and zzso analysis revealed zzso zzso zzso of zzso and loss of zzso in zzso zzso zzso whereas loss of zzso was found in late zzso of tumor zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were rare zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were the most common, followed by gastric zzso and zzso zzso zzso Patients with zzso zzso zzso of the zzso duct showed a slightly better overall survival than patients with zzso zzso ratio zzso versus zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso The development of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso duct follows an zzso sequence that zzso with the zzso zzso of common zzso zzso Further large trials are needed to investigate and verify the finding of a better prognosis of zzso zzso zzso compared with conventional zzso
