The zzso and zzso involved in zzso signal zzso which have been detected in the nucleus of several cell types have been demonstrated to be responsive to zzso The complexity of this aspect of zzso function has been previously analyzed in some cell models characterized by a zzso or zzso response to specific zzso An interesting experimental model is represented by human derived zzso zzso cells, characterized by the expression of high affinity receptors for zzso 1 alpha zzso zzso which is one of the most potent zzso of bone zzso In particular, we investigated the earliest zzso events following the binding of zzso alpha to its zzso involving the zzso signal zzso zzso zzso cells present a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in fact, the nucleus contains both zzso beta 1 and gamma 1, while the zzso contains almost exclusively the gamma 1 zzso zzso alpha evokes a rapid and transient increase of the zzso beta 1 activity in the nucleus, which causes the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso In response to zzso zzso not only the zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to be zzso also the zzso lipids generated by zzso zzso zzso zzso which may act as second zzso appear to be zzso In fact, zzso cells present a nuclear zzso zzso activity which can be enhanced by the zzso alpha zzso Among the possible targets of the second zzso released by the nuclear zzso beta 1 zzso we found that some protein zzso C zzso namely the zzso and zzso which are present within the nucleus, are activated after zzso alpha zzso These activated zzso zzso in turn, could zzso the activity of the zzso factor zzso which, 5 zzso after zzso alpha treatment, has already zzso to the nucleus and bound to DNA to promote gene zzso The actual role of the zzso zzso in the zzso cell function has also been investigated by utilizing cell clones zzso with the mouse sequence of the zzso beta zzso
