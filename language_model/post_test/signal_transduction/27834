Studies from our laboratory have shown that exposure of human lung zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso their zzso This effect of zzso is likely to occur via zzso of signal zzso zzso To zzso zzso signal zzso mechanisms, we exposed zzso cells to zzso and determined the induced zzso zzso profile of zzso We demonstrate that, in these cells, zzso prominently induced zzso zzso of a zzso zzso This effect was observed as early as 30 zzso and was sustained for at least 24 zzso Treatment of cells with agents that abrogate zzso zzso zzso function, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C, or a selective zzso that blocks the association of zzso with zzso zzso zzso all failed to prevent zzso zzso zzso zzso an active site inhibitor of zzso activity, prevented the zzso zzso Treatment of cells with zzso growth factor, vascular zzso growth factor, or transforming growth zzso all of which are known to be activated by a zzso pathway, did not stimulate zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso induced an increase in zzso incorporation into DNA, and cell numbers were unaffected in the presence of zzso These results demonstrate that, in zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso protein via a zzso but zzso zzso This novel signaling zzso represents a putative mechanism by which zzso could influence zzso cell zzso
