zzso zzso is a severe stress condition that causes extensive zzso changes triggering cardiac cell zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso a heat shock protein present in all cells and a widely used marker of zzso zzso stress, functions in controlling the structural maturation of nascent zzso However, zzso was also found to be expressed on the cell surface of several cells such as zzso cells, zzso and tumor cells where it functions as a zzso for a variety of zzso in signaling zzso Recently, we have identified peptides from two different sources that specifically bind zzso zzso We have shown that binding of these peptides to zzso cell surface zzso resulted in zzso In this study, we first established the presence of cell surface zzso on cardiac zzso Analysis of zzso under zzso determined the significant increase in cell surface zzso in addition to gene expression and total zzso zzso that was significantly increased in zzso under hypoxic conditions was inhibited by the presence of the zzso zzso during zzso zzso of zzso was zzso by the binding of the zzso to zzso cell surface zzso resulting in blocking zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that reduced zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of cardiac cells induced by zzso zzso in a mouse model was also significantly inhibited by the administration of the zzso to mouse zzso Our findings may make zzso a useful therapeutic tool for zzso of zzso
