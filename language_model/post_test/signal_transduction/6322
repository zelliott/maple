zzso growth factor zzso zzso is frequently zzso in zzso zzso and its precursor zzso To gain insights into how zzso zzso affects cellular functions in primary human zzso cells, we performed gene expression profiling and identified zzso growth zzso protein zzso as the most zzso zzso zzso regulates cell proliferation through both zzso growth zzso and independent zzso We found that zzso zzso and protein expression was increased in zzso primary and immortalized human zzso zzso zzso was also zzso in zzso cells in zzso culture and in zzso transgenic zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was zzso in zzso of primary zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso of primary zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was observed in zzso of primary zzso zzso cell zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso of zzso in the preponderance of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso in zzso cancer cell lines at both zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso zzso by cancer cells was capable of binding to zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso growth factor appeared to regulate zzso expression in zzso cancer cell zzso Finally, suppression of zzso by small interfering zzso zzso cell zzso suggesting that zzso may inhibit tumor cell proliferation as a negative feedback zzso In aggregate, we have identified for the first time that zzso is an zzso regulated gene through the zzso signaling zzso and it may zzso zzso effects during zzso
