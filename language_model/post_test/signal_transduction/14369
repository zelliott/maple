We previously had shown that bilateral zzso infusion of 1 zzso nicotine (but not zzso zzso zzso led to an improvement in spatial memory retention in the Morris water maze task in male zzso We also reported that a similar type of bilateral infusion of zzso a protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused a deficit in spatial memory zzso In the present study, we wished to test the hypothesis that zzso infusion of zzso zzso zzso zzso also called zzso a membrane permeable selective zzso of zzso into the zzso region can cause an improvement in spatial memory in this maze zzso Indeed, bilateral infusion of 10 and 100 zzso zzso (but not 1 and 5 zzso zzso led to a significant reduction in escape zzso and travel distance zzso an improvement in spatial zzso compared to the zzso Also, bilateral infusion of zzso zzso nicotine or 1 zzso zzso alone did not lead to an improvement in spatial zzso However, such bilateral infusion of zzso at 1 and 5 zzso zzso infused within minutes after zzso zzso nicotine infusion improved spatial memory zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso zzso infusions improve spatial memory retention in male rats and that zzso can interact zzso with nicotine to improve spatial zzso
