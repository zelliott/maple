The signal zzso pathways that are activated by zzso and growth factors binding to their receptors on human zzso zzso are poorly zzso When zzso in suspension encounter many of these zzso they are not zzso but rather are primed for subsequent zzso We and others reported that when zzso are zzso onto zzso and zzso with zzso or with the zzso zzso zzso zzso they respond by releasing hydrogen zzso zzso and the specific zzso component zzso zzso growth zzso zzso is released by many cells including zzso It has been reported that zzso stimulates zzso but not zzso or zzso production by cells in zzso We hypothesized that zzso would activate zzso to release zzso when they were adherent to zzso a response zzso by zzso zzso In this study, we determined whether zzso zzso zzso and zzso release by zzso adherent to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso release from adherent zzso in a zzso manner, with effects seen in the range of zzso to 100 zzso Both zzso and zzso release were detected by 60 zzso and continued for at least 180 zzso zzso and spreading of zzso paralleled zzso and zzso zzso Ethanol zzso zzso blocked both zzso and zzso release, suggesting the involvement of the zzso D zzso In zzso labeled with zzso we observed that zzso treatment caused an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso blocked both zzso and zzso release, suggesting that the conversion of zzso acid to zzso is an important step in zzso zzso by zzso Overall, these results are similar to those reported for zzso zzso of adherent zzso and suggest that a common zzso is involved in both zzso and zzso zzso
