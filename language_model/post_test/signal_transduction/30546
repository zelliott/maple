zzso DNA damage elicits dramatic cell signaling zzso some of which are directed towards deciding the fate of that particular cell, while others lead to signaling to other zzso Each zzso cell type and tissue has a characteristic pattern of zzso gene zzso distinct from that of the zzso tissue and different from that of other zzso zzso It is the sum of such events, highly modulated by zzso that sometimes leads to zzso The challenge is to determine as to which of these phenomena have persistent effect that should be incorporated into models of how radiation increases the risk of developing zzso The application of systems biology to radiation effects may help to identify which biological responses are significant players in radiation zzso In contrast to the radiation biology paradigm that focuses on zzso changes, systems biology seeks to integrate responses at multiple scales zzso zzso zzso organ, and zzso A key property of a system is that some phenomenon emerges as a property of the system rather than of the zzso Here, the idea that cancer in an zzso can be considered as an emergent phenomenon of a zzso system is zzso Given the current research goal to determine the consequences of high and low radiation zzso broadening the scope of radiation studies to include systems biology concepts should benefit risk modeling of radiation zzso
