zzso has been identified as an important and independent risk factor for zzso coronary and peripheral zzso However the mechanisms by which homocysteine promote zzso plaque formation are not clearly zzso Earlier reports have suggested that homocysteine exert its effect via the zzso produced during its zzso To evaluate which zzso molecules are involved in homocysteine induced zzso changes during the zzso of vascular diseases, we examined homocysteine induced smooth muscle cell proliferation in the presence of different signal zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso is involved in homocysteine induced DNA synthesis and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells in the presence of the zzso scavenging zzso zzso Our data suggest that homocysteine zzso smooth muscle cell growth through a zzso that is independent of zzso that involves zzso zzso zzso and that results in accelerated zzso
