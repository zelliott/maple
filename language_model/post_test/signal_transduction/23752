zzso zzso and zzso events play a key role in memory formation and various protein zzso and zzso have been firmly associated with memory zzso Here, we determined expression changes of protein zzso and zzso following retrieval of spatial memory in zzso mice in a Morris Water zzso task, using zzso zzso and zzso Western zzso Comparing changes following single and consecutive zzso we identified zzso and zzso expressed zzso some of which have never been implicated before in memory zzso On the basis of these findings we define a small signaling network associated with spatial memory zzso Moreover, we describe differential regulation and correlation of expression levels with behavioral performance of zzso zzso zzso Together with its recently observed genetic association to zzso disorders our data suggest a role of this zzso in balancing preservation and flexibility of learned zzso
