zzso bone growth results from coordination of proliferation and zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso vascular invasion, and completion of zzso bone formation in the growth zzso Although zzso and zzso zzso are well characterized zzso the understanding of factors governing this transition is not fully zzso Our hypothesis was that significant differential gene expression exists between zzso and zzso zzso that may provide clues to the regulation of this transition at the zzso zzso zzso zzso rat growth plate zzso from the zzso zone zzso and zzso zone zzso were isolated by laser capture zzso and then subjected to zzso zzso Confirmation of the differential expression of selected genes was done by in zzso zzso and quantitative reverse zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso A total of 40 transcripts showed at least twofold greater expression in the zzso compared to zzso at both 6 and 7 weeks of age, while 52 transcripts showed twofold greater expression in the zzso compared to zzso at these time zzso Many of the zzso expressed genes in each zone had very high levels of expression and thus were classified as zzso zzso for that zzso The zzso transcripts included zzso zzso zzso end zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso and zzso 1 zzso In contrast, zzso transcripts included collagen I, protein zzso zzso deficient zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 13 zzso and collagen zzso Other genes were highly expressed in cells from both zones, including collagen II, zzso cartilage zzso zzso cartilage link zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso transcripts showed an increased percentage of genes expressed in nuclear cell cycle and zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso transcripts were more involved in zzso structure and membrane zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that transforming growth factor beta and zzso zzso protein zzso pathways were important in both zones, and bone zzso protein zzso played a role in the zzso It is likely that these zzso expressed genes are involved in regulation of the transition from proliferation to differentiation functions in the growth zzso
