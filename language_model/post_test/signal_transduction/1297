In the human zzso a close zzso relationship exists between duct cells and beta zzso This explains the high proportion of duct cells in isolated human zzso zzso We investigated whether human duct cells are a source of zzso interactions with beta cells and immune zzso This zzso has been implicated in the development of zzso diabetes in zzso 

Human duct cells were isolated from donor zzso and examined for their ability to produce zzso following a zzso zzso zzso zzso was tested for its in zzso effects on survival of human beta cells and on zzso of human zzso zzso 

Exposure of human pancreatic duct cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso synthesis of the 26,000 zzso zzso precursor and conversion to the 17,000 zzso mature form, which is rapidly zzso This effect is zzso and involves zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso contributed to zzso zzso of isolated human beta zzso It also induced zzso of human zzso zzso 

Human pancreatic duct cells are a potential source of zzso that can cause zzso of zzso beta cells and initiate an immune response through zzso of zzso zzso They may thus actively participate in inflammatory and immune processes that threaten beta cells during development of diabetes or after human zzso cell zzso have been zzso
