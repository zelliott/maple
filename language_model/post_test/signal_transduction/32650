Upon transforming growth zzso zzso binding to its zzso zzso zzso and zzso form zzso and zzso the zzso signal to the zzso In addition to the zzso pathway, another zzso involving a member of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso However, it is unknown how these pathways function together to zzso amplify zzso zzso Here we report that the zzso factor zzso (also called zzso is bound by a zzso of zzso and zzso upon zzso zzso zzso is one member of the zzso family that binds to the zzso response element, and its activity is enhanced after zzso by zzso protein zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso The binding between zzso and zzso is zzso via the zzso region of the zzso proteins and the basic zzso zzso region of zzso zzso signaling also zzso the zzso of zzso via zzso and zzso Both of these actions are shown to be responsible for the synergistic stimulation of zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso plays a central role in zzso signaling by acting as a common nuclear target of both zzso and zzso zzso
