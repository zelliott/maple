zzso in zzso zzso develop in a variety of cells after an induction phase, called zzso the duration of which depends on the magnitude of external zzso zzso in zzso indicate that the period and zzso of zzso zzso both decrease as the level of the stimulus zzso We analyze the correlation between period and zzso in a model recently proposed for zzso zzso zzso We show that the linear relationship between period and zzso observed in the experiments arises naturally in this model as a result of the mechanism of zzso zzso release on which it is zzso
