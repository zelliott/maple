zzso has been identified as a potent zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanism responsible for its zzso property is zzso In this study, we examined the effect of zzso on zzso cell zzso zzso and migration in a cell culture zzso We found that zzso was expressed in blood vessels zzso and human zzso vein zzso cells zzso zzso significantly enhanced zzso cell zzso to various zzso zzso This effect was dependent on the zzso of zzso zzso which subsequently led to distribution pattern changes of zzso and zzso These results indicated that zzso affects cell zzso and zzso reorganization through an zzso signal zzso zzso Analysis of zzso following zzso treatment revealed increased zzso zzso activities and zzso zzso levels, consistent with increased cell zzso Interestingly, when zzso were induced to migrate by migration zzso factor zzso active zzso and zzso small zzso levels were decreased dramatically at 30 zzso following zzso zzso Using zzso zzso at zzso as an indicator of focal zzso zzso zzso zzso had elevated zzso zzso compared with the mock treated zzso The results were a reduction in focal zzso zzso and the zzso in zzso zzso This study zzso a mechanism by which zzso exerts its effect on zzso zzso and migration through an zzso signal zzso zzso
