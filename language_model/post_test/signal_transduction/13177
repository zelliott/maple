This review focuses on the zzso specificity of the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso toxin zzso zzso proteins that mediate diverse signaling zzso including regulation of zzso channels and other zzso Several lines of evidence indicate that specific combinations of G protein zzso beta and gamma zzso are required for different receptors or zzso networks, and that a higher degree of specificity for zzso and zzso is observed in intact systems than reported in zzso The structural zzso of zzso protein specificity remain incompletely zzso and involve zzso protein interaction zzso and perhaps other scaffolding zzso By identifying G protein specificity for individual zzso signaling zzso zzso targeted to disrupt individual pathways of a given zzso could be zzso
