The vascular zzso growth factor zzso has beneficial effects on zzso zzso during in zzso maturation and their subsequent early embryonic development, but the zzso zzso underlying this effect has not been zzso zzso the focus of the present study was to investigate the zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in response to the addition of zzso to the maturation zzso and to study the zzso zzso of zzso and its receptors during zzso zzso zzso We concluded that: zzso zzso mainly localized in the zzso whereas its zzso zzso zzso and zzso domain region zzso were localized on the plasma membrane of zzso zzso the addition of 5 zzso zzso increased the percentage of zzso with zzso first polar bodies zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment zzso control, zzso P zzso zzso and the rate of zzso competent to undergo nuclear maturation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso as the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased after supplementation with 5 zzso expression of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso were zzso in a zzso zzso We zzso that, in a zzso manner, zzso zzso bound to zzso its main zzso and then activated the zzso signaling pathway, which promoted maturation of zzso zzso However, the zzso system also had an zzso regulatory loop that contributed to creating an environment optimal for zzso zzso
