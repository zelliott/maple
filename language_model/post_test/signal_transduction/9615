zzso state often zzso zzso and in zzso zzso food stimulates aversive responses zzso by the zzso zzso sensory zzso In the present study, we have characterized the role of key zzso zzso that zzso zzso aversive behavior in response to changing nutritional zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso play zzso roles in food zzso zzso zzso activates zzso on the zzso and zzso on the zzso zzso and stimulates aversive responses, suggesting that zzso zzso stimulation involves local changes in zzso levels zzso by zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso activates zzso on the zzso zzso zzso to inhibit zzso suggesting zzso zzso and zzso roles for zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso express zzso an zzso zzso that appears to cell autonomously inhibit zzso zzso Food also zzso directional decisions after reversal is complete, through the same zzso zzso and receptors involved in the initiation of zzso and the decision to continue forward or change direction after reversal is dictated entirely by nutritional zzso These results highlight the complexity of the zzso zzso and zzso signaling in the zzso of zzso aversive zzso
