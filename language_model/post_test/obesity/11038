An increased number of zzso in zzso tissue is associated with insulin resistance and zzso dysfunction in obese zzso However, little is known about other immune cells in zzso tissue from obese people, and whether they contribute to insulin zzso We investigated the characteristics of T cells in zzso tissue from metabolically abnormal zzso obese zzso subjects, metabolically normal zzso obese zzso subjects, and lean zzso zzso sensitivity was determined by using the zzso zzso clamp zzso 

We assessed plasma zzso zzso and subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso zzso populations in 9 lean, 12 zzso and 13 zzso zzso zzso muscle and liver samples were collected from 19 additional obese patients undergoing zzso surgery to determine the presence of selected zzso zzso 

zzso tissue from zzso subjects had 3- to zzso increases in numbers of zzso T cells that produce zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso 17 and zzso zzso compared with zzso and lean zzso zzso subjects also had increased plasma zzso of zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso were expressed in human liver and skeletal muscle zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso of zzso in skeletal muscle isolated from rats and reduced insulin sensitivity in cultured human zzso 

zzso tissue from zzso individuals contains increased numbers of zzso and zzso cells, which produce zzso that cause zzso dysfunction in liver and muscle in zzso Additional studies are needed to determine whether these zzso in zzso tissue T cells contribute to the zzso of insulin resistance in obese zzso
