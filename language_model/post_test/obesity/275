To assess the association of indicators of general and abdominal obesity with the prevalence of type 2 diabetes zzso and intermediate zzso zzso in the Chinese zzso 

We used data of 50 zzso adults aged zzso years in the 2002 China National Nutrition and Health zzso zzso Chinese zzso values were used for zzso (24 zzso and waist circumference zzso 85 zzso in men, 80 zzso in zzso zzso zzso for zzso ratio zzso were determined from analyses of zzso characteristic zzso zzso 

The prevalence of zzso and zzso was zzso % and zzso % zzso zzso curve analyses indicated zzso as the optimal zzso value for zzso in both zzso High zzso zzso and zzso were all associated with the prevalence of zzso tolerance zzso with the highest prevalence ratio zzso for high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 95 % zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 95 % zzso zzso zzso When combining zzso and zzso in men either a high zzso or a high zzso alone was associated with increased zzso Among women, a high zzso without a zzso high zzso was not associated with increased zzso tolerance abnormalities risk, whereas a high zzso was associated with risk irrespective of zzso 

Among the Chinese adult population measures of central obesity are better zzso of zzso tolerance abnormalities prevalence than zzso A zzso zzso point of zzso for both men and women can be considered as optimum for predicting zzso diabetes and may be a useful tool for screening and health zzso
