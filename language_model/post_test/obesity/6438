To examine the effects of a cafeteria diet and a chronic treatment with zzso zzso zzso on mature zzso female zzso 

zzso zzso rats zzso to 400 zzso were divided into two groups: highly palatable food zzso and normal rat zzso zzso Both groups had zzso zzso access to rat zzso The zzso group had access to chocolate bars, cookies, cheese, and nuts zzso 20 zzso After 21 days, the rats in each group were then divided into control and treated zzso zzso delivering saline or zzso (1 zzso per day) for minimally 28 days were zzso zzso consumption was measured for 17 days in a second group of rats implanted with zzso containing zzso (1 zzso per day) or zzso 

zzso rats ate less zzso rat zzso than zzso zzso After 20 days, the zzso group had reached a plateau and weighed significantly more zzso zzso than the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 17 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rats and zzso rats receiving zzso reduced their zzso intake and body weight in the initial 2 weeks of treatment zzso 14, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso intake returned to zzso values, although body weights remained reduced in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso consumption was increased in rats treated with zzso 

This suggests that zzso initially reduced body weight by limiting food zzso however, maintenance of weight is most likely due to increased energy expenditure under conditions of normal and highly palatable diets in mature zzso
