zzso manipulation of zzso or fat intake could alter subsequent ad zzso food zzso 

In a controlled zzso study, we investigated whether zzso manipulation of zzso or fat would alter subsequent ad zzso energy zzso zzso zzso subjects (age range zzso zzso 15 zzso % body fat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were fed for 3 days an zzso zzso diet zzso zzso zzso zzso fat, zzso zzso and a high-fat diet zzso 50% fat, zzso zzso zzso zzso in random order each followed by 3 days of ad zzso food zzso 

There were no differences in mean daily energy intake zzso following each diet zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso or in the percent of weight maintenance energy needs zzso 173 zzso 41 zzso 173 zzso zzso P zzso zzso However, the individual difference in zzso between the zzso versus HC diet zzso both on day one and over the 3 days of each ad zzso period was zzso associated with % body fat zzso and waist circumference zzso 1: zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso mean day 1-3 zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

A short-term zzso HC diet did not result in overall lower zzso compared with a zzso diet in the same zzso However, we did find that increasing body fat was associated with less decline in zzso following the HC versus zzso diet indicating that increasing zzso is associated with altered regulation of zzso in response to zzso zzso
