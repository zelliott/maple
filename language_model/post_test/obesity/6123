zzso studies in patients with severe zzso obesity have provided insights into the molecular and zzso pathways that regulate body weight in zzso We report a 19-year-old male with zzso and severe zzso mild learning difficulties and zzso in whom diagnostic tests for zzso syndrome zzso had been zzso We carried out detailed clinical and zzso zzso of this patient and investigated the genetic basis of this obesity syndrome using zzso 185 k array comparative zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The identified deletion was validated using multiplex zzso probe amplification and long-range zzso followed by zzso sequencing which enabled precise zzso of the zzso We identified a approximately zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso that encompasses zzso small zzso zzso (including zzso zzso which were not expressed in peripheral zzso from the zzso zzso of the clinical zzso revealed increased ad zzso food zzso normal zzso zzso rate when adjusted for zzso mass, partial zzso zzso and growth zzso We have identified a novel deletion on zzso zzso in an individual with zzso zzso zzso and other features associated with zzso which is normally caused by zzso of several zzso expressed imprinted transcripts within zzso zzso a region that includes multiple zzso genes as well as several zzso zzso These findings provide direct evidence for the role of a particular family of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso in human energy zzso growth and zzso
