With the increasing rates of zzso many people diet in an attempt to lose zzso As weight loss is seldom maintained in a single effort, weight cycling is a common zzso Unfortunately, reports from clinical studies that have attempted to determine the effect of weight cycling on mortality are in zzso and to date, no controlled animal study has been performed to assess the impact of weight cycling on zzso zzso our objective was to determine whether weight cycling altered lifespan in mice that experienced repeated weight gain and weight loss throughout their zzso 

Male zzso mice were placed on one of three lifelong zzso a low-fat zzso diet, a high-fat zzso diet or a zzso diet in which the mice zzso between 4 weeks on the zzso diet and 4 weeks on the zzso zzso Body weight, body zzso several blood parameters and lifespan were zzso 

zzso between the zzso and zzso diet resulted in large fluctuations in body weight and fat zzso These gains and losses corresponded to significant increases and zzso respectively, in zzso zzso zzso IGF-1, zzso insulin and zzso zzso Surprisingly, weight zzso mice had no significant difference in lifespan zzso zzso as compared to zzso controls zzso zzso despite being overweight and eating a zzso diet for half of their zzso In contrast, the zzso group experienced a significant decrease in lifespan zzso zzso compared with zzso controls and zzso zzso 

This is the first controlled mouse study to demonstrate the effect of lifelong weight cycling on zzso The act of repeatedly gaining and losing weight, in itself, did not decrease lifespan and was more beneficial than remaining zzso
