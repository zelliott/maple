zzso has been shown to improve peripheral insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic patients and animal zzso We examined the effect of zzso on the expression of zzso zzso 4 zzso in muscle and zzso tissue from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an animal model of obese type 2 diabetes zzso In addition, the effects of zzso on zzso zzso and on zzso transport activity in zzso were also zzso Muscle and zzso zzso were isolated from zzso male zzso and zzso zzso rats at a dose of 150 zzso per day for 14 zzso In skeletal muscle, the protein and zzso levels of zzso were not significantly different between zzso and control rats and they were not affected by zzso On the other hand, zzso protein and zzso levels in zzso tissue from zzso rats were significantly decreased zzso compared with control rats and they were significantly increased zzso zzso by zzso zzso had no major effect on zzso zzso in zzso but it significantly increased zzso zzso the zzso and zzso amounts of zzso in plasma membrane zzso in zzso from zzso zzso zzso with these results, the zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso from zzso zzso rats were significantly increased zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso may exert beneficial effects on insulin resistance by increasing the expression of zzso in zzso zzso
