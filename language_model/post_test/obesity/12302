We tested the hypothesis that obesity reduced circulating number of zzso zzso cells zzso zzso ability, and blood flow in zzso tissue that could be reversed after obesity zzso 

zzso zzso mice zzso were equally divided into group 1 zzso with zzso control zzso group 2 zzso high fat zzso and group 3 zzso high fat diet, followed by zzso control zzso Critical limb zzso zzso was induced at week 20 in groups 2 and zzso The animals were sacrificed at the end of 22 zzso 

Heart weight, body weight, abdominal fat weight, serum total cholesterol level, and zzso blood sugar were highest in group 2 (all zzso The numbers of circulating zzso zzso zzso zzso were lower in groups 1 and 2 than in group 3 at zzso after zzso induction zzso The numbers of differentiated zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso tissue after zzso zzso were also lowest in group 2 zzso zzso expressions of zzso zzso index, zzso and zzso were higher, whereas the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were lower in group 2 than in groups 1 and 3 (all zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso the number of small vessel zzso and blood flow through zzso zzso scanning of zzso area were lower in group 2 compared to groups 1 and 3 on day 14 after zzso induction (all zzso 

zzso suppressed abilities of zzso and recovery from zzso that were reversed by obesity zzso
