In the present study, we investigated the influences of a high fat diet zzso fed for 12 weeks, on zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso region zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Body weights and body weight gains were significantly higher in HD fed zzso mice than in low fat diet zzso fed zzso and zzso or HD fed zzso zzso In the HD fed zzso and zzso mice, zzso zzso and protein levels were much higher than in the zzso fed zzso or zzso zzso In particular, zzso zzso and protein levels in HD fed zzso mice was higher than that in the HD fed zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in the zzso cells of zzso mice, while in the zzso mice zzso zzso was observed in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso fed zzso and zzso mice was slightly, but not significantly decreased compared to that in the HD fed zzso and zzso mice, zzso In addition, zzso zzso adapter zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso in the HD fed zzso showed zzso of zzso which is the characteristics of activated zzso These results suggest that HD fed zzso mice are more susceptible to zzso zzso in the zzso than in zzso fed zzso and zzso or HD fed zzso mice without any differences of zzso zzso
