Over the past two decades, zzso has been studied in more than zzso thousand zzso A classical zzso zzso was among the first factors zzso from zzso tissue that were found to promote zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso consistently decline with increasing body mass zzso Clinical and basic science studies have identified zzso zzso actions, providing a zzso link to the increased zzso of cardiovascular disease in obese zzso While progress has been made in identifying receptors essential for the zzso actions of zzso zzso and zzso few studies have examined the zzso signaling pathways in cardiovascular zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was recently identified as critical for the zzso and zzso actions of zzso zzso is abundantly present on the surfaces of vascular and muscle zzso through a direct interaction with zzso zzso with this zzso zzso is absent from zzso zzso Since zzso lacks an zzso domain, additional studies would further our understanding of this signaling zzso Here, we review the diverse zzso actions of zzso
