To examine the effect of zzso weight and body mass index zzso on the risk of hip and knee replacement in middle-aged zzso 

In a prospective cohort study zzso zzso women aged zzso zzso who were recruited in the UK in zzso were followed over zzso zzso for incident primary hip and knee zzso 

zzso weight and zzso were all associated with the risk of hip and knee zzso Comparing the tallest group zzso zzso with the shortest zzso zzso the relative risks were zzso zzso zzso for hip replacement and zzso zzso zzso for knee zzso Comparing the heaviest group zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso the relative risks of hip and knee replacement were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Comparing obese women zzso 30 zzso to women with a zzso zzso zzso the relative risks for hip and knee replacement were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These effects did not vary according to age, education, alcohol and tobacco consumption, or with use of hormonal zzso Currently, an estimated zzso of hip replacements and zzso of knee replacements in middle-aged women in the UK are attributable to zzso 

In middle-aged women, the risk of having a hip or knee replacement increases with both increasing height and increasing zzso From a clinical perspective, relatively small increases in average zzso among middle-aged women are likely to have a substantial impact on the already increasing rates of joint replacement in the zzso
