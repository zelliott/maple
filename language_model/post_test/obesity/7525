The present study was performed to examine the effects of garlic on obesity and blood zzso profiles in high-fat induced obesity mice model, and to zzso the molecular mechanisms responsible for such zzso zzso mice were fed a standard diet zzso or high-fat diet zzso for 5 weeks to induce zzso Mice were then randomly divided into four groups with 10 mice per group, and fed experimental diet for 4 zzso zzso group, zzso group, zzso containing zzso or zzso garlic group zzso + zzso or zzso + zzso zzso Administration of garlic significantly reduced zzso body weight, zzso fat zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso indexes were reduced by zzso and zzso respectively, in zzso and zzso garlic supplemented zzso Liver zzso induced by zzso was ameliorated by garlic zzso Furthermore, garlic affected the down regulation of expression patterns of zzso zzso tissue genes such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specific fatty acid binding protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that garlic may have a potential benefit in preventing zzso
