Recent estimates suggest that obesity accounts for zzso of US total direct health care costs, but these estimates have not accounted for the increased death rate among obese zzso This article examines whether the estimated direct health care costs attributable to obesity are offset by the increased mortality rate among obese zzso 

Data on death rates, relative risks of death with zzso and health care costs at different ages were used to estimate direct health care costs of obesity from 20 to 85 years of age with and without accounting for increased death rates associated with zzso zzso analyses used different values of relative risk of death, given zzso and allowed the relative costs due to obesity per unit of time to vary with zzso 

zzso health care costs from 20 to 85 years of age were estimated to be approximately zzso lower when differential mortality was taken into zzso zzso analyses suggested that direct health care costs of obesity are unlikely to exceed zzso or to be lower than zzso 

Increased mortality among obese people should be accounted for in order not to overestimate health care zzso
