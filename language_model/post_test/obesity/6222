Recent studies from our laboratory have shown that the rate at which insulin activates zzso disposal in zzso is much slower in obese subjects compared with lean zzso To determine if this was caused by an zzso in zzso of zzso zzso transport at the cellular level, we measured the rate at which insulin zzso zzso transport in human zzso from obese zzso zzso rates of zzso transport in the absence of insulin were lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso in zzso from obese subjects zzso zzso 10) than in lean control subjects zzso zzso zzso but this did not achieve statistical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transport rates were significantly decreased in obesity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso It took longer for zzso from obese subjects to achieve zzso zzso of zzso zzso transport than those from lean subjects (15 zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso The slower overall rates of zzso of zzso zzso zzso transport observed in zzso from obese subjects mirror the slower rates of stimulation of zzso disposal in zzso which suggests that the in zzso findings are caused by a cellular zzso in insulin action at a step beyond the binding of insulin to its zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
