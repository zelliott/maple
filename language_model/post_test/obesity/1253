The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of reduced peripheral insulin sensitivity, beta cell zzso and reduced zzso insulin clearance in the zzso of lean and obese zzso zzso A total of 35 women with zzso zzso syndrome zzso and 10 lean zzso controls underwent an oral zzso tolerance test and an zzso clamp zzso zzso patients were classified into four groups according to their zzso and insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and results were compared between groups and with the zzso All the zzso groups showed significantly higher insulin zzso than zzso there were no differences in insulin response to zzso load between lean and obese zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso was greater in zzso groups than zzso All the zzso zzso patients had lower values of zzso insulin zzso independent of zzso when compared either with controls zzso zzso or with zzso zzso women zzso zzso zzso and zzso obese patients had similar total body zzso zzso zzso zzso which was lower than in lean zzso subjects and zzso Our results suggest that evaluation of insulin resistance alone does not fully characterize the zzso population; differences in liver metabolism of insulin are present in obese insulin resistant subjects and in lean patients with normal insulin sensitivity when divided into zzso and zzso zzso zzso resistance and zzso may represent two distinct features of the insulin disorder in zzso the former appear to reflect the presence of zzso while the latter may be a primary feature of zzso
