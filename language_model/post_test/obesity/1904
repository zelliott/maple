It has been previously demonstrated that obesity is common among women with low socioeconomic status zzso but the factors accounting for this association are not well zzso According to our hypothesis, low zzso is associated with zzso stress, an zzso lifestyle, and zzso history, which may increase the likelihood of women with low zzso to be overweight or zzso 

We examined overweight and obesity in relation to zzso among 300 healthy women ages zzso years, who constitute the control group of the Stockholm Female zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso study of women with coronary heart zzso This control group was compared with a large zzso sample and found to be representative of healthy Swedish women ages zzso zzso We used an zzso of education and occupation as a measure of zzso and defined overweight as body mass index zzso between zzso and zzso zzso and obesity as zzso zzso zzso 

Low zzso was a strong zzso of overweight and obesity among middle-aged healthy Swedish zzso The odds of being overweight or obese increased with lower social zzso After adjustment for age, the odds ratios for overweight and obesity among women in a low vs high position were zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso Both low social position and obesity were related to zzso history zzso parity and earlier age at zzso zzso dietary habits, and zzso zzso factors zzso quality of life, low self-esteem, and job zzso These factors together explained zzso of the zzso zzso 

zzso history, zzso dietary habits, and zzso stress accounted for a large part of the association between low zzso and zzso zzso habits and zzso stress are potentially modifiable factors, which should be taken into account in intervention programs among women with low zzso
