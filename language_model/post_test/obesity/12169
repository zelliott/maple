The fact that zzso occurs in simple obesity and mild zzso intolerance has been well zzso zzso zzso insulin extraction may influence the levels of circulating zzso The simultaneous measurement of insulin and zzso zzso in peripheral blood enables an in zzso zzso of zzso insulin zzso To evaluate zzso insulin zzso insulin and zzso responses to oral zzso were studied in 176 obese and zzso subjects with normal, impaired, or diabetic zzso zzso zzso levels as well as insulin incremental areas in zzso intolerant subjects were significantly higher than in zzso zzso The levels of zzso as well as zzso incremental areas were only slightly enhanced in subjects with impaired zzso zzso whereas they were reduced in subjects with diabetic zzso The zzso ratios of zzso to insulin, both in the zzso state and after zzso of zzso as well as the relationship between the incremental areas of the two peptides were used as measures of zzso insulin zzso They were significantly reduced in zzso intolerant subjects and, to a lesser extent, in zzso obese zzso These results indicate that peripheral zzso in subjects with simple obesity or impaired zzso tolerance is a result of both pancreatic zzso and diminished zzso insulin zzso In subjects with a more severe degree of zzso zzso decreased zzso insulin removal is the primary cause of zzso
