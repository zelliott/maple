zzso has been considered a potential risk factor for complications during zzso zzso The purpose of this study is to zzso investigate the association of various obesity zzso and zzso factors in zzso donor zzso 

This study included 70 and 44 patients who underwent zzso donor zzso by a zzso approach and zzso approach, zzso We measured fat thickness and fat areas on zzso computerized zzso zzso zzso The median value of fat thickness or of the subcutaneous fat area, visceral fat area, zzso fat area, or total fat area among subjects was used as a zzso to define fatty and zzso zzso The operative time and estimated blood loss were then compared between the two zzso 

In the zzso approach group, there was no statistically significant difference in any of the zzso or zzso factors between the fatty and zzso groups defined using any of the fat zzso In the zzso approach group, patients in the fatty group zzso by zzso fat thickness and visceral fat area had significantly greater estimated blood loss than those in the zzso zzso Also, in the zzso approach group, patients in the fatty group zzso by zzso fat area had significantly greater estimated blood loss and longer operating time than those in the zzso group zzso and zzso zzso 

The results indicate that the visceral fat, and in particular the zzso fat area measured using CT scan imaging, influences operating time and estimated blood loss after zzso approach surgery but not in zzso approach zzso In donors with a high volume of zzso fat, the zzso approach may be recommended for zzso zzso
