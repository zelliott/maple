zzso cycles zzso are formed by a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso the difference between zzso and zzso forming the zzso zzso zzso through the route of which the cycle is zzso SC zzso regulatory effects, zzso amplify or reduce the % change in zzso compared to the % change in zzso and zzso thus affecting the sensitivity to regulatory factors, including zzso A formula is given to calculate (with an approximation of zzso zzso the zzso response zzso zzso zzso the factor by which the % change in zzso plus the % change in zzso must be multiplied to obtain the % change in zzso zzso when zzso and zzso undergo opposite, zzso changes (as is often the case in zzso zzso The formula is: zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso By this formula we evaluated the zzso activities of zzso and zzso (which roughly reflect zzso zzso production and zzso respectively), zzso the two zzso that catalyze the cycle between zzso zzso and zzso Based on data obtained in normal, zzso diabetic and obese diabetic subjects as well as in normal, zzso and obese diabetic zzso mice, we found that zzso was reduced in non-obese diabetic humans and animals whereas it was increased in zzso humans and mice, compared to normal zzso Thus, diabetes without obesity zzso and obesity with diabetes increases, the sensitivity of the zzso cycle to regulatory zzso
