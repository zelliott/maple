We have previously reported that weight gain induced by high-fat diet zzso leads to an increase in mean zzso pressure zzso zzso and heart rate zzso zzso in the adult zzso In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that an increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system may contribute to the development of zzso zzso A combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso + zzso was chronically administered to rabbits housed in zzso cages for continuous monitoring of zzso pressure by zzso 24 h a zzso After 2 weeks of zzso blockade under control diet, animals were switched to zzso for the next 6 zzso zzso induced a progressive increase in body weight, but no increase in mean zzso pressure zzso and a slight increase in heart rate zzso zzso animals fed normal diet showed no changes in zzso or zzso with long-term zzso and zzso zzso Our results indicate that the zzso of the sympathetic nervous system may play an important role in the zzso of zzso zzso
