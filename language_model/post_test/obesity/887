The effects of St zzso a selective zzso zzso zzso were investigated in non obese and obese zzso rat heart zzso In both groups, the numbers and affinity zzso for zzso zzso were found to be zzso At 4 or 10 zzso zzso St 587 failed to increase the developed tension whereas at 14 zzso zzso St 587 significantly increased it in both groups of zzso This effect was reversed by zzso St 587 also increased action potential duration at 14 zzso zzso zzso is thus important for the occurrence of the zzso effect of St 587 in 12 zzso zzso rats, either non obese or obese with reduced zzso zzso This suggests the participation of zzso metabolism in the mechanism of St 587 zzso effect in the zzso
