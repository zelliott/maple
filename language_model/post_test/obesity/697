The new optical device, the zzso enables the zzso zzso safe, and precise determination of the thickness of subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso layers at any given site of the human zzso Fifteen zzso zzso body sites from neck to calf describe a SAT topography zzso like an individual zzso of a zzso This zzso was examined in 16 women with zzso zzso syndrome zzso and compared to the body fat distribution of 87 zzso healthy controls and 20 zzso diabetic zzso zzso differences of these three groups were described and, to render the possibility of visual comparison, the zzso body fat information was condensed to a two-dimensional factor plot by factor zzso All zzso patients had an zzso body fat distribution with significantly thinner SAT layers on the legs as compared to healthy zzso Moreover, a zzso cluster analysis resulted in two distinctly different groups of zzso women, a lean zzso and an obese zzso zzso compared to healthy women, lean zzso patients had significantly lower total SAT development, even though zzso weight, and body mass index did not zzso zzso Especially on the legs, their SAT layers were significantly zzso indicating a more zzso fat distribution zzso zzso zzso women showed a zzso pattern very similar to that of women with zzso diabetes, although the mean age difference between these groups was more than 30 zzso Compared to healthy controls, the zzso of these obese zzso patients was strongly shifted into the zzso direction, appearing as zzso with a significantly increased upper trunk obesity to zzso and a significantly decreased leg SAT development to zzso
