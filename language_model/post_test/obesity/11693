Patients with zzso syndrome represent a group with extensive cardiovascular risk factors for the development of zzso which may be preceded by an impairment of zzso zzso zzso dysfunction is characterized by a reduced availability of zzso zzso oxide, the principal zzso of zzso zzso In the present study we assessed NO synthesis in zzso by measuring the zzso zzso acids zzso and zzso and in particular the stable intermediate compound zzso zzso in patients with zzso syndrome by using zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso As a prerequisite to our study, we measured the zzso acid zzso in 31 healthy volunteers to investigate gender and age zzso To prove whether blood drawn from peripheral veins reflects plasma zzso of the whole vessel system, several blood samples from different regions were obtained from patients undergoing zzso left and right heart zzso In the latter group, no significant differences were noted among the plasma zzso between the different sample zzso In healthy volunteers, there were no significant differences in plasma zzso of any one specific zzso acid between males and females or age zzso The main finding of the study is that the intermediate product of NO zzso zzso is significantly reduced in the plasma samples of patients with a zzso syndrome as compared with samples from healthy control zzso The plasma zzso of the NO precursor zzso and the end product of NO zzso zzso were zzso In conclusion, our results suggest that plasma levels of zzso are independent of age and gender and are not different at various locations within the vascular zzso In a group of patients at high risk for the development of zzso we found reduced plasma zzso of zzso either caused by a decreased zzso NO zzso activity or caused by an increased breakdown of zzso by pathways independent of NO zzso resulting in a reduced availability of zzso for NO zzso
