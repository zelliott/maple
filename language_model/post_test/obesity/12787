To validate the ability of zzso to measure total body composition before and after weight loss and the composition of the lost body zzso 

Cross zzso and follow-up study of body composition before and after a weight loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

31 obese subjects with a mean body weight of zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso and a mean body weight of zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso 

Body composition was measured by dual X-ray zzso total body zzso zzso and high precision scales before and after a weight zzso 

zzso and the scales showed a strong linear relation zzso zzso zzso At zzso however, zzso underestimated the body weight by a maximum of zzso zzso because the subjects were too large for the scan zzso After weight loss body weight zzso were zzso Before and after weight loss the linear relations between zzso and zzso for zzso were strong zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and Altman plots showed limits of agreement of zzso zzso before and after weight zzso zzso underestimated zzso in women and overestimated zzso in zzso zzso accounted for zzso of the lost body zzso The composition of the lost body mass did not differ from that estimated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso 

zzso estimates accurately the body composition and the composition of weight loss in groups of obese zzso However, the scan table may be too small for patients weighing more than 95 zzso
