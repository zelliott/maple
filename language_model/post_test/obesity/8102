To assess the relationship between body mass index zzso and zzso as well as the influence of injury level on this relationship in 24 women with spinal zzso injury zzso and 23 zzso zzso women with similar age, race, and zzso 

Body composition was measured by dual energy X-ray zzso zzso Analysis of zzso was performed to compare total and regional soft tissue percent fat zzso measures between zzso 

Women with zzso had a higher soft tissue zzso than AB women at any given zzso The zzso soft tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and AB women, zzso The zzso explained about equal amounts of the zzso in soft tissue zzso among zzso and AB women zzso but only zzso in zzso zzso 

This study confirms a limited use of zzso in measuring zzso in women with zzso particularly among those with zzso Our observation of lower zzso zzso points for defining obesity zzso zzso for zzso and 21 zzso for zzso needs further zzso The zzso issue also deserves the consideration while proposing the ideal weight and zzso range for persons with zzso
