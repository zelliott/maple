In a previous report, the zzso zzso was mapped to a position 5 zzso zzso to Met on zzso zzso zzso 6 in tight linkage to zzso In order to identify additional zzso in the region of zzso we have made use of zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso In total, 19 zzso were used to type 131 zzso of a zzso zzso + zzso B6 zzso zzso + zzso Fifteen of the zzso mapped to zzso 6, one of which, zzso was tightly linked to zzso For refinement of the genetic map around zzso 350 obese zzso of a B6 zzso zzso zzso + zzso were zzso zzso from these animals were typed for zzso markers from zzso 6 that flank zzso zzso were then typed for zzso zzso was zzso among all the zzso of both crosses corresponding to zzso zzso This probe will be of use as an entry point for physical mapping of the zzso zzso
