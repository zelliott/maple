The molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso a fungus cultured on zzso are not fully zzso Thus the zzso effects of zzso zzso as potential an zzso agent were investigated in zzso obese zzso mice over a zzso zzso For a period of 26 zzso zzso mice were administered either 5 or zzso zzso zzso zzso powder zzso zzso dry mulberry leaf powder zzso or zzso zzso zzso powder in the standard diet while a control group received only standard zzso The zzso and SW preparations served as positive zzso zzso zzso at zzso in the diet was more effective in reducing body weight compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The fall in blood zzso levels in the groups treated for 26 zzso was greater in both IS groups at 1 zzso compared to zzso or SW but equal in all groups at 6 zzso zzso analyses were performed with a mouse zzso zzso clone set array to identify the zzso profiles for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso mouse zzso The zzso IS group, compared to control, showed that 15 genes including zzso zzso and LDL zzso relating protein 1 were zzso and 12 genes including cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso of zzso 1 and zzso of zzso 15 were previously shown to occur in drug-induced suppression of zzso With zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso related to suppression of diabetes, were zzso In the case of zzso the zzso zzso alpha zzso 2) and zzso zzso zzso 9) involved in zzso of blood zzso levels were both zzso Data suggest that zzso zzso is effective in lowering blood zzso due to the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso both associated with suppression of diabetes, indicating that zzso analysis is a useful tool to assess pharmacological potency of therapeutic zzso
