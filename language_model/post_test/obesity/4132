zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso plays an important role in maintenance of energy zzso While zzso zzso in zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso the role of elevated zzso zzso zzso as present in the development of obesity has not been directly zzso Here, we have generated and characterized mice expressing a zzso active version of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso On normal zzso diet, these animals develop obesity as a result of zzso and decreased zzso expression accompanied by central zzso and insulin zzso This unexpected finding zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression zzso both zzso and insulin signaling as zzso zzso zzso zzso formation and protein zzso B zzso zzso in zzso zzso as well as with the fact that zzso ability to zzso zzso zzso is largely reduced in zzso cells of zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso zzso is not sufficient to promote zzso expression but requires simultaneous zzso zzso zzso release of zzso zzso In contrast, upon exposure to a high-fat diet, food intake and body weight were zzso in zzso mice compared with control zzso Taken together, these experiments directly demonstrate that enhanced zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso as present in control mice upon high-fat feeding contributes to the development of zzso zzso and insulin zzso
