zzso tissue secrets zzso and fatty zzso which may contribute to zzso vascular dysfunction and cardiovascular zzso This study investigated which factors are responsible for the synergistic effect of zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced proliferation of human vascular smooth muscle cells zzso zzso medium zzso from human zzso zzso proliferation of zzso in correlation to its vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso CM increases zzso zzso 1 and 2 expression and zzso zzso of zzso while zzso only stimulates zzso zzso zzso zzso abrogates zzso and zzso proliferation and considerably reduces proliferation induced by CM and zzso in zzso zzso release is higher from visceral zzso tissue zzso of obese subjects compared to subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso and zzso from lean zzso Furthermore, zzso release from zzso zzso with its zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso from type 2 diabetic patients releases significantly higher amounts of zzso and zzso stronger proliferation of zzso as compared to SAT and zzso of zzso In conclusion, zzso is zzso zzso proliferation of zzso As this zzso is released in high amounts from zzso of obese patients and zzso of diabetic patients, zzso might link zzso tissue inflammation to increased zzso zzso
