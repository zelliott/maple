To investigate the role of zzso in zzso tissue zzso zzso and fatty acid zzso 

We generated transgenic mice zzso zzso (also called zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and also performed zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso mice were zzso with decreased zzso tissue zzso content and smaller zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased zzso but did not result in increased serum zzso fatty acid levels or zzso zzso zzso We found increased cycling between zzso zzso and zzso and increased fatty acid zzso in zzso from these mice, as well as improved insulin zzso 

We show that by increasing zzso zzso zzso causes reduced zzso zzso content and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes fatty acid zzso and zzso within zzso
