The growth hormone zzso response to stimulation tests is impaired in zzso Moreover, obese patients exhibit a zzso increase of zzso to zzso hormone zzso stimulation after food zzso this paradoxical response is reversed by zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso seems to exert profound effects on insulin zzso Recent studies also demonstrated an impairment of zzso response to several stimuli in zzso zzso syndrome zzso a condition associated with zzso zzso and insulin zzso zzso zzso of zzso tone by the zzso zzso zzso zzso is able to reduce the insulin response to an oral zzso tolerance test zzso in zzso zzso zzso Since insulin and zzso may zzso influence their zzso and the zzso system may have a role in the zzso of zzso and reduced zzso zzso we have explored the involvement of these neuroendocrine mechanisms in essential obesity and in obesity associated with zzso by a long-term treatment with an zzso zzso We tested seven obese patients affected by zzso seven matched women with essential obesity zzso and five non-obese control zzso All patients, in the zzso phase, underwent an zzso (75 zzso and zzso hormone zzso Two days later, patients were subjected to a zzso zzso The patients then had 4 weeks of treatment with zzso 50 zzso Following continuation of the treatment, zzso and zzso tests were zzso zzso growth zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso were also determined in the zzso condition before and after zzso zzso zzso treatment reduced zzso insulin levels in patients with zzso zzso zzso and restored a normal zzso response to zzso without affecting IGF-1 and zzso zzso In zzso subjects, zzso reduced the insulin response to a zzso load and failed to modify the blunted zzso response to zzso Our data suggest a significant difference in zzso system function in zzso and zzso subjects, indicating a particular form of obesity in zzso The zzso zzso treatment in zzso may act through the reduction of negative insulin feedback on zzso zzso In zzso patients, the failure to improve zzso zzso in obese zzso patients may be related to a high zzso tone or to the zzso predominance of other zzso
