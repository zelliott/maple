We measured the effects of seven consecutive daily infusions of zzso (the zzso analogue of zzso or zzso itself on urinary zzso and total nitrogen zzso during zzso Two study protocols were zzso In protocol I, subjects underwent three separate zzso zzso one during which 34 zzso of zzso were infused on days zzso a second during which 34 zzso of zzso were infused on days zzso and a third control fast during which no infusions were zzso zzso of zzso significantly reduced daily urine zzso nitrogen zzso compared with both the control zzso and the zzso in which zzso was infused zzso less than zzso This zzso effect of zzso persisted during days zzso even though no further infusions were zzso Daily urinary zzso nitrogen zzso during zzso when zzso was administered did not differ from values observed during control zzso In protocol II, subjects were starved on two occasions for 14 zzso During one fast, infusions of 11 zzso of zzso were given on days zzso during the control fast, no infusions were zzso Daily urine zzso nitrogen zzso was lower zzso less than zzso on days zzso and also on days zzso of the fast during which zzso was zzso The zzso effect of zzso could not be related to changes in circulating levels of zzso zzso zzso bodies, or insulin in either zzso We conclude that zzso infusions decrease the nitrogen wasting of zzso whereas zzso studied under identical conditions, does zzso
