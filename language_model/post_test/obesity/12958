We investigated the effect of reduction in visceral obesity on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso metabolism in a controlled dietary intervention study in 26 obese zzso zzso zzso of very low density zzso zzso zzso was measured using a zzso constant, infusion of zzso In seven men receiving the reduction diet, intermediate density zzso zzso and low density zzso zzso zzso zzso were also zzso zzso zzso enrichment was measured using gas zzso zzso and zzso was used to estimate the fractional turnover zzso zzso and visceral zzso zzso at the zzso vertebra were zzso by magnetic resonance zzso With weight reduction there was a significant decrease zzso zzso in body mass index, waist zzso and visceral zzso zzso The plasma zzso of total cholesterol, zzso insulin, and zzso also significantly decreased zzso zzso Compared with weight zzso weight reduction significantly decreased the zzso zzso zzso pool size, and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fat free zzso P zzso zzso but did not significantly alter its fractional zzso Weight reduction was also associated with an increased fractional zzso rate of LDL zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and conversion of zzso to LDL zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso A change in zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly correlated with a change in visceral zzso tissue area zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not plasma zzso of insulin, free fatty zzso or zzso The data support the hypothesis that a reduction in visceral zzso tissue is associated with a decrease in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and this may be due to a decrease in portal zzso zzso zzso Weight reduction may also increase the fractional zzso of LDL zzso but this requires further zzso
