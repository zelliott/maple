zzso of G protein signaling zzso plays functional roles in cell division, synaptic zzso addictive behavior, and zzso zzso As part of a broad effort to define the extent of functional diversity of zzso in zzso we generated zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso adult mice exhibited unexpected zzso in cardiovascular and zzso functions without any obvious changes in motor skills, basic behavioral traits, and brain zzso zzso zzso mice exhibited a lean zzso reduced fat mass, and increased nocturnal energy zzso zzso zzso mice also exhibited altered blood pressure control zzso These studies expand the functional repertoire for zzso and other G protein regulatory proteins providing unexpected mechanisms by which G protein systems may be targeted to influence obesity and cardiovascular zzso
