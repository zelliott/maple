The zzso zzso rat is a model of genetic obesity characterized by zzso zzso and other zzso zzso In order to zzso zzso mechanisms contributing to disturbed feeding behavior in these animals, the effect of food restriction on three zzso zzso involved in the control of food intake was zzso zzso male obese and 18 lean zzso rats were randomly divided into two groups: half of the animals were zzso for 2 weeks, while the other half served as controls and were fed ad zzso The levels of zzso Y zzso zzso releasing factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso were determined using in zzso zzso zzso In addition, plasma insulin and zzso zzso were zzso Food restriction significantly increased the expression of zzso zzso in the zzso nucleus in both zzso zzso while the expressions of zzso zzso in the zzso nucleus zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso nucleus zzso were not zzso The expression of zzso zzso was significantly greater in control obese animals compared to control lean zzso Food restriction lowered plasma insulin levels, but did not change plasma zzso zzso It is concluded that food restriction specifically activates zzso gene zzso in the zzso nucleus the response being similar in both zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso plays a role in the adaptation to altered feeding zzso
