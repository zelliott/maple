zzso and obesity have been suggested to be risk factors for zzso zzso However, high body mass index zzso might result in a higher zzso rate because of the presence of more fatty tissue surrounding the zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate whether zzso is of zzso value with regard to short-term and long-term outcome in patients who undergo zzso for zzso 

In 556 patients who underwent zzso zzso clinical and pathological outcome were compared between different zzso classes zzso normal weight, overweight, zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso rate did not differ in zzso and obese zzso However, severe complications seemed to occur more often in obese patients zzso and the risk for zzso leakage increased with higher zzso zzso in zzso patients compared with zzso in obese patients, zzso zzso assessment showed comparable zzso zzso although an advanced zzso stage was seen more often in patients with zzso zzso zzso A linear association between zzso and zzso rate was detected zzso zzso in zzso patients compared with zzso in obese zzso However, unlike zzso zzso zzso was not an independent predictor for zzso zzso zzso There was no significant difference in overall or zzso zzso survival between the zzso classes zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso is not of zzso value with regard to short-term and long-term outcome in patients who undergo zzso for cancer and is not an independent predictor for radical zzso zzso Patients zzso eligible for zzso should not be denied surgery on the basis of their zzso zzso
