To review the evidence for and against the role of visceral zzso tissue as a major contributor to the zzso complications of obesity through abnormal regulation of zzso 

Data from investigators in the field who have studied visceral zzso and zzso health and/or regional and systemic free fatty acid zzso release were zzso 

Although visceral fat mass was positively correlated with adverse health consequences and excess zzso zzso visceral fat was not the source of excess systemic zzso zzso Upper body zzso fat contributes the majority of zzso in lean, obese, zzso and zzso zzso zzso amounts of visceral fat probably result in greater zzso zzso zzso 

zzso as opposed to zzso insulin resistance is unlikely to be caused by high rates of visceral zzso tissue zzso
