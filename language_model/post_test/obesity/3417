In zzso the zzso zzso through mechanisms that are not completely zzso regulates both aggression and mating zzso Interestingly, our study demonstrates that the zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso interact to modify male behavior by controlling the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes necessary for zzso production and zzso Furthermore, we reveal that zzso in turn regulates aggression through the zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso Finally, we establish that zzso is expressed in zzso zzso known to control aggressive behavior and that zzso requires functional zzso for its zzso We conclude that genetically manipulating the zzso zzso zzso and zzso is sufficient to affect zzso zzso which in turn zzso zzso male behavior through the regulation of the zzso hormone zzso
