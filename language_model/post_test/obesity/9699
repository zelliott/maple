zzso is associated with an altered inflammatory and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso is an zzso zzso with zzso zzso 

We aimed to explore the expression levels of zzso in zzso tissue analyzing the contribution of zzso and zzso fraction cells zzso as well as its impact on inflammation and zzso zzso We also analyzed the effect of the stimulation with zzso and zzso zzso on both zzso and zzso 

zzso obtained from 75 subjects were used in the zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were analyzed in visceral zzso tissue zzso as well as in both zzso and zzso In addition, zzso expression was measured in two mice models of zzso 

We show, for the first time, that zzso expression levels of zzso are increased in zzso and type 2 diabetic obese patients zzso as well as in obese patients with zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, expression levels of zzso in zzso zzso tissue from two different mice models of obesity were significantly increased zzso zzso and zzso were mainly expressed by zzso and its expression was significantly enhanced zzso by zzso zzso zzso treatment also increased zzso levels of zzso Moreover, the addition of zzso zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression in human zzso zzso 

These findings indicate that zzso is involved in the zzso of obesity via visceral zzso tissue inflammation representing a link with zzso zzso
