We had observed that several patients with acute zzso leukemia zzso were markedly zzso Therefore we determined the relationship between obesity and a diagnosis of zzso among patients with acute zzso leukemia zzso Between 1980 and 1995 we saw zzso patients with zzso zzso of whom 120 had zzso zzso body mass index zzso was strongly associated with a diagnosis of zzso zzso Like zzso et al zzso zzso zzso zzso we found zzso to be more frequent in Latinos and younger patients zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso indicated that increasing zzso decreasing age, and Latino origin were each independently associated with a diagnosis of zzso zzso P values zzso zzso zzso zzso Since the mean zzso in the zzso patients zzso resembled that of the general US population, it appears that zzso patients are zzso and not that zzso patients are zzso Five of the zzso patients zzso had a zzso zzso none of the other zzso zzso zzso Given the distribution of zzso in the general US population ages zzso the probability that five of 120 normal adults would have a zzso is virtually zzso Excluding the five very heavy zzso patients does not alter the conclusion that increasing zzso predicted for zzso in patients with zzso Although the mechanism is unclear there appears to be an association between increasing zzso and a diagnosis of zzso among patients with zzso There may also be an association between zzso and zzso
