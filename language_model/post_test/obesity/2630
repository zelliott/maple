zzso protein zzso zzso plays an important role in regulating whole body energy zzso Recently, it has been demonstrated that zzso zzso exerts zzso and zzso effects in obese and diabetic zzso models through the zzso of zzso in peripheral zzso Here we show that zzso improves zzso zzso and fatty liver in obese mice through central and peripheral zzso In obese zzso and zzso mice, zzso treatment reduced liver weight, zzso and plasma zzso and cholesterol zzso In the liver and muscle of zzso mice, zzso promoted zzso activity and fatty acid zzso and changed expression of genes involved in zzso zzso Additionally, zzso administration of zzso decreased the level of zzso and zzso the expression of fatty acid zzso genes in skeletal zzso Together, these data suggest that zzso would improve fatty liver in obese subjects, which is probably zzso not only by peripheral zzso zzso but also by neural signaling from the central nervous zzso
