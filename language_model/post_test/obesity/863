The left internal zzso artery to the left anterior descending artery is recognized as the gold standard for zzso Several studies have shown the benefits of the left internal zzso zzso However, a substantial portion of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass zzso does not receive this zzso We sought to identify reasons for zzso of the left internal zzso artery to the left anterior descending artery, while evaluating zzso and zzso zzso 

Between April 1997 and September 2001 a total of zzso consecutive patients underwent coronary artery bypass zzso with zzso to the left anterior descending zzso All data were collected zzso except reasons for zzso of the left internal zzso zzso zzso zzso and Cox zzso hazards analyses were used to adjust zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso bias was controlled by constructing a propensity zzso A case note review was carried out to determine reasons for zzso 

A total of zzso patients zzso received the left internal zzso artery to the left anterior descending artery leaving zzso patients zzso who did zzso We found no difference in hospital mortality or zzso however, patients receiving the left internal zzso artery had a survival advantage at 4 zzso zzso for not using the left internal zzso artery were damage to the zzso zzso zzso zzso poor flow zzso zzso zzso poor lung function zzso zzso zzso unstable symptoms zzso zzso 24), vascular problems zzso zzso zzso and 19 patients with zzso reasons zzso zzso chest wall zzso and obese zzso Case notes had no reason stated for 146 patients and reasons for 26 patients were zzso 

Left internal zzso artery usage is not associated with any increase in hospital mortality and zzso but these patients have better zzso zzso zzso on zzso poor flow, and poor lung function were the most common reasons for not using this zzso
