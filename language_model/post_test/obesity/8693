zzso acid overload has been proposed as a cause of decreased responsiveness in the major insulin target zzso of the body such as muscle and liver zzso We therefore investigated fatty acid zzso in zzso muscle and liver isolated from zzso diabetic fatty zzso rats treated with zzso a new class of zzso zzso zzso production from zzso zzso acid was lower in the zzso muscle and liver of zzso rats versus lean rats zzso zzso When administered orally to zzso rats for 2 weeks, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (10 zzso increased zzso acid zzso in the zzso muscle of zzso rats zzso zzso zzso but not zzso increased zzso acid zzso in the liver of zzso rats zzso zzso and both zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso in the skeletal muscle of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso rats was inhibited by zzso but not by zzso A reduction of fatty acid zzso in the liver of zzso rats and an increase in response to zzso were observed only when zzso and zzso fatty zzso not zzso were used as zzso Thus, there were defects in fatty acid zzso activity and zzso zzso in the zzso muscle and liver of zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso has advantages over zzso in the zzso of these zzso zzso abnormalities in insulin resistance associated with zzso
