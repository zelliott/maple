The present experiments have tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso zzso enhance insulin zzso by neural zzso zzso were made diabetic by injecting zzso to destroy their own pancreatic zzso zzso transplants of fetal pancreatic tissue were placed under the zzso zzso zzso zzso were placed in rats whose diabetes was cured with transplants as well as zzso zzso The animals were followed for 4 zzso The zzso rats with pancreatic transplants gained no more weight than the zzso zzso There was no significant rise in insulin in the transplanted rats after zzso zzso but the zzso zzso rats with intact pancreatic tissue showed the expected rise in zzso Food intake rose zzso in the zzso zzso rats with intact zzso but only zzso in the zzso zzso rats with zzso zzso of the pancreatic zzso was also observed in the zzso zzso rats with an intact zzso but was not found in the zzso zzso rats with a transplanted zzso Thus, transplantation of pancreatic tissue beneath the zzso capsule of diabetic rats prevented the characteristic zzso zzso and obesity in zzso zzso rats whose zzso was free from intact zzso The results support the hypothesis that neural mediation of the rise in insulin is the primary factor in the development of zzso zzso
