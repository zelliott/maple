zzso response to feeding was measured in zzso in liver, zzso white zzso tissue zzso and zzso brown zzso tissue zzso during the development of obesity in zzso zzso zzso The fatty acid synthesis after a meal was higher in all zzso of zzso mice on a zzso basis, but the magnitude of this increase zzso depending on the tissue and the time after the initiation of zzso zzso in BAT from zzso mice was double that of control mice for the first 2 weeks, but subsequently decreased to near control zzso In zzso zzso after feeding was highest 2-4 weeks after zzso injection, and in liver, zzso synthesis in fed obese mice was greatest at zzso weeks after the induction of zzso The zzso insulin concentration was increased after 2 weeks of zzso and serum zzso concentration was higher in fed obese mice after 4 zzso These results indicate that increased zzso in zzso mice may be due to an increase in insulin concentration after feeding and that insulin resistance zzso by zzso response to insulin zzso is apparent in BAT before zzso and zzso
