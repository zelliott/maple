To study the effects of zzso on zzso development in zzso 

Three hundred obese and 300 healthy children without taking any medication or having evidence of zzso or zzso diseases were zzso Their ages of first zzso and zzso were surveyed, and blood levels of zzso sex hormones, growth hormone zzso and insulin zzso were zzso 

With increased of age, blood levels of zzso appeared from low to high and from high to low again in the boys, with zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso zzso zzso in the obese group, and with zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso zzso zzso in the control zzso While blood level of zzso appeared an increasing trend in girls, with zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso in the obese group, and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso in the control zzso zzso of sex hormones also appeared an increasing trend in the all zzso zzso of zzso showed an abrupt increased at certain ages, different in boys from girls zzso years of age in boys and zzso in zzso In the all ages, serum levels of zzso and zzso were higher in the obese group than those in the control group, while the level of zzso was lower in the obese group than that in the control zzso zzso level of zzso was higher in the obese group of both boys and girls than that in the control group, with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ages at first zzso and zzso were much earlier in the obese children than those in the controls, with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso years of age in boys and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the girls, zzso Blood levels of zzso was higher in the girls than that in the zzso Age at zzso and earlier in the girls than that of first zzso in the zzso Blood level of testosterone correlated zzso with that of zzso in boys, while that of zzso correlated with that of zzso in zzso Level of zzso correlated zzso with that of zzso in boys and correlated with that in zzso Level of zzso correlated with that of zzso in the control zzso 

zzso might have an effect on initiation of zzso in children, possibly with more importance in girls than in zzso The gender difference in the degree of correlations between levels of zzso and zzso may cause their difference in the ages at sudden growth in boys and zzso The gender difference in the degree of correlation between levels of zzso and sex hormone may cause their difference in the ages at first zzso and zzso in both boys and zzso
