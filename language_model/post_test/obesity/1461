To investigate the relationship between early zzso intake and zzso zzso 

A follow up study of nutrition and growth carried out in a sample of 112 French children from 10 months to 8 years of zzso 

zzso zzso at the age of 2 years and zzso zzso Body Mass Index zzso zzso and zzso zzso at the age of 8 years, and age at zzso rebound assessed on the basis of zzso zzso 

The zzso at the age of 8 years is positively correlated with energy intake at the age of 2 years, but this correlation becomes non significant after adjustment for zzso at 2 zzso zzso zzso of zzso intake at the age of 2 years is positively correlated with zzso and zzso zzso at 8 years after adjustment for energy intake at 2 years and parental zzso The percentage of protein at 2 years is zzso associated with age at zzso rebound, zzso the higher the protein intake at 2 years, the earlier the zzso rebound and the higher the subsequent zzso zzso 

zzso at the age of 2 years is the only zzso intake associated with zzso development zzso A high protein intake increases body zzso at 8 years of age, via an early zzso zzso The association between protein intake and obesity is consistent with the increased stature and accelerated growth of obese zzso A high fat low protein diet (such as human milk) is adapted to high energy demand for growth in early zzso Our results suggest that high protein diet early in life could increase the risk of obesity and other zzso later in zzso
