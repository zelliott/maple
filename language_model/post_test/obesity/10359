zzso variation at the zzso A5 gene zzso is associated with increased zzso zzso a risk factor for zzso zzso zzso zzso thickness zzso is a surrogate measure of zzso zzso We sought to determine the association of common zzso genetic zzso with carotid zzso and zzso A total of zzso zzso zzso Study participants underwent carotid ultrasound and had data on at least one of the five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Although none of the individual zzso was significantly associated with carotid measures, the zzso defined by the presence of the rare zzso of the zzso zzso was associated with a higher common carotid artery zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso The rare zzso of each of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso defined by the presence of the rare zzso in these four zzso were each significantly associated with zzso zzso in obese zzso These associations remained significant even after adjustment for zzso zzso zzso were associated with zzso zzso particularly in obese zzso The mechanism of these associations and the effect modification by obesity are independent of zzso zzso zzso
