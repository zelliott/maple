High sitting height ratio zzso is a characteristic commonly associated with Inuit zzso Inuit are described as having short leg lengths and high zzso proportions such that zzso for obesity derived from European populations may not adequately describe thresholds of disease zzso Further, high zzso may help explain the reduced impact of zzso on zzso risk factors among Inuit relative to comparison zzso This study investigates the relationship between zzso and body mass index zzso in zzso 

zzso are zzso individuals zzso males and zzso zzso from 36 Inuit communities in the Canadian zzso Mean age is zzso zzso zzso years in males and zzso zzso zzso years in zzso We use linear zzso to examine the association between age, sex, zzso sitting zzso zzso waist circumference zzso and zzso We then evaluate the efficacy of the relative sitting height adjustment as a method of correcting observed zzso to a zzso zzso 

Mean zzso is significantly higher than among zzso zzso zzso prevalence is high, particularly among Inuit zzso In the regression, only age and zzso are significant zzso of zzso While zzso is significantly greater than that of the US population, there is substantial agreement between overweight and obesity prevalence using observed and corrected zzso 

We find no consistent relationship between zzso and zzso and suggest the unique zzso and zzso profile observed in Inuit arise from factors not yet zzso More complex zzso and imaging studies in Inuit are zzso
