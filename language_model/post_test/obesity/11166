The scope of this study was to assess the impact of calcium and zzso zzso acid zzso supplementation on plasma fatty acid profiles and to evaluate potential synergistic effects of both compounds against dietary zzso Mice separated into five experimental groups were zzso control zzso high-fat diet zzso zzso with calcium zzso zzso plus zzso and zzso with both zzso and zzso Plasma zzso and fatty acids were determined by commercial kits and gas zzso zzso Both dietary calcium and zzso supplementation contributed to lower body fat gain under a zzso zzso zzso efficacy was seen with zzso no additional effect was associated with the combined treatment with zzso Plasma zzso zzso and zzso index were in accordance with an altered zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso groups, whereas control levels were attained under zzso zzso Plasma fatty acids showed minor changes associated to zzso treatment, but a high impact on zzso was observed under zzso zzso Our results show that the mechanism underlying the zzso effects of calcium supplementation is zzso mainly by changes in zzso plasma zzso In addition, the lack of zzso on body weight reduction in combination with associated zzso profiles of calcium and zzso suggests that calcium may interfere with zzso and/or zzso of zzso which can be of relevance when using zzso dairy products against human zzso
