The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between insulin sensitivity and lower body muscle strength in overweight and obese sedentary zzso zzso The design of the study was zzso The study population consisted of 82 zzso overweight and obese sedentary zzso women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were classified by dividing the entire cohort into zzso based on relative insulin sensitivity expressed per zzso of lean body mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We measured insulin sensitivity zzso the zzso clamp zzso body composition zzso zzso X-ray zzso visceral fat and muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso muscle strength index expressed as weight lifted in zzso per zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A positive and significant relationship was observed between insulin sensitivity and the muscle strength index zzso zzso zzso p zzso Moreover, a moderate but significant correlation was observed between the muscle strength index and muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso Finally, the muscle strength index was significantly higher in the zzso group compared with the zzso and zzso groups, respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso sensitivity is positively associated with zzso muscle strength in overweight and obese sedentary zzso zzso
