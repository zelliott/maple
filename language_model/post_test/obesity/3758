In rats selectively bred to develop zzso obesity zzso or to be zzso zzso zzso maternal obesity selectively enhances the development of obesity and insulin resistance in their adult zzso We zzso that the interaction between genetic predisposition and factors in the maternal environment alter the development of zzso zzso systems involved in energy zzso zzso zzso obesity in the current studies led to increased body and fat pad weights and higher zzso and insulin levels in zzso day 16 offspring of both zzso and DR zzso However, by 6 zzso of age, most of these intergroup differences disappeared and offspring of obese zzso zzso had unexpected increases in zzso nucleus zzso zzso zzso peripheral insulin sensitivity, zzso and zzso brown zzso temperature increase and zzso zzso response compared with offspring of lean zzso but not lean DR zzso On the other hand, while offspring of obese zzso zzso did have the highest zzso nucleus zzso zzso zzso their zzso and brown zzso zzso responses to the zzso zzso zzso II zzso did not differ from those of offspring of lean DR or zzso zzso Thus, during their rapid growth phase, juvenile offspring of obese zzso zzso have zzso in their zzso systems regulating energy zzso which ameliorates their genetic and zzso determined predisposition toward zzso zzso Because they later go onto become more obese, it is possible that interventions during this time period might prevent the subsequent development of zzso
