zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso activity is under strong genetic control in both mice and zzso This study determines whether common DNA variation in the zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso is associated with zzso tissue zzso activity and zzso risk factors in a homogeneous population of 75 overweight zzso women zzso mass zzso zzso age: zzso years zzso The zzso zzso for the presence of the zzso for zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso There were no associations between the zzso zzso and any of the measured zzso Age, body mass index, percent body fat, zzso ratio, visceral and subcutaneous fat area, and zzso zzso and abdominal zzso zzso size did not differ by zzso zzso zzso However, zzso tissue zzso activity at both zzso and zzso sites was higher in women without the zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with women who were zzso zzso or zzso zzso for the zzso zzso Total and LDL cholesterol were lower in women without the zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with women who were zzso or zzso for the zzso zzso whereas zzso and HDL levels were similar between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not insulin, was lower in women without the zzso zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso zzso is a possible marker for a functional zzso that is found in the zzso gene and that alters zzso activity in older overweight zzso
