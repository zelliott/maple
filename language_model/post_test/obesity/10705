The association of zzso zzso with zzso tumors and zzso diabetes suggests that a zzso zzso may promote zzso and zzso characteristic of zzso zzso Although such a zzso has not been isolated, it may derive by sequential zzso from the zzso precursor zzso to zzso and zzso zzso In order to evaluate the role of zzso peptides in the zzso of zzso zzso we compared plasma levels of zzso zzso and zzso in plasma of 8 zzso patients with zzso benign zzso zzso and 7 zzso normal controls utilizing sensitive zzso zzso Mean plasma zzso levels for the zzso zzso and control subjects were not significantly different (90 zzso zzso 140 zzso nor was any significant difference observed between plasma zzso levels of the 2 groups zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our data indicate that plasma levels of the zzso peptides zzso and zzso are not increased in zzso benign zzso zzso and suggest that its proposed hormonal zzso might originate independently from the large zzso precursor of zzso zzso and their zzso
