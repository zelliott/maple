Recent data show an alarming increasing trend in obesity around the zzso Mechanical ventilation in this population requires specific zzso settings due to the mechanical and inflammatory zzso observed in zzso In this line, zzso lung volume is zzso leading to impairment in the mechanics of the respiratory system, lung and chest wall as well as zzso Furthermore, the inflammatory process acts on zzso zzso increasing airway zzso or on pulmonary zzso cells, increasing the molecules related to the adherence of inflammatory zzso In order to reduce lung stress and strain, as well as minimize the risk of zzso associated lung injury, mechanical ventilation management should be conducted with the following zzso 1) zzso recruitment maneuver before positive zzso pressure application, which requires zzso according to respiratory system dynamic zzso and 2) tidal volume zzso zzso according to zzso zzso In zzso the overall objective is to ensure an adequate setting of zzso parameters in order to minimize the inflammatory impact already present in obese patients as well as prevent further lung zzso
