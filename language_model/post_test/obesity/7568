Previous studies of clinical samples of adults with bipolar disorder zzso suggest that there is increased prevalence of obesity and that obesity is associated with greater BD zzso We therefore examined this topic in a representative zzso zzso 

The zzso National zzso zzso on Alcohol and Related zzso was used to determine whether the prevalence of obesity is elevated among subjects with lifetime zzso and whether obesity is associated with greater severity of zzso 

The zzso zzso and zzso prevalence of obesity was significantly greater among subjects with BD versus controls zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso among subjects with BD was significantly positively associated with greater age, female sex, zzso anxiety and medical conditions, and zzso treatment zzso and significantly zzso associated with zzso substance use disorder zzso In multivariable zzso obesity among adults with BD was positively associated with age, zzso anxiety disorders, duration of depressive episodes, and history of hospitalization for depression, and zzso associated with zzso zzso 

The increased prevalence of obesity in BD and its association with illness severity, particularly in relation to depression, cannot be attributed to biases inherent in zzso zzso Future studies are needed to examine the direction of the observed associations and to develop preventive and treatment strategies seeking to mitigate the burden of obesity in zzso
