Evidence suggests that obesity may raise blood pressure zzso through zzso zzso mechanisms and that the zzso zzso to Stop zzso combination diet zzso may decrease zzso by enhancing zzso zzso To address this question, 12 obese patients with zzso 1 hypertension zzso and 12 lean zzso were studied on their usual diets and after following the zzso and a zzso diet in random sequence for 4 weeks zzso Acute zzso stress was induced by a zzso infusion of zzso and zzso zzso activity of plasma zzso and plasma zzso were measured as zzso of zzso capacity and zzso stress, zzso zzso was lower in obese zzso on the zzso than on the usual and zzso diets zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not change significantly in lean zzso after 4 weeks on the zzso but tended to rise on the zzso zzso zzso on usual diets was higher in lean subjects than in obese zzso zzso increased in obese but not lean volunteers on the zzso compared with usual diet, and the group difference zzso zzso increased from baseline during zzso and zzso in both groups on the zzso diet but not in obese zzso on the zzso Among zzso obese zzso the zzso raises zzso capacity, lowers zzso and reduces zzso stress induced by acute zzso The findings are consistent with evidence that elevated zzso in obese subjects may reflect an imbalance between zzso capacity and zzso stress that is improved by the zzso
