The zzso zzso predicts that zzso is associated with an earlier age at onset of type 1 zzso We tested the hypothesis using data from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth zzso 

zzso were 449 youth aged zzso years at diagnosis who had positive results for diabetes zzso measured zzso months after diagnosis zzso zzso zzso The relationships between age at diagnosis and zzso were examined using zzso as measured at the SEARCH visit and reported birth weight, both expressed as zzso scores zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was not related to age at zzso In multiple linear regression, adjusted for potential zzso a significant interaction was found between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso on onset age zzso zzso This interaction remained unchanged after additionally controlling for number and zzso of diabetes zzso An inverse association between zzso and age at diagnosis was present only among subjects with zzso levels below the median zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso A decrease of 1 zzso in birth weight zzso zzso was also associated with an approximately zzso earlier age at diagnosis zzso zzso zzso independent of sex, zzso current zzso zzso and number of diabetes zzso 

zzso zzso is associated with younger age at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes only among those zzso youth with reduced zzso zzso The zzso environment may also be an important zzso of age at onset of type 1 zzso
