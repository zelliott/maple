It has been suggested that maternal smoking during pregnancy has an effect on childhood zzso We previously clarified the association between maternal lifestyle habits practiced during pregnancy, including smoking, and childhood obesity and overweight at zzso years of zzso In this study, we aimed to demonstrate this association through survival zzso 

This study was based on an zzso community-based prospective cohort study initiated in the fetal stage called Project zzso The study population comprised of the participants of Project zzso who were children born in a rural Japanese area between 1991 and 1999 and their zzso In this project, maternal smoking status during pregnancy was collected through a questionnaire and childhood zzso data were measured at annual medical zzso from 3 years of age to zzso years of zzso Using these data, we performed a survival analysis using the zzso method to compare the cumulative rate of childhood obesity and overweight between those with mothers who smoked during pregnancy and those who did zzso zzso we calculated the hazard ratio zzso of the effect of maternal smoking during pregnancy on childhood obesity using the Cox zzso hazard zzso 

In the survival analysis of childhood zzso we analyzed the data of zzso children and their mothers zzso rate: zzso Of these, 290 children zzso became overweight and 92 children zzso became obese between 3 years of age and zzso years of zzso This shows that the cumulative rate of childhood obesity was significantly different between mothers with and without smoking habits zzso zzso Using the Cox zzso hazard model, we analyzed the data of zzso children and their mothers zzso rate: zzso Of these, 255 children zzso became overweight and 76 children zzso became obese between 3 years of age and zzso years of zzso zzso smoking during pregnancy was found to be associated with childhood obesity zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso However, there was no significant association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and childhood zzso 

Our results suggest that the effect of fetal environmental factors on childhood obesity is more pronounced than that on childhood zzso These results suggest that maternal smoking during pregnancy may be a significant factor in the association between fetal environment and zzso zzso
