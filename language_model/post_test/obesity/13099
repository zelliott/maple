zzso Y zzso is a powerful zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso receptors have been implicated in zzso the zzso activity of zzso To further investigate the importance of these two receptors in zzso zzso after chronic central administration, we used mice lacking either zzso or zzso zzso zzso infusion into the lateral zzso of zzso mice zzso food intake and induced obesity over a zzso zzso Fat pad weight as well as plasma insulin, zzso and zzso levels were strongly increased in zzso zzso In addition, zzso infusion resulted in a significant decrease in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, the lack of either zzso or zzso expression in knockout mice did not affect such feeding response to chronic zzso zzso Moreover, the obesity syndrome that developed in these animals was similar to that in zzso zzso Taken together, these data strongly suggest biological redundancies between zzso and zzso zzso signaling in the zzso control of food zzso
