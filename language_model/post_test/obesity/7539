zzso signaling in the central nervous system zzso is required for the zzso effect of insulin on zzso zzso Our aim was to determine whether the zzso is also involved in the zzso effect of circulating insulin on the zzso retention of fatty acid zzso from zzso In zzso mice, zzso clamp conditions zzso the retention of both plasma zzso zzso and plasma zzso zzso in the various white zzso zzso zzso but not in other zzso including brown zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso administration of insulin induced a similar pattern of zzso zzso zzso This effect of zzso insulin administration was not associated with zzso of the insulin signaling zzso in zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso a zzso channel blocker, considerably reduced (during zzso clamp zzso and even completely blocked (during zzso administration of zzso zzso retention of zzso from zzso This central effect of insulin was absent in zzso mice, indicating that zzso is the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso retention by zzso In zzso zzso mice, these stimulating effects of insulin zzso or zzso zzso on zzso retention in zzso were zzso In conclusion, in zzso mice, circulating insulin stimulates zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso in part through zzso of zzso channels in the zzso Apparently, circulating insulin stimulates fatty acid zzso in zzso but not in zzso directly and indirectly through the zzso
