The rising rate of overweight and obese individuals among developing countries despite focused efforts on prevention and treatment underscores not only the need to better define the zzso factors that contribute to weight problems, but also the need to zzso the zzso mechanisms of the zzso failure over eating that leads to weight zzso zzso findings suggest an overlapping model of addiction and compulsive zzso 

Our goal was to examine whether neural zzso to reward typically associated with substance abuse could also be seen in individuals exhibiting zzso zzso 

Participants completed zzso of demographic information and eating zzso zzso data were collected via functional zzso zzso scans while participants were exposed to personally relevant zzso zzso 

The participants were recruited from the general zzso 

Twenty-six individuals with high body mass index zzso and moderate zzso behavior as assessed by the zzso Eating zzso zzso were recruited for this zzso 

zzso zzso response during exposure to zzso taste zzso 

The results showed that exposure to zzso taste cues zzso zzso zzso response in the reward system of individuals with high zzso and, more importantly, that this zzso increases with greater number of zzso symptoms zzso zzso zzso 

These findings support an overlapping neural model of addiction and zzso failure over eating that may lead to problems with weight in zzso These findings offer insight into the prevention and treatment of zzso zzso
