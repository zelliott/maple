Central and lateral zzso zzso of 9 regulatory peptides implicated in the control of feeding zzso were measured in zzso zzso zzso rats which develop spontaneous zzso zzso and zzso and in lean zzso zzso In female zzso rats, central zzso levels of zzso Y zzso zzso zzso and substance P were significantly lower zzso less than zzso than in lean female zzso Following food restriction with a zzso reduction in body weight, these differences were apparently reversed and there were also significant rises in the lateral zzso zzso of zzso and of zzso The other 4 peptides examined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B and zzso zzso zzso did not differ significantly between zzso and lean zzso either fed freely or zzso Male zzso rats showed no significant differences from lean males in central or lateral zzso zzso of any of the 9 zzso zzso and zzso are powerful and specific central appetite stimulants, whereas zzso substance P and zzso inhibit feeding when injected zzso zzso in these putative zzso peptides may be involved in the zzso and other zzso abnormalities in this spontaneous obesity zzso The apparent absence of differences between the male zzso and lean groups may relate to sexual zzso of the syndrome, which is more marked in the zzso
