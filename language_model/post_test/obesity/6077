zzso acid zzso is a zzso zzso and precursor of zzso zzso acid zzso The objective of the present study was to explore the effects of VA on immune function in a model of the zzso syndrome, zzso zzso zzso zzso mix of zzso and zzso and obese zzso rats, aged 8 weeks, were fed a control zzso zzso or a VA diet zzso zzso zzso for 3 weeks zzso rats per zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso immune cell zzso zzso zzso ex zzso zzso production zzso and zzso fatty acid zzso were zzso zzso rats had higher proportions of zzso zzso total zzso helper zzso zzso and percentage zzso zzso zzso zzso and percentage zzso and produced higher zzso of zzso to zzso A zzso compared with lean zzso zzso rats had lower proportions of zzso zzso new zzso zzso and zzso zzso but higher proportions of helper cells that were zzso zzso and zzso and produced higher zzso of zzso zzso zzso gamma and zzso in response to zzso compared with lean zzso VA was higher in plasma zzso and both VA and zzso zzso zzso were higher in zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso rats had lower proportions of zzso and zzso zzso helper cells, and helper zzso zzso from zzso rats produced zzso less zzso zzso and zzso compared with zzso VA zzso production of zzso zzso and zzso in obese rats to levels similar to those seen in lean zzso These results indicate that dietary VA zzso alters the zzso tendency of zzso zzso from zzso zzso
