Some zzso conditions have been associated with reduced vitamin D levels, including systemic lupus zzso zzso arthritis, diabetes zzso and multiple zzso 

The main objective of this study was to analyze the zzso D zzso status of patients with psoriasis in comparison with control subjects without this zzso 

This zzso study included 86 patients zzso with psoriasis and 43 zzso and zzso control subjects) from the zzso clinic of our hospital dermatology department in zzso zzso All patients and control subjects were studied during one zzso period to avoid seasonal variations in vitamin D zzso 

zzso zzso levels were significantly lower in zzso patients than in control subjects even after adjusting for zzso factors in a zzso analysis zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso for vitamin D zzso Low zzso levels were zzso associated with zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and body mass index in multiple linear zzso zzso zzso patients with body mass index greater than or equal to 27 zzso had a higher risk of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and specificity of zzso 

Further studies with larger numbers of patients are required to analyze the zzso mechanisms underlying the relationship between zzso zzso and zzso 

The zzso values are significantly lower in zzso patients than in control zzso Low zzso levels are zzso associated with zzso zzso an inflammatory zzso marker, and with zzso zzso patients with a body mass index of 27 or more are likely to have vitamin D zzso
