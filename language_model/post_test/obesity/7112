Increased morbidity and mortality in critically ill obese patients may result from an exaggerated inflammatory response and/or a diminished effectiveness of routine therapeutic strategies used in the critical care zzso The objectives of this study were to compare the effectiveness of zzso saline zzso resuscitation in obese and lean mice with zzso and to address potential mechanisms underlying zzso protection against the inflammatory and zzso responses to zzso 

zzso zzso was used to monitor and zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso in the brain zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice subjected to zzso zzso and puncture zzso and zzso with either normal saline or zzso The dual zzso zzso zzso method was used to measure zzso expression in the zzso while the zzso behavioral deficit was zzso using a zzso chamber zzso 

zzso attenuated the zzso of adherent zzso and zzso and the behavioral deficit observed at 4 h after zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the brain zzso was attenuated by zzso in zzso but not in lean, zzso 

zzso exerts significant zzso and zzso actions in obese septic zzso These responses may be related to the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso
