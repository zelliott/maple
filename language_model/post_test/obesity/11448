This study evaluated a zzso model of the relation between social factors and zzso in which differences in body mass index zzso across zzso groups were hypothesized to be attributable to social group differences in health zzso affecting energy expenditure (physical activity, diet and alcohol consumption and weight zzso 

A total of zzso adults who participated in the 1995 Australian National Health and Nutrition zzso provided data on a range of health factors including zzso measured height and weight, health zzso and social factors including family status, employment status, housing situation and migration zzso 

Social factors remained significant zzso of zzso after controlling for all health zzso Neither social factors alone, nor health zzso alone, adequately explained the zzso in zzso zzso interactions were found between social factors and individual health zzso 

These results suggest that social factors moderate the relation between zzso and zzso zzso and that the mechanisms underlying zzso group differences in obesity may vary among men and zzso Additional factors are likely to act in conjunction with current health zzso to explain variation in obesity prevalence across zzso zzso
