To analyze the zzso expression of zzso zzso level in subcutaneous and zzso zzso zzso of normal, obese, and type 2 diabetic individuals and to investigate the relationship between zzso zzso expression and serum zzso level, body fat zzso zzso and zzso zzso and insulin resistance zzso 

36 patients with benign diseases undergoing selective abdominal operation, 19 males and 17 zzso aged 20 - 65, included 12 with normal zzso regulation and normal weight zzso group), 12 with normal zzso regulation and zzso zzso group), and 12 with type 2 diabetes and zzso zzso zzso zzso subcutaneous and zzso zzso zzso were obtained during zzso zzso quantitative zzso was used to measure the zzso zzso zzso The level of zzso serum zzso was measured by zzso Meanwhile blood zzso zzso lipids and insulin levels were zzso Body weight, zzso and waist hip ratio zzso were evaluated and insulin sensitivity was assessed by zzso model assessment insulin resistance index zzso 

The zzso zzso level in zzso zzso tissue of the zzso group was zzso zzso zzso significantly higher than that in subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso P zzso The zzso zzso level of the males was zzso zzso zzso not statistically different from that of the female zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso zzso level of the zzso group was zzso zzso zzso significantly lower than that of the zzso group zzso zzso zzso P zzso and the zzso zzso level of the zzso group was zzso zzso zzso both significantly lower than those of the other 2 groups (both P zzso zzso correlation analysis showed that the zzso zzso was zzso correlated with zzso body weight, zzso zzso zzso and zzso insulin, and positively correlated to serum zzso level and zzso Multiple linear zzso analysis showed that serum zzso level, zzso and body weight were independent variables of zzso 

zzso zzso is highly expressed in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso expression level decreases in the zzso individuals and decreases further when zzso is combined with type 2 zzso zzso zzso is positively correlated to serum zzso level, obese indexes, insulin resistance, and zzso metabolism zzso zzso zzso gene expression may contribute to the underlying zzso of insulin resistance zzso
