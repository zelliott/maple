In all patients, serum zzso was zzso at zzso and 3 zzso In 5 patients, a slight increase of serum zzso above 125 zzso was observed at or around 5 years, the values being maintained at all subsequent times, with no one value higher than 160 zzso ever being zzso The other 2 patients showed full resolution of diabetes at all follow-up zzso Both serum cholesterol and zzso values fell to normal 1 year after zzso and remained within the normal range in all 7 patients during the entire follow-up zzso zzso pressure zzso in 6 cases and was improved in 1 zzso No patient had excessive weight loss at any zzso zzso
