To identify quantitative trait zzso zzso responsible for regulating plasma zzso concentration associated with zzso linkage analysis was carried out on the 190 zzso progeny of a cross between zzso female and zzso zzso zzso at the zzso locus zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso locus zzso mice, two zzso were identified on zzso 1 and a zzso on zzso 3 for zzso A zzso for zzso was identified on zzso 1 and a zzso for zzso on zzso zzso In zzso zzso mice, two zzso for zzso were found on zzso zzso zzso for other lipids with suggestive linkage were also zzso In both zzso mice, one zzso on zzso 1 for zzso and zzso was mapped near zzso in the vicinity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Seven zzso zzso out of 309 zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences were identified between zzso and zzso The zzso zzso may be an indication of the plasma zzso levels, but its influence was less apparent than in the case of weight zzso The zzso for lipids were not on identical zzso with those previously identified for zzso suggesting that zzso in zzso does not coincidentally occur with zzso
