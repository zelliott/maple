Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to individual differences in body weight zzso The present study examined a possible role for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso nucleus zzso zzso in a model of zzso obesity zzso in male zzso zzso were screened and selectively bred for being either zzso zzso exhibiting zzso or diet resistant zzso when exposed to a zzso fat zzso A zzso experimental design was used, based on these two strains of rats and exposure to rat zzso versus the zzso fat diet for seven zzso zzso zzso were measured for zzso size and zzso zzso including number, zzso and zzso As previously observed, each zzso zzso had a single long primary zzso zzso background and diet did not affect zzso size or the number of zzso of zzso zzso However, genetic background exerted a main effect on the length of the long primary zzso In particular, the long primary zzso were approximately zzso shorter on the zzso zzso in the zzso rats compared with DR rats regardless of zzso This effect was isolated to the long primary zzso extending in the zzso direction, with these long primary zzso zzso shorter for the zzso group compared with the DR zzso This finding implicates the connectivity of the long primary zzso on zzso zzso in the control of energy zzso The functional significance of these shortened zzso and their zzso warrants further zzso
