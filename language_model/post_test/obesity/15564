Thirty-five years ago, Lois and Theodore zzso reported the discovery of a genetic zzso in the rat that resulted in zzso zzso increased food zzso decreased energy zzso and insulin zzso The zzso was called fatty zzso The fatty gene is passed on to successive generations by an zzso zzso mode of zzso In the intervening years, much work has been done to characterize the many abnormalities of this animal model of zzso Nearly 10 years ago, we reviewed the evidence for a central nervous system mechanism in the zzso of obesity in the fatty zzso zzso Since that time, the discovery of novel peptides and genes has revolutionized the study of the zzso of genetically linked zzso In this review, we update the evidence for a central nervous system mechanism of obesity in zzso rats by focusing on the possible role of zzso Y zzso and zzso in the zzso of zzso We also discuss the role of zzso and insulin in the regulation of zzso
