zzso estimates of obesity such as zzso seem to be strongly influenced by genetic factors in zzso zzso zzso of total and regional fat as determined by direct techniques such as zzso scan have only been applied in a few twin zzso The aim of the present study was to estimate the zzso zzso of total and regional fat distribution in young and elderly Danish zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso twins in two age groups zzso to 32 and 58 to 66 zzso underwent zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso correlations and zzso components of zzso were estimated for total and regional fat percentages using zzso zzso 

The zzso correlations demonstrated higher correlations for all fat percentages among zzso twins as compared with zzso zzso The zzso modeling revealed a major genetic component zzso of total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and regional fat percentages zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lower body, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso body, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in both the young and elderly zzso 

The zzso estimates emphasize that body fat and distribution as determined by zzso scan are under extensive genetic zzso
