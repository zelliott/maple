Studies in mice suggest that zzso serve as zzso sensors and regulate systemic zzso metabolism through release of serum zzso protein 4 zzso This model has not been validated in zzso zzso was highly expressed in isolated mature human zzso and zzso by zzso human zzso In contrast to the animal data, zzso zzso was zzso in subcutaneous zzso tissue of obese women, and circulating zzso zzso were similar in normal weight, overweight, and obese women zzso zzso zzso zzso was positively correlated with zzso expression in zzso zzso independent of any zzso zzso Five percent weight loss slightly decreased zzso zzso expression but did not influence circulating zzso In another set of experiments, we zzso patients zzso zzso zzso by low or high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as determined by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were similar throughout oral zzso tolerance testing, and zzso zzso expression in zzso tissue and serum zzso zzso were similar in the groups with higher and lower zzso zzso zzso Our findings point to profound differences between zzso and humans in the regulation of zzso or circulating zzso and challenge the notion that zzso zzso by zzso has a dominant role in the regulation of zzso
