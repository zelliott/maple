The zzso zzso index zzso reflects zzso vascular resistance and zzso which are associated with chronic kidney zzso The links connecting zzso function, zzso zzso resistance, and zzso hormone zzso with hypertension and zzso factors remain zzso The aim of this study is to investigate the possible relationship of zzso with zzso zzso rate, zzso hypertension, obesity zzso mass index and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis in body composition assessment, serum zzso and insulin resistance assessed by zzso model insulin resistance zzso 

This study was carried out on zzso zzso women, 141 zzso zzso patients, zzso and zzso years, referred to an Internal Medicine Clinic and Day Hospital for essential hypertension, zzso and/or zzso Lower zzso calorie Mediterranean diet, physical activity increase, smoking withdrawal, and lifestyle counseling, provided by a health psychologist support, were zzso 

Higher hypertension risk, present in zzso of the overall group of eligible patients zzso is associated with high zzso and high zzso along with greater zzso zzso insulin resistance, and zzso There is a straight linear relationship of zzso to zzso zzso zzso in zzso hypertension, which is not observed in normal blood pressure zzso By zzso multiple linear zzso analysis, it was found that fat mass, zzso ratio, and zzso account significantly for zzso of the zzso to zzso in zzso zzso 

Increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso resistance are associated with higher zzso in zzso zzso obesity zzso by greater fat mass and zzso zzso and zzso are the independent conditions that account significantly for higher zzso
