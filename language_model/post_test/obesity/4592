zzso To develop risk prediction models for knee zzso zzso and zzso to estimate the risk reduction that results from modification of potential risk zzso 

This was a 12-year retrospective cohort study undertaken in the general population in zzso zzso zzso risk factors were collected by zzso zzso zzso knee zzso was defined by zzso and Lawrence zzso score zzso zzso symptomatic knee zzso was defined by zzso zzso plus knee zzso zzso of knee zzso was defined by zzso zzso grade increase from zzso A zzso zzso model was used for zzso zzso and discrimination of the models were tested in the zzso Initiative zzso population and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the models were compared with those obtained from zzso of existing zzso 

From a community sample of zzso people aged over 40, 3 risk prediction models were zzso These included zzso of zzso knee zzso zzso of symptomatic knee zzso and progression of knee zzso All models had good zzso and moderate discrimination power in zzso and zzso The zzso lied within the zzso zzso of the published zzso The risk reduction due to zzso obesity at the individual and the population levels were zzso 

zzso prediction of knee zzso based on the well established, common modifiable risk factors has been zzso The models may be used to predict the risk of knee zzso and risk reduction due to preventing a specific risk zzso
