zzso zzso zzso zzso rats slowly develop a zzso zzso dominant, obesity zzso with a specific increase in zzso white zzso tissue zzso depot and preserved insulin sensitivity zzso et zzso in zzso zzso zzso To better understand the remarkable zzso of these rats, the zzso metabolism was investigated in male zzso and zzso zzso zzso Total plasma cholesterol zzso levels were normal but total plasma zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso content zzso was elevated in zzso zzso Plasma zzso and zzso levels were higher while plasma zzso levels were zzso lower in zzso zzso Increased zzso zzso zzso explained the increased zzso levels in zzso zzso The zzso gene expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso in both old obese and young non-obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in heart and zzso white zzso tissue zzso was zzso while zzso activity was increased in zzso zzso zzso and decreased in zzso muscle zzso Moreover, zzso zzso and zzso gene expression was increased in zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso was reduced or unchanged and zzso zzso zzso was reduced in zzso from both old obese and young non-obese zzso zzso To zzso the obese zzso of zzso male rats is associated with increased zzso zzso production and zzso a shift in zzso activity from skeletal muscle to zzso reduced zzso response in zzso zzso and a specific increase in expression of genes responsible for fatty acid and zzso synthesis in the zzso zzso
