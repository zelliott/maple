zzso sleeve zzso zzso is performed in certain circumstances after failure of gastric zzso The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of zzso gastric zzso on the morbidity associated with secondary zzso for zzso 

The case records of 102 consecutive patients undergoing zzso were studied zzso The technique of zzso was zzso Two groups were zzso one with patients having undergone zzso after zzso gastric zzso zzso zzso 31) and the second, with patients having undergone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were overall morbidity and zzso complications including gastric leaks consecutive to staple line disruption as well as other septic or zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed to detect independent risk factors for zzso 

zzso morbidity was significantly higher in patients having undergone zzso after zzso gastric zzso compared with those undergoing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso leaks secondary to staple line disruption also occurred statistically significantly more often in patients with zzso gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso 6 months between gastric band removal and performing zzso did not prevent the increased morbidity compared with zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that among the factors analyzed zzso zzso zzso body mass index, surgeon, zzso gastric zzso the only independent risk factor for staple line disruption was zzso gastric zzso with an odds ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso gastric zzso increases the risk of complications after secondary zzso We recommend that patients who undergo zzso after a zzso gastric zzso should be warned of the increased risks of morbidity or, zzso that zzso be performed zzso as the initial zzso
