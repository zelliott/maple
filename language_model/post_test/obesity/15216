Current evidence suggests a combined treatment of zzso weight loss of diet and zzso However, to our knowledge, neither their separate and interactive effects nor long-term outcomes have been zzso 

We evaluated whether a zzso dietary behavior modification zzso treatment to decrease energy zzso physical exercise behavior modification zzso treatment to implement moderate zzso exercise, or combined dietary and physical exercise behavior modification zzso treatment compared with control zzso care) zzso reduces body weight in zzso women measured at the end of treatment and at a zzso follow-up 9 zzso after treatment zzso 

At 10-14 zzso zzso 68 zzso Swedish women with a zzso zzso (in zzso of zzso were randomly assigned to D, zzso zzso or C zzso zzso were made at zzso after the intervention, and again at a zzso follow-up 9 zzso zzso A 2 zzso 2 zzso approach was used to analyze main and interaction effects of zzso 

Weight changes after the intervention and zzso follow-up were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, in the D zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, in the E zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, in the DE zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, in the C zzso The main effects of D treatment, but not of E treatment, on weight were significant at both times zzso zzso 

zzso treatment provided clinically relevant weight loss in zzso zzso women, which was sustained at 9 zzso after zzso The combined treatment did not yield significant weight or zzso changes beyond those of dietary treatment zzso
