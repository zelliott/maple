Two experiments examined the zzso that occurs when rats are switched from a high-fat to a low-fat zzso In the first experiment, rats fed a high-fat diet for eight weeks weighed 79 g more than rats fed a low-fat zzso zzso of the high-fat diet led to reduced food intake for at least four zzso zzso the body weight of the rats by a 24 hour fast did not alter the time course of the zzso Plasma levels of free zzso free fatty acids and zzso were elevated during and after feeding the high-fat zzso suggesting that feeding a high-fat diet increases fat zzso even after the high-fat diet is zzso In the second experiment, feeding rats the high-fat diet for four weeks increased body weight and body zzso zzso the rats for two days after feeding the high-fat diet did not alter subsequent zzso and did not alter the percentage of body zzso This pattern of results is similar to that previously seen following termination of zzso insulin zzso The results are consistent with the idea that a persistent increase in fat zzso is responsible for the zzso
