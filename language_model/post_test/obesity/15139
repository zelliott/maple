Recent studies have disclosed a close relationship between maternal zzso fetal metabolism and zzso and zzso zzso The zzso metabolism in zzso zzso is a possible target of zzso zzso 

31 genes of zzso and fatty acid and cholesterol zzso synthesis and regulation were analyzed in day zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mice by zzso and zzso zzso 

The most obvious difference between both strains was the lack of the zzso gamma transcript in zzso zzso In adult zzso mice, zzso gamma is zzso in most zzso In a zzso analysis, a higher zzso rate of fatty acid transport protein 4 zzso zzso zzso and a reduced transcript number of fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in zzso zzso zzso synthesis regulation was modified in zzso zzso as indicated by the ratio of zzso regulatory zzso protein zzso 2 zzso zzso gene 1 zzso 1) zzso zzso zzso 

In mouse zzso zzso and signal molecules of fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism resemble those expressed zzso zzso differences in zzso rates of genes between zzso from obese and non-obese mothers indicate that zzso zzso development is an early target for zzso zzso
