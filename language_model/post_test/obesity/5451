zzso is a class of zzso zzso droplets in zzso and zzso zzso Our purpose was to examine the association between common zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso locus and zzso as well as related zzso in unrelated American zzso 

Four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were typed in zzso white subjects zzso men and zzso zzso attending a residential lifestyle intervention zzso The baseline zzso and zzso measures were zzso zzso was defined as zzso or zzso 30 zzso 

zzso analysis demonstrated that, in women, two of the zzso zzso and zzso were significantly associated with percentage body fat zzso zzso zzso for zzso and p zzso zzso for zzso and waist circumference zzso zzso zzso for zzso and p zzso zzso for zzso Moreover, zzso analysis using these two zzso indicated that zzso zzso and zzso were both associated with significantly increased obesity risk zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso for zzso zzso and odds ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso for zzso zzso when compared with zzso zzso No significant associations between zzso variations and obesity were found in zzso 

Our data support the hypothesis that the zzso locus may be a significant genetic zzso for obesity risk in whites and that women are more sensitive to the genetic effects of zzso than zzso
