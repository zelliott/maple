The zzso zzso zzso is important in short-term regulation of food zzso and decreased zzso of this neural zzso with long-term zzso of a high-fat diet may contribute to zzso weight zzso We tested the hypothesis that expression of genes zzso receptors for zzso factors in zzso zzso zzso are increased by long-term zzso of a high-fat diet, thus supporting zzso signals from the zzso zzso zzso rats fed a high-fat diet showed increased body weight and zzso compared with low-fat zzso controls and high-fat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the type I zzso zzso and growth hormone zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso was increased in zzso compared with low-fat zzso controls or zzso zzso Shifts in the balance between zzso and zzso signals within the zzso zzso zzso may influence food intake and body weight gain induced by high fat zzso
