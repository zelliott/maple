The development of obesity is still a poorly understood process that is dependent on both genetic and environmental zzso 

The objective was to examine how physical activity and the proportion of energy as protein in the diet modify the genetic variation of body mass index zzso waist zzso and percentage body zzso 

zzso from Denmark zzso complete zzso and Finland zzso complete zzso aged zzso and zzso zzso respectively, zzso The proportion of energy as protein in the diet was estimated by using zzso zzso The participants reported the frequency and intensity of their leisure time physical zzso zzso circumference and zzso were zzso Percentage body fat was assessed in Denmark by using a zzso zzso zzso The data were analyzed by using zzso interaction models for twin data with the zzso statistical package zzso Institute for Psychiatric and zzso zzso Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, zzso 

High physical activity was associated with lower mean values, and a high proportion of protein in the diet was associated with higher mean zzso waist zzso and percentage body fat and a reduction in genetic and environmental zzso zzso modification by physical activity was statistically significant for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and waist circumference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the merged zzso A high proportion of protein in the diet reduced genetic and environmental zzso in zzso and waist circumference in Danish men but not in women or in Finnish zzso 

Our results suggest that, in physically active individuals, the genetic variation in weight is reduced, which possibly suggests that physical activity is able to modify the action of the genes responsible for predisposition to zzso whereas the protein content of the diet has no appreciable zzso
