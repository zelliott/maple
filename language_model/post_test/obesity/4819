To analyze whether two dietary weight loss zzso dietary approaches to stop hypertension zzso program and a low-fat diet zzso be cost-effective in Australia, and to assess their potential to reduce the disease burden related to excess body zzso

zzso adjusted life years zzso zzso incremental zzso ratios zzso and proportions of disease burden zzso zzso under zzso per zzso are considered zzso 

The DASH and low-fat diet programs have zzso of zzso per zzso zzso uncertainty zzso zzso zzso and zzso per zzso zzso zzso Neither intervention reduced the body zzso disease burden at population level by more than zzso The sensitivity analysis showed that when zzso costs for time and travel are included, the zzso increase to zzso per zzso for DASH and zzso per zzso for the low-fat zzso zzso weight loss during the interventions, zzso weight regain and low participation limit the health zzso 

Diet and exercise interventions to reduce obesity are potentially cost-effective but have a negligible impact on the total body zzso disease zzso
