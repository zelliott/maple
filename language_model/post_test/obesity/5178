The clinical significance of zzso zzso is zzso We have measured the responses to random presentation of single, elastic zzso loads in 36 zzso 8 normal personnel zzso 9 with obesity zzso 10 with chronic zzso failure under zzso zzso 5 with pneumonia zzso and 4 with zzso lung disease zzso We have expressed these responses zzso zzso the ratio of zzso (or zzso of the system during loaded breathing to the zzso without loading zzso zzso the ratio of tidal volume zzso achieved when breathing from an zzso load to the VT predicted in the absence of load compensation zzso zzso the ratio of zzso flow rates during loaded and unloaded zzso zzso the ratio of zzso time of loaded and unloaded zzso We found zzso in the O, H and P groups less than that of either zzso patients or N controls zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso zzso zzso zzso although greater in groups O and H than in N zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso did not account for the difference i zzso in all zzso When expressed as zzso the response to a zzso zzso load for groups zzso O and P was less than that for N zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso zzso zzso time was observed in zzso O and P patients when inspiring from this zzso In contrast, zzso flow did not differ from that of normal zzso Nerve zzso zzso was slightly reduced or normal in the H zzso Respiratory load compensation is deficient in zzso O and P zzso The zzso which does not involve peripheral zzso is zzso
