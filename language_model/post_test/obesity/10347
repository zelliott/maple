Using three-dimensional zzso scanning data along with other existing zzso medical profiles to search for better zzso markers in association with type 2 Diabetes zzso zzso 

In this zzso study with zzso subjects undergoing health examination in a period of 3 years, the authors adopted data from zzso scanning with hundreds of body measures and conducted factor analysis to search for practical indicators better associated with type 2 zzso A multiple zzso zzso model was used to analyze strength of association between indicators and presence of type 2 zzso 

The trunk component derived from factor analysis was positively associated with type 2 zzso regardless of obesity zzso However, lower limbs component was found to be zzso associated with type 2 zzso in the same zzso zzso was thus found as the strongest indicator among practical measures of trunk zzso The strength of association between thigh and type 2 zzso was found to be the highest among practical measures of lower limbs zzso A marker from taking the ratio of waist to thigh zzso was derived from the approach which was found to be the best indicator for association with type 2 zzso while comparing to zzso index, waist zzso or zzso zzso 

This study offers a low-cost, zzso practical marker that is better associated with the presence of type 2 zzso zzso with further study, may be used in clinical practice, zzso study, and preventive medicine in the zzso
