zzso controlled zzso 

University zzso 

zzso patients with body mass indexes zzso zzso zzso and who had zzso evidence of NASH were zzso 

Patients were randomly assigned to a step 1 American Heart Association zzso diet plus exercise and zzso placement or step 1 zzso diet plus exercise and sham zzso placement for a period of 6 zzso 

Liver zzso was the primary outcome measure recorded before and after zzso 

A total of 18 patients completed the zzso zzso characteristics of the zzso and sham groups were zzso At 6 months, a significant reduction in the mean zzso was seen in the zzso group zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso The median zzso fatty liver disease activity scores at the end of treatment were significantly lower in the zzso compared with the zzso groups (2 zzso vs 4 zzso P zzso zzso There was a trend toward improvement in the median zzso scores (1 zzso vs 1 zzso P zzso zzso There was no change in the median zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso scores in both groups after zzso 

Pilot study with small numbers and short zzso 

zzso from this pilot study demonstrated that addition of zzso for 6 months provided a greater loss of zzso and improvement in 2 of 5 zzso parameters of zzso fatty liver zzso A longer study with larger numbers will be required to prove whether or not the therapy is meaningful in the treatment of zzso
