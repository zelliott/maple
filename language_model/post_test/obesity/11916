zzso is hypothesized to play an important role in the zzso of inflammatory pathways associated with zzso zzso zzso However, demonstration of zzso zzso exposure is challenging due to the zzso of the portal zzso Furthermore, reliable measurement of the relatively low zzso levels in plasma of patients with liver disease and subsequent interpretation remain zzso 

In this study, we used the zzso zzso that measures zzso zzso to the core region of zzso to estimate zzso zzso exposure over zzso 

zzso levels against zzso were measured in peripheral plasma obtained from 21 severely obese patients with NASH and 9 severely obese patients with healthy zzso 

Plasma zzso levels against zzso were significantly elevated in patients with NASH compared with patients with healthy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, these zzso levels progressively increased with NASH grade zzso 1 zzso grade 2 zzso grade 3 zzso zzso zzso There was no relation between plasma zzso levels and NASH zzso 

Plasma zzso levels against zzso were found to be increased in zzso human NASH and increased with aggravated inflammation in zzso suggesting a relationship between chronic zzso exposure and the severity of human zzso
