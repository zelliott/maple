We studied participants with incident diabetes from the zzso Health Study zzso zzso and Health Professionals zzso Study zzso zzso who were free of cardiovascular disease and cancer at the time of a diagnosis of zzso Body weight shortly before diagnosis and height were used to calculate the zzso index zzso the weight in zzso divided by the square of the height in zzso zzso Cox models were used to estimate the hazard ratios and zzso confidence intervals for mortality across zzso zzso 

There were zzso deaths during a mean period of zzso years of zzso A zzso association was observed across zzso categories zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso for zzso mortality zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso This relationship was linear among participants who had never smoked zzso ratios across zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but was zzso among participants who had ever smoked zzso ratios across zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso A direct linear trend was observed among participants younger than 65 years of age at the time of a diabetes diagnosis but not among those 65 years of age or older at the time of diagnosis zzso for zzso 

We observed a zzso association between zzso and mortality among all participants and among those who had ever smoked and a direct linear relationship among those who had never zzso We found no evidence of lower mortality among patients with diabetes who were overweight or obese at diagnosis, as compared with their zzso counterparts, or of an obesity zzso zzso by the National Institutes of Health and the American Diabetes zzso
