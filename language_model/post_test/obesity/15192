zzso zzso techniques can be used to study changes in regional brain zzso using changes in surrogate markers such as regional cerebral zzso and rates of zzso zzso or zzso These approaches are shedding new light on two major health problems: the increasing burden of type 2 diabetes zzso zzso which is driven by the rising prevalence of insulin resistance and zzso and zzso intractable problematic zzso which is driven by the cognitive impairment that can occur in association with zzso zzso zzso Some patients with diabetes zzso lose awareness of being zzso which puts them at risk of severe zzso as they are unlikely to take action to prevent the condition zzso zzso of zzso brain and zzso serving higher executive functions as well as the zzso has been demonstrated in both situations and has implications for zzso This Review describes the relevant principles of functional zzso techniques and presents data supporting the notion that the zzso of central pathways involved in zzso regulation, reward and appetite could contribute to problematic zzso during therapy for diabetes zzso and to zzso obesity and zzso zzso these zzso could enable the development of novel clinical zzso
