Weight gain is a side effect of therapy with many zzso zzso and may have important clinical repercussions with respect to long-term health and treatment zzso The primary objective of this zzso study was to compare the safety and zzso of zzso and zzso in patients with schizophrenia as evidenced by the percentage of patients exhibiting significant weight zzso 

This was a zzso zzso randomized, zzso zzso trial in patients with zzso schizophrenia who were in acute zzso and required zzso zzso weight gain was defined as zzso or zzso zzso increase in body weight from zzso Body weight, Positive and zzso zzso zzso and Clinical Global zzso scale zzso assessments were performed at baseline and at regular intervals during the zzso The study period was from April 2000 through June zzso 

317 patients were randomly assigned to zzso (N zzso zzso or zzso (N zzso zzso Compared with those treated with zzso a greater proportion of patients treated with zzso exhibited clinically significant weight gain during the zzso By week 26, 37% of zzso patients had experienced significant weight gain compared with zzso of zzso patients zzso zzso zzso significant differences in mean weight change were observed between treatments beginning at week 1 and sustained throughout the zzso At week 26, there was a mean weight loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso compared with a mean increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso among patients who remained on therapy zzso zzso Changes in zzso plasma levels of total cholesterol, zzso zzso cholesterol, and zzso were significantly different in the 2 treatment groups, with worsening of the zzso profile among patients treated with zzso There was a consistent and sustained improvement in symptoms in patients who remained on therapy with either zzso or zzso as assessed by zzso scores and zzso rates throughout the zzso 

zzso had a greater impact on patients' weight than zzso zzso differences in favor of zzso were also observed in the effects of therapy on plasma zzso zzso Both treatment groups achieved comparable clinically meaningful improvements on efficacy zzso The observed effects on weight and lipids indicate a potentially lower zzso and cardiovascular risk in patients treated with zzso compared with those treated with zzso
