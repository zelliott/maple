zzso obese but zzso zzso individuals present zzso disturbances typical of obese zzso Additionally, metabolically healthy but obese zzso individuals have been identified who are relatively insulin sensitive and have a favorable cardiovascular risk zzso We compared insulin zzso patterns of zzso and zzso with those of two zzso groups zzso zzso individuals or obese zzso subjects, zzso To this end, 110 zzso subjects and 87 obese subjects were zzso into zzso based on their zzso zzso disposal zzso zzso zzso was estimated by acute insulin response zzso during an intravenous zzso test zzso and the disposition index was calculated as zzso zzso zzso We found that, as zzso zzso was lower in zzso who exhibited higher zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels compared to normal zzso zzso zzso zzso was higher in zzso than in normal zzso subjects, but disposition index was lower in zzso zzso index did not differ between zzso and zzso zzso zzso was higher in zzso who exhibited lower waist zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso insulin levels, and higher zzso zzso zzso cholesterol compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso did not differ between zzso obese and zzso but disposition index was lower in the former zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso obese showed decreased zzso insulin zzso compared to normal zzso and zzso subjects, zzso Because these subjects also exhibited a worse zzso risk profile, these findings may account for their increased risk for type 2 zzso
