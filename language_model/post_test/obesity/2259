Body Mass Index zzso as a marker of obesity is an established risk factor for chronic kidney disease zzso and cardiovascular disease zzso However, zzso can overestimate zzso zzso zzso that include central fat deposition are emerging as a more important risk zzso We studied zzso waist circumference zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso ratio zzso and zzso index zzso in a cohort of patients with zzso stage 3 and compared the associations with other known risk factors for zzso progression and zzso 

zzso patients with zzso stage 3 were recruited from primary care for the Renal zzso in Derby zzso Each participant underwent clinical assessment, including zzso zzso and pulse wave zzso zzso as well as urine and serum zzso zzso 

The mean age of the cohort was zzso years with zzso zzso The mean zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the cohort had zzso With the cohort divided into normal and increased risk of morbidity and mortality using each zzso zzso those zzso that included increased central fat distribution were significantly associated with more risk factors for zzso progression and zzso than increased zzso zzso analysis demonstrated central fat distribution was correlated with more risk factors than zzso zzso analyses using zzso zzso zzso to define obesity and zzso of zzso and zzso demonstrated that increasing central fat distribution was significantly associated with more zzso and zzso risk factors than increasing zzso 

zzso zzso that include a measure of central fat deposition are related to more key risk factors in zzso stage 3 patients than zzso Central fat deposition may be of greater importance as a risk factor in zzso than zzso and reliance on zzso alone may therefore underestimate the associated zzso
