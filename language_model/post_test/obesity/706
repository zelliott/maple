zzso angles measured in the zzso and zzso zzso views have been used for planning surgical treatment of zzso caused by slipped capital zzso zzso zzso zzso established zzso is associated with a decrease in zzso angles and an increase in zzso zzso zzso is one of the factors involved in the development of zzso but its influence in zzso angles has not been previously zzso Additionally, few reports describe normal values adjusted for sex and bone zzso In this study, we determined zzso angles in normal control participants zzso in patients with obesity zzso and in patients with zzso zzso The zzso variations were zzso and zzso for the zzso and zzso angles, zzso No significant differences were detected in the control group when these individuals were compared according to sex or zzso zzso zzso patients showed a significant increase in the zzso angle when compared with control zzso The hip with zzso presented a significant reduction in the zzso angle and an increase in the zzso angle, when the same was compared with the zzso hip or with the control zzso In patients with unilateral zzso the zzso angle of the normal hip was detected as increased, which was possibly related to the obesity associated with decreased insulin resistance presented by these zzso We conclude that the detection of risk for developing zzso should include an expanded clinical and zzso profile characterized by zzso males who present obesity associated with insulin resistance and an increase in zzso zzso zzso
