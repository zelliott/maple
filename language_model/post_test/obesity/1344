To investigate the role of zzso in zzso zzso and function and in plasma zzso activity on zzso zzso 

Renal zzso and function, zzso hormones and structural cardiac parameters were evaluated in 20 lean zzso and in 64 obese subjects with central or peripheral fat distribution, 43 of them were zzso and 21 of them were zzso zzso and central fat distribution were defined according to zzso zzso zzso respectively of Body Mass Index zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso insulin zzso plasma zzso activity zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso urinary zzso of sodium zzso were evaluated by current zzso Renal zzso was evaluated by zzso study according to zzso and Gate's zzso By zzso study, effective zzso plasma flow zzso effective zzso blood flow zzso zzso zzso rate zzso zzso fraction zzso and zzso vascular zzso zzso were zzso Left zzso mass zzso and zzso for body height zzso cardiac output zzso and total peripheral zzso zzso by zzso were also zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso were significantly zzso zzso higher in all the obese groups than lean zzso In addition, zzso and zzso were significantly zzso zzso higher in obese zzso than obese zzso either with central fat zzso zzso values were significantly zzso zzso higher in central obese zzso than peripheral obese zzso and than central obese zzso Moreover, zzso levels were significantly zzso zzso higher in central zzso and zzso obese subjects than lean zzso zzso and zzso were significantly zzso zzso lower and zzso levels were significantly higher only in central obese than lean zzso On the contrary zzso were significantly zzso zzso higher in both obese zzso groups and in central obese zzso than lean zzso Comparisons between peripheral and central obese groups indicated that zzso zzso and zzso were significantly zzso zzso higher and zzso and zzso values were significantly zzso zzso lower in both central obese groups than comparable subjects with peripheral zzso Multiple zzso analysis indicated that zzso increased significantly zzso zzso with zzso and zzso but not with CO and zzso 

Our results indicate that obesity with body fat distribution of central type, more than obesity of peripheral type, is associated to abnormalities in zzso zzso and zzso These data are consistent with the indication that change in zzso zzso take place at an early stage in the zzso zzso
