The unparalleled global rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes, together with the associated cardiovascular morbidity and zzso are referred to as the zzso zzso Changes in lifestyle occurring worldwide, including the increased consumption of zzso foods and reduced exercise, are regarded as the main zzso zzso Central obesity and insulin resistance have emerged as important linking zzso zzso the zzso of the cluster of zzso that leads to the increased risk is instrumental in the development of preventive and therapeutic zzso Historically, skeletal muscle, zzso tissue and liver were regarded as key insulin target zzso involved in zzso regulation of peripheral zzso zzso and protein zzso The consequences of impaired insulin action in these zzso were deemed to explain the functional and structural abnormalities associated with insulin zzso The discovery of insulin receptors in the central nervous system, the detection of insulin in the zzso fluid after peripheral insulin administration and the well-documented effects of zzso injected insulin on energy zzso have identified the brain as an important target for insulin zzso In addition to its critical role as a peripheral signal zzso the complex network of zzso zzso and zzso that influence parameters of energy balance, central nervous insulin zzso is also implicated in the regulation of peripheral zzso zzso This review summarizes the evidence of insulin action in the brain as part of the multifaceted circuit involved in the central regulation of energy and zzso zzso and discuss the role of impaired central nervous insulin zzso as a zzso factor in the obesity and type 2 diabetes zzso
