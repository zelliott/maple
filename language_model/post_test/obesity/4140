zzso often zzso that obesity will increase zzso technique difficulty in pregnant patients, but few investigators have systematically examined this population for risk factors associated with difficult zzso or spinal needle zzso We designed this study to zzso identify factors that predict zzso technique difficulty in pregnant zzso 

Using a zzso zzso format, pregnant patients were examined for multiple potential risk factors for zzso technique difficulty, including current body mass index, ability to zzso zzso zzso maximum back zzso zzso and experience of the zzso zzso technique difficulty was then assessed using two zzso 1) the number of needle passes needed to reach the desired space, and 2) the placement time from skin zzso to either spinal injection or zzso zzso zzso zzso of total needle passes were determined by fitting the data to a generalized linear model with negative zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso time were determined by fitting a linear model to the log of zzso zzso placement zzso A survival model was used to account for bias introduced when attending physicians intervened in resident physician zzso 

zzso procedures in zzso pregnant patients were zzso For both the number of needle passes and the zzso zzso placement time, the significant zzso of difficulty were the zzso ability to zzso the patient's zzso landmarks and the patient's ability to flex her zzso zzso as measured by body mass index, was not an independent predictor of either end zzso zzso did, however, strongly predict both the ability to zzso landmarks and flex the zzso 

Despite concerns that obesity may cause difficulty with zzso technique, some obese patients have surprisingly easy zzso block zzso When approaching any zzso zzso in a pregnant patient, and especially in the obese zzso back zzso and landmark zzso predict zzso technique zzso
