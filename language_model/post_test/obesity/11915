We recently reported that obese and non-obese patients with asthma have similar zzso limitation and zzso zzso but obese patients have more symptoms zzso There is limited information on the effect of obesity on zzso of varying severity measured by objective zzso zzso zzso how obesity affects zzso of differing severity can provide insights into the zzso of asthma in the obese and a rationale for the therapeutic approach to such zzso 

Participants with asthma from two American Lung zzso Clinical Research Center zzso studies were grouped by zzso of zzso obstruction zzso zzso volume in one second zzso predicted, zzso vital capacity zzso and zzso zzso zzso Within each zzso we examined the independent effect of body mass index zzso divided into normal weight, overweight, and obese categories, on lung function, airway zzso and zzso 

Overall, both zzso and zzso decreased and symptoms worsened with increasing zzso airway zzso was zzso When zzso by the degree of zzso zzso higher zzso was not associated with greater airway zzso to zzso Higher zzso was associated with more asthma symptoms only in the least zzso zzso zzso When zzso by degree of airway zzso zzso was zzso associated with zzso in all zzso zzso zzso was directly associated with asthma symptoms only in those with the least airway zzso 

zzso does not influence airway zzso in patients with asthma and it is associated with more symptoms only in those with less severe zzso
