Few studies have examined the relationship of human zzso virus zzso zzso and its associated zzso with liver zzso 

zzso multivariable linear regression, we examined the zzso zzso zzso and viral factors associated with transient zzso liver zzso in 314 participants zzso zzso zzso C virus zzso negative, 78 zzso zzso positive, 14 zzso zzso positive, 57 zzso zzso zzso in the Women's zzso zzso zzso 

Compared with zzso zzso negative women, zzso zzso positive women had higher median liver zzso values zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso negative and zzso zzso negative women had similar liver zzso values (both zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso remained associated with higher liver zzso values zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso even after multivariable zzso Among zzso positive women, waist circumference zzso zzso zzso was associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso higher liver zzso values after multivariable zzso waist circumference showed little association among zzso zzso negative or zzso zzso negative zzso Among zzso zzso negative women, history of AIDS zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso were associated with greater liver zzso 

zzso infection but not zzso infection is associated with greater liver zzso when infected women are compared with those with neither zzso Our finding that waist zzso a marker of central zzso is associated with greater liver zzso in zzso but not zzso or women with neither infection suggests that in the absence of zzso liver injury the adverse effects of obesity are zzso
