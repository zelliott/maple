zzso linkage scans were carried out using a zzso zzso components method in white and black families of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Network zzso study to identify quantitative trait zzso zzso for pancreatic zzso function and insulin sensitivity estimated through the newly released zzso computer version of zzso model assessment zzso Participants zzso zzso zzso with diagnosed type 2 diabetes, or taking blood zzso or blood zzso medications were zzso Both zzso were adjusted separately by race and sex for the effects of age, zzso and field center before linkage scans using 370 zzso markers were zzso A total of 685 white families zzso zzso and zzso black families zzso zzso were evaluated as well as zzso including 267 obese white families zzso zzso and zzso obese black families zzso zzso identified through zzso analyses using interacting zzso of age, sex, and zzso For zzso function in the obese white families, significant zzso of odds zzso zzso evidence supporting linkages was detected on zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso score zzso empirical P zzso zzso and at zzso zzso zzso zzso score zzso empirical P zzso zzso In addition, two regions supported linkage for insulin sensitivity index in the obese black families on zzso zzso at zzso (79 zzso zzso score zzso empirical P zzso zzso and on zzso zzso at zzso (173 zzso zzso score zzso empirical P zzso zzso zzso clinical zzso using obesity data and improved estimates of zzso function and insulin sensitivity may have permitted identification of a zzso on zzso zzso for zzso function in the presence of estimated insulin resistance and a zzso on zzso zzso for insulin zzso These regions replicate previous reports for type 2 zzso zzso
