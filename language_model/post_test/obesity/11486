Using body mass index zzso zzso the present study's aims were zzso to describe and evaluate the relationship between zzso with cardiovascular disease zzso risk factors, such as zzso blood pressure zzso zzso blood pressure zzso and physical zzso zzso to provide information on the prevalence of high blood pressure and physical activity according to zzso zzso and zzso to examine the relationship of risk of obesity to adverse levels of high blood pressure and physical zzso 

The sample consisted of zzso children zzso males and zzso zzso zzso years zzso Participants were classified as being at zzso of zzso according to zzso and zzso fourth zzso of zzso zzso Blood pressure was measured using the zzso zzso An adapted version of the Weekly zzso zzso was applied for the diagnosis of physical activity index zzso 

zzso and zzso blood pressures were significantly zzso zzso and positively related to zzso whereas no significant associations were reported between zzso and zzso in both zzso Overall, the proportion of subjects with adverse levels of blood pressure zzso or zzso ranged from zzso in the first zzso zzso zzso to zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso ranged from zzso in zzso to zzso in zzso and no significant differences were zzso Children and adolescents at zzso of zzso were zzso times as likely to have at least one risk factor zzso blood pressure or low level of zzso 

Our data suggest that higher zzso is associated with higher values of zzso and zzso Children and adolescents in the upper zzso of zzso are zzso times as likely to have at least one risk zzso zzso our data confirmed previous findings that higher levels of zzso are associated with a zzso risk profile for zzso risk zzso
