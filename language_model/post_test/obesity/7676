Despite robust interest in minimally invasive surgery for obese zzso patients, widespread use by zzso surgeons has been hindered by the technical difficulty of completing these zzso The use of robotic assistance to overcome these challenges continues to zzso This study discusses the problem of obesity in the United States, provides basic definitions and calculations related to the disease, reviews some of the literature supporting zzso surgery in obese patients, explores the emergence of zzso in this patient population, and offers zzso zzso to aid in the successful completion of minimally invasive robotic zzso procedures in heavier zzso
