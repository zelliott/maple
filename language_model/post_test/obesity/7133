The risk of zzso syndrome is influenced in a cumulative fashion by socioeconomic zzso and risk zzso to health acting throughout the life zzso The zzso of abdominal zzso of raised blood pressure, and of diabetes zzso show an ascending zzso from the most zzso categories of risk to the least zzso categories of risk, except for raised blood pressure and diabetes zzso in men
