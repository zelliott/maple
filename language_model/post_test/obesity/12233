Fifty overweight women with zzso were enrolled and divided in two groups to receive zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso alone zzso zzso for a period of six zzso zzso zzso were repeated at three months zzso and at the end of the treatment zzso 

At the end of the treatment, both zzso and zzso groups showed an improvement of the zzso parameters and no significant differences were zzso As expected, the combined supplementation with zzso and zzso resulted to be more effective, compared to the zzso group, after three months of zzso 

The combined administration of zzso and zzso in zzso plasma ratio zzso should be considered as the first line approach in zzso overweight patients, being able to reduce the zzso and clinical zzso of zzso and, therefore, reduce the risk of zzso zzso
