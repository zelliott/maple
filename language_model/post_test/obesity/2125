The authors examined how body mass index zzso across life is linked to the risk of zzso knee zzso zzso testing whether prolonged exposure to high zzso or high zzso at a particular period has the greatest influence on the risk of knee zzso 

A zzso British birth cohort of zzso men and women underwent clinical examination for knee zzso at age 53 zzso and weights were measured 10 times from 2 to 53 zzso zzso were zzso by gender and adjusted for occupation and activity zzso 

The prevalence of knee zzso was higher in women than in men zzso zzso vs zzso zzso In men, the association between zzso and later knee zzso was evident at 20 years zzso and remained until 53 years zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso In women, there was evidence for an association at 15 years zzso at 53 years, the OR was zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso per zzso increase in zzso Changes in zzso from childhood in women and from adolescence in men were also positively associated with knee zzso A structured zzso approach to zzso the way in which zzso is linked to knee zzso suggested that prolonged exposure to high zzso throughout adulthood carried the highest risk and that there was no additional risk zzso from adolescence once adult zzso had been accounted zzso 

This study suggests that the risk of knee zzso accumulates from exposure to a high zzso through zzso
