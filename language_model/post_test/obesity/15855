The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis of an association between the zzso zzso of the promoter of the zzso gene and the prevalence and zzso of zzso We studied the zzso zzso of the zzso gene promoter in zzso zzso of whom zzso were seen again 6 years zzso All the persons underwent an oral zzso test and the zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso gene promoter was studied using zzso At the initial study, the probability of having a zzso or zzso in carriers of the A zzso was significantly lower than expected by chance zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso In those persons with a zzso or zzso at the first study, the probability at 6 years of losing weight zzso a zzso zzso was greater in carriers of the A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The increase in weight over these 6 years, taken as a continuous zzso was significantly less only in those persons who were originally obese zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, in a population from southern Spain, carriers of the A zzso of the zzso zzso in the promoter of the zzso gene had a lower risk for obesity and the likelihood of losing weight was greater in those obese persons who had the A zzso zzso or zzso
