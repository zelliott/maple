A relationship between zzso detection of dietary zzso regulation of fat zzso and body mass index was recently zzso However, involved mechanisms are poorly zzso Moreover, whether obesity can directly zzso preference for fatty foods remains zzso To address this question, exploration of the oral zzso sensing system was undertaken in zzso obese zzso zzso By using a combination of zzso zzso and behavioral approaches, we found that zzso the attraction for lipids is decreased in obese mice, zzso this behavioral change has an zzso origin, zzso it is reversed in zzso zzso mice, revealing an inverse correlation between fat preference and zzso tissue size, zzso obesity suppresses the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso usually found during the zzso of lean mice, and zzso the zzso signaling cascade controlling the zzso calcium levels zzso in taste bud cells is decreased in obese zzso zzso obesity alters the zzso system responsible for the oral perception of dietary zzso This phenomenon seems to take place through a zzso zzso leading to changes in eating zzso
