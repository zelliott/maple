Our research has shown that 800 zzso zzso zzso unlike pure protein zzso maintained resting zzso rate zzso and zzso zzso zzso Concern that zzso from zzso might reflect protein zzso led to this study, in which 23 obese women were studied as zzso for 2 weeks on diets zzso zzso 50 percent of zzso containing either 93 percent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plus protein (75 zzso percent, SP, zzso zzso zzso or fat plus protein (75 zzso percent, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and nitrogen balance were zzso zzso fell zzso less than zzso with SP and zzso zzso zzso zzso percent, zzso zzso zzso percent), but was maintained by S zzso zzso zzso zzso percent, P zzso zzso zzso SP and zzso Plasma zzso decreased zzso less than zzso with S and SP by zzso zzso zzso percent and zzso zzso zzso percent, but increased by zzso zzso zzso percent zzso less than zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso S or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso disposal all decreased zzso zzso zzso with S and with SP, in contrast to zzso in which these parameters were unchanged (all P zzso zzso zzso S or zzso zzso (2 week) nitrogen loss was least zzso zzso zzso in SP zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with S zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which did not zzso Since inclusion of zzso in zzso diets maintained zzso while decreasing zzso zzso zzso and nitrogen loss, we conclude that the zzso effects of zzso do not depend on protein zzso
