The present study investigates the possible associations between coronary heart disease and zzso prostate zzso in autopsy zzso 

The material of our study, were 116 men between 55 years and 98 years of age, who died in the period of August zzso zzso The initial segment of the zzso and the prostate zzso of all zzso were removed while the initial 30 zzso of the left and right coronary arteries and the peripheral zone of the prostate zzso underwent zzso zzso 

Of all subjects examined zzso had pathological findings suggesting advanced coronary heart zzso Twenty out of 116 zzso were found with zzso zzso in their prostate zzso Among subjects positive for prostate cancer, 12 had died of cardiovascular diseases, while 16 had zzso evidence of advanced coronary artery zzso disease, a finding that was confirmed on zzso zzso Although most of the subjects had zzso zzso on the coronary zzso the percentage of men with prostate cancer, which had advanced zzso was greater when compared to those of subjects without prostate zzso The relation between the coronary artery zzso disease severity and the presence of zzso prostate cancer was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso No statistically significant correlation was obtained between body mass index and the presence of prostate zzso 

Our results indicate that there could be an association between coronary artery zzso disease and prostate cancer, however due to the relatively low sample further studies are needed in order to confirm such zzso
