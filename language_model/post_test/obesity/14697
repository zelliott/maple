zzso zzso insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease zzso risk are zzso Both weight-loss and zzso zzso zzso fatty acids zzso zzso zzso are independently known to reduce zzso risk, but the combined effects are zzso 

This study examines whether addition of zzso zzso zzso to a low zzso zzso weight-loss zzso results in greater improvements in zzso insulin sensitivity and zzso risk, than weight-loss zzso 

One hundred and zzso overweight zzso women entered a zzso zzso intervention zzso Thirty-nine women were zzso to a weight-loss zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso 38 to a weight-loss zzso with zzso oil zzso and 39 to receive zzso oil, with no weight-loss zzso zzso 

zzso women completed the study (35 zzso 32 zzso and 26 zzso with significant weight-loss in zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared to the control group zzso The zzso but not zzso or control group, showed significant increases in zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso and zzso zzso zzso Weight-loss showed significant improvements in insulin sensitivity zzso zzso profile zzso zzso and inflammation zzso acid zzso zzso effects showed significant decreases in zzso zzso and increases in zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso in the zzso vs zzso zzso 

Weight-loss improved risk factors associated with zzso with some additional benefits of zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso Given the current low dietary intake of zzso zzso zzso greater attention should be given to increase these fatty acids in the treatment of zzso
