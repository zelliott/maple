zzso precedes and is strongly linked to the development of type 2 diabetic zzso in most patients, yet little is known about the effects of weight reduction on this zzso This study aimed to establish proof of concept for the hypothesis that weight reduction ameliorates diabetic zzso 

Six obese individuals with advanced diabetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso urine zzso zzso zzso currently taking a zzso axis inhibitor underwent a zzso very low calorie zzso weight reduction diet with encouragement of exercise between March and September zzso zzso and other parameters of kidney health were the main outcome zzso 

There was a zzso reduction in weight zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso The intervention was associated with a zzso reduction in zzso that did not reach statistical significance zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso and significant reductions in the zzso markers serum zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso and zzso C zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso were also noted for the diabetes markers zzso zzso (166 versus 131 zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso versus zzso zzso zzso and insulin resistance zzso versus zzso zzso Physical function, general health, and the number of diabetes medications also showed statistically significant signs of zzso 

After a short-term intensive weight reduction intervention in patients with advanced diabetic zzso improvements were observed in markers of zzso zzso diabetes status, and risk factors for kidney disease zzso as well as other general indicators of health and zzso
