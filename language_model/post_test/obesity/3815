zzso zzso inflammatory zzso but little is known about how obesity zzso the inflammatory responses of exercising zzso This study assessed the acute effect of exercise on inflammatory zzso in overweight zzso 

zzso overweight zzso youth zzso mass zzso zzso and 30 zzso zzso controls of the same proportions of age and gender performed 10 zzso bouts of cycle zzso exercise above the zzso zzso with zzso rest intervals between zzso zzso and zzso blood samples were collected for white blood cell zzso and inflammatory zzso 

zzso zzso populations were higher in zzso youth zzso zzso Exercise increased most zzso zzso for both groups zzso zzso zzso remained elevated 2 hours zzso zzso zzso for both groups, whereas zzso remained elevated 2 hours zzso for the zzso zzso Natural killer zzso cells dropped below baseline 2 hours zzso Exercise significantly decreased zzso and zzso cells, which remained depressed 2 hours zzso in the zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso were zzso approximately zzso higher in zzso children zzso zzso Exercise increased zzso in both groups zzso zzso which further increased 2 hours zzso zzso zzso zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not change with zzso 

zzso baseline zzso zzso and zzso levels in zzso children suggest that childhood obesity is associated with a chronic zzso inflammatory zzso The acute inflammatory response to intense exercise appears to be similar between zzso and zzso children for most zzso but the depression of zzso zzso and zzso cells 2 hours zzso suggests that an acute risk of zzso inflammation may exist in zzso children after high-intensity zzso
