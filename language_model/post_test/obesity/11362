zzso in chronic heart failure carries a poor zzso but little is known about the influence of body mass on the prognosis of zzso heart failure zzso 

We studied zzso consecutive chronic heart failure patients followed for at least a year, in whom there were accurate baseline data for body zzso 

Average age was zzso zzso zzso years, left zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was present in zzso zzso patients were divided into zzso of body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no difference among the 5 groups in age, exercise capacity or zzso Survival was greatest in zzso zzso survival zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso survival zzso zzso Relative risks compared with zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis of 1 year zzso peak oxygen consumption zzso ratio with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso independently predicted zzso survival with a combined zzso value of zzso Age zzso zzso and diagnosis zzso zzso was not a predictor of zzso 

In patients with chronic heart failure, increasing zzso is not an adverse zzso zzso zzso patients appear to have a poorer zzso
