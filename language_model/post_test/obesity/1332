To study the zzso rate of zzso insulin from subcutaneous injection sites in zzso and obese zzso diabetes zzso zzso zzso 

Ten zzso and 10 obese zzso patients zzso mass indexes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso received four subcutaneous injections of zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso 5 zzso three in the abdominal wall above, lateral to, and below the zzso and one in the zzso The depth of the subcutaneous fat layer was measured using ultrasound zzso The residual zzso was monitored zzso for zzso zzso 

The disappearance zzso of zzso was between 4 and 6 h from all injection sites, with the exception of the upper abdominal area in the zzso subjects, where it measured approximately 3 zzso The residual zzso did not differ between zzso and obese patients measured from any of the zzso In the zzso group, the most rapid zzso of zzso was found from the upper abdominal area and the zzso from the zzso In the obese group, the zzso rates did not differ between zzso No correlation was found between the depth of the fat layer and the residual zzso when measured at any zzso 

Our results indicate that the zzso of zzso insulin is markedly slow in both obese and zzso zzso patients compared with zzso patients and healthy subjects studied zzso In the zzso group, the most rapid zzso of zzso is obtained after injection into the upper abdominal zzso zzso and zzso differences are small in the obese zzso zzso the choice of injection site is of little importance in this zzso
