The zzso ensemble of obese humans is marked by increased urinary zzso of cortisol and its zzso in the face of normal circulating cortisol zzso For better understanding of the zzso zzso meaning of these changes, the zzso zzso need to be zzso 

We investigated 17 obese women zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso and 14 normal women zzso zzso zzso who underwent zzso blood sampling at zzso zzso and plasma zzso and cortisol zzso were measured with sensitive zzso Data were analyzed with a new zzso program, approximate zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso and cortisol production rates were higher in obese women than in controls and correlated with zzso zzso of zzso correlated with zzso (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso and insulin (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso and forward zzso zzso were diminished in obese zzso The zzso effective concentration zzso of zzso zzso zzso cortisol zzso was higher in obese women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso indicating decreased potency of zzso The zzso properties of zzso and cortisol zzso were unchanged in obese zzso 

zzso women exhibit enhanced zzso and cortisol zzso production compared with lean zzso The amplified zzso drive is accompanied by decreased zzso zzso and diminished forward zzso between zzso and zzso In addition, the potency of zzso is decreased in zzso
