zzso and type 2 diabetes are worldwide health zzso The present paper investigates prenatal and zzso pathways to zzso identifying different zzso outcomes with different effects on insulin sensitivity and different underlying mechanisms involving key components of insulin zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso rats either were fed zzso ad zzso or were undernourished throughout pregnancy, generating either control or zzso growth restricted zzso zzso Male offspring were fed either standard zzso or a high-fat diet from zzso At 260 d of age, zzso insulin sensitivity was assessed by zzso zzso and other zzso parameters were zzso As expected, high-fat feeding caused zzso obesity zzso and insulin zzso zzso the insulin sensitivity of zzso offspring was similar to that of control zzso despite zzso insulin zzso and increased zzso irrespective of zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analyses of key markers of insulin sensitivity and zzso regulation showed that zzso offspring had increased zzso levels of zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso and increased expression of fatty acid zzso zzso In contrast, zzso led to decreased expression of fatty acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso The decrease in zzso zzso zzso with zzso may explain, at least in part, the insulin zzso Our data suggest that the mechanisms of obesity induced by prenatal events are fundamentally different from those of obesity induced by zzso high-fat zzso The origin of insulin zzso in zzso offspring may be independent of the zzso events that trigger the insulin resistance commonly observed in zzso
