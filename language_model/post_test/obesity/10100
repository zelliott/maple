zzso Y zzso zzso in the zzso zzso nucleus zzso produce zzso and zzso effects that promote the development and maintenance of zzso In turn, zzso metabolism in these zzso is inhibited by zzso zzso In this study, ARC zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso turnover were assessed in zzso male zzso rats prone to develop zzso obesity zzso or to be diet resistant zzso when fed a zzso zzso zzso By in zzso zzso zzso rats had zzso more ARC zzso zzso expression than zzso rats under zzso zzso zzso rat zzso zzso levels were zzso higher, but zzso zzso was zzso longer and turnover was 59% less than zzso zzso Neither a zzso fast nor 50% energy intake restriction for 5 days affected the already increased ARC zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso Both zzso increased zzso expression to the level of zzso rats in zzso rats by 23 and zzso zzso Finally, when fed HE diet for 2 zzso neither zzso nor zzso rats altered their ARC zzso expression despite the development of obesity and zzso in zzso zzso Thus zzso rats zzso and fail to regulate ARC zzso zzso to energy restriction or zzso This zzso is possibly secondary to reduced zzso because of defective zzso zzso zzso Both may be important zzso factors in the development of zzso
