To determine whether closed subcutaneous drainage systems were zzso in reducing the rate of wound breakdown of zzso incision after zzso section zzso in obese zzso 

Prospective controlled clinical zzso 

118 obese pregnant females with a body mass zzso undergoing zzso were divided into two groups: group I zzso zzso zzso with closed subcutaneous drainage system and group II zzso zzso 40) without drainage zzso zzso closure technique was zzso zzso antibiotics were given routinely to both zzso 

zzso outcomes were the zzso of wound breakdown in both groups together with rate of zzso formation and occurrence of zzso Secondary outcomes were amount of fluid zzso need for zzso 

zzso breakdown occurred in 9 cases in group I zzso while it happened in 5 cases in group II zzso zzso zzso Relative risk was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formation was observed in only 1 case in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso was observed in 18 cases in group I zzso in the first 24 h zzso while in group II, 13 cases developed fever zzso zzso zzso The need for zzso within the first 24 h was only in zzso of cases in group I while it was zzso in group II zzso zzso 

We found no significant benefit in using a subcutaneous drain as a zzso measure against wound breakdown in obese pregnant females undergoing zzso as long as they received a zzso zzso
