zzso communities in Northern Australia with high rates of group A zzso zzso skin infection in childhood also have high rates of zzso failure in adult zzso In a zzso study of one such high risk community, zzso was used as a marker of zzso zzso The prevalence of zzso increased from zzso in subjects aged zzso years to zzso zzso in those aged 50 or more zzso zzso zzso to zzso M zzso markers of past zzso infection, were present in zzso zzso at ages zzso years, zzso zzso at ages zzso and zzso zzso in those aged 50 or zzso After allowing for the zzso of zzso and of M protein zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly associated with M protein zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso of adults aged 30 or more with M protein zzso also had zzso compared with only zzso of those who were zzso More detailed zzso suggested that although most zzso people in this community developed M protein zzso following zzso infection in childhood, the development of zzso was associated with the persistence of such zzso into adult zzso The models predicted that zzso developed at a mean age of 30 years in zzso zzso at 45 years in zzso persons who were overweight, and at 62 years in zzso persons of normal zzso We demonstrated a clear association between evidence of childhood zzso infection and individual risk of zzso in adult zzso This study provided a strong rationale for prevention of zzso disease through the more effective control of zzso skin infections in childhood and through the prevention of obesity in adult zzso
