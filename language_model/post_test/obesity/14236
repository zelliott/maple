The potential long-term impact of low zzso on body fat zzso has not been zzso zzso we examined the effects of low zzso zzso on long-term energy balance and weight gain in zzso 

Two sets of analyses were realized in order to verify this zzso First, Study 1 consisted of 259 participants between 20 and 65 years of age selected from Phase 2 of the Quebec Family Study zzso The association between zzso zzso at the end of an oral zzso tolerance test zzso and changes in body mass was zzso zzso zzso follow-up of 6 zzso In addition, Study 2 consisted of 44 obese participants (20 men and 24 zzso randomly assigned to a zzso weight loss program in either a drug therapy group zzso or a zzso group coupled with energy intake zzso The focus of this study was the relationship between zzso control at the end of the treatment and zzso weight zzso 

In Study 1, the zzso zzso at 120 zzso of the zzso were zzso correlated with weight gain over 6 years zzso zzso In Study 2, the weight loss program induced a mean reduction in body weight of 10 zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso In participants who returned for a follow-up visit zzso weeks after the zzso the zzso area below zzso values zzso at the end of the zzso increased with weight loss zzso and was correlated with weight regain zzso zzso 

Lower zzso zzso at the end of an zzso are correlated with weight gain over zzso Large amounts of weight loss are associated with low zzso at the end of an zzso These low zzso zzso are strong zzso of the amount of weight regained after weight zzso
