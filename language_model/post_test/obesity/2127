To assess the association between maternal zzso weight gain zzso during the first 20 weeks of gestation and zzso and abdominal obesity of offspring at the age of 16 zzso 

A prospective cohort zzso 

The two northernmost provinces of zzso 

Mothers and their adolescent offspring born from singleton zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the Northern Finland Birth zzso zzso 

zzso weight at 20 weeks of gestation was measured in municipal zzso zzso zzso zzso was based on the difference between the measured weight and zzso zzso weight, and was classified into zzso zzso weight, height and waist circumference were measured by study nurses during a clinical zzso zzso zzso analyses zzso and without adjustment for maternal zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso education level, zzso smoking status, parity, and gender of zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso based on zzso and abdominal obesity at 16 zzso 

The highest zzso of maternal weight gain zzso zzso during the first 20 weeks of zzso was independently associated with zzso zzso and abdominal obesity in the 16-year-old offspring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Among all zzso maternal zzso obesity showed the highest odds for both zzso and abdominal obesity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso during the first half of gestation predicts offspring zzso and abdominal obesity in adolescence, yet a high zzso zzso appears to be a more important zzso of both zzso
