To test the hypothesis that overweight siblings of children with type 2 diabetes zzso zzso have a higher prevalence of abnormal zzso tolerance zzso compared with other overweight zzso 

This was a zzso study of overweight zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso subjects, age 8 to 17 years, with at least 1 sibling zzso 12 zzso The primary outcome was zzso as assessed by the oral zzso tolerance test zzso zzso 140 zzso The secondary outcome was insulin resistance by zzso model assessment zzso 

The sibling zzso and control zzso groups were similar in terms of age, sex, racial distribution zzso African zzso zzso status, and zzso The prevalence of zzso in the sibling group was zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso in controls zzso zzso Fisher exact zzso zzso odds zzso zzso confidence zzso to zzso zzso analysis did not identify zzso for either zzso There were no significant differences in zzso or zzso zzso between the 2 zzso 

zzso siblings of children with zzso had 4 times greater odds of having zzso compared with other overweight zzso This group may represent a particularly high-risk population to target for screening and pediatric zzso zzso
