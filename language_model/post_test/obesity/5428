zzso zzso mice are zzso and zzso however, the cause of zzso remains largely zzso 

zzso metabolism in zzso in zzso zzso zzso mice and lean zzso was studied by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for 6 zzso applying mass zzso distribution analysis on blood zzso and urinary zzso 

When expressed on the basis of body weight, zzso zzso production zzso vs zzso zzso obese versus lean mice, zzso and de zzso synthesis of zzso zzso vs zzso zzso obese versus lean mice, zzso were lower in zzso mice than in lean zzso In contrast, zzso cycling was greatly increased in obese mice zzso vs zzso zzso obese versus lean mice, zzso As a result, total zzso zzso output remained unaffected zzso vs zzso zzso obese vs lean mice, zzso The zzso clearance rate of zzso was significantly lower in obese mice zzso vs zzso zzso obese versus lean mice, zzso zzso zzso levels of genes zzso for zzso and zzso zzso were markedly increased in zzso zzso 

zzso total zzso zzso output in the presence of zzso reflects zzso insulin resistance in zzso mice, which is associated with markedly increased rates of zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice primarily results from a decreased zzso clearance rate of zzso
