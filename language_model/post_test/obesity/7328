zzso is a risk factor for cardiovascular dysfunction, yet the underlying factors driving this impaired function remain poorly zzso zzso resistance is a common pathology in obese patients and has been shown to impair vascular zzso Whether insulin resistance or zzso itself, is zzso remains zzso 

The present study tested the hypothesis that insulin resistance is the underlying zzso for impaired zzso zzso in obesity by genetic deletion of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

The zzso mouse is zzso obese, zzso and has zzso zzso in zzso expression compared to lean zzso In zzso mice, zzso deletion improved zzso zzso zzso and insulin zzso signaling in muscle and zzso zzso insulin signaling in zzso mice was not improved by deletion of zzso indicating specific zzso of peripheral insulin zzso Additionally, obese mice demonstrate an impaired zzso dependent and independent zzso to zzso and sodium zzso zzso This zzso which correlated with increased zzso in the zzso mice, was corrected by zzso zzso Increased zzso production was associated with increased expression of zzso zzso 1 and its molecular regulators, zzso and zzso 

zzso of zzso improved both zzso dependent and independent zzso zzso and reduced zzso generation in zzso zzso zzso deletion did not affect any vascular function in lean zzso Taken together, these data reveal a role for peripheral insulin resistance as the zzso of vascular dysfunction in zzso
