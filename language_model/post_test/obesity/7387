zzso studies the role of genetic variation on interactions between diet and health, aiming to provide more personalized dietary zzso However, replication has been zzso Our aim was to study interaction among a functional zzso zzso food zzso and body mass index zzso in independent populations to replicate findings and to increase their evidence zzso 

zzso follow-up (20 zzso and zzso analyses were undertaken in 3 independent zzso We analyzed zzso interactions between the zzso zzso zzso and saturated fat intake on zzso and obesity in zzso individuals from 3 populations in the United zzso the zzso zzso Study zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso Drugs and Diet Network Study zzso zzso and zzso Rican Centers on zzso Health and Health zzso Study zzso Hispanics of Caribbean zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso in study participants ranged from zzso to zzso We identified statistically significant interactions between the zzso zzso and saturated fat regarding zzso in all 3 zzso Thus, the magnitude of the difference in zzso between the individuals with the zzso and zzso zzso differed by saturated zzso A mean increase in zzso of zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso was observed between zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso but not with low- saturated fat intake in all zzso Likewise, the zzso zzso was significantly associated with higher obesity prevalence in all populations only in the zzso fat zzso zzso zzso of obesity for individuals with the zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso were an odds ratio of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso in the zzso fat zzso but no association was detected in the zzso fat stratum zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

For the first time to our knowledge, a zzso interaction influencing zzso and obesity has been strongly and consistently zzso in 3 independent zzso
