The chronic moderate exercise positively alters the systemic zzso zzso enhances the insulin action, and ameliorates the zzso damage in the skeletal muscle and zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of an intermittent zzso training on the zzso parameters of the white zzso tissue in the obese zzso zzso 

zzso zzso rats, 8 week old, were subjected to running on a zzso treadmill (1 zzso 5 zzso 20 zzso at zzso for 10 weeks, except the weekends, zzso zzso zzso zzso or were placed to the zzso treadmill zzso zzso zzso zzso for the same zzso The serum insulin, zzso and zzso were zzso The gene expression of the zzso system zzso components and selected zzso parameters were zzso by real-time zzso in the liver and zzso and zzso zzso zzso The content of the protein zzso groups was zzso in the liver and zzso fat zzso 

The gene expression of the zzso fatty acid binding protein 4 zzso was significantly elevated in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The level of the zzso zzso was increased in the zzso zzso tissue while zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were elevated in the zzso zzso tissue after zzso The zzso training led to a decrease in the amount of protein zzso groups in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes in the zzso zzso tissue was not influenced by the zzso In the liver, only the zzso zzso gene expression increased zzso The serum zzso insulin, and zzso zzso were not changed in the zzso rats when compared to zzso zzso 

Data of the present study indicate that an intermittent moderate exercise in the zzso obese zzso rats lasting for 10 weeks improves some of the zzso and zzso parameters of the white zzso tissue and decreases the protein zzso zzso a general beneficial effect of the long-lasting zzso
