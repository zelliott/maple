To evaluate whether genetic zzso at the zzso gene zzso is associated with zzso we studied four common zzso in the zzso promoter zzso zzso C, zzso zzso in 85 zzso patients and 25 healthy zzso We found 5 different zzso when considering the 3 zzso zzso at positions zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso were zzso in patients and zzso in controls, whereas those of the zzso zzso were zzso in patients and zzso in controls zzso zzso zzso P zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were in linkage zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and were associated with patient or control zzso zzso and zzso zzso were more frequent in patients in zzso or considering subjects zzso and zzso for G zzso as a whole zzso zzso for all zzso In healthy women G zzso at zzso and zzso were associated with statistically significant higher circulating levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a tendency zzso zzso for higher total T zzso compared with zzso and zzso zzso On the contrary, neither the zzso nor the zzso zzso was related to zzso or influenced any clinical or zzso zzso In conclusion, our present results suggest that the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso are involved in the zzso of zzso zzso
