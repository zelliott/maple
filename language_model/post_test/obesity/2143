The zzso protein zzso has recently been shown to be expressed in zzso zzso 

We aimed to evaluate the association of zzso with obesity and zzso zzso and vascular zzso in zzso 

We zzso zzso serum levels in 69 lean and 105 obese children and assessed associations with zzso and cardiovascular zzso In addition, a potential direct effect of zzso on the expression of zzso zzso molecules and cell viability was assessed in human coronary artery zzso cells in zzso 

zzso zzso were significantly higher in obese compared to lean children and correlated with zzso parameters such as body mass index zzso score, zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, we identified significant associations with the measures of inflammation zzso zzso protein and white blood cell count, as well as with the markers of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Multiple zzso analyses confirmed zzso as the strongest predictor of zzso and zzso independent of body mass index zzso zzso Likewise, on the cellular level, zzso induced zzso and zzso expression in zzso cells in zzso whereas zzso and zzso expression and zzso cell viability were zzso 

Our results suggest an association of zzso with obesity and inflammatory and zzso zzso markers and support a role for zzso as a molecular link between increasing fat mass and an early zzso risk profile in obese zzso
