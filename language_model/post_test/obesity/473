zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso uses standard zzso access to determine cardiac output zzso zzso are based on zzso zzso characteristics in combination with patient characteristic data to estimate individual zzso zzso It has been shown that obesity is associated with altered zzso compliance independently of other risk zzso We conducted this study to assess the zzso of measuring CO by the zzso device in obese patients undergoing cardiac surgery in comparison with zzso zzso zzso 

Fifteen obese patients with a zzso zzso or zzso 30 and 23 non-obese patients zzso zzso undergoing coronary artery bypass zzso zzso were zzso zzso CO zzso by zzso zzso and the zzso device zzso version zzso were obtained zzso after induction of zzso before zzso bypass zzso after zzso and after zzso zzso zzso in the intensive care unit zzso were performed upon arrival in the zzso after 4, 8, and 24 h after zzso CO was zzso to the body surface area zzso index, zzso 

The analysis of 262 data pairs revealed a bias and precision of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in a percentage error of zzso zzso zzso values ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis resulted in a percentage error of zzso in obese patients and zzso in patients with normal zzso 

The zzso zzso device was found to adequately agree with zzso pulmonary artery zzso in both obese and non-obese patients undergoing zzso
