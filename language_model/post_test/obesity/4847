It is hypothesized that the genesis and spread of obesity is predetermined by genetic immunity to infections and subsequent zzso genetic zzso As in genetic immunity to infections, obesity is determined by a constitutional zzso between relevant acting agents and their molecular zzso Because many hormones share their specific receptors with the acting molecules of infectious agents, zzso formation of a zzso genetic resistance to infection could also create life-threatening immunity to relevant zzso This kind of individual molecular constitution could spread in a population as a result of natural selection for genetic immunity to infections that had performed differently in ecologically distinct zzso Extraordinary diversity in the obesity course, manifestations and severity of specific zzso and their sizes and focal disposition around the body, is created by the zzso mating of persons with different grades of zzso zzso
