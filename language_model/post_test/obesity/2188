zzso fat with its close proximity to coronary arteries has been suggested to be a significant predictor of cardiovascular zzso We studied the relations among acquired zzso zzso zzso and genetic factors in the zzso of zzso zzso A rare sample zzso zzso zzso of healthy zzso zzso twin pairs zzso for obesity zzso difference in body mass index zzso zzso and 9 zzso zzso pairs 23 to 33 years old were examined for cardiac structure, function, zzso fat thickness zzso abdominal subcutaneous zzso and visceral zzso tissue zzso liver fat zzso resonance zzso and serum zzso zzso zzso In the entire sample, zzso zzso were remarkably similar in most zzso zzso including zzso fat zzso correlation zzso p zzso zzso However, in the zzso pairs, the obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso more zzso fat zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso They also had significantly larger zzso and left zzso zzso zzso fat correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso in individual twins and when using zzso differences of zzso within pairs zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In multiple zzso analyses including abdominal subcutaneous zzso zzso and liver fat, zzso zzso protein was the only factor that remained significantly associated with zzso fat in individual twins and within zzso In conclusion, subjects who share the same genes seem to have similar cardiac zzso However, acquired obesity increases zzso fat independent of genetic zzso The close relation between zzso fat and zzso inflammation is likely to contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease in zzso
