New genetic zzso most of which are expressed in the brain, have recently been reported to contribute to the development of zzso The brain, especially the zzso is strongly involved in regulating weight and food zzso 

We investigated whether the recently reported obesity zzso are associated with measures of abdominal zzso and whether these zzso affect dietary energy or zzso zzso 

We studied zzso female Dutch participants in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition zzso Their zzso zzso and intake of zzso were zzso zzso was performed by using zzso zzso A linear zzso model, with an assumption of an additive effect, was used to analyze the association between zzso of 12 single zzso zzso zzso and zzso measures and dietary zzso 

Seven zzso were associated zzso zzso with weight, body mass index zzso and waist circumference zzso for zzso They were in or near to 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Five zzso were associated with dietary intake zzso zzso and were in or near 5 zzso zzso zzso with increased zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

We confirmed some of the findings for the newly identified obesity zzso that are associated with general zzso in a healthy Dutch female zzso Our results suggest that these zzso are not specifically associated with abdominal zzso but more generally with zzso We also found that some of the zzso were associated with zzso food zzso
