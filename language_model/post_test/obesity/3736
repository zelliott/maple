We sought to assess whether direct zzso of circulating free fatty acids zzso by zzso occurs in zzso in overnight zzso humans and, if so, whether there are regional differences in zzso between lean and obese women and zzso We used zzso injections of zzso zzso zzso followed by carefully timed zzso tissue zzso First, we validated a method to measure direct zzso zzso zzso and then zzso this process using the modified methods in zzso zzso men and zzso We then used a continuous infusion of zzso zzso to measure direct and indirect zzso regional zzso tissue zzso in obese men and zzso zzso zzso zzso was greater in women than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso were taken up by subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso zzso subcutaneous fat took up zzso more avidly than zzso fat in men, but this did not occur in zzso Similar sex and regional difference were found to occur in obese women and zzso Gene expression of fatty acid zzso was greater in abdominal than zzso fat in men zzso zzso but not in women zzso zzso zzso We observed zzso and zzso recycling of circulating zzso into subcutaneous zzso This is a novel zzso disposal zzso that may also play a role in the development or maintenance of body fat zzso Regional variations in facilitated fatty acid transport may contribute to this zzso
