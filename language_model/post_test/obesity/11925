The effects of various weight loss strategies on pancreatic beta cell function remain zzso We aimed to compare the effect of intensive lifestyle intervention zzso and zzso gastric bypass surgery zzso on beta cell zzso 

One year controlled clinical trial zzso zzso zzso 

One hundred and zzso zzso obese participants without known diabetes from the zzso study zzso zzso age zzso zzso years, body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso 84 zzso were allocated to zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso The patients underwent repeated oral zzso tolerance tests zzso and were zzso as having either normal zzso or abnormal zzso tolerance zzso zzso zzso subjects with zzso (age zzso zzso years, zzso zzso zzso zzso 19 zzso served as zzso zzso zzso of beta cell function were zzso 

One year weight reduction was zzso zzso after zzso and zzso (10) after zzso zzso zzso zzso index zzso increased in all treatment groups (all zzso although more in the surgery groups (both P zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio decreased in both surgery groups (both P zzso but to a greater extent in the surgery group with zzso at baseline zzso zzso Post surgery, patients with zzso at baseline had higher zzso and lower zzso zzso ratio than controls (both P zzso 

zzso bypass surgery improved beta cell function to a significantly greater extent than zzso zzso insulin zzso and zzso processing may indicate excessive beta cell function after gastric bypass zzso
