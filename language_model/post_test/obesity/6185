It has long been a matter of debate whether the zzso zzso zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso can affect insulin zzso through the zzso of zzso We generated mice lacking both zzso and zzso zzso and explored the role of zzso in pancreatic zzso in the setting of zzso zzso developed elevated blood zzso levels and reduced plasma insulin levels compared with zzso in a fed state, while the zzso of zzso did not affect zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso exacerbated the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso leading to reduced zzso insulin zzso The zzso of zzso also diminished the zzso mass in zzso mice due to decreased cell zzso In conclusion, zzso affects insulin secretary capacity especially in the setting of zzso
