zzso acid zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso long chain fatty acid zzso zzso gene deletion protects mice from high fat zzso zzso In this study we have investigated the regulatory mechanism of zzso expression at the zzso zzso zzso expression was activated during zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein levels were positively correlated with zzso protein alpha zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, a negative correlation was detected between zzso and zzso zzso of zzso or zzso increased zzso zzso and protein levels in several types of zzso Restoration of zzso or zzso expression in zzso or zzso mouse embryonic zzso increased zzso zzso However, in mouse embryonic zzso zzso was a more potent zzso of zzso expression than was zzso zzso of zzso robustly increased zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso A zzso element was identified in the zzso promoter by using zzso and specific site zzso The binding of zzso in the zzso promoter was detected by zzso zzso in zzso zzso These results demonstrated that zzso regulates zzso gene expression at the zzso zzso
