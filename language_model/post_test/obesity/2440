To determine whether or not impaired male sex behavior in obese male zzso rats is accompanied by any anatomical zzso in a zzso area implicated in the control of sex behavior, 6 lean and 5 obese male zzso rats were studied zzso and zzso at 14 months of zzso zzso males showed markedly decreased male sex behavior relative to lean zzso in spite of serum levels of testosterone and zzso weights comparable to those of lean zzso zzso rats had significant decreases in brain weight and volumes of sexually zzso zzso per g of brain, relative to lean zzso volumes per g brain of other structures zzso and zzso zzso were not different between zzso It is suggested that an incomplete expression of sexually zzso features of the zzso zzso zzso due perhaps to an impaired process of zzso brain zzso may contribute to decreased male sex behavior in adult obese zzso
