The zzso axis in women is activated and associated with decreased zzso zzso estimated by relating zzso and cortisol pulse zzso Recently, a new accurate method for constructing the zzso zzso relationship was introduced, which is based on the relation between zzso zzso and associated cortisol zzso rates within cortisol zzso 

The zzso zzso relation between zzso and cortisol in obesity is changed, leading to diminished zzso 

Twenty-five obese zzso women and 16 normal weight zzso women were studied by zzso blood sampling for 24 zzso 

zzso and cortisol zzso rates, zzso zzso estimates of zzso zzso efficacy zzso cortisol zzso dynamic zzso zzso and adrenal sensitivity zzso zzso from zzso zzso profiles were zzso 

The initial potency zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in obese women and zzso zzso zzso in lean women zzso and the corresponding values for the recovery phase were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity (curve slope) amounted to zzso zzso zzso in obese women and zzso zzso zzso in normal weight women zzso The efficacy zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso in obese women and zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso in normal weight women zzso zzso zzso rate, inflection point, and zzso values were not zzso zzso or zzso did not change the zzso zzso 

The zzso relation in obesity in women is characterized by decreased sensitivity and zzso thus explaining zzso serum cortisol zzso despite increased plasma zzso zzso
