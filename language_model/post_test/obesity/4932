Recent studies in the mouse have demonstrated that variations in zzso expression levels in zzso tissue have marked effects on zzso tissue mass and insulin zzso In the zzso zzso zzso prevents normal zzso tissue development, resulting in zzso and insulin resistance, whereas excess zzso levels promote fat zzso and insulin zzso Here, we investigated the effects of genetic variation in zzso levels on zzso zzso across species by analyzing zzso transcript levels in human and mouse zzso zzso A strong negative correlation was observed between zzso zzso levels and zzso zzso and insulin levels, as well as an indicator of insulin resistance zzso in both mice and zzso We subsequently analyzed the zzso diversity of the zzso gene in zzso Finnish families, as well as in a zzso sample of obese zzso zzso zzso and lean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were defined by zzso seven single zzso zzso zzso of the critical DNA region over the zzso zzso zzso zzso and corresponding zzso zzso exhibited associations with serum insulin levels and body mass index zzso zzso zzso Both the expression levels in zzso tissue across species and genetic data in human study samples highlight the importance of zzso in zzso zzso and imply that zzso zzso of this gene have significance in human zzso zzso
