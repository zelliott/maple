The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso previously called zzso or zzso zzso zzso are a family of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso These zzso zzso exert their many crucial zzso and biological functions in zzso via their ability to cleave larger inactive precursor proteins into their biologically active mature zzso This event takes place in a highly efficient and selective zzso Such actions of zzso either alone or in combination to cleave specific protein bonds are the hallmark events that not only define the normal functions and metabolism of the body but also may lead to a variety of diseases or disorders with associated zzso These include among others, diabetes, zzso cancer, cardiovascular diseases, reproduction abnormalities as well as viral bacterial zzso These conditions were the direct consequences of an enhanced level of zzso activity of one or more zzso except only zzso whose zzso activity in relation to its zzso zzso has yet to be zzso zzso to this finding, a large number of research studies have been exclusively devoted to develop zzso efficient and reliable in zzso methods for examining the zzso activity of these zzso Several zzso have been developed to monitor zzso activity and these are widely used in chemical, zzso cellular and animal zzso This review will cover various zzso and protocols that are currently available in the literature for zzso activity zzso These include liquid phase methods using zzso zzso and zzso zzso fluorescent zzso as well as a newly developed novel solid phase zzso zzso This review will also highlight the usefulness of these zzso and finally a comparative analysis has been made to examine their merits and demerits with some key zzso
