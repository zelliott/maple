zzso represents a disruption in balancing fuel intake with energy expenditure in favor of energy zzso zzso is known to be carefully regulated and, over time, highly resistant to major changes, raising questions about how energy zzso can become zzso in favor of fat zzso In zzso the excess zzso zzso represents a surfeit of energy, but those who are obese often experience rapid fatigue and decreased physical zzso reflecting an energy zzso To develop an explanation for this apparent contradiction in energy zzso and the chronic zzso relative to energy used in zzso a review of the literature was zzso The resulting model of obesity is based on a growing body of research demonstrating that altered zzso energy production, particularly in skeletal muscles, is a major anomaly capable of setting off a chain of zzso events leading to zzso zzso in skeletal muscle zzso distribution and their zzso and zzso energy capacities in obesity are zzso The zzso responses of obese and normal individuals to exercise are zzso and the effects of weight loss on energy production are zzso The effect of altered fat zzso is considered in relation to energy regulation by the central nervous system and the development of major obesity zzso including systemic zzso insulin resistance and diabetes, and cardiovascular zzso zzso for clinical intervention and additional research are proposed based on the model presented of impaired zzso function in zzso
