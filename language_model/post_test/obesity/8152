Previous studies, based on relative risks for certain secondary diseases, have shown greater zzso costs in higher body mass index zzso zzso The present study zzso the relationship between zzso and total zzso zzso with the patient as the unit of zzso 

zzso of zzso data, collected over zzso in zzso from zzso randomly selected patients, in 65 general practices across zzso Healthcare costs estimated from primary care, zzso zzso and zzso zzso weighted by unit costs taken from standard zzso 

In zzso zzso significant associations zzso were found between total zzso expenditure and all dependent variables zzso zzso zzso and increasing with greater physical activity, age and zzso In zzso analysis, age, sex, zzso smoking and alcohol consumption remained significantly associated with zzso cost, and together explained just zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso total annual zzso cost was zzso zzso zzso zzso higher per unit zzso All cost categories were significantly zzso higher for those with zzso compared with zzso zzso prescription drugs zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso versus zzso primary care zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso versus zzso and zzso care zzso versus zzso women zzso 

Annual zzso expenditure rose a mean of zzso per unit greater zzso doubling between zzso zzso This zzso may be an underestimate if the zzso patients with heights and weights recorded had other costly zzso
