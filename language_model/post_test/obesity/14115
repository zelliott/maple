In search of functional zzso associated with the zzso of insulin resistance, we studied a zzso in the promoter of zzso the gene coding for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso a major zzso of insulin zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso was selected among single zzso zzso of the zzso region because we suspected that its common C zzso zzso frequency approximately 50% in zzso could create a zzso motif and was zzso in five zzso of obese zzso zzso zzso and two zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso European zzso To estimate insulin resistance in these children, the zzso model assessment for insulin resistance zzso index was measured in strict nutritional zzso zzso and functional effects of zzso were explored in zzso cell lines and in zzso from obese zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso was associated with zzso in the obese children zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso averaged zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso obese children zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso patients had intermediate zzso As shown by the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the association of zzso with zzso depended on zzso and was only marginal in zzso children zzso zzso zzso At the molecular level, the C zzso of zzso was found to create a zzso site able to increase zzso of zzso 

We zzso that the C zzso of zzso is a zzso zzso capable of attenuating insulin resistance in obese children through increased expression of zzso
