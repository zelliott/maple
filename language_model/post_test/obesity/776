zzso protein zzso values predict zzso cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes zzso zzso between zzso and zzso predominantly assessed zzso may partly explain these zzso Previous studies have been unable to control for genetic influences on zzso and zzso The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between zzso and accurately measured body fat, zzso zzso blood pressure, and environmental and behavioral factors, independent of genetic zzso 

One hundred zzso healthy female twins (age zzso zzso were studied after excluding pairs with zzso zzso zzso Total body fat and central abdominal fat zzso were measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration was strongly related to surrogate and direct measures of body fat zzso to zzso zzso zzso blood pressure zzso zzso and zzso and zzso levels zzso to zzso zzso zzso alcohol consumers and zzso of hormone replacement therapy zzso had lower zzso levels than zzso and zzso users, zzso In zzso multiple zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso B, and zzso use explained zzso of the zzso in circulating zzso In analyses controlling for genetic influences in zzso zzso zzso differences in zzso were associated with zzso differences in total body fat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso HDL cholesterol zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was strongly related to total and central abdominal zzso blood pressure, and zzso levels, independent of genetic zzso These relationships are likely to contribute significantly to prospective associations between zzso and type 2 diabetes and coronary zzso
