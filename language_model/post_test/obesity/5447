The current study investigated the association between zzso zzso and the combination of hypertension and obesity zzso and the related clinical zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso in zzso cases with HO and zzso unrelated zzso No associations between zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and HO were zzso However, total cholesterol zzso levels were significantly different among zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso power zzso zzso In male cases, zzso carriers zzso + zzso had higher zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels compared with zzso zzso carriers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso carriers were more prevalent among the subjects with both HO and elevated zzso levels zzso or zzso zzso than those with HO and optimal zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso odds ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso approximately zzso Multiple zzso zzso analysis suggested a significant contribution of zzso zzso to the elevated zzso levels after controlling for conventional risk factors zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso approximately zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene did not seem to be associated with HO but with zzso levels in zzso The zzso gene may be involved in human zzso zzso
