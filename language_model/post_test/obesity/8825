zzso is associated with lower rates of skeletal muscle fatty acid zzso zzso which is linked to insulin zzso zzso is reduced further in obese African-American zzso zzso white women zzso and may also be lower in lean zzso zzso zzso In lean zzso endurance exercise training zzso zzso the zzso capacity of skeletal zzso zzso we determined whether zzso would elevate skeletal muscle zzso similarly in zzso and CW with a lower zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso rates of zzso were assessed in zzso zzso muscle strips using zzso zzso zzso zzso from lean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and CW zzso zzso zzso zzso undergoing voluntary abdominal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and CW (24 zzso zzso zzso and obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and CW (40 zzso zzso zzso underwent 10 consecutive days of zzso on a cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso peak oxygen zzso zzso was measured in zzso zzso zzso as captured zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Muscle strip experiments showed suppressed rates of zzso zzso zzso zzso in lean zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the rates of skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in both lean zzso and zzso In obese subjects, zzso zzso (but not zzso or zzso zzso was lower zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso in obese zzso zzso zzso and 59% zzso zzso in obese zzso Similar increases zzso zzso in zzso zzso were observed for zzso and zzso in both zzso 

Both lean and obese zzso possess a lower capacity for skeletal muscle zzso but zzso increases zzso similarly in both zzso and zzso These data suggest the use of zzso for treatment against obesity and diabetes for both zzso and zzso
