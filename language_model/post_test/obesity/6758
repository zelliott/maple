Barrett's zzso is a precursor zzso of zzso zzso a cancer that, in the USA, has increased in zzso over zzso during the past 40 zzso Barrett's zzso and zzso zzso are much more common among men than among zzso this finding is unexplained and most earlier studies lacked sufficient numbers of women to evaluate zzso risk zzso We leveraged the power of an international consortium to assess zzso relationships between body mass index zzso abdominal circumference and Barrett's zzso 

Four zzso studies provided a total of zzso cases zzso women, zzso zzso and zzso population controls zzso women, zzso zzso for zzso zzso estimates, generated using individual participant data, were combined using random effects zzso 

zzso circumference was significantly associated with Barrett's zzso even after adjustment for zzso persons in the highest versus the lowest zzso of waist circumference had approximately zzso and zzso increases in the odds of Barrett's zzso among men and women, respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso In contrast, there was no evidence of a significant association between zzso and the risk of Barrett's zzso with or without adjustment for waist zzso 

zzso zzso independent of zzso was found to be a risk factor for Barrett's zzso among both men and zzso Future studies examining the biological mechanisms of this association will extend our knowledge regarding the zzso of Barrett's zzso
