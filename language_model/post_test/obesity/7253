To evaluate how the zzso profile associates with zzso zzso E gene zzso plasma zzso level, and body mass index zzso zzso score in Portuguese zzso 

zzso cohort zzso 

Hospital de zzso zzso and Hospital de zzso Maria zzso zzso zzso between May 2006 and March zzso 

One hundred zzso obese children and adolescents (62 zzso mean age, zzso years zzso zzso zzso Participants were grouped according to zzso zzso E zzso presence of the zzso E zzso 2 or 4 in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 31) carriers, respectively, or as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were excluded from zzso E analysis because they carry both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso group 1, zzso zzso score less than 2 zzso zzso zzso group 2, zzso zzso score of 2 or more and less than zzso zzso zzso zzso and group 3, zzso zzso score of zzso or more zzso zzso zzso 

zzso variable comparisons between zzso E zzso and zzso zzso score groups and influence of zzso zzso score and zzso level, adjusted for zzso E zzso on total cholesterol to zzso zzso cholesterol and zzso zzso to zzso B zzso 

zzso carriers presented with a worse zzso profile when compared with zzso and zzso zzso There was also a clear risk of worsening for the group with the highest zzso zzso zzso zzso E zzso zzso zzso score, and zzso level were significantly associated with total cholesterol to zzso zzso cholesterol zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso for all) and zzso zzso to zzso B zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso for all) zzso 

Our data suggest a more zzso zzso profile for some zzso E zzso and for increasing zzso zzso score, whereas zzso level seems to play a protective zzso
