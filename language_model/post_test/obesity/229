To test the hypothesis that obese children are at higher risk of having zzso zzso symptoms compared with zzso zzso 

In this prospective study, 236 obese children zzso 7 to 16 zzso were interviewed using a standard questionnaire for zzso symptoms and a zzso symptom score was zzso zzso was defined as body mass index zzso greater than 95th zzso for age and zzso One hundred and one zzso and zzso children with zzso between 5th and 95th zzso served as zzso zzso data were collected in all zzso We compared prevalence rates of a zzso symptom score and other symptoms between the 2 zzso 

A prevalence rate of a positive zzso symptom score zzso was significantly higher in obese children than in the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso remained as the only significant predictor for a positive zzso symptom score after controlling for other variables such as age, sex, race, and caffeine exposure zzso odds zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A positive zzso symptom score increased significantly from zzso in the control group to zzso in 196 obese children to zzso in 40 severely obese children (with zzso zzso 

zzso children zzso 7 to 16 zzso are at higher risk of having zzso symptoms compared with the control zzso This risk is independent of age, sex, or race and increases with higher zzso
