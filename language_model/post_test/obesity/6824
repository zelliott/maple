Introduction of the yellow obese gene zzso into mice zzso results in obesity and diabetes by 5 weeks of zzso 

Using this model of type 2 diabetes, we evaluated male and female 6- to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice subjected to zzso zzso zzso and sacrificed at day zzso zzso 

Despite similar zzso sizes zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso survival was zzso zzso in zzso mice and zzso zzso in zzso mice zzso Plasma zzso levels were zzso increased in zzso mice at baseline compared to zzso zzso zzso levels did not change in zzso mice but decreased 38% in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso dimensions zzso were smaller and fractional zzso improved in the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso for zzso The improved cardiac function in zzso was accompanied by reduced zzso numbers and collagen I and III levels (both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for vessel density demonstrated fewer vessels in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In conclusion, our study in zzso mice revealed a paradoxical reduced zzso survival but improved cardiac function through reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso These results indicate a zzso effect of obesity in the zzso zzso
