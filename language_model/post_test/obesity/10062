zzso ventilation with zzso or zzso has been increasingly used in the zzso The objective of mechanical ventilation is in addition to improve gas exchange to reduce breathing zzso While improvement on breathing work has been shown mainly on zzso patients with different respiratory diseases, there is no existing data about the effect of zzso ventilation on the breathing work of patients with massive zzso 

Assisted zzso with zzso positive airway pressure zzso was carried out on 5 overweight control subjects zzso zzso 7 overweight patients with zzso sleep zzso zzso 6 patients with zzso syndrome zzso and 7 overweight patients with chronic zzso lung disease zzso zzso pressure assist zzso was set to 12 or 16 zzso zzso zzso pressure zzso was set to 5 zzso zzso All, subjects were massive overweight zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso range zzso to zzso zzso Respiratory muscle activity was measured as zzso pressure change zzso zzso and zzso pressure change zzso zzso and calculated as pressure time zzso 

With zzso ventilation respiratory muscle activity was significantly zzso zzso reduced in all groups at least zzso compared to baseline values during spontaneous zzso 

zzso ventilation via face masks can efficiently reduce work of breathing in subjects with massive zzso
