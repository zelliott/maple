A recent report has shown an association between a specific zzso restriction zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso gene and Type 2 zzso zzso zzso To further examine the significance of this finding we have studied Type 2 diabetic zzso for linkage between the zzso zzso of this zzso zzso gene and zzso One large pedigree, in which the diabetic zzso was associated with obesity and insulin resistance, was zzso In this family the disease did not zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso linkage analysis was performed assuming zzso dominant inheritance with zzso zzso At putative gene zzso of zzso and zzso the zzso of the odds for linkage versus zzso at a zzso fraction of zzso was zzso and zzso respectively (a value of less than zzso indicates zzso zzso zzso variations in the zzso zzso zzso gene are unlikely to be responsible for the development of diabetes in this zzso
