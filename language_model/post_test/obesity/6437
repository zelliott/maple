To examine the relationship between physical activity and zzso patterns and overweight in zzso adolescents using baseline and zzso change in activity and zzso zzso 

zzso representative data from zzso participants zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blacks, zzso Hispanics, and 901 zzso in the National zzso Study of Adolescent Health zzso and zzso Data on moderate to vigorous and zzso physical activity, zzso viewing, and video zzso use were obtained from zzso zzso models assessed the association of overweight zzso mass zzso or zzso 95th zzso Centers for Disease Control and zzso Center for Health Statistics 2000 zzso with initial (and zzso zzso activity and zzso levels, controlling for age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, urban residence, cigarette smoking, and region of zzso 

zzso prevalence was positively associated with high level zzso viewing among white boys zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso and girls zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso The odds of overweight decreased with high levels of moderate to vigorous physical activity among white boys zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso black boys zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and girls zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and Hispanic boys zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and girls zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

zzso probabilities generated from the zzso zzso models, which examined the experimental effects of altering hours of zzso viewing and bouts of moderate to vigorous physical activity, show lower overweight among adolescents who watched less TV per week combined with frequent moderate to vigorous physical activity than those who watched more TV per week combined with fewer bouts of weekly moderate to vigorous physical zzso zzso probabilities suggest important sex and ethnic differences in these zzso
