The zzso factors that account for the development of diabetes condition in Chinese women with zzso zzso syndrome zzso remain zzso 

To clarify the zzso features by evaluating the levels of insulin sensitivity and zzso cell function in these women with zzso either separately or by using of a disposition indexes zzso 

zzso study involving 137 Chinese women with zzso and 123 normal women were examined by zzso zzso profile, sex hormone, zzso C zzso zzso oral zzso tolerance tests and insulin tolerance zzso 

After controlling for zzso status, the zzso Index was significantly lower in women with zzso in comparison to those of normal women zzso The early phase of insulin zzso zzso zzso remained significantly lower in lean women with zzso than those of both lean and obese women of control group zzso and p zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso values were significantly lower zzso zzso in obese women with zzso zzso than those of zzso zzso Further, all zzso derived from zzso state indexes in women with zzso were significantly lower than those of zzso control women zzso for zzso Lastly, zzso derived from zzso states indexes in zzso were significantly lower than those of zzso 

Early impaired zzso cell function was detected in both LP and zzso However, more serious primary zzso in insulin action was detected in LP compared to zzso These findings imply that early screening and intervention for zzso would be therapeutic for Chinese zzso
