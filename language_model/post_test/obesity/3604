Male obesity may lead to declines in testosterone levels, zzso hormonal profile, and zzso zzso To assess the effects of obesity on zzso zzso rats fed a high-fat diet served as a model of induced zzso The litter sizes for females zzso to obese males were significantly lower as compared to females zzso with zzso zzso Their serum zzso zzso zzso zzso cholesterol, and zzso levels increased in obese zzso but testosterone and zzso hormone levels zzso zzso zzso disruptions included zzso zzso disrupted tight zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso To further investigate the molecular mechanisms leading to zzso changes, we employed zzso zzso analysis on rats fed both types of zzso Three spots were zzso in rats fed a high-fat diet whereas two others were zzso One of the zzso spots was zzso zzso 1 zzso a zzso zzso related zzso localized to zzso zzso In a zzso line cultured in a high-fat supplemented zzso zzso abundance was accompanied by increases in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreases in the tight zzso zzso zzso and zzso In conclusion, declines in rat male fertility induced by a high-fat diet are associated with an altered zzso protein expression pattern as well as disruption of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression may provide a zzso marker of reduced fertility in obese zzso as increases in its expression may be zzso to zzso function during zzso
