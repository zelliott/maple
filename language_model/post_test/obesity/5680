The effects of free fatty acids zzso on insulin zzso binding and processing zzso degradation, zzso and zzso were examined in zzso isolated from zzso female zzso Animals were zzso for 24 h to zzso liver zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso for 30 zzso or 3 h at 37 degrees C in media containing 10 zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso percent zzso with increasing zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Under these conditions zzso is the primary zzso for cellular zzso and its major fate is zzso zzso binding was determined after zzso h of incubation at 4 degrees C with zzso insulin and increasing zzso of zzso zzso With increasing zzso zzso a zzso decline in zzso insulin zzso binding was zzso zzso decreased by 35 percent and 44 percent after 30 zzso and 3 h of zzso with 2 zzso zzso zzso This decrease was due to a reduction in insulin zzso zzso zzso insulin processing was evaluated in cells zzso at 4 degrees C with zzso zzso at an insulin concentration of 100 zzso and zzso at 37 degrees C for up to 30 zzso The amount of zzso insulin was decreased by zzso of zzso with zzso This decrease was zzso to the reduction in zzso insulin zzso density at zzso zzso of zzso zzso but was zzso greater at higher fatty acid zzso zzso insulin degradation decreased at zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso At 2 zzso however, insulin degradation was zzso This enhancement was observed after 30 zzso or 3 h of exposure to the fatty zzso zzso and/or release of zzso zzso insulin was not influenced by the zzso zzso The effects of zzso on zzso insulin binding and processing were contingent upon cellular zzso since no changes were noted when cells were zzso with zzso at 4 degrees C under otherwise similar zzso Thus the in zzso exposure of zzso to zzso influences both zzso and zzso events zzso insulin zzso These effects may account for the altered zzso insulin extraction and sensitivity that accompany abdominal obesity and its progression to zzso
