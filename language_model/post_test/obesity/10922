To investigate whether changes in zzso measures are related to lung function zzso 

A national zzso follow up study in Great zzso 

zzso adults aged zzso y at zzso 

The primary outcome measure was change in forced zzso volume in one second zzso zzso adjusted for age, height and zzso This was related to changes in weight, body mass index, waist zzso hips circumference and waist to hip zzso 

Changes in weight, body mass and waist zzso adjusted for zzso including mean level, were all associated with changes in zzso zzso with all effects stronger in men than women zzso Change in waist to hip ratio was related in men zzso but not in women zzso A 10 zzso weight increase induced an additional fall in zzso of 96 zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in men, and 51 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso In men, the effect increased with average weight and obesity and was more pronounced in middle zzso This phenomenon was not present in women, possibly due to gender differences in weight distribution in later adult zzso Smoking did not appear to influence the magnitude of effect in either zzso The zzso effect of weight gain on zzso in subjects that stopped smoking between studies appeared small in comparison to the benefit of smoking zzso 

zzso in adult body mass are zzso of zzso decline, especially among older and heavier men, where weight reduction may significantly slow lung function zzso
