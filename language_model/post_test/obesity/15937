To assess the relationship between insulin resistance and body mass index zzso zzso score associated with dietary modification that focuses on limiting zzso zzso consumption in overweight zzso 

A retrospective cohort study conducted between July 1, 2004, and April 28, zzso 

zzso primary care practices treating zzso 

zzso children zzso zzso zzso zzso at or above the 95th zzso of zzso for age and zzso zzso Children and parents were instructed by a zzso regarding caloric reduction and modification of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso resistance at baseline was calculated from zzso insulin and zzso levels zzso zzso model assessment zzso and change in zzso zzso score from baseline to zzso zzso 

Change in zzso zzso score in response to a decrease in zzso beverages correlated zzso product moment correlation zzso zzso zzso P zzso with baseline insulin zzso Those with a decrease in or an unchanged zzso zzso score had significantly greater insulin resistance than those whose zzso zzso score increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso Linear zzso confirmed that zzso was a significant predictor of change in zzso zzso score when controlling for age, race, and zzso 

Among overweight children in primary care practices, a significant relationship was found between insulin resistance and the change in zzso zzso score associated with a zzso intervention that includes a focus on decreasing zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin resistance may inform dietary recommendations for overweight zzso
