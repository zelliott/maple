Changes in the biological efficacy of zzso were evaluated in zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice at weaning and after consuming a high-fat zzso diet for 4 and 8 zzso There was no evidence of zzso resistance in either strain at the start of the study, but after 4 and 8 zzso on the zzso diet, zzso mice became unresponsive to zzso zzso zzso mice responded to zzso zzso at these time points but developed peripheral resistance to sympathetic stimulation of zzso white zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was fully effective in zzso mice, zzso the complete profile of responses observed in zzso zzso zzso mice were also partially responsive to zzso zzso at both time points, increasing zzso protein 1 zzso expression in brown zzso tissue and decreasing zzso zzso in white zzso zzso The findings indicate that retention of zzso responsiveness is an important component of the ability of zzso mice to mount a robust zzso zzso response and resist zzso zzso
