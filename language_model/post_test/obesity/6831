zzso and species level analysis is the best way to characterize zzso in the human gut zzso that are associated with zzso because the zzso of obese and lean zzso increases with the zzso depth of the zzso zzso zzso members have been associated with a lean status, whereas different zzso species are associated both with a lean and an obese zzso 

We analyzed the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso five other zzso species previously linked with lean or obese zzso zzso coli and zzso zzso in 263 individuals, including zzso obese, 38 overweight, 76 lean and 15 zzso subjects to test for the correlation between bacterial concentration and body mass index zzso Of these subjects, 137 were used in our previous zzso 

zzso were found zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso coli in zzso zzso species between 17 and zzso and zzso zzso in zzso of zzso The zzso concentration of zzso zzso was positively correlated with zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso in agreement with what was reported for zzso zzso As reported, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso were zzso associated with the zzso zzso zzso coli was found here for the first time to zzso correlate with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso 

Our findings confirm the specificity of the obese zzso and emphasize the correlation between the concentration of certain zzso species and zzso
