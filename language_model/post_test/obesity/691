zzso exercise training has been shown to produce beneficial changes in zzso tolerance and insulin sensitivity in obese individuals if performed at high enough zzso and/or zzso We examined the effects of a moderate intensity, short-term exercise training protocol on zzso tolerance in obese males with zzso zzso 

Fourteen zzso obese, sedentary males with normal zzso tolerance zzso zzso zzso 7) and abnormal zzso tolerance zzso zzso zzso 7) completed 40 zzso of exercise bouts for 10 consecutive days at approximately zzso of zzso maximum heart zzso zzso zzso and insulin levels, and zzso tolerance and insulin response to zzso were measured before and after the training zzso 

Participants did not experience significant mass loss during the 10-day zzso zzso in the zzso group experienced significant zzso zzso improvement in zzso tolerance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 120 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 120 zzso and zzso insulin levels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a result of zzso zzso zzso zzso reductions in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a decrease in zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso were observed in the zzso group following the training zzso 

The data suggest that moderate, short-term exercise without zzso mass loss is effective in improving zzso tolerance and insulin response to a zzso load in obese males with abnormal zzso zzso
