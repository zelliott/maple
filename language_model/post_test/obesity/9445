This study aims to evaluate the outcome and safety of the deep inferior zzso zzso zzso zzso for breast reconstruction in a group of Southeast Asian women treated in our unit and to identify risk factors for breast reconstruction using the zzso zzso in this zzso 

This is a prospective study on 50 consecutive zzso zzso breast reconstructions by a single surgeon in an academic institution between July 1999 and July zzso Data on patient zzso diagnosis, procedure type, zzso and zzso treatments, risk factors and complications were zzso collected and registered in a clinical zzso zzso variables include total zzso loss, partial zzso loss, fat necrosis and minor complications related to the donor site or zzso Known risk factors are zzso to determine if they affect outcome in terms of complication rate in this group of zzso 

Total zzso loss, partial zzso loss and fat necrosis complication rates were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso complication rates were comparable to those quoted by previous studies done zzso zzso zzso is a statistically significant factor associated with development of zzso zzso complications in our zzso 

Breast reconstruction with zzso zzso is a safe and reliable method when used in Southeast Asian women, offering optimal results with less donor zzso zzso zzso increases the zzso of zzso complication in this group of zzso
