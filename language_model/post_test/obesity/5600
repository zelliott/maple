The association between obesity and type 2 diabetes has been found to be consistent across different ethnic zzso Our aim was to study the contribution of obesity to the development of type 2 diabetes in a non-obese Chinese population with a high prevalence of diabetes zzso in zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso subjects were recruited from the Hong Kong zzso zzso Factor zzso Study zzso This was a community-based population study which involved the use of a 75 g oral zzso tolerance test and 1985 World Health Organization diagnostic zzso Their zzso status was zzso at 2 zzso 

In subjects with impaired zzso tolerance zzso the annual progression rate to diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso that in control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso OR per unit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 2 h plasma zzso zzso per unit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly associated with zzso status at 2 y in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with high baseline waist circumference or zzso zzso or zzso were more likely to have worsening of zzso tolerance at 2 y than those with low waist circumference zzso conversion to diabetes, OR zzso zzso or zzso zzso conversion to diabetes, OR zzso zzso 

zzso zzso readily assessed by the measurement of zzso or waist zzso was for the first time shown zzso to be independently associated with the deterioration of zzso tolerance in a Chinese zzso
