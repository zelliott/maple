We examined the effects of caffeine zzso on insulin and zzso zzso in obese men before and after a nutrition and exercise zzso 

Nine zzso obese zzso mass index (in zzso zzso zzso zzso men who had refrained from exercise and caffeine zzso for 48 h underwent 2 zzso tests zzso The subjects randomly received caffeine (5 zzso or zzso 1 h before each zzso After a zzso nutrition and exercise intervention, during which time the subjects avoided dietary caffeine, the zzso were zzso

A nutrition and exercise intervention improved, whereas caffeine zzso impaired, zzso zzso in obese zzso The results are consistent with previous findings that caffeine zzso contributes to insulin zzso
