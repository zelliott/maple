Blood pressure zzso is higher in men than in women at similar ages through adult zzso Interestingly, a similar pattern is detected in left zzso mass zzso classically attributed to differences in body zzso However, the existing difference in zzso between sexes might be relevant in determining zzso and it has been not fully zzso zzso we set out to determine the impact of zzso levels of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso 

We conducted zzso study including 283 young students zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined twice using standard mercury zzso in 2 zzso zzso was determined with zzso zzso To dissect the relative contribution of zzso volume load, and body size to the sex-related difference in zzso an analysis of zzso was zzso 

Mean zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso higher and zzso was zzso zzso zzso g larger in men than in women, respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso was adjusted to mean zzso the sex difference was reduced by zzso When zzso was adjusted to body size and zzso load, this difference was reduced by zzso 

We report in a sample of young zzso students a difference in zzso between women and men that is partially explained zzso by sex differences in zzso supporting an early effect of zzso on cardiac mass even in the absence of zzso A more relevant effect could be expected as the population zzso
