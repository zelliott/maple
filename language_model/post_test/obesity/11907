To evaluate the relationships of zzso levels at age 16 years in obese zzso to zzso syndrome and its components at age 23 zzso 

zzso prospective study of zzso zzso 

In 144 white and 129 black non-obese 16-year old girls zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso median zzso levels zzso 12 zzso black zzso was used to identify paradoxically high zzso levels in obese zzso Of 34 white and 74 black obese girls, 12 zzso and 19 zzso had paradoxically high zzso zzso In these 108 obese girls, zzso levels at age 16 years independently predicted zzso zzso cholesterol zzso and waist zzso insulin zzso and zzso zzso at age 23 years; paradoxically high zzso levels at age 16 years was a negative independent predictor for zzso zzso model zzso resistance, and for the number of abnormal components of the zzso syndrome at age 23 zzso In 31 pairs of obese girls with and without paradoxically high zzso levels, matched by race and age 16 body mass index, zzso levels at age 16 years was a negative predictor for the number of abnormal zzso syndrome components at age 23 zzso 

zzso high zzso levels in obese 16 year old girls protects against zzso syndrome and its components at age 23 zzso
