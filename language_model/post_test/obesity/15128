zzso associated with obesity may play a role in zzso zzso but the underlying mechanism remains zzso This study investigated whether the zzso pathway, an zzso signaling cascade that plays a critical role in zzso zzso is activated by zzso zzso of the inflammatory zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso Animal studies were conducted on zzso mice, and obesity was induced by utilizing a high-fat diet zzso zzso An zzso zzso was performed, and results were confirmed with real-time zzso chain zzso The array revealed that zzso obesity increased the expression of zzso in the colon by zzso zzso and that of zzso by zzso zzso The concentration of zzso zzso zzso determined by ex zzso culture zzso was nearly doubled in the obese animals zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso 3 beta zzso an important zzso inhibitor of zzso signaling and a potential target of zzso was zzso by zzso The zzso zzso form of zzso was elevated in the zzso zzso of obese mice zzso Moreover, zzso the key zzso of zzso zzso zzso was elevated in the zzso of obese mice zzso as was the expression of a downstream target zzso zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso obesity produces an zzso in zzso zzso and zzso a number of zzso of key components within the zzso signaling zzso that are zzso in zzso Thus, these observations offer evidence for a biologically plausible zzso the zzso pathway, by which obesity increases the risk of zzso zzso
