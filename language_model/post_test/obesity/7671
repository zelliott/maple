Type 2 diabetes is an important risk factor for heart failure and is common among patients with heart zzso The impact of weight on prognosis after hospitalization for acute heart failure among patients with diabetes is zzso The objective of this study was to examine zzso mortality in relation to weight status among patients with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for zzso heart zzso 

The Worcester Heart Failure Study included adults admitted with acute heart failure to all metropolitan Worcester medical centers in 1995 and zzso The weight status of zzso patients with diabetes zzso of type 2 diabetes in medical record or admission serum zzso zzso zzso was zzso using body mass index calculated from height and weight at zzso Survival status was zzso at 1 and 5 years after hospital zzso 

zzso percent of patients were overweight or obese and zzso were zzso zzso patients had 50% higher odds of zzso mortality within 5 years of hospitalization for acute heart failure than normal weight zzso Class I and II obesity were associated with zzso and zzso lower odds of zzso zzso and Class III obesity were not associated with zzso zzso were similar for mortality within 1 year of hospitalization for acute heart zzso 

The mechanisms underlying the association between weight status and mortality are not fully zzso Additional research is needed to explore the effects of body zzso recent weight changes, and prognosis after hospitalization for heart failure among patients with zzso
