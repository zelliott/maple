zzso is associated with tissue zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso factor 1 alpha zzso Prior studies in transgenic mice have shown that zzso plays a role in the zzso dysfunction associated with zzso zzso we hypothesized that, after the development of zzso obesity zzso zzso function could be improved by administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice were treated with zzso zzso or with control zzso for 8 weeks and compared with an zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso markedly suppressed zzso gene expression in zzso tissue and the zzso zzso zzso administration induced weight zzso Final body weight was zzso zzso zzso g in the zzso zzso group vs zzso zzso zzso g in the control zzso group and zzso zzso zzso g in zzso mice zzso zzso zzso increased energy expenditure zzso zzso zzso vs 12 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, zzso and decreased the respiratory exchange ratio zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, zzso which suggested switching metabolism to fat zzso In contrast, zzso zzso had no effect on food intake or zzso zzso zzso treatment decreased zzso blood zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs 239 zzso zzso zzso in the control zzso group and 222 zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice, zzso plasma insulin, zzso zzso zzso and liver fat zzso These findings demonstrate that the zzso consequences of zzso are attenuated by zzso zzso zzso
