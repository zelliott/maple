To determine whether body mass index zzso is independently associated with cognitive function in zzso women and the relationship between body fat distribution as estimated by zzso ratio zzso 

zzso data zzso 

zzso data from the Women's Health Initiative zzso hormone zzso 

Eight thousand seven hundred zzso zzso women aged 65 to 79 free of clinical evidence of zzso who completed the baseline evaluation in the zzso hormone zzso 

Participants completed a zzso zzso State zzso zzso health and lifestyle zzso and standardized zzso of zzso weight, body zzso and blood zzso zzso analysis was performed of associations between zzso score, zzso and zzso after controlling for known zzso 

With the exception of smoking and exercise, vascular disease risk factors, including hypertension, waist zzso heart disease, and diabetes zzso were significantly associated with zzso score and were included as zzso in subsequent zzso zzso was zzso related to zzso zzso for every zzso increase in zzso zzso score decreased zzso points zzso after adjusting for age, education, and vascular disease risk zzso zzso had the most pronounced association with poorer cognitive functioning scores in women with smaller waist zzso In women with the highest zzso cognitive scores increased with zzso 

Higher zzso was associated with poorer cognitive function in women with smaller zzso Higher zzso zzso central fat mass, was associated with higher cognitive function in this zzso zzso Further research is needed to clarify the mechanism for this zzso
