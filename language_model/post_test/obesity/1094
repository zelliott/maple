In order to study the effects of diet on fat distribution, circulating zzso levels and zzso zzso zzso diets of different zzso composition were fed to lean mice and gold zzso zzso A high-fat diet and 2 zzso zzso one containing mostly zzso starch and the other containing zzso starch were fed ad zzso for 10 weeks and were compared to standard laboratory zzso Weight gain was attenuated by feeding zzso starch in all mice and by feeding a high-fat diet in lean zzso zzso zzso was seen in lean mice fed zzso zzso whereas increased zzso was seen in both lean and obese mice fed on the high-fat zzso zzso zzso levels, when corrected for zzso were decreased in all mice fed either the high-fat diet or the zzso zzso In zzso fat zzso decreased zzso zzso expression was seen after both high-fat and zzso starch zzso These results show that diet zzso composition contributes to the zzso of circulating zzso levels by the combined effects of diet on fat distribution and on zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso
