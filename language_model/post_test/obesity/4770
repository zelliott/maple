zzso poisoning is seen in the form of isolated episodes, or intentional zzso and zzso Despite its efficient treatment, methanol poisoning has high morbidity and mortality zzso So far, several studies have been performed to identify the zzso factors in methanol zzso Recently, during the treatment of patients with methanol poisoning, we observed that patients' blood zzso levels were high on presentation to the hospital, particularly in those who zzso Through a literature search, we found that no studies have been performed on blood zzso levels or zzso in methanol zzso zzso the present retrospective study was done as a preliminary investigation to understand whether there was a meaningful relationship between methanol poisoning and blood zzso level on zzso and also if zzso could be considered as a zzso factor for zzso In this retrospective study, a review of the hospital charts was performed for all patients who were treated for methanol poisoning from March 2003 to March 2010 in two hospitals in Tehran, zzso Those with definitive diagnosis of methanol poisoning, no history of diabetes zzso and normal or low body mass index zzso were zzso zzso demographic information, clinical manifestations, time elapsed between zzso and zzso blood zzso level on presentation zzso zzso results of zzso blood gas analysis, and the clinical outcome were zzso zzso analysis was done using zzso software zzso 17, Chicago, Illinois, zzso and application of zzso U test, zzso zzso test, zzso correlation zzso zzso receiver operating characteristic zzso curve, and zzso zzso P values less than zzso were considered as the statistically significant zzso zzso patients with methanol poisoning met the inclusion criteria and were included in the zzso Of these, 91 zzso were male and 4 zzso were zzso Mean age was zzso years zzso 13 to zzso Among the 95 patients, 68 survived zzso and 27 expired zzso Median blood zzso level was 144 zzso zzso 75 to zzso There was no significant statistical correlation between blood zzso level and time of treatment, age, zzso or serum zzso zzso but blood zzso level had a statistically significant correlation with pH zzso zzso and base deficit zzso zzso The mean blood zzso level was zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso patients, respectively zzso Considering the zzso level of 140 zzso for blood zzso and using zzso zzso analysis, and adjusting according to the admission data with significant statistical difference in the two study groups, the odds ratio for zzso as a risk factor for death was zzso zzso confidence zzso Our study showed that blood zzso levels were high in methanol poisoning and even higher in those who died in comparison with the zzso zzso zzso might be a new zzso factor in methanol poisoning, but further studies are needed to determine whether controlling zzso has therapeutic zzso
