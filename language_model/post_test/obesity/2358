The zzso zzso zzso trial showed that zzso produced greater mean weight loss than zzso but increased cardiovascular morbidity but not zzso The relationship between 12-month weight loss and subsequent cardiovascular outcomes is zzso 

zzso subjects (N zzso 10 zzso zzso years with cardiovascular disease and/or type 2 diabetes zzso received zzso plus weight management during a zzso zzso Period before zzso to continue zzso (N zzso zzso or to receive zzso (N zzso zzso The primary zzso was the time from zzso to first occurrence of a primary outcome event zzso zzso zzso zzso stroke, zzso cardiac arrest or cardiovascular zzso 

For the total population, mean weight change during zzso Period zzso was zzso zzso zzso mean total weight change to Month 12 was zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Degree of weight loss during zzso Period or through Month 12 was associated with a progressive reduction in risk for the total population in primary outcome events and cardiovascular mortality over the zzso zzso Although more events occurred in the zzso zzso group, on an average, a modest weight loss of approximately 3 zzso achieved in the zzso Period appeared to offset this increased event zzso zzso weight loss zzso zzso reduced cardiovascular deaths in those with zzso moderate or mild cardiovascular zzso 

zzso weight loss over short-term (6 weeks) and longer-term zzso zzso periods is associated with reduction in subsequent cardiovascular mortality for the following 4-5 years even in those with pre-existing cardiovascular zzso While the zzso group experienced more primary outcome events than the zzso group, greater weight loss reduced overall risk of these occurring in both zzso
