zzso is characterized by an excessive development of fat mass which is a consequence of increased fat cell size and/or fat cell zzso Several hormones and zzso are regulators of zzso tissue development and zzso Among them, catecholamines play a major role by acting through alpha zzso and zzso zzso zzso of alpha zzso receptors induce zzso of zzso in mature zzso as well as zzso zzso The zzso effect zzso by alpha zzso receptors is in part responsible for the weak zzso zzso of some fat deposits in humans zzso fat in zzso Changes in zzso and alpha zzso receptors ratio and function have been proposed to explain the zzso disturbances described in some obese zzso Human and zzso zzso differ considerably with respect to the balance between zzso and alpha zzso zzso Human zzso express mainly alpha zzso but very few beta zzso receptors while the reverse is true for zzso zzso Since no suitable animal model was available to study the contribution of alpha zzso balance in zzso in zzso we combined gene targeting and transgenic approaches to create a mice with increased alpha zzso ratio in zzso zzso Specifically, we have generated transgenic mice strains on a beta zzso zzso zzso background which express human alpha zzso zzso No particular zzso was observed in mice maintained in normal diet whereas when fed a high fat diet, transgenic mice increased significantly body weight and fat zzso These results underline the zzso relevance of the interaction of the presence of alpha zzso receptors with a high fat diet in the control of zzso tissue zzso
