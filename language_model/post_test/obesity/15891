To compare zzso zzso and serum zzso growth factor zzso concentration in cats with and without zzso zzso zzso and assess the hypothesis that cats with zzso have larger body size and skeletal features and higher serum IGF-1 zzso than healthy zzso 

25 cats with zzso and 22 healthy control zzso 

Physical examination and zzso were performed to zzso cats into the zzso and control zzso Data collected from each cat included diet history, body weight, body condition score, lengths of the zzso and 4th and 12th zzso zzso heart size, head length and zzso and abdominal zzso Comparisons of these variables were made between zzso 

Body condition score in zzso and control cats did not differ zzso However, median head zzso lengths of the head, 4th and 12th zzso zzso and zzso and body weight in the zzso group were significantly greater than values in the control zzso Median serum concentration of IGF-1 was not significantly different between zzso 

These data suggested that among the study zzso those with zzso were zzso larger, but not more obese, than healthy zzso Whether this was attributable to differences in early growth or other causes requires additional zzso
