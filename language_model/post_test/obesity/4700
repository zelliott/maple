zzso inflammation is an underlying factor linking obesity with insulin zzso zzso obesity promotes an increase in circulating levels of inflammatory zzso and their zzso into expanding zzso zzso Nevertheless, the zzso pathways that trigger and sustain chronic zzso inflammation in obesity are incompletely zzso In this study, we report that a high-fat diet selectively increases the circulating levels of zzso zzso in zzso mice that express zzso zzso zzso zzso and that this increase is abolished in zzso zzso The zzso of classically activated zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso and the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso was largely blunted in zzso tissue of obese zzso mice, whereas the ratio of alternatively activated zzso zzso to zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso mice were protected from systemic zzso and insulin intolerance and this was associated with a decrease in inflammation in zzso tissue and liver and a decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso prevented high zzso loss of insulin signaling in liver and skeletal zzso These observations zzso a novel role of zzso zzso zzso in promoting zzso trafficking to zzso tissue and promoting chronic inflammation in obesity and could lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets for treating insulin resistance in zzso
