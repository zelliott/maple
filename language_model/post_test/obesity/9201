Fish oil is known to improve zzso zzso These effects occur partly via zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso fatty acids included abundantly in fish zzso We investigated fish oil functions on zzso and zzso metabolism that are both dependent on and independent of zzso zzso 

Mice were fed a diet containing 30 zzso beef zzso (B zzso for twelve weeks to induce zzso The mice were then divided into two groups which were fed either a B diet or a diet containing 30 zzso fish oil zzso zzso Each group was further divided into two groups which were administered zzso and zzso zzso or vehicle once a day for three zzso 

The F diet groups showed lower zzso levels in plasma and liver than the B diet groups, but zzso zzso did not affect the zzso levels in either diet zzso The F diet groups also showed improvement of zzso tolerance compared with the B diet zzso However, zzso zzso made zzso tolerance worse in the F diet group but improved it in the B diet zzso zzso by the administration of antagonists, zzso tolerance was zzso regulated between the B and F zzso and zzso action in the plasma and liver of the F diet group was not zzso 

These results suggest that fish oil decreases zzso levels in plasma and liver via zzso zzso zzso and that zzso tolerance is zzso regulated by zzso zzso under diets containing different zzso
