Human obesity is associated with zzso resistance, elevated zzso levels in the zzso and increased risk of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our studies suggest that elevated zzso levels may directly promote zzso zzso in zzso We found that zzso zzso mice had prolonged times to zzso after zzso injury with zzso zzso and that zzso administered zzso corrected their zzso in a zzso zzso These effects appear to result from a zzso zzso effect of zzso on zzso because zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and human zzso but it had no effect on zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso mice had an attenuated zzso response to zzso zzso injury zzso from that of the zzso zzso which was unaffected by zzso zzso Our results raise the possibility that elevated plasma levels of zzso may contribute to the risk of zzso complications in human zzso
