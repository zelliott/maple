zzso has been shown to impair zzso wound healing, which is associated with increased wound zzso Exercise is known to decrease zzso inflammation and has been shown to speed zzso wound healing in aged zzso zzso we investigated whether treadmill exercise could speed zzso wound healing in obese, high-fat zzso zzso 

We fed female zzso mice a high-fat diet zzso calories from zzso for 16 zzso to induce a state of obesity and insulin zzso Mice then ran on a treadmill for 3 d before zzso zzso On day 4, mice were wounded 1 h after zzso Mice then exercised for 5 d after zzso and healing was assessed by zzso for 10 zzso 

As described zzso obesity impaired wound healing, with significantly larger wound sizes measured from days 3 to day 10 after wounding zzso zzso Exercise did not improve healing in lean mice fed a normal zzso zzso However, wound size was significantly smaller in exercised obese mice compared with their lean counterparts zzso zzso at day 1, day 4, and day 5 after zzso Surprisingly, we were unable to detect any differences in gene or protein expression of zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso or the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso Likewise, there were no differences in gene expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or of growth factor zzso growth factor in wounds of exercise and sedentary zzso 

This suggests an effect of exercise independent of zzso in zzso Future work should focus on early events after zzso including exercise effects on zzso and zzso zzso
