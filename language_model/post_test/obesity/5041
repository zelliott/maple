It is unclear whether the coronary heart disease zzso mortality risk associated with obesity is zzso only through traditional zzso risk zzso This analysis evaluated the independent zzso mortality risk due to obesity and determined its population attributable risk zzso 

Using the zzso I zzso zzso Study zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso mass index zzso variable was zzso The hazard ratios zzso for fatal zzso in the zzso categories zzso for age, sex, race, exercise, education level, smoking, hypertension, cholesterol, and alcohol zzso were determined and the zzso subsequently zzso 

Compared to lean zzso the zzso zzso zzso for fatal zzso is zzso zzso zzso in overweight zzso zzso zzso zzso in obese zzso zzso zzso zzso in lean zzso zzso zzso zzso in overweight zzso and zzso zzso zzso in obese zzso The zzso is zzso zzso zzso in overweight zzso zzso zzso zzso in obese zzso zzso zzso zzso in lean zzso zzso zzso zzso in overweight zzso and zzso zzso zzso in obese zzso 

zzso is an independent risk factor for zzso mortality even after controlling for traditional zzso risk zzso The zzso for zzso death in obese zzso is zzso zzso should be aggressively treated in those without traditional zzso risk zzso
