zzso cloning using zzso cells has been accomplished successfully in several species, and its potential zzso clinical and therapeutic applications are being pursued on many zzso zzso the long-term effects of cloning on offspring is crucial for consideration of future application of the zzso Although zzso development of animals cloned from adult zzso cells has been reported, problems in the resulting progeny indicate that the cloning procedure may not produce animals that are zzso identical to their cell zzso We used a mouse model to take advantage of its short generation time and zzso Here we report that the increased body weight of cloned zzso female mice reflects an increase of body fat in addition to a larger body size, and that these mice share many characteristics consistent with zzso We also show that the obese zzso is not transmitted to offspring generated by mating male and female cloned zzso
