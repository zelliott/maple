zzso neighborhood environment attributes related to childhood obesity can inform environmental changes for obesity zzso 

To evaluate child and parent weight status across neighborhoods in King County zzso metropolitan zzso and San Diego County differing in zzso physical activity environment zzso and nutrition environment zzso zzso 

Neighborhoods were selected to represent high zzso versus low zzso on the two measures, forming four neighborhood types zzso on both measures, low zzso NE, high zzso NE, and high on both zzso Weight and height of children aged zzso years and one parent zzso from selected neighborhoods were assessed in zzso zzso in child and parent overweight and obesity by neighborhood type were zzso adjusting for zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Children from neighborhoods high on both environment measures were less likely to be obese zzso vs zzso zzso zzso and marginally less likely to be overweight zzso vs zzso zzso zzso than children from neighborhoods low on both zzso In models adjusted for parent weight status and demographic factors, neighborhood environment type remained related to child obesity zzso vs low on both measures, zzso zzso Parents in neighborhoods high on both measures zzso low on zzso were marginally less likely to be obese zzso vs zzso zzso zzso although parent overweight did not differ by neighborhood zzso The lower odds of parent obesity in neighborhoods with environments supportive of physical activity and healthy eating remained in models adjusted for demographics zzso vs low on the environment measures, zzso zzso 

zzso support the proposed zzso definitions of zzso neighborhoods for children and parents that consider both physical activity and nutrition environment zzso
