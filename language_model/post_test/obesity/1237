To determine whether the mechanisms by which zzso zzso carried by zzso induce the loss of body fat can affect zzso zzso rats, since they are zzso and could not eliminate excess energy through zzso two aspects essential for the zzso effect of zzso in normal zzso 

The rats were infused for 28 d zzso zzso with zzso in zzso zzso at a dose of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and obese zzso zzso zzso 

Body weight zzso zzso consumption, body composition zzso zzso zzso nitrogen balance, plasma zzso 

Treatment resulted in loss of body zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso O, mainly due to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso O and water, preventing further increases in body weight and fat zzso zzso rats increased their body zzso zzso (24 zzso zzso zzso (101 zzso O and zzso stores: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso O, making the differences more zzso On day 28, zzso levels were maintained in all zzso in zzso zzso increased and total cholesterol zzso O showed no changes in plasma zzso In all rats, food intake decreased with treatment, and heat production zzso zzso was unchanged zzso or slightly decreased zzso Energy expenditure per unit of zzso mass remained zzso zzso balance was maintained in all zzso zzso was achieved without loss of body zzso 

Treatment of genetically obese rats with zzso in zzso zzso results in sustained loss of body zzso zzso sparing zzso up to 28 zzso essentially preventing further increase in body weight and zzso of zzso and zzso This is achieved through lower food intake and relatively small changes (if zzso in energy zzso
