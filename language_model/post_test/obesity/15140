Increased zzso of the zzso system zzso has been related to cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes zzso Most zzso clinical trials have demonstrated that zzso blockade reduces the zzso of type 2 diabetes, which has been explained by improved insulin zzso and insulin zzso In this review, an overview of the mechanisms that may zzso the association between the zzso and type 2 diabetes will be zzso with focus on skeletal muscle and zzso tissue zzso This will include discussion of several human studies performed in our laboratory to investigate the zzso and zzso effects of the zzso combining in zzso zzso of zzso and tissue metabolism with molecular and zzso zzso Available data suggest that the zzso effects of the zzso on insulin zzso are zzso by a reduction in pancreatic blood flow and induction of zzso fibrosis, zzso stress as well as zzso whereas both impaired skeletal muscle function and zzso tissue dysfunction may zzso zzso insulin zzso Thus, although future studies in humans are warranted, current evidence supports that targeting the zzso in intervention studies may improve zzso and cardiovascular function in conditions of insulin resistance like obesity and type 2 zzso
