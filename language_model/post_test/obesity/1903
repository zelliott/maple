The relationship of zzso between young offspring and their parents was examined to evaluate its usefulness in predicting zzso disorders among parents and zzso 

Young offspring ages zzso years and their parents were studied in a community-based sample of 477 zzso The zzso were defined zzso zzso isolated high zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso isolated high zzso zzso and/or low zzso zzso cholesterol zzso and zzso combined, involving both zzso 

Children of parents with a given zzso type had the highest frequency of the same disorder zzso zzso to P zzso In zzso analyses only the corresponding disorders in their parents were selected into the models as significant zzso after controlling parental zzso In terms of sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso and zzso of offspring could be correctly predicted for isolated zzso isolated zzso combined, and any type of disorder, respectively, by the corresponding disorders in both zzso Likewise, the predictability of parent's zzso from their children's disorder was also zzso 

The zzso zzso have familial basis to provide rationale for parents or children to determine their own risk zzso however, sensitivity and positive zzso values are not high enough to be useful as a selective screening zzso
