Childhood obesity is a widespread and growing problem in the zzso Body mass index zzso and zzso criterion have been used to determine childhood zzso No data was available to evaluate cardiovascular risk factors in overweight and obese Chinese children screened by zzso index and Chinese newly developed zzso zzso 

To evaluate cardiovascular risk factors in overweight and obese Chinese children by using Chinese zzso and zzso index as screening zzso 

A total of 215 children aged zzso years were recruited from 3 primary schools in zzso zzso zzso zzso included body weight, zzso waist and hip zzso zzso serum zzso insulin, total zzso zzso total cholesterol zzso high density zzso cholesterol zzso low density zzso cholesterol zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso Chinese zzso and zzso height criterion were used to zzso overweight and zzso 

According to Chinese zzso zzso 65 from 108 obese children originally identified by zzso were reclassified as obese and other 41 children were classified as zzso Compared with non-obese children, obese children screened by Chinese zzso and zzso index had increased levels of zzso zzso zzso B, zzso decreased levels of zzso zzso zzso and significantly higher prevalence of zzso and high zzso Children identified as overweight by Chinese zzso criterion had also shown high zzso zzso zzso B, insulin levels, low zzso zzso A levels, and significantly higher prevalence of zzso than the normal weight zzso 

Our study reveals that overweight and/or obesity screened by both Chinese new zzso and zzso criterion are associated with increased levels of cardiovascular risk factors zzso elevated serum zzso LDL, zzso B, and reduced zzso zzso A zzso Using Chinese zzso criterion may underestimate the prevalence of childhood obesity but it could be adopted as a unique tool for screening children's overweight in zzso screening zzso
