zzso sex hormones can be measured in plasma and zzso We determined the extent to which these two methods provide different information on hormonal status by relating them to zzso profile in zzso zzso 

Thirty healthy zzso women collected one zzso urine sample and a blood sample was zzso zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso and serum lipids were zzso Sex hormone levels were measured with specific zzso Linear zzso analysis was used to determine associations between zzso levels and zzso zzso are presented as zzso in zzso per standard zzso zzso of zzso zzso levels, adjusted for body mass index zzso and smoking zzso confidence zzso A zzso analysis for obese zzso or zzso zzso versus lean women was zzso 

Mean levels of zzso sex hormones were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso h zzso zzso showed significant associations with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not with total and zzso zzso zzso was zzso associated with total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso and zzso All associations appeared to be stronger in lean zzso 

Both plasma and zzso levels appear to be associated to serum lipids in healthy zzso zzso However, this relation appears to be different for zzso levels in plasma and zzso Depending on the research question, either blood samples or urine samples may be zzso
