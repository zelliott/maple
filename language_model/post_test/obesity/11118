In the USA, Puerto Rican children have a higher prevalence of asthma than other Latino zzso and zzso is one of hypothesized reasons for this zzso We examined associations between zzso characteristics and serum zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and body mass index zzso and further, among zzso zzso levels, zzso zzso and allergic zzso in 2-year-old zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were measured in serum from Puerto Rican toddlers zzso zzso zzso born in New York City with a maternal history of zzso and/or zzso zzso and home characteristics questionnaires were administered to the mother, zzso and two years zzso Children's weight and height were measured to determine zzso zzso 

More girls zzso had zzso levels above the median compared with boys zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was positively correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Children in zzso were more likely to be obese zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso birthplace was significantly associated with children's zzso but not with zzso zzso levels were lower for children whose mothers were born on the US mainland zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with those whose mothers were born in Puerto Rico or another country zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Mothers born in another country were more likely than those born in the US mainland or Puerto Rico to have obese children zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not associated with zzso to any of the measured zzso zzso or total zzso 

Even at a very young age, some zzso factors were associated with zzso and zzso measures of obesity among this Puerto Rican pediatric zzso To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the association of mother's birth place with child zzso and zzso as early as 24 zzso
