zzso demand for zzso zzso has encouraged the use of obese donors despite the absence of long-term outcome data and evidence that obesity can adversely affect zzso zzso We wished to determine whether obesity increased the risk for zzso dysfunction and other medical zzso in donors several years after zzso 

zzso patients who donated a kidney 5 to 40 years previously were zzso according to body mass index zzso at donation and evaluated for zzso dysfunction and risk factors for cardiovascular zzso Patients who were from the 2005 through 2006 National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso zzso did not have zzso zzso and were matched for age, zzso race, and zzso served as zzso control zzso 

Renal function in obese zzso or zzso and zzso zzso zzso donors was similar, and both donor groups had reduced zzso function compared with zzso zzso control zzso zzso was associated with more hypertension and zzso in both donors and zzso control zzso however, there were no significant differences between the two groups within each zzso zzso 

These results indicate that obese donors are not at higher risk for long-term reduced zzso function compared with zzso donors and that the increased zzso of hypertension and other cardiovascular disease risk factors in obese donors is due to their obesity and is not further exacerbated by zzso These findings support the current practice of using otherwise healthy overweight and obese donors but emphasize the need for more intensive zzso education and zzso health care maintenance in this donor zzso
