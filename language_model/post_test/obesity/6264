To clarify the role of sodium intake in the regulation of blood pressure in obese subjects, we measured blood pressure in 60 obese and 18 zzso adolescents after successive two-week periods of a zzso diet zzso than 250 zzso of sodium per day) and a zzso diet (less than 30 zzso per zzso When they were changed from a zzso to a zzso diet, the obese group had a significantly larger mean change zzso zzso in mean zzso pressure zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso than did the zzso group zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso P less than zzso The variables that best predicted the degree of sodium sensitivity were the zzso plasma insulin level, the plasma zzso level while the zzso diet was being given, the plasma zzso level while the zzso diet was being given, and the percentage of body weight made up by zzso Fifty-one of the obese adolescents were also studied before and after a zzso weight-loss zzso After the weight-loss program, the 36 subjects who lost more than 1 zzso of body weight had a reduced sensitivity of blood pressure to sodium zzso from value during zzso diet to that during zzso diet, zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso The blood pressure of the remaining 15 adolescents was still sensitive to sodium intake zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso These results support the hypothesis that the blood pressure of obese adolescents is sensitive to dietary sodium intake and that this sensitivity may be due to the combined effects of the zzso zzso and increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system that are characteristic of zzso
