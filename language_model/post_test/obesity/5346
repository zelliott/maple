In patients with zzso syndrome zzso cardiovascular complications determine a mortality rate four times higher than in an zzso and zzso zzso zzso we calculated the global cardiovascular risk in patients with zzso 

We applied the World Health zzso Society of zzso zzso 1999 guidelines for the zzso of cardiovascular risk in 38 females and 11 males with zzso 27 zzso zzso 15 adrenal zzso four adrenal zzso and three zzso zzso zzso The risk of major cardiovascular events was estimated considering the combined effect of several risk factors zzso diabetes, zzso organ damage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and associated zzso Four categories of absolute cardiovascular disease risk were defined zzso zzso high, very zzso 

Eighty per cent of patients presented a zzso or zzso zzso cardiovascular zzso zzso of the patients were zzso with a zzso hypertension zzso zzso per cent of patients were diabetics and zzso were zzso zzso was less frequent zzso zzso zzso was the only cardiovascular risk factor that correlated with a degree of zzso zzso of disease correlated with the presence of obesity zzso zzso and hypertension zzso zzso but not with the presence of diabetes or zzso and seemed to be the only significant predictor of cardiovascular risk zzso zzso zzso 

Patients with active zzso present a remarkably increased cardiovascular zzso Considering that the zzso cure of zzso is often difficult to zzso especially in zzso disease, and that cardiovascular risk could persist even after the zzso control of risk factors should be one of the primary goals of the zzso
