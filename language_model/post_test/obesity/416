The zzso explosion of overweight people has been called an zzso The inflammatory nature of obesity is widely zzso Could it really be an epidemic involving an infectious zzso In this climate of concern over the increasing prevalence of overweight conditions in our society, we focus on the possible role of oral bacteria as a potential direct contributor to zzso To investigate this possibility, we measured zzso bacterial populations of overweight zzso zzso was collected from 313 women with a body mass index between 27 and 32, and bacterial populations were measured by DNA probe zzso zzso in this group were compared with data from a population of 232 healthy individuals from zzso disease zzso The median percentage difference of 7 of the 40 bacterial species measured was greater than zzso in the saliva of overweight zzso zzso tree analysis of zzso zzso composition revealed that zzso of the overweight women could be identified by the presence of a single bacterial species zzso zzso at levels greater than zzso of the total zzso zzso Analysis of these data suggests that the composition of zzso bacteria changes in overweight zzso It seems likely that these bacterial species could serve as biological indicators of a developing overweight zzso Of even greater interest, and the subject of future research, is the possibility that oral bacteria may participate in the pathology that leads to zzso
