The capacity to increase zzso zzso rate in response to an acute oral protein load is known as the zzso functional zzso the loss of such capacity is used as a marker of zzso This zzso response in obese zzso is not yet fully zzso We aimed to study the zzso effects of obesity and hypertension on zzso reserve, taking into account zzso zzso and zzso oxide in the zzso of that zzso Fourteen obese zzso zzso age, zzso zzso zzso zzso and nine lean zzso zzso age, zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Renal zzso and the levels of serum zzso oxide and urinary zzso were assessed at baseline and after a protein load (1 zzso of body zzso An increase in the following parameters was observed when comparing obese and lean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso and urinary zzso and zzso oxide levels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso reserve was lower in obese zzso when compared with that of lean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso After a protein load, contrasting with the lean group, inability to elevate the zzso oxide serum levels and a lower increase in urinary zzso were observed in the obese zzso These data suggest that obese zzso lose zzso reserve earlier in the evolution to zzso zzso This may be due to the defective zzso of zzso zzso mechanisms by zzso zzso and zzso oxide zzso
