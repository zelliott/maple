zzso is a risk factor for the zzso of hypertension, but it is still unclear whether this risk can be better estimated by body mass index zzso or waist circumference zzso 

In the baseline evaluation of a zzso zzso zzso adults answered a zzso questionnaire and had their baseline blood pressure zzso and zzso zzso assessed according to standardized zzso Excluding the individuals with hypertension at zzso and those deceased or lost during the zzso zzso individuals zzso of those zzso were visited zzso zzso was defined as zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso for men and zzso zzso for zzso zzso cases of hypertension were characterized by zzso zzso zzso or use of zzso medication in the follow-up zzso 

After a mean follow-up of zzso zzso zzso years, zzso incident cases of hypertension were zzso The hazard ratios zzso zzso adjusted for age and baseline zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso higher than 30 zzso were zzso zzso P zzso in men and zzso zzso P zzso in zzso The corresponding figures were zzso zzso P zzso for men with zzso and zzso zzso P zzso for women with zzso zzso 

We conclude that the risk for hypertension may be better identified by obesity defined by higher zzso than higher zzso
