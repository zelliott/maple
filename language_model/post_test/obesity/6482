zzso present a novel method of scanning for zzso fat volume by zzso zzso zzso zzso and describe the clinical significance of measuring the volumes of zzso visceral fat zzso and subcutaneous fat zzso vs these respective areas determined by conventional zzso CT at the zzso zzso 

zzso with obesity or zzso (79 men, 74 zzso were recruited for this zzso We obtained zzso CT scans with a tube current of 150 zzso zzso of 120 zzso and zzso pitch zzso speed in relation to slice zzso starting at the upper edge of the liver and continuing until the zzso The zzso visceral fat volume was measured by drawing a line within the muscle wall surrounding the abdominal zzso The abdominal subcutaneous fat volume was calculated by zzso the visceral fat volume from the total abdominal fat zzso By comparison, the zzso visceral and subcutaneous fat areas were determined at the zzso level by the established zzso CT scanning zzso 

zzso was correlated positively with visceral fat area zzso measured by conventional CT in both genders (in men zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso in women zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso also showed a positive correlation with subcutaneous fat area zzso in both genders (in men zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso in women zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso 

We have reported a novel method for measuring zzso fat volume by the use of zzso zzso
