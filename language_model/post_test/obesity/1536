zzso is associated with systemic inflammation and is a risk factor for zzso zzso zzso We undertook this study to test the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso and not mechanical overload, is responsible for the development of high-fat zzso zzso in zzso 

Human zzso protein zzso mice received a high-fat diet without or with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 2 different drugs with zzso zzso Mice fed zzso were included as zzso After 42 weeks, mice were killed and zzso zzso grading of the knees was zzso To monitor the overall inflammation state, systemic human zzso levels were zzso 

Male mice on a high-fat diet had significantly higher zzso grades than mice on zzso and showed no correlation between zzso severity and body zzso In male mice, high-fat zzso zzso was significantly inhibited by zzso or zzso to zzso grades observed in control zzso Both treatments resulted in reduced human zzso zzso Furthermore, a positive correlation was found between the relative individual induction of human zzso evoked by a high-fat diet on day 3 and zzso grade at end zzso 

zzso zzso zzso in mice is due to zzso inflammation and not to mechanical overload, since no relationship between body weight and zzso grade was zzso Moreover, the zzso process was inhibited to a great extent by treatment with 2 drugs with zzso zzso The inflammatory response to a zzso high-fat challenge may predict individual zzso to developing zzso later in zzso The use of statins or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could be a strategy for interfering with the progression of zzso
