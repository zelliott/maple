zzso can be divided into zzso and zzso Since abnormal zzso and zzso metabolism are more strongly associated with central zzso it may not be adequate to use a general measure, such as a zzso index, to assess for zzso An index of central zzso such as the zzso ratio, might be more zzso 

Nurses measured height and weight for the body mass index zzso zzso zzso of mass divided by the square of the height in zzso and zzso for the zzso ratio zzso in zzso patients aged 45 years and zzso Patients completed an zzso zzso 

zzso percent of patients had an elevated zzso Fifty percent of men zzso confidence zzso zzso 46 to zzso and zzso of women zzso zzso 75 to zzso had central obesity based on elevated zzso Using an elevated zzso as the standard for central zzso elevated zzso as the standard for central zzso elevated zzso had a positive zzso value of only zzso and a negative zzso value of zzso in zzso For women, the corresponding positive and negative zzso values were zzso and zzso zzso 

The data indicate that the practice of using only scales to identify zzso patients should be reevaluated since doing so will miss patients at zzso In primary care patients, particularly those 50 years of age and over, zzso zzso such as the zzso result in zzso of central zzso
