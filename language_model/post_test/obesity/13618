zzso zzso syndrome zzso is associated with insulin resistance and zzso Recent studies have shown that plasma zzso levels decrease with zzso Currently, no data exist on the relative expression and regulation of zzso in zzso tissue of women with zzso The objective of this study was to assess zzso and protein levels of zzso including circulating zzso in zzso zzso tissue of women with zzso and matched control zzso zzso zzso and in zzso regulation of zzso tissue zzso was also zzso 

zzso zzso and Western zzso were used to assess zzso and protein expression of zzso Plasma zzso was measured by zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso insulin, and zzso and adrenal steroids on zzso tissue zzso were analyzed ex zzso The in zzso effects of insulin zzso on zzso levels were also assessed by a prolonged zzso zzso 

In addition to decreased plasma zzso levels in women with zzso zzso zzso compared with control subjects, there was significantly lower levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso in zzso zzso tissue of women with zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso tissue zzso insulin and zzso significantly zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso protein levels, and zzso into zzso media zzso zzso P zzso Also, zzso induction in healthy subjects significantly reduced plasma zzso levels zzso zzso 

Our novel findings reveal that zzso is zzso by insulin and zzso These may, in part, explain the decreased zzso levels observed in our overweight women with zzso
