Recently, zzso zzso have been linked to the zzso of zzso fatty liver disease zzso and its progression to zzso zzso zzso First transcribed as zzso these molecules are further processed by a complex of zzso and zzso zzso binding molecules to form mature zzso The aim of this study is to investigate mechanisms of zzso regulation in the visceral zzso of obese zzso patients via measuring expression of zzso processing zzso and zzso 

Total zzso were extracted from visceral zzso tissue zzso samples collected from patients undergoing zzso zzso All patients had zzso zzso zzso patients zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For each patient, we zzso zzso levels for three zzso processing elements zzso zzso and zzso and seven zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was significantly increased within the NASH cohort along with expression of zzso The presence of focal necrosis on the liver biopsy correlated significantly with levels of zzso and zzso Both NASH and zzso zzso of zzso correlated zzso with the expression levels of zzso zzso NASH correlated positively with the expression levels of zzso and zzso The presence of the zzso zzso zzso in the liver biopsy correlated positively with zzso and zzso The expression profile of zzso also correlated positively with body mass zzso 

Our findings support the hypothesis that zzso zzso may contribute to the zzso of NASH in obese zzso
