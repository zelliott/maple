We aimed to assess the impact of zzso sleep zzso zzso on the left zzso zzso function independent of obesity using the zzso performance index zzso zzso and the global zzso zzso strain zzso and its zzso after zzso Twenty-five newly diagnosed zzso patients, normal weight zzso zzso zzso and obese zzso mass index zzso zzso 25; zzso zzso zzso controls without zzso were enrolled and underwent zzso zzso zzso The zzso and obese groups had a significantly comparable increased zzso and zzso chamber dimension, prolonged zzso relaxation time, reduced early zzso filling zzso and increased late zzso filling zzso and zzso index as compared to the normal weight zzso However, zzso was significantly reduced only in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso as compared to the normal weight group zzso zzso zzso P zzso and obese group zzso zzso zzso P zzso As a treatment, 13 of 25 patients underwent surgical zzso and the follow-up zzso revealed significantly improved zzso index and zzso as compared to baseline zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso respectively), which was comparable to the obese zzso A reduction in the zzso index had a significant effect on the improvement in the zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso and zzso function significantly deteriorated in the patients with zzso beyond zzso and an improvement in the zzso function was observed within 6 months after the surgical zzso zzso is considered to be one of the parameters that can be used in the early detection of zzso zzso dysfunction in patients with zzso and a normal ejection zzso
