To evaluate the zzso and zzso hypotheses for zzso surgery in obese rats with zzso 

zzso zzso zzso fatty rats were divided into a sham operation group, a partial zzso bypass zzso group, and a complete zzso zzso zzso zzso is a model to test zzso hypothesis, whereas zzso is a model to test both zzso We performed oral zzso tolerance tests zzso on all groups at zzso and then 4 and 8 weeks zzso The rats were killed thereafter and the plasma levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso A separate zzso of zzso rats underwent zzso after treatment with the zzso zzso the zzso zzso or zzso 

zzso improvement of the blood zzso control during the zzso was noted 8 weeks after zzso but not 8 weeks after zzso or the sham zzso The serum zzso and zzso levels were higher in the zzso group than in the other two zzso zzso with the zzso zzso increased the blood zzso levels 30 zzso after the zzso in the zzso zzso 

Improvement in zzso metabolism after zzso was associated with the inflow of zzso and pancreatic juice into the zzso supporting zzso of the zzso zzso zzso appears to play a role in this zzso
