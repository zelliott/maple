In ten obese zzso subjects the concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso and reverse zzso zzso were zzso in serum and of T4 and zzso in urine before and after 2 weeks of zzso zzso zzso zzso per day zzso Mean serum T4 was zzso while zzso decreased and zzso zzso zzso zzso of both T4 and zzso decreased after zzso In six subjects the zzso of serum zzso binding zzso zzso zzso binding zzso zzso and zzso were measured before and after zzso Free T4 and zzso were calculated using a formula based on measured concentration of hormones and their binding zzso zzso restriction resulted in a significant decrease in zzso and a greater decrease in zzso while zzso was zzso zzso of free hormones showed a fall in absolute free zzso and rise in percentage free zzso but a rise in both absolute and per cent free zzso Our data indicate a selective effect of calorie restriction on the zzso of zzso and to a lesser extent zzso and confirm previous reports of altered peripheral zzso of zzso zzso urinary zzso of zzso despite a calculated increase of free T4 in serum, suggests zzso zzso adjustment, the mechanism of which awaits zzso
