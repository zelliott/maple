zzso and obese subjects run a greater risk of developing zzso than the rest of the zzso Several zzso studies suggest that zzso which characterizes both obese and insulin resistant diabetic subjects, may be involved in zzso Because insulin stimulates proliferation of zzso smooth muscle cells zzso in culture, it was supposed that insulin may exert an zzso role by promoting proliferation of zzso in the zzso which is considered as one of the most important initial steps in zzso However, direct evidence of the zzso effect of insulin on zzso in zzso is still zzso Using an animal model of zzso injury with a balloon zzso zzso we have investigated the short and long-term effect of high circulating insulin, associated or not with plasma zzso variations on zzso zzso zzso response to zzso zzso zzso proliferation was appreciated by measuring the incorporation of zzso in the DNA of zzso zzso In a first series of experiments, we induced zzso variations of plasma zzso and insulin zzso by submitting rats with experimental zzso injury to zzso and zzso In control rats, the zzso response to zzso zzso was dramatically increased on day 2 after injury, remained high on day 4, and progressively declined zzso In zzso zzso rats, the increase on day 2 was less pronounced than in zzso zzso a sharp decrease in plasma zzso and insulin zzso was zzso zzso was associated with a significantly less marked decline in zzso zzso activity since day 4 after zzso at the same time, plasma zzso and insulin zzso were sharply zzso These results suggested an involvement of variations of both zzso and insulin in zzso zzso However, when the surge of zzso and insulin after zzso was prevented by adding zzso to the diet, the zzso zzso activity remained higher in zzso rats than in controls, casting doubt as to whether zzso and zzso could be of importance in this zzso Moreover, when zzso rats were rendered either zzso or zzso by simultaneous infusion of zzso and insulin, no difference with controls, in the zzso zzso was zzso Taken together these data indicate that the acute zzso response of zzso to zzso zzso is not influenced by insulin associated or not with high levels of zzso The long-term of long-lasting zzso was investigated using the obese zzso rat model which is characterized especially by early spontaneous development of zzso and insulin zzso Compared to controls, the zzso zzso activity was not significantly increased from day 2 to day 7 after injury, but, from day 14 to day 30 after zzso zzso zzso proliferation was significantly less decreased in obese than in lean zzso Moreover, on day 30, zzso zzso as measured by zzso technique, was much higher in obese than in lean zzso This difference was entirely due to an increase in zzso number within the zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
