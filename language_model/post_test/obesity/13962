To investigate the relationship between development of obesity and the small zzso functions two experimental models of male zzso rats were used in the present work: 1) early zzso overfed rats, nursed from birth to weaning in small litters zzso 4 zzso and 2) zzso zzso zzso treated rats zzso 2 zzso zzso administered zzso for 4 days after zzso submitted to the same early nutritional zzso After zzso all animals had free access to a standard zzso diet and at 40 and 80 days of age their body weight, body fat content and food consumption as well as changes of the zzso zzso and zzso alkaline zzso (AP) activity were compared with parameters of the zzso raised under normal feeding conditions zzso 8 zzso At 40 and 80 days of age the zzso overfed zzso from zzso nests became zzso displayed a significantly increased zzso plus zzso fat pad weight zzso and significantly higher zzso activity in both segments of the small zzso zzso in comparison with rats nursed in NL zzso although their mean daily food intake did not differ from that of non-obese rats during the zzso periods zzso In contrast, the same treatment of zzso rats had only a small effect on late appearance of zzso zzso in early zzso overfed and normally fed zzso rats a similar pattern of body weight, food zzso zzso and zzso activity was found after zzso The effect of zzso was also accompanied by the appearance of zzso zzso and stunted growth on day 40 and day 80, zzso Moreover, the size of fat zzso and the increase of zzso zzso activity in zzso rats belonging to the zzso and NL groups was zzso similar to the values size of these parameters observed in zzso obese rats subjected to early zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso nutritional experience zzso may represent a zzso factor in control rats from small litters for the development of obesity in later zzso zzso increased small zzso zzso activity observed after weaning in both models of obesity when zzso is not present suggest that these functional changes and associated zzso in food zzso could be a component of regulatory mechanisms contributing to the maintenance of their elevated body fat zzso
