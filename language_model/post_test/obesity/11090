To assess the association of a zzso healthy zzso zzso with mortality using five definitions of zzso zzso 

Adults zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso aged zzso years in 1991 through 1993 provided data on zzso and zzso health, defined using data from the Adult Treatment zzso zzso criteria from two zzso and the zzso and zzso model assessment zzso zzso zzso of zzso categories and zzso status zzso created six zzso Cox zzso hazards zzso models were used to analyze associations with zzso and cardiovascular disease zzso mortality during a median follow-up of zzso zzso 

A total of zzso individuals zzso of the zzso were obese, of whom zzso were metabolically healthy, depending on the zzso Regardless of the definition, compared with metabolically healthy, zzso individuals, both the metabolically healthy obese zzso ratios zzso ranged from zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso to zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and the metabolically abnormal obese zzso ranged from zzso zzso for the zzso index to zzso zzso for criteria defined in a separate zzso had an increased risk of zzso The only exception was the lack of excess risk using the zzso criterion for the metabolically healthy obese zzso zzso Among the obese, the risk of mortality did not vary as a function of zzso health apart from when using the zzso criterion zzso zzso Similar results were obtained for cardiovascular zzso 

For most definitions of zzso health, both metabolically healthy and zzso obese patients carry an elevated risk of zzso
