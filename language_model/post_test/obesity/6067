zzso zzso are among the most feared complications in orthopedic surgery as they may cause life-threatening conditions in otherwise highly successful procedures such as total joint zzso Body weight is an important risk factor for zzso and is used in zzso to determine zzso in zzso However, weight patterns among orthopedic populations have changed considerably since the introduction of these zzso essentially shifting towards zzso This study asks whether zzso obese patients would benefit from higher than usual zzso of zzso in the prophylaxis of zzso zzso 

To detect at least a zzso difference in the zzso of clinically symptomatic zzso events with sufficient power, 750 patients were enrolled in the study and treated with 3,500 zzso or 5,000 zzso zzso zzso in rates were zzso in a zzso zzso including as zzso the potential zzso severity of zzso sex, exact weight and zzso 

Overall, zzso patients were followed for a total of zzso zzso and analyzed by zzso The ratio of zzso rates in the two groups of patients was zzso zzso zzso zzso thus there was no evidence for a difference in rates between zzso There was, however, a borderline significant association between zzso rates and body zzso There were no complications resulting from the higher zzso of zzso 

Both groups of treated patients showed low zzso rates of zzso and we did not see a significant reduction of zzso rates with higher zzso of zzso in this zzso However, there was weak evidence that higher zzso might prove beneficial if populations gain weight even zzso
