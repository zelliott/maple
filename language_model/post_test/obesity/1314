Energy balance is the difference between zzso energy intake and total energy zzso Energy intake is difficult to measure zzso changes in body weight, for example, are not a good measure of the zzso of energy zzso because fluctuations in body weight are common even if the overall trend is toward weight zzso It is now customary to assess energy requirements indirectly from total energy zzso Total energy expenditure consists of zzso zzso zzso zzso and physical zzso Energy expenditure is related to both body weight and body zzso A reduction in total energy expenditure accompanies weight loss, because zzso zzso rate decreases with the loss of lean tissue zzso Similarly, with weight gain, there is an increase in zzso zzso rate, because lean tissue mass grows to support the increase in fat tissue zzso Excess energy intake over energy expenditure causes weight gain and an accompanying increase in total energy zzso Following a period of adaptation, total energy expenditure will match energy intake and body weight will stabilize at a higher zzso This same relationship holds for weight zzso Respiratory zzso zzso in steady zzso is an indication of the proportion of energy expenditure derived from fat and zzso zzso Over long periods of time, fat balance is equivalent to energy balance, as an excess of fat intake over fat zzso causes fat zzso
