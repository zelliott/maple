We investigated the zzso effect of zzso acid in mice fed a high-fat diet with emphasis on changes in zzso in zzso zzso zzso Male zzso mice were divided into four groups and fed a normal diet, a high-fat diet zzso or zzso plus oral administration of zzso acid (20 zzso of body zzso zzso or 40 zzso of body zzso zzso for 8 zzso Compared with the zzso group, mice orally administered 40 zzso of zzso zzso of body zzso exhibited significantly decreased body weight and zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group were significantly lower than those in the zzso group, as were the levels of serum insulin and zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso tissue mass was decreased by zzso acid zzso zzso acid also inhibited the protein expression of zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso which are zzso by zzso These data demonstrate that zzso acid has an zzso effect in mice zzso by the regulation of zzso
