The zzso rat is obese, insulin zzso and zzso and the males develop zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso body weight was administered in the food from 10 to 14 weeks of age and resulted in an initial 50% decrease in food zzso Body weights of male and female rats initially decreased by about zzso and thereafter remained relatively constant, whereas control animals gained about zzso in weight over the treatment zzso zzso rats showed body weights virtually identical with those of zzso zzso zzso treatment and pair feeding decreased serum zzso zzso by about zzso there was a preferential loss of zzso containing longer chain fatty acids in the zzso whereas this selectivity was not seen in the zzso zzso zzso insulin clamp studies were performed using zzso a zzso that allows for the measurement of total zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso In male zzso rats, zzso does not stimulate total zzso zzso reflecting the very severe insulin resistance, and neither zzso treatment nor pair feeding increased total zzso zzso zzso in male zzso rats decreases zzso zzso zzso and zzso treatment or pair feeding reduced this zzso diversion of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso increases total zzso turnover in female zzso rats, and this was not increased further by zzso treatment or pair zzso These effects emphasize the zzso differences in zzso response of the rats to zzso and zzso zzso zzso ameliorates the zzso zzso syndrome in this experimental model mainly by decreasing zzso with an accompanying improvement in zzso zzso metabolism and a related reduction in zzso
