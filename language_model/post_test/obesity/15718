Although zzso oxygen concentration decreases in obese subjects, the mechanism for this remains to be zzso 

The blood gas level in each pulmonary vein zzso was measured in zzso subjects with diverse body mass index zzso values, to determine whether there was a regional zzso in gas exchange depending on the zzso zzso 

Forty subjects with normal zzso function who underwent a zzso zzso for zzso zzso were zzso Before delivering any zzso energy application, blood samples were obtained from each of the four zzso during zzso breathing in a zzso position to measure the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso lung zzso were also zzso 

The zzso value was significantly higher in superior veins than inferior veins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the left superior, left inferior, right superior, and right inferior zzso zzso There was a significant inverse relationship between the zzso and zzso zzso Neither the zzso nor lung zzso could detect any remarkable findings corresponding to the low zzso zzso Among the various clinical zzso only the zzso was significantly associated with the decreased zzso value in the inferior zzso 

zzso in obese subjects in a zzso position is thus considered to be primarily caused by insufficient gas exchange in the regions of lung linked to the inferior zzso The inverse relationship between the zzso and zzso value in the inferior zzso suggests a possible zzso manifestation of zzso respiratory zzso
