A sympathetic zzso is a common feature in hypertension, type 2 diabetes zzso zzso and zzso zzso This increase in sympathetic activity may lead to an zzso of zzso zzso By contrast, cardiac zzso impairment is observed in these zzso Recently we showed in a model of rats with massive obesity zzso zzso zzso that an enhanced zzso activity may be protective against zzso The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of an increase in sympathetic activity and a change in zzso activity on zzso rigidity and hypertension in zzso zzso Fourteen zzso zzso patients aged 54 zzso 2 years were compared to 22 elderly zzso subjects (75 zzso 1 years: 11 controls and 11 zzso and 34 middle aged zzso subjects zzso zzso 1 years; 17 controls and 17 zzso zzso zzso activity was investigated by spectral analysis of heart rate zzso and blood pressure zzso zzso during 6 zzso at a controlled breathing rate (12 zzso zzso and the low zzso of zzso zzso zzso were significantly zzso higher in zzso zzso and elderly zzso Pulse pressure zzso and the high zzso of zzso zzso were lower in zzso zzso zzso zzso was positively correlated to zzso zzso zzso only in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso correlated to zzso in elderly control subjects zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso The present results suggest that: sympathetic nervous system activity is enhanced in subjects over 70 years without any zzso effect of zzso and in middle-aged zzso patients with type 2 zzso the increase in pulse pressure, an index of zzso zzso in elderly subjects may result from sympathetic zzso the decrease in the cardiac zzso balance, mainly due to a high zzso activity, may be protective against the occurrence of hypertension in patients with type 2 zzso
