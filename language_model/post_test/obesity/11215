The associations between zzso hypertension and diabetes are well established, and the zzso system zzso may provide a link among zzso The effect of zzso zzso on type 2 diabetes is still zzso however, zzso seems to play an important role in the regulation of the zzso and zzso intolerance of mice fed high-fat zzso zzso 

zzso mice fed a zzso diet (8 weeks) were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso (30 zzso or zzso (10 zzso for 6 weeks, and the protective effects were extensively compared among groups by zzso zzso tools, zzso Western zzso and hormonal zzso 

All zzso zzso significantly attenuated the increased blood pressure in mice fed a zzso zzso Treatment with zzso but not zzso or zzso significantly attenuated body mass zzso gain, zzso intolerance and insulin resistance, improved the alpha and beta cell mass and prevented the reduction of plasma zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment improved the protein expression of the pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatment showed the greatest zzso zzso 

Our findings indicate that zzso zzso with zzso attenuated several of the deleterious effects of the zzso zzso In zzso zzso appears to be responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso and function, of alpha and beta cell mass and of zzso and zzso zzso These protective effects of zzso were zzso primarily, to the reduction in body mass gain and food intake and the enhancement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso axis and zzso zzso
