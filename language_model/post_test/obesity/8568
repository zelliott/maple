zzso functional residual capacity and pulmonary collapse during general zzso lead to zzso in respiratory mechanics and gas zzso Such phenomena are more pronounced in obese zzso We recently demonstrated the beneficial effects of the zzso recruitment strategy on zzso in zzso patients of normal body mass index zzso The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether obese patients also benefit from the zzso recruitment strategy and to determine the level of positive zzso pressure zzso that prevents zzso in obese zzso 

Three groups of 30 patients each were zzso patients with normal zzso zzso zzso and obese patients to whom we applied zzso at 5 and 10 zzso zzso zzso and zzso groups, zzso after the recruitment zzso We studied respiratory mechanics zzso zzso airway pressures and flow zzso and zzso zzso zzso before and after the zzso 

zzso at baseline was higher in the control group zzso zzso 44 zzso zzso than in either the zzso or zzso group zzso zzso 24 and 114 zzso 22 zzso zzso respectively, p zzso zzso improved in all groups after recruitment zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso group was similar to that of the control group zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso and 259 zzso 80 zzso zzso respectively, zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group, however, was worse zzso zzso 41 zzso zzso than that of either of the other groups zzso zzso 

We conclude that the zzso recruitment strategy was effective for increasing zzso in zzso patients, regardless of body zzso The zzso of obese patients receiving the higher level of zzso was similar to that of non-obese zzso
