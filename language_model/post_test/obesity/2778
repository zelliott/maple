The amount of visceral zzso tissue is a risk factor for the zzso zzso It is unclear how zzso changes during childhood and adolescence predict adult fat zzso We hypothesized that there are critical periods during development for the prediction of adult subcutaneous and visceral fat mass by zzso changes during childhood and zzso 

zzso growth charts were retrieved for the men participating in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Study zzso zzso zzso Body composition was analyzed using zzso X-ray zzso and zzso tissue areas using abdominal zzso zzso at 18 to 20 years of zzso 

The main finding in the present study was that subjects with increases in zzso Z score of more than 1 zzso during adolescence had, independent of zzso zzso both larger subcutaneous zzso P zzso and visceral zzso tissue areas zzso P zzso than subjects with unchanged zzso zzso In contrast, subjects with increases in zzso Z score of more than 1 zzso during late childhood had a larger amount of adult subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso P zzso than subjects with unchanged zzso Z score but an unaffected amount of visceral zzso zzso zzso changes during adolescence predict both visceral and subcutaneous zzso tissue of the abdomen, whereas zzso changes during late childhood predict only the subcutaneous zzso zzso 

The amount of visceral zzso tissue in young adult men was associated with zzso changes specifically during adolescence, whereas the amount of subcutaneous zzso tissue was associated with zzso changes during both late childhood and zzso
