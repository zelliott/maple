Fuel selection in human muscle is key to explaining insulin zzso In obesity and type 2 diabetes zzso there is an increased content of zzso within and around muscle zzso Changes in muscle fuel zzso of zzso between zzso and storage of fat, contribute to the zzso of intramuscular zzso and to the zzso of both obesity and type 2 diabetes zzso A mathematical model of the zzso metabolism in skeletal muscle was developed and the effects of fuel selection for lean and obese individuals under zzso conditions, zzso conditions, and zzso insulin conditions were zzso Model results were complementary to prior observations that elevated zzso zzso during zzso conditions is correlated with insulin zzso The model also adequately simulated zzso zzso between fat and zzso zzso in the obese zzso A novel sensitivity analysis indicated the strong interaction effects of parameters of zzso and zzso zzso pathways on the variables of each zzso
