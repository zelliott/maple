zzso has become a major health problem zzso zzso abnormalities have been described not only in obese adults but also in obese children and zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate left and right, zzso and zzso zzso dysfunction in obese zzso patients without zzso using zzso zzso tracking zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was performed on 50 obese children and adolescents with body mass index zzso above the 95th zzso zzso and 46 non-obese zzso and zzso controls zzso zzso and zzso functions of both zzso were investigated through conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso and two-dimensional zzso zzso tracking were also used to zzso zzso performance in both zzso zzso zzso ejection fraction was similar between groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso parameters did not differ between groups, except for a lower zzso A wave zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and higher zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in the zzso zzso global strain was lower in the zzso by both methods zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso In zzso analysis, zzso zzso global strain correlated zzso with zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

Although zzso was not different between the two groups, zzso zzso zzso tracking zzso strain was lower in the obese group, even in the absence of other zzso indicating that obesity effects on zzso function is an early finding in zzso
