zzso female mice developed massive obesity as compared with zzso female zzso We previously identified quantitative trait zzso zzso for obesity on zzso 1, 6, 9 and 17 in zzso female mice, including zzso zzso mice with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mice zzso mice without the zzso zzso produced by crossing zzso and zzso zzso We here addressed the question whether the obesity zzso share genetic bases with putative zzso for plasma zzso insulin and zzso zzso We performed zzso analyses for the first principal component zzso extracted from these zzso zzso to identify the genes that contributed to the comprehensive evaluation of zzso zzso By single zzso scans, we identified two significant zzso for insulin concentration on zzso 6 and 12, three for zzso concentration on zzso 1, 6 and 17, and five for zzso on zzso 1, 6, 12 zzso zzso and zzso Although insulin and zzso zzso and zzso were not normally distributed in combined zzso mice, results of single zzso scans by zzso and zzso methods were very zzso zzso zzso scan by the zzso method was performed with the zzso locus zzso as a zzso A significant zzso zzso zzso interaction was found for zzso on zzso zzso All obesity zzso had significant zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso traits in zzso mice were largely controlled by zzso on zzso 1, 6, 9, 12 and zzso
