To examine the safety and overall clinical effects of zzso the zzso plasma zzso zzso level with bedtime zzso insulin alone in patients with zzso diabetes zzso zzso that is poorly controlled with zzso doses of zzso 

Twelve obese male zzso subjects were treated for 16 weeks with bedtime insulin after a zzso zzso zzso The insulin dosage was increased until the zzso level was zzso The zzso plasma zzso profiles and zzso and zzso levels were measured at the beginning and end of the study, and the zzso and severity of zzso episodes were closely zzso In addition, zzso clamp studies were performed to assess insulin zzso and provide an indirect measurement of insulin zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at week zzso was zzso ( zzso zzso within 6 weeks zzso zzso zzso zzso and remained at target levels until the end of the study zzso zzso zzso zzso at week 16, P zzso The insulin dose was 80 zzso 9 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso control was confirmed by a reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso The zzso of mild or moderate zzso episodes was zzso zzso zzso for the entire zzso study, and no patient experienced severe zzso Bedtime insulin significantly improved total cholesterol, zzso zzso cholesterol, zzso zzso cholesterol, and zzso levels zzso zzso Weight gain was zzso zzso zzso zzso and blood pressure was zzso During the zzso zzso there was an improvement in the first phase zzso zzso and in the second phase zzso zzso of insulin zzso There also was an increase in the rate of zzso zzso infused zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso ratio zzso zzso suggesting enhanced insulin zzso 

zzso insulin given at bedtime in amounts sufficient to achieve a normal zzso level does not cause excessive or severe zzso and does lead to good zzso and zzso control in zzso Bedtime insulin therapy also is accompanied by improved insulin zzso and insulin zzso We conclude that a single dose of insulin alone at bedtime merits consideration as a therapeutic strategy in patients with poorly controlled zzso
