The purpose of this investigation was to determine the meal pattern that characterizes the increased food intake of the zzso zzso The major result was that obese mice ate larger and less frequent meals than lean mice during the dark phase of the zzso zzso There was a sex difference in that obese females ate the largest zzso To investigate the possibility that the different meal patterns observed in obese and lean mice was an artifact of the zzso criterion used to define a minimal zzso zzso the meal patterns of obese and lean male mice were analyzed using two zzso criteria, 1 zzso and 5 zzso and a behavioral zzso the behavioral sequence of zzso This analysis demonstrated that obese mice ate larger meals than lean mice whenever the criterion for an zzso zzso included the behavioral sequence of zzso The mechanisms responsible for the increased meal size in obese mice are not known, but we suggest that zzso zzso mechanisms may be less potent in obese zzso
