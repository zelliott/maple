Various zzso tissue factors have been implicated as zzso of the zzso syndrome zzso The objective of this study was to assess which specific zzso tissue factors would discriminate the presence of zzso in a strictly obese population meeting waist circumference zzso criteria for the zzso 

This was a zzso study of 148 subjects recruited from a zzso weight loss program prior to starting the zzso Patients were eligible if they had a zzso more than 25 zzso and had zzso more than 40 and 35 inches in males and zzso zzso zzso measured included high sensitivity zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and total zzso 

Of the total population, zzso satisfied criteria for the zzso zzso was the only zzso to consistently differentiate between presence and absence of zzso in this obese population zzso zzso zzso in zzso P zzso zzso in zzso All zzso measured with the exception of zzso had a statistically significant relationship with increasing criteria for the zzso 

In a population where an excess amount of zzso tissue exists, insulin is the only reliable zzso to differentiate zzso zzso We zzso that differences in zzso zzso and zzso are a reflection of their zzso in individuals with statistically different amounts of zzso zzso
