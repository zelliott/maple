In this study, we sought to investigate the putative association of the oxidized zzso derived from zzso acid zzso with pediatric zzso fatty liver disease zzso and type 2 diabetes zzso We studied 80 obese adolescents (age zzso zzso zzso years; body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso who underwent an oral zzso tolerance test, a magnetic resonance imaging zzso to measure the zzso fat content, and the measurement of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a robust zzso of liver zzso In this study, we show that only in subjects with zzso zzso the zzso are associated with the zzso and that this association is modulated by the zzso zzso zzso We also show that most of the zzso are associated with a lower insulin zzso and that adolescents with zzso have higher levels of zzso than subjects with impaired or normal zzso zzso These observations lead to the hypothesis that the zzso may be the zzso link between liver injury and zzso and that the novel therapeutic opportunities targeting the zzso are possible in adolescents with zzso zzso and zzso
