The zzso axis plays an important role in generation of zzso zzso Thus, disturbances in this axis can influence the path to a simple zzso THE zzso OF THE STUDY was to assess the function of the hormonal part of the zzso axis in children with simple zzso 

Group of 13 girls with the simple obesity was analyzed and the results were compared with results taken in the control group of 10 healthy zzso Each girl was examined for the oral zzso tolerance and standard meal zzso Blood was collected before stimulation and after 15, 30, 60 and 120 zzso zzso of insulin, zzso pancreatic zzso zzso gastric zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso were determined with zzso zzso and zzso levels of the peptides as well as their integrated zzso were zzso 

The results indicated that the disturbances in zzso zzso axis were limited to zzso and changes in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in obese zzso The integrated output of zzso in obese girls was significantly higher zzso than in control group but exclusively after the meal zzso Mean values of the integrated output of zzso in both tests were significantly higher in the control group than in the obese girls zzso zzso tolerance zzso zzso zzso meal: zzso After zzso and test zzso neither plasma zzso of zzso pancreatic zzso nor zzso differed in the obese girl and control zzso 

Low zzso level of zzso in obese children seems to be responsible for excessive zzso of food and a weaker zzso of gastric zzso both resulting in zzso
