The relationships between body zzso zzso tissue distribution, plasma zzso insulin levels, zzso levels, and resting blood pressure were studied in 81 men aged zzso zzso zzso years zzso zzso zzso zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso percentage body zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso blood pressures zzso were significantly associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso the waist circumference zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso as well as with zzso tissue areas measured by computerized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso zzso P zzso Furthermore, the relative zzso of subcutaneous abdominal fat, as estimated by the ratio of abdominal to zzso zzso tissue areas measured by CT, was positively correlated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plasma insulin level zzso zzso zzso P zzso as well as the insulin area measured during an oral zzso tolerance test zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso zzso P zzso were significantly correlated with blood zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly associated with zzso zzso as well as with the zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso were significantly correlated with zzso zzso only zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the insulin area was the most important variable associated with blood pressure and that this association was independent of total body zzso and regional zzso tissue zzso Plasma insulin levels explained zzso and zzso of the zzso observed in the zzso and zzso blood pressures zzso These results suggest that most of the association between abdominal obesity and high blood pressure is zzso by the zzso and/or the related insulin resistant zzso
