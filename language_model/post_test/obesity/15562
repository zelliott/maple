To provide a firmer basis for preventing high blood pressure zzso we tested interventions to promote weight loss, dietary sodium reduction, and their combination for lowering zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of hypertension during a 3- to zzso zzso 

We conducted a randomized, 2 zzso 2 zzso clinical trial, with zzso levels measured by blinded zzso Nine academic medical centers recruited zzso men and women (age range, zzso zzso not taking zzso drugs, with a zzso zzso of 83 to 89 zzso zzso a zzso zzso lower than 140 zzso zzso and a body mass index (the weight in zzso divided by the square of the height in zzso representing zzso to zzso of desirable body zzso Counseling aimed at helping participants achieve their desirable weight or a zzso or more weight reduction (in the weight loss and combined zzso and/or sodium intake of 80 zzso (in the sodium reduction and combined zzso was zzso 

From zzso zzso weight decreased by zzso to zzso zzso at 6 months and by approximately 2 zzso at 36 months in the weight loss and combined groups compared with weight changes in the usual care group (all groups, P zzso zzso zzso decreased 50 and 40 zzso at 6 and 36 months, respectively, in the sodium reduction group and about 15 zzso less at each time point in the combined group compared with the usual care group (all groups, P zzso Compared with the usual care group, zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso in the weight loss group, zzso zzso zzso in the sodium reduction group, and zzso zzso zzso in the combined group at 6 months (all groups, P zzso At 36 months, zzso decreases remained greater in the active intervention groups than in the usual care group zzso loss group, zzso zzso zzso sodium reduction group, zzso zzso zzso combined group, zzso zzso zzso zzso were statistically significant for zzso and zzso zzso in the weight loss group and for zzso zzso in the sodium reduction zzso Through 48 months, the zzso of hypertension zzso or zzso 140 zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso 90 zzso zzso zzso or the use of zzso zzso was significantly less in each active intervention group than the usual care group zzso relative risks, zzso 

In overweight adults with zzso zzso weight loss and reduction in sodium zzso individually and in zzso were effective in lowering zzso and zzso zzso especially in the short-term (6 zzso Although the effects on average zzso declined over time, reductions in hypertension zzso were zzso
