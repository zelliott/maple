In prospective studies in zzso Indians, four zzso zzso which are known to have a familial zzso have been found to predict weight zzso These are: zzso low relative resting zzso rate zzso relative to the average predicted rate for body zzso zzso low level of spontaneous physical activity zzso zzso high 24 h respiratory zzso zzso and zzso high insulin sensitivity zzso zzso studies show that all four parameters correlate with body size: zzso zzso zzso mass zzso r zzso zzso P zzso energy cost of zzso zzso weight, r zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso body fat, r zzso zzso P zzso IS zzso weight, r zzso zzso P zzso When these parameters are adjusted for differences in body size, then the initial value predicts the rate of change in body weight over the subsequent years: zzso zzso for zzso fat mass, age and zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso for fat zzso r zzso zzso P zzso IS zzso for zzso r zzso zzso P zzso After gaining weight, the original zzso from the value predicted on the basis of the population zzso low relative zzso high zzso and high zzso tends to diminish, suggesting a progressively decreasing zzso drive for further body weight zzso Thus, the high zzso high energy cost of zzso low zzso and low IS seen in obesity may act to limit additional weight zzso
