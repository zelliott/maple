to assess the accuracy of the two most used zzso criteria: Must and Cole to diagnose obesity in adolescence comparing with percentage of fat mass determined by zzso 

zzso study with zzso adolescents zzso zzso attending a private school in zzso zzso zzso measures of height and weight were taken and zzso was zzso Analysis of body composition was performed using the zzso to detect percentage of fat zzso Using the method proposed by Ellis & zzso zzso two zzso linear zzso models of fat percentage for age in years were zzso The comparison between the methods was carried out through the analyses of specificity and sensitivity with two residual zzso as zzso points zzso and zzso as zzso A zzso model was fitted to estimate the probability zzso of obesity zzso 

the comparison of the two classic criteria for the diagnosis of obesity with the zzso and zzso zzso yields for females the same sensitivities of zzso and zzso for both zzso For males sensitivities for zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso while for zzso the sensitivities were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso there are high probabilities that those criteria diagnose adolescents as obese, when actually they are zzso 

the Must and Cole criteria were similar and present flaws for the diagnosis of zzso In clinical practice and field studies zzso criteria should be evaluated as to the diagnostic accuracy along with other clinical parameters and, when zzso the analysis of zzso zzso However, the zzso criteria evaluated are efficient in the identification of non-obese adolescent in the two zzso points zzso
