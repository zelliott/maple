The negative zzso pressure zzso technique is used to detect zzso zzso flow limitation zzso in patients with respiratory zzso Application of zzso may result in a sustained decrease of flow below control as a result of upper airway collapse, which may invalidate interpretation of the zzso This response to zzso is common in patients with zzso sleep zzso syndrome zzso The prevalence of this phenomenon, however, has not been studied in healthy subjects and patients with zzso and restrictive disorders without zzso 

The purpose of this study was as zzso zzso to assess the effects of increasing zzso levels on upper airway zzso and zzso to determine the factors that zzso to zzso flow limitation or upper airway collapse during zzso application in different postures in healthy zzso and obese subjects, and in patients with zzso and restrictive respiratory zzso 

zzso patients with zzso airway disease (21 patients with zzso 16 patients with simple chronic bronchitis, and 19 patients with zzso were compared with 47 patients with restrictive respiratory disorders, 20 zzso and healthy subjects, and 9 obese subjects zzso mass zzso 30) without a history of zzso or zzso 

zzso at levels of 5 zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso and 15 zzso zzso were applied at the mouth immediately after the onset of tidal expiration while seated and zzso zzso zzso was defined as no change in zzso flow over any portion of the immediately preceding control zzso Upper airway collapse or narrowing was detected when flows decreased below those of the control zzso 

Ten patients zzso with zzso airway disease (7 patients with zzso exhibited zzso at zzso of 5 zzso zzso (4 patients were zzso only, and 6 patients were both zzso and zzso No patient with restrictive disorders or healthy obese and zzso subjects presented zzso at zzso of 5 zzso zzso In almost all subgroups, both seated and zzso subjects exhibited a transient decrease of flow below control immediately after the application of zzso in occasional zzso As zzso increased, the number of subjects who exhibited this response in occasional breaths declined, while the number of subjects who displayed this pattern in all breaths zzso zzso there were very few subjects in each zzso who exhibited a sustained decrease in flow below control in occasional breaths at zzso at 5 zzso zzso and only one healthy obese subject who displayed this response in all breaths in zzso position zzso 

In general, an increase in zzso resulted in only rare instances of sustained decrease in flow below control in all zzso While transient decreases in flow exhibited immediately after the onset of zzso in all breaths are common and become more prevalent as zzso is increased beyond 5 zzso zzso there are only rare instances of sustained decrease in flow below control throughout expiration at all levels of zzso tested, indicating an appropriate upper airway zzso response that maintains zzso Thus, in subjects without zzso assessment of zzso zzso with zzso is valid in almost all zzso
