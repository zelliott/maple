Body fat distribution plays an important role in determining zzso zzso Whereas central obesity is closely associated with the development of zzso and type 2 diabetes, lower body fat appears to be protective and is paradoxically associated with improved zzso and cardiovascular zzso zzso studies have demonstrated that fatty acid handling differs between white zzso tissue zzso with lower body white zzso tissue acting as a more efficient site for long-term zzso zzso The regulatory mechanisms governing these regional differences in function remain to be zzso Although the local zzso is likely to be a contributing factor, recent findings point towards the zzso being zzso distinct at the level of the zzso precursor cells zzso The zzso zzso are capable of generating cells of the zzso zzso including zzso Regional differences in the zzso and zzso potential of these cells, as well as zzso and zzso activity, have been zzso zzso the genetic and zzso characteristics of these cells can be retained through multiple generations when the cells are cultured in zzso The rapidly emerging field of zzso may hold the key for explaining regional differences in white zzso tissue gene expression and zzso zzso describes the regulation of gene expression that occurs independently of changes in DNA zzso for instance, DNA zzso or zzso protein zzso In this review, we will discuss the contribution of DNA zzso to the determination of cells of zzso fate as well as the role DNA zzso may play during zzso terminal zzso
