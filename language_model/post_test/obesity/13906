To assess risk factors for type 2 diabetes zzso zzso and cardiovascular disease zzso with the hypothesis that risk for zzso in children would be associated with an increase in risk factors for zzso 

zzso from a group of Mexican-American school children zzso zzso zzso identified to be at risk for zzso and their siblings, were selected for this zzso There were 68 children with zzso zzso zzso and 71 without AN zzso Both zzso and zzso children were assessed for zzso and zzso risk zzso zzso and siblings were evaluated by physical examination, family history, and zzso serum zzso zzso insulin, body mass index zzso serum zzso and oxidized zzso Data were analyzed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso ratio, zzso and zzso blood pressure were all significantly higher zzso zzso in zzso whereas zzso stages were similar in both zzso zzso serum zzso was in the normal range, whereas insulin was elevated in zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso resistance as assessed by the zzso assessment model zzso was elevated in both groups, although higher among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was lower zzso zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso The lower zzso in zzso was associated with elevated zzso and a higher serum total cholesterol zzso ratio when contrasted with the zzso values zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In addition to the high prevalence of zzso zzso zzso zzso in this population zzso zzso elevated insulin zzso zzso low zzso zzso zzso zzso and elevated zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso zzso were also zzso 

The altered zzso pattern observed in this group of Mexican-American children is characteristic of zzso syndrome, a condition associated with obesity and increased risk for both zzso and zzso in zzso This study points to the value of zzso and zzso zzso as easily accessible markers for children and nuclear families at increased risk for developing zzso and zzso
