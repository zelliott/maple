Commercial Web-based weight-loss programs are becoming more popular and increasingly refined through the addition of enhanced features, yet few zzso controlled trials zzso have independently and rigorously evaluated the efficacy of these commercial programs or additional zzso 

To determine whether overweight and obese adults zzso to an online weight-loss program with additional support features zzso experienced a greater reduction in body mass index zzso and increased usage of program features after 12 and 24 weeks compared to those zzso to a standard online version zzso 

An zzso zzso comparing 301 adults zzso zzso zzso mean age: zzso years, zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso who were recruited and enrolled offline, and randomly allocated to basic or enhanced versions of a commercially available Web-based weight-loss program for 24 zzso 

zzso at 24 weeks was greater in the enhanced group versus the basic group zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso In the zzso analysis of zzso with zzso using last observation carried forward, after 24 weeks both intervention groups had reductions in key outcomes with no difference between groups: zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso weight zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso waist circumference zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso ratio zzso mean zzso zzso zzso enhanced mean zzso zzso zzso zzso The enhanced group logged in more often at both 12 and 24 weeks, respectively zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso and zzso mean zzso zzso zzso vs basic zzso mean zzso zzso zzso and zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The addition of personalized zzso in the enhanced program provided limited additional benefits compared to a standard commercial Web-based weight-loss zzso However, it does support greater retention in the program and greater zzso which was related to weight zzso Further research is required to develop and examine Web-based features that may enhance engagement and outcomes and identify optimal usage patterns to enhance weight loss using Web-based zzso
