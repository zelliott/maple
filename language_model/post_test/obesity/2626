The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that zzso obesity and soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lead to altered vascular function in the offspring later in zzso 

zzso female mice were placed on a low-fat zzso or high-fat zzso diet before zzso On day 8 of pregnancy, the zzso mice were injected with zzso that carried either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso received saline zzso After being zzso all offspring were placed on a standard zzso At 3 months of age, the carotid artery was isolated for in zzso vascular zzso zzso 

Among male zzso the response to zzso was significantly lower in the zzso zzso zzso The response to zzso in males and to zzso in females was lower in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso the zzso zzso and zzso groups displayed less relaxation to zzso The response to zzso was significantly lower in females than males in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The response to zzso was significantly lower in the zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso 

zzso obesity and zzso alter fetal programming of adult vascular zzso The mechanism is complex and gender zzso
