To examine hormonal status in obese, zzso normal women we studied 25 regularly zzso zzso obese zzso weight, 120 zzso women participating in a weight reduction program and 25 zzso normal weight zzso weight, 60 zzso zzso zzso 17 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso testosterone, zzso zzso zzso and cortisol zzso were measured during the zzso phase of the zzso zzso zzso to hip ratio and abdominal fat cell size were measured at the beginning of the zzso The serum levels of zzso zzso less than zzso as well as those of A, zzso and zzso zzso less than zzso were lower in the obese zzso zzso the testosterone to zzso ratio and the E1 to A ratio were higher and the zzso to zzso ratio was lower in this zzso zzso to hip ratio did not correlate with the levels of circulating hormones or zzso but an inverse correlation was found between abdominal fat cell size and A as well as the zzso to zzso ratio in the zzso women of the obese zzso zzso to moderate weight reduction zzso zzso serum A and E1 levels zzso less than zzso increased, and serum cortisol levels decreased zzso less than zzso Thus, massive obesity is associated with abnormalities in hormonal balance in zzso zzso women, there being an association between zzso zzso A, zzso zzso and relative weight and/or abdominal fat cell zzso
