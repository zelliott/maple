zzso zzso zzso zzso in obesity has been attributed to increased fatty acid transport and/or to zzso in zzso fatty acid zzso zzso an imbalance in these two processes may channel fatty acids into zzso zzso in red and white muscles of lean and obese zzso rats, we examined whether the increase in zzso zzso was attributable to an increased rate of fatty acid transport rather than zzso in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso fatty acid zzso In obese animals selected parameters were zzso including zzso transport zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso not zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso approximately zzso and zzso content (red zzso zzso zzso parameters were also greater in obese animals, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso SS zzso zzso not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities zzso zzso zzso zzso activity did not zzso A comparison of lean and obese rat muscles revealed that the rate of change in zzso concentration was zzso greater than that of fatty acid zzso zzso zzso when both parameters were expressed relative to fatty zzso Thus fatty acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso in muscles of obese zzso rats, with these effects being most pronounced in red zzso The additional fatty acid taken up is channeled primarily to zzso suggesting that zzso in fatty acid transport as opposed to altered fatty acid zzso is the major zzso of intramuscular zzso zzso
