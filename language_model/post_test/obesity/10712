The effects of diet on the serum zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso were studied in 3 groups of obese subjects zzso zzso and 1 group of normal weight subjects zzso zzso Group I subjects ate either a 830 zzso zzso diet zzso or zzso diet zzso Group II and III subjects ate a zzso zzso zzso in Group IV ate a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not change in any of the 4 zzso Only the subjects in Group II had a statistically significant decrease in serum zzso concentration 6 zzso after starting the zzso zzso Group I individuals eating the zzso and the subjects in Groups II, III and IV had significant decreases in the serum zzso of zzso and zzso after 1 zzso which persisted without further change during the remaining 3-5 zzso of the zzso Group I subjects eating the zzso had a significant decrease in zzso concentration at 1 and 6 zzso The zzso serum concentration was significantly decreased after 1 zzso on the diet, but was not significantly different from the control diet period at 6 zzso The magnitude of the decreases in serum zzso of zzso and zzso in the Group I subjects eating the zzso were significantly greater than in the Group I subjects eating the zzso Thus, zzso of a zzso zzso by obese individuals results in decreased serum zzso of zzso and zzso zzso substitution of zzso for fat reduces this zzso zzso zzso apparently zzso the serum zzso of zzso and zzso independently of caloric zzso since zzso of a zzso zzso by normal weight individuals also decreased the serum concentration of the two visceral zzso
