zzso tissue growth has been proposed to involve recruitment of new blood zzso Here, we test the hypothesis that delivery of an zzso inhibitor in mice may prevent zzso zzso the most common type of obesity in zzso We show that systemic administration of a selective zzso zzso zzso zzso prevents obesity in high caloric zzso zzso mice as well as in genetically zzso zzso zzso zzso of obesity in mice by zzso involves a reduction of zzso in the zzso zzso This therapeutic strategy appears to selectively affect the growth of zzso tissue as measured by the ratio between total fat and lean body zzso Interestingly, the treatment with zzso results in decreased serum levels of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, insulin levels are reduced, which indicates increased insulin sensitivity, suggesting that zzso zzso may prevent the development of type II zzso Our findings suggest that similarly to growth and zzso in other zzso zzso tissue growth is dependent on zzso Our observations may have conceptual implications for the prevention of obesity and related zzso
