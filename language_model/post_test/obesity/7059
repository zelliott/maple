zzso energy expenditure and increased food intake are principal causes for zzso In the present study, zzso of zzso zzso zzso and of zzso zzso zzso both of which are believed to have a close link to the cause of zzso were analyzed and compared with zzso of childhood zzso 

Thirty-five obese children with moderate to severe obesity were zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso coding region and zzso chain reaction were used to detect zzso variation in the zzso gene using peripheral zzso zzso 

zzso frequency of zzso variation in the zzso gene in the obese subjects was zzso which is comparable with that in the healthy general population in eastern zzso zzso of zzso characteristics did not show a significant difference between zzso and zzso zzso It was notable that body height zzso was significantly higher in the zzso than the zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Annual weight gains were far beyond a hypothetical fat gain in an zzso zzso with decreased energy consumption, suggesting increased food intake in childhood zzso There was, however, no variation in the zzso gene despite thorough sequencing of the entire coding zzso 

The zzso variation in the zzso gene has no relationship to the degree or the zzso of childhood zzso The majority of childhood obesity can be characterized as tall zzso more rapid weight gain than that expected by decreased energy zzso Further investigation is necessary in regard to the increased food intake as a major cause of childhood zzso
