We investigated early childhood disparities in high body mass index zzso between Black and White US zzso 

We compared differences in Black and White children's prevalence of zzso zzso zzso and early life risk and protective zzso fit zzso zzso models predicting high zzso zzso 95th zzso at age 4 to 5 years to 2 nationally representative samples followed from zzso and performed separate and zzso zzso of these zzso 

After adjustment for sample zzso zzso models predicting high zzso in the 2 samples were statistically zzso In the zzso models, Black children's odds of high zzso were 59% higher than White children's zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced the racial disparity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and early life zzso reduced the disparity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso obesity and zzso or no zzso were among zzso for which racial differences in children's zzso most disadvantaged Black zzso 

zzso disparities in early childhood high zzso were largely explained by potentially modifiable risk and protective zzso
