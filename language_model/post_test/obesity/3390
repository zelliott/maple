We have investigated the role of muscle mass, zzso peptides and zzso in explaining the obesity zzso 

The obesity paradox relates to the association between obesity and increased survival in patients with coronary heart disease zzso or heart failure zzso 

Prospective study of zzso men aged zzso years followed up for a mean period of 11 years, during which zzso deaths zzso The men were divided according to the presence of doctor diagnosed zzso and zzso zzso no zzso or zzso zzso with zzso (no zzso and zzso with zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and obesity zzso zzso 30 zzso were associated with lower mortality risk compared to men with normal weight zzso zzso zzso in those with zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso and in those with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso Adjustment for muscle mass and zzso attenuated the inverse association in those with zzso (no zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso but made minor differences to those with zzso zzso zzso related positively to mortality in men without zzso but zzso to mortality in those with zzso adjustment for zzso abolished the zzso mortality association in men with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso 

The lower mortality risk associated with excess weight in men with zzso without zzso may be due to higher muscle zzso In men with zzso zzso zzso reflecting zzso explain the inverse zzso
