zzso suppresses the release of zzso fatty acids from zzso and suppresses zzso production from zzso but stimulates zzso zzso by skeletal muscle, liver and zzso zzso zzso resistance, the failure of an ample supply of insulin to mediate these effects, is an early and fundamental zzso in type 2 diabetes zzso associated with zzso zzso tissue not only acts as an energy zzso but also zzso a variety of zzso zzso and zzso factors, which regulate energy metabolism and insulin zzso In addition, zzso tissue from obese individuals has a distinct zzso profile that alters both zzso function and overall in zzso insulin zzso zzso is coupled to insulin resistance and diabetes through the action of zzso factors, in a process that involves intricate signaling pathways and zzso regulators in various cell types of zzso zzso in addition to zzso between zzso and zzso zzso Thus, the dissection of the specific pathways that contribute to insulin resistance in obese individuals is a crucial component in understanding zzso zzso In this review, recent in zzso and in zzso data that zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso pathway, a component of both fatty acid and inflammatory zzso signaling zzso in the regulation of insulin sensitivity are discussed, and the value of this zzso as a therapeutic target in zzso is zzso
