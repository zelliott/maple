To examine whether defects in zzso zzso and zzso in aging, zzso and diabetes are secondary to impaired insulin action or to a primary zzso in zzso zzso we compared zzso zzso and energy expenditure in 9 younger, 9 older, 9 obese, and 10 zzso diabetic subjects after the zzso of 75 g of zzso or zzso (a zzso whose transport into the cell and subsequent metabolism are independent of zzso In young control subjects zzso produced a significantly greater increase in zzso zzso and energy expenditure than zzso despite significantly lower plasma zzso and insulin zzso In aged, obese, and diabetic individuals the increments in zzso zzso and energy expenditure after zzso zzso were significantly zzso versus the younger zzso After zzso zzso the increase in zzso zzso in the three zzso groups remained below that observed in the younger volunteers, whereas zzso zzso was enhanced to levels that were comparable with those seen in the younger zzso These data suggest that 1) the stimulation of zzso after zzso zzso is related to an zzso of zzso metabolism rather than an increase in the plasma insulin concentration per se, 2) the insulin resistance of aging, zzso and diabetes is associated with a zzso in zzso zzso zzso and 3) the cellular mechanisms involved in zzso zzso are not primarily impaired in zzso zzso
