zzso zzso causes obesity in zzso and humans, but circulating levels of zzso are paradoxically elevated in zzso The mechanisms underlying this zzso resistance are unknown, but may involve reduced zzso transport across the zzso barrier via short zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Here, we first zzso short zzso zzso expression in isolated rat cerebral zzso zzso the zzso barrier and found that zzso and zzso zzso were abundantly expressed in similar zzso Second, brain zzso of zzso was reduced in mice lacking zzso Third, brain zzso of zzso in New Zealand zzso mice, a strain that responds to central, but not zzso zzso was reduced, suggesting that their obesity is at least partly due to deficient zzso transport into the zzso Fourth, brain zzso of zzso was significantly reduced in zzso obese zzso Neither New Zealand zzso mice nor zzso obese mice exhibited significant decreases in zzso zzso expression in isolated cerebral zzso These data support the ideas that short zzso of zzso are involved in brain zzso of zzso and that impaired zzso barrier function contributes to the zzso of zzso However, the mechanisms by which zzso deficits in brain zzso of zzso occur remain to be zzso
