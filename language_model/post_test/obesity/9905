zzso Indian River male broiler chickens growing from 7 to 28 days of age were fed diets containing 12, 18, 24 and zzso protein + 0 or 1 zzso zzso zzso of diet to study energetic costs of zzso and the use of various zzso for in zzso zzso zzso De zzso zzso and CO2 production were determined in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso consumption was determined in zzso preparations to estimate the energetic costs in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso CO2 derived from zzso was used as an estimate of zzso A availability in liver zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso and zzso estimate relative zzso zzso zzso zzso CO2 production from zzso was greatest in that group fed a zzso protein diet and least in the group fed a zzso protein zzso zzso In addition, zzso increased CO2 production from zzso zzso The production of zzso from the second carbon of zzso or zzso was increased by zzso zzso The zzso diet zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso Adding zzso to the diets decreased carbon flux into zzso from all zzso but increased CO2 production from all zzso without changing stage 3 and 4 zzso rates in zzso zzso zzso These observations imply that zzso A availability may have regulated de zzso zzso in the present zzso zzso It was also concluded that previously noted effects of zzso on zzso metabolism may involve zzso pathways that do not involve changes in zzso zzso
