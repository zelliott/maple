Studies were conducted to evaluate the role of zzso metabolism on the zzso mechanisms in obese patients with essential hypertension zzso The obesity index correlated positively with the mean zzso pressure, plasma volume, zzso fluid volume or total zzso zzso and zzso with plasma zzso concentration or plasma zzso activity in zzso zzso effects of sodium restriction zzso 35 zzso K 75 zzso or the zzso response to infused zzso (3 zzso was remarkable in obese zzso zzso zzso of sodium zzso which reflects the zzso zzso zzso of zzso was significantly lower in obese zzso than that in non-obese or mildly obese zzso zzso zzso of free zzso zzso had a positive relationship with simultaneously measured urinary zzso of sodium or zzso In addition, zzso correlated positively with the obesity index in patients whose weight was under zzso of the ideal zzso On the contrary, the relation between the two parameters was significantly negative in patients whose weight was over zzso of the ideal zzso These findings suggest that the expansion of body fluid volume and zzso which might result from the blunted zzso ability, at least in part, due to an zzso of the zzso zzso activity, play an important role of the zzso mechanisms in obese zzso
