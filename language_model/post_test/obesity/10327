The zzso of cardiovascular risk factors can be seen in a single person but it needs to be determined if this occurs more frequently than might be explained by mere zzso 

This study involved zzso zzso zzso males and zzso zzso who were 40 years of age or older and who underwent an annual health zzso From the clinical and zzso data, the actual prevalence of a combination of 3 or more factors: abnormal body mass index zzso or zzso hypertension, high zzso zzso or zzso zzso low HDL cholesterol zzso zzso and abnormal zzso zzso metabolism zzso blood zzso or zzso zzso or zzso or zzso was zzso Then, the prevalence of a corresponding combination of 3-5 factors was predicted from the prevalence of each factor on the assumption that their combination occurs as a result of zzso 

The criteria of zzso syndrome zzso or zzso risk zzso was met in zzso zzso of the zzso The actual prevalence of any combination of 3-5 factors of zzso syndrome was more frequent than those expected to occur by coincidence zzso zzso When compared with the prevalence of the total zzso the prevalence of obesity and insulin resistance was zzso and zzso times higher in zzso syndrome compared to that in the total zzso but it was zzso to zzso times higher in hypertension and high zzso The former two were zzso more than hypertension or high zzso in zzso zzso zzso levels of serum zzso and total cholesterol were found more often in zzso zzso 

zzso of risk factors of zzso syndrome were found more frequently than coincidental phenomenon in the subjects from the general zzso These finding suggest that these risk factors do cluster and obesity and insulin resistance were suggested to be linked with zzso syndrome more than hypertension or high zzso
