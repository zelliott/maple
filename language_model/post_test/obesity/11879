To investigate the association between change in daily step count and both zzso and insulin sensitivity and the extent to which the association between change in daily step count and insulin sensitivity may be zzso by zzso 

zzso based cohort zzso 

zzso zzso 

zzso adults zzso zzso mean age zzso zzso zzso years; women zzso mean age zzso zzso zzso who participated in the zzso component of the national zzso Study in 2000 and zzso 

Body mass index, waist to hip ratio, and zzso insulin sensitivity at follow-up in zzso 

Over the five year period, the daily step count decreased for zzso zzso of zzso Having a higher daily step count in 2005 than in 2000 was independently associated with lower body mass index zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso lower per 1000 zzso lower waist to hip ratio zzso zzso to zzso zzso and greater insulin sensitivity zzso zzso to zzso zzso units zzso in zzso The mean increase in zzso units fell to zzso zzso to zzso after adjustment for body mass index in zzso 

Among community zzso middle aged adults, a higher daily step count at five year follow-up than at baseline was associated with better insulin zzso This effect seems to be largely zzso through lower zzso
