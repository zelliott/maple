zzso white zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso production, inflammation and zzso are strongly associated with zzso but the zzso of these changes zzso are not fully zzso zzso the aim of this study was to establish the zzso of changes in zzso zzso zzso and the global zzso landscape in visceral zzso during the development of zzso zzso 

zzso mice were fed a high-fat diet zzso or normal diet zzso and sacrificed at 8 zzso over zzso zzso fat zzso was evident in visceral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso collagen zzso was evident in zzso zzso at zzso Plasma zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased early and zzso while zzso decreased late after zzso Only plasma zzso and zzso levels were associated with their respective zzso levels in visceral zzso zzso zzso revealed early and sustained zzso of the immune zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso inflammatory genes included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3, 4, 6, 7 and 9) and their upstream zzso zzso genes (multiple zzso zzso zzso and zzso Early changes also occurred in fibrosis, zzso zzso collagen and zzso zzso but zzso zzso was only visible in the later zzso 

In zzso zzso early zzso of zzso inflammatory zzso zzso by CD zzso zzso leads to increased expression of zzso zzso and zzso resulting in chronic zzso zzso Early changes in collagen genes may trigger the zzso of zzso zzso promoting zzso in the later stages of zzso zzso New therapeutic approaches targeting visceral zzso tissue genes altered early by zzso feeding may help zzso the deleterious effects of zzso zzso
