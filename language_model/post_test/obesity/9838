zzso dysfunction is a characteristic feature of diabetes and obesity in animal models and zzso zzso in zzso oxide production by zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso are associated with insulin resistance, which is exacerbated by high-fat zzso Nevertheless, the zzso effects of increasing zzso levels have not been zzso 

The current study was designed to test whether zzso of zzso would prevent zzso obesity and insulin zzso 

In zzso mice and in high-fat zzso zzso zzso mice, the abundance of zzso protein in zzso tissue was decreased without significant changes in zzso levels in skeletal muscle or zzso Mice zzso zzso zzso transgenic zzso were resistant to zzso obesity and zzso although systemic zzso intolerance remained largely zzso In comparison with zzso mice, high-fat zzso zzso transgenic mice displayed a higher zzso rate and attenuated zzso of white zzso zzso of zzso did not affect food consumption or zzso changes in plasma cholesterol or zzso levels, yet plasma zzso and fatty acids were zzso zzso analysis of zzso tissue indicated that zzso zzso primarily affected zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested changes in fatty acid zzso In agreement with these findings, zzso tissue from zzso transgenic mice showed higher levels of zzso and zzso gene zzso elevated abundance of zzso zzso and a higher rate of oxygen zzso 

These findings demonstrate that increased zzso activity prevents the zzso effects of high-fat diet without affecting systemic insulin resistance, in part, by stimulating zzso activity in zzso zzso
