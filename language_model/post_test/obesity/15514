The influence of weight excess reduction on height and height zzso of obese subjects should be evaluated on the basis of appropriate standards, since the pattern of growth of obese subjects is different from that of normal weight zzso 

zzso weight and zzso zzso thickness were recorded from zzso school subjects zzso males and zzso zzso zzso y of age, from three provinces of central Italy, and a growth reference curve of height was zzso Using zzso (as zzso using the tables of zzso et zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso subjects zzso and obese subjects zzso were identified and specific reference zzso zzso every sixth month of zzso were developed for both zzso zzso of height were also calculated for zzso Various zzso zzso of height in school subjects were performed and a graph of height zzso zzso was constructed in zzso and in zzso using the zzso zzso The yearly mean zzso of zzso was also zzso based on square root transformed data (in order to zzso a zzso zzso zzso from successive zzso in total subjects, in zzso and in zzso The zzso of height and of the square root of zzso were calculated in 217 obese subjects zzso males and 92 zzso before and during a weight excess reduction zzso zzso zzso subjects in zzso who showed a reduction of zzso of zzso were considered as zzso those who either maintained or showed an increase of zzso of zzso were considered as zzso zzso subjects in zzso were followed for zzso zzso giving the following zzso zzso zzso 142 zzso and 75 zzso 0-2 zzso 76 zzso and 33 zzso 0-3 zzso 35 zzso and 30 zzso zzso zzso 24 zzso and 18 zzso 

Compared to zzso zzso showed a significantly greater zzso in zzso males and in zzso zzso but in older children the zzso spurt was reduced and more zzso As a result, the height of zzso which was greater in 3-13 year-old males and in zzso year-old zzso subsequently showed a reduction, as compared to that of zzso in zzso year-old males and in zzso year-old zzso In both responsive and zzso groups of obese subjects in zzso the zzso of height showed a reduction during zzso when evaluated using the reference curve of the total school zzso In contrast, when their growth was evaluated according to the zzso reference curve, no significant variation was observed comparing both zzso before and during the zzso 

More appropriate information on the growth of obese subjects may be obtained when evaluating the height and zzso according to zzso reference standards from the same population of zzso zzso this zzso no significant variation of height resulted during zzso in obese zzso
