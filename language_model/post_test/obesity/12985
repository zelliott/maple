To study the effects of a zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso diet on plasma zzso levels and physical zzso 

A six-month follow-up dietary intervention study with a zzso diet providing zzso of total calories as complex zzso zzso as proteins and zzso as fats zzso saturated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fatty acids zzso or a zzso diet with zzso complex zzso zzso proteins and zzso fats zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Twenty zzso mildly obese, zzso zzso women (11 on zzso and nine on zzso zzso and 14 zzso and zzso lean zzso 

Body mass index zzso zzso ratio, plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso and B, LDL and HDL density distribution, and zzso fatty acid composition at zzso and after 3 and 6 months on dietary zzso 

Body weight progressively decreased during the first 3 months and then it stabilized during the following 3 months zzso zzso baseline in both zzso P zzso zzso decreased significantly in both zzso zzso increased significantly in the zzso group, whereas a decreased level was observed in the zzso zzso At baseline the obese women had higher very low density zzso zzso and dense zzso and lower zzso cholesterol levels than the zzso these abnormalities persisted in the zzso diet, whilst a significant decrease in the dense LDL associated with an increase in the zzso cholesterol was seen in the zzso zzso zzso was not affected by either zzso The zzso ratio was not affected by the zzso diet, whilst it was significantly reduced after 6 months of zzso diet as compared with zzso zzso zzso increased in the zzso group, and decreased in the zzso zzso 

Both diets were effective in decreasing body zzso At steady weight conditions, only the zzso diet improved LDL and HDL zzso distribution abnormalities present in mildly obese zzso zzso
