We have examined the relationship of free fatty acid zzso turnover and zzso zzso rates in zzso to the size of body zzso stores and compared these findings with the in zzso zzso rates of isolated abdominal fat zzso The studies were performed in 20 zzso Indian women 18 to 35 years of age, both lean and zzso zzso turnover rate was measured using a zzso infusion, zzso zzso rate by indirect zzso using a zzso hood, body composition by underwater weighing with correction for residual lung volume, and fat cell zzso rates in zzso by published zzso Both zzso turnover and zzso zzso rates, expressed per zzso of body fat, decreased with increasing degree of obesity (as measured by percent body zzso zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso P less than or equal to zzso zzso In contrast, the rate of zzso determined in zzso expressed per zzso of fat, increased with increasing degree of obesity zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso A ratio of zzso zzso which directly compares these in zzso and in zzso zzso decreased significantly with increases in the degree of obesity zzso zzso zzso P less than or equal to zzso Furthermore, there were no positive correlations between the measures of in zzso zzso metabolism and in zzso zzso when both were expressed per fat mass, per fat cell number, or per fat cell surface zzso The in zzso data also demonstrated that zzso zzso could only account for 50% of the zzso disappearance zzso While zzso zzso rate adjusted to the zzso size increased with increasing plasma zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso the zzso component of the zzso turnover failed to increase with increases in plasma zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is not available in zzso in proportion to the size of the zzso zzso The reason for this is not due to an inability of fat cells to release their stored zzso as assessed in zzso zzso in zzso zzso of fat cell zzso cannot be used to directly predict in zzso zzso zzso The large zzso zzso disposal is likely to be important in the regulation of plasma zzso zzso
