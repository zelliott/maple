In zzso increased activity of the local zzso system zzso and enlarged zzso with altered zzso production are linked to the development of zzso health problems and cardiovascular zzso zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso have been shown to reduce zzso size and alter the production of zzso The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of feeding individual zzso zzso on zzso size and zzso associated with the local zzso zzso Male zzso zzso rats received either zzso control, zzso zzso or zzso zzso diet for zzso The zzso zzso reduced zzso size and increased cell number in zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis revealed that neither zzso zzso altered zzso or protein levels of zzso or zzso receptors in zzso zzso Likewise, levels of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso or the zzso zzso zzso were unchanged in zzso zzso Similarly, neither zzso zzso had any effect on zzso nor DNA binding of zzso Our results suggest that although the zzso zzso had beneficial effects on reducing zzso size in obese rats, this did not translate into changes in the local zzso zzso or associated zzso
