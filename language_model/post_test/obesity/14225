Recent research from a self-report survey showed a strong association between obesity and clinical depression in zzso The present analysis assessed whether differential bias in self-reports of height and weight as a function of depression influences the apparent strength of the zzso 

zzso of zzso height and weight was assessed in 250 obese zzso zzso zzso women, 135 of whom met the American Psychiatric Association zzso diagnostic criteria for clinical zzso 

zzso and zzso women underreported their weight by zzso and zzso zzso zzso They underreported their height by zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso in self-reports of body weight and height is similar in depressed and zzso obese zzso The zzso of weight in both groups is similar in magnitude to that seen in normal weight zzso Thus, using self-reports of height and weight seems unlikely to bias estimates of the association between obesity and clinical depression in zzso
