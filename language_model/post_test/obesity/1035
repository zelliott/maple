To investigate zzso profiles in zzso zzso and relationships between zzso profile and other components of the zzso zzso 

A total number of 49 adults with a wide range of body weight and zzso tolerance were studied in a zzso zzso Plasma cholesterol distribution profiles were measured by size exclusion zzso zzso Blood zzso was measured using an zzso zzso zzso and plasma insulin was determined by zzso 

zzso diabetic zzso zzso had elevated plasma cholesterol zzso and zzso levels zzso compared to their lean zzso The zzso was mainly due to increased circulating levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in these zzso Multiple linear zzso analyses revealed that body weight was independently associated with plasma cholesterol zzso and LDL concentration zzso while plasma insulin was associated with zzso concentration zzso All of the variables measured exhibited continuous zzso across a wide range of zzso from a normal zzso zzso profile to profound zzso 

These data suggest that the zzso in obese, diabetic zzso zzso is closely associated with other components of the zzso Syndrome, including obesity and insulin zzso
