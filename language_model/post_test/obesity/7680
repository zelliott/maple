The aim of this study was to verify the effects of a multidisciplinary therapy (24 weeks) on zzso control of food zzso specifically in zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso Y zzso and zzso zzso and zzso factors zzso insulin, and zzso stimulating hormone zzso in obese zzso 

A total of 88 adolescents zzso boys and 50 zzso including 62 obese and 26 zzso aged zzso years were zzso zzso adolescents were submitted to a zzso multidisciplinary zzso zzso zzso zzso hormone, zzso insulin, zzso zzso total zzso and food intake were measured at three stages (at zzso after 12 weeks, and after 24 zzso 

At zzso obese adolescents showed zzso zzso zzso levels, which were, in boys and girls, 40 and 35 times higher than in zzso subjects, zzso After 24 weeks, these values decreased in all obese zzso Our results showed no differences in zzso levels between obese and zzso zzso in both zzso However, obese boys reduced their plasma zzso concentration after 24 weeks of therapy zzso zzso The multidisciplinary therapy decreased zzso and zzso values and increased zzso simultaneously with these changes there was a decrease in total food intake after 24 weeks of zzso 

We can conclude that the multidisciplinary therapy was efficient to zzso zzso control of food intake in obese zzso
