There is overwhelming evidence that experiences during early life could have long-term health zzso However, the role of early nutrition in programming obesity and zzso resistance is still poorly zzso 

We aimed at determining whether nutritional zzso in early life are associated with body composition and hormonal status at 20 zzso 

Healthy infants participating in the zzso prospective zzso zzso zzso zzso Nutrition zzso des zzso study were examined at 10 months and 2 zzso At 20 years, weight, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso fat mass zzso and zzso mass zzso assessed via zzso zzso analysis, and serum zzso concentration were recorded in 73 subjects still participating in the zzso 

In adjusted linear zzso models, an increase by zzso in energy intake at 2 years was associated with higher zzso zzso thickness zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and higher zzso zzso zzso zzso at 20 zzso An increase by zzso energy from fat at 2 years was associated with lower zzso zzso thickness zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso lower zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and lower serum zzso concentration zzso zzso to zzso zzso at 20 zzso 

Low-fat intake in early life was zzso associated with body fat zzso at the trunk zzso and serum zzso concentration at 20 years, suggesting that early low-fat intake could increase the zzso to develop overweight and zzso resistance at later zzso These findings substantiate current recommendations against restricting fat intake in early life and open new directions for investigating the origin of zzso
