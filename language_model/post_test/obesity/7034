zzso zzso is known to be involved in maintaining zzso zzso and zzso is observed in poorly controlled zzso diabetes zzso subjects, resulting in a lowered plasma zzso Recently we reported that zzso zzso zzso zzso mice exhibited a decreased circulating blood volume and zzso of fat accompanied with impaired zzso Here we further investigated the roles of the zzso zzso in regulating zzso zzso and plasma volume using zzso zzso The plasma zzso levels at the baseline or during a zzso tolerance test were higher in zzso than zzso zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso clamp revealed that the zzso infusion rate was significantly lower in zzso mice than in zzso mice and that zzso zzso production was higher in zzso mice than zzso zzso In contrast to the increased zzso zzso production, the liver zzso content was decreased in the zzso zzso These results indicated that the zzso mice had impaired zzso zzso Furthermore, feeding zzso mice a high-fat diet accompanied by increased calorie intake resulted in significantly overt obesity in comparison with zzso zzso In addition, we found that the circulating plasma volume and zzso level were decreased in zzso mice, although the plasma zzso level was zzso These results suggested that the effect of zzso on water recruitment was disturbed in zzso zzso Thus, we demonstrated that one of the zzso conditions resulting from zzso of the zzso zzso leads to decreased plasma volume as well as impaired zzso zzso which can progress to obesity under conditions of increased calorie zzso
