Several retrospective analyses have suggested that obese men with prostate cancer treated with external beam zzso zzso have outcomes inferior to those of zzso zzso However, a recently presented analysis for the first time challenged this association between body mass index zzso and treatment zzso It is therefore important to provide further data on this zzso 

This was a retrospective analysis of zzso men treated with zzso zzso zzso at a single zzso zzso patients received zzso alone, and the other patients received zzso plus zzso zzso In addition, high-risk patients were treated to higher zzso doses zzso zzso A zzso balloon zzso for internal zzso which can be identified on portal images, was used in 261 patients zzso Thus, zzso did not rely on zzso landmarks alone in these zzso 

The median zzso was 26, and zzso of patients had zzso Neither zzso nor zzso analyses detected any significant impact of zzso on zzso zzso prostate zzso survival, or overall zzso The zzso zzso zzso rate was zzso and prostate zzso survival zzso 

The present analysis of a large cohort of zzso treated patients suggests that efforts to reduce prostate movement and geographic miss might result in comparable outcomes in obese and zzso zzso
