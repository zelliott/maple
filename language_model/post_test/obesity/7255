zzso signaling is thought to mediate zzso and insulin action in zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso key regulators of energy zzso through largely unknown zzso We zzso either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso in these zzso and demonstrate a dominant role for the latter in energy zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice exhibited central zzso resistance, increased zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, the response to zzso was not blocked in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice displayed minimal energy zzso zzso Similarly, in zzso zzso zzso had a more important role than zzso zzso zzso mice displayed normal energy zzso regulation, whereas zzso zzso mice were lean, with increased zzso sensitivity and resistance to zzso zzso These results demonstrate distinct zzso roles for the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso energy zzso
