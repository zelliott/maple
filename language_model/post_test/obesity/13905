To examine the relationships between zzso zzso and insulin resistance among prepubescent zzso 

zzso zzso 

Data were collected from 112 zzso Latino schoolchildren from public schools in three South Florida zzso Of the enrolled participants, zzso were obese zzso 95th zzso and zzso presented with a family history of type 2 diabetes zzso zzso With one exception, all demonstrated normal zzso zzso 

Plasma zzso levels were determined with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso model assessment zzso was calculated as an index of insulin zzso Mean levels of zzso among obese vs zzso children were compared with a one-way analysis of zzso with two groups, and the association between zzso and zzso was assessed with a zzso zzso 

Higher circulating zzso levels were revealed among zzso vs obese zzso zzso girls demonstrated higher zzso levels than obese girls, whereas there were no significant differences for zzso There were no significant differences after zzso for family history of zzso There was a modest relationship between increased zzso levels and decreased insulin zzso 

The observed elevated circulating zzso zzso among zzso participants may reflect an inflammatory process that has been associated with higher levels of physical fitness in both adults and prepubescent zzso This effect may remain stronger for prepubescent girls, and the mechanism may be attenuated by the hormonal changes that occur with the onset of zzso
