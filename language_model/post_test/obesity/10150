zzso is mainly zzso and zzso by fat cells in proportion to zzso tissue zzso Under zzso conditions, this hormone reduces food intake and increases zzso through interactions with zzso in the central nervous zzso However, transport of zzso into the central nervous system via the zzso barrier is zzso and in obesity the feedback signal to the brain is markedly zzso In recent experiments we have zzso that zzso zzso delivery of zzso reduces food intake in zzso The aim of the present study was to explore the distribution of zzso delivered zzso within brain, blood, and peripheral zzso Application of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso into male zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 per zzso leads to zzso brain zzso zzso 30 zzso after application, with contents in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso F zzso zzso being significantly higher than the brain average zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, contents in the zzso zzso were lower than the brain average, indicating a minor participation of the transport via zzso fluid, which would have favored zzso zzso zzso In experiments employing the application of zzso zzso administered zzso we were able to show that excess blood zzso does not diminish brain zzso of zzso zzso (as indicated by zzso supporting a direct transport from nose to brain by zzso of the zzso zzso This study thus clearly demonstrates a rapid and highly effective transport of zzso from nose to zzso
