zzso zzso tissue zzso is widely recognized as conveying the highest health risk in humans among the currently measurable zzso tissue zzso A recent study indicated that the traditionally measured zzso area at zzso is not the zzso area with the highest correlation with total zzso zzso At present, it is unknown whether the area with the highest correlation is also the most strongly associated with zzso health zzso 

The study aim was to establish which zzso slice zzso are most strongly associated with zzso health risk zzso 

The subjects were a convenience sample of healthy adults who completed zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso The zzso with appropriate adjustments, were examined between individual zzso slice zzso areas and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso insulin and blood zzso 

The sample consisted of 283 healthy men (age zzso zzso years; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 411 women zzso zzso years; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After adjusting for age, race, menopause status, scan position and specific blood analysis laboratory, zzso area at zzso had lower correlations with most zzso risk factors including zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin and blood pressure than zzso volume in both men and zzso The zzso areas 10 and 15 zzso above zzso in men had higher or equal correlations with health risk measures than zzso zzso In women, the zzso area 5 zzso above or below zzso and total zzso volume had similar correlations with health risk zzso 

An appropriately selected single slice zzso area is an equally reliable zzso marker of zzso health risk as total zzso zzso However, in both men and women the zzso slice area at the traditional zzso level is not the best marker of zzso health zzso
