zzso excess promotes visceral obesity and cardiovascular zzso Similar features are found in the highly prevalent zzso syndrome in the absence of high levels of systemic zzso Although elevated activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso within zzso might explain this paradox, the potential role of zzso in zzso is less clear; human zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso cells exhibit zzso activity zzso of zzso probably due to the absence of zzso provision by zzso zzso To clarify the zzso impact of zzso we assessed whether zzso in zzso from zzso (as a representative of visceral zzso zzso and zzso tissue displayed zzso activity in zzso zzso was highly expressed in freshly isolated zzso cells, predominantly in zzso zzso zzso and protein levels were comparable between zzso and zzso zzso in both zzso zzso was an zzso thus zzso zzso in zzso cells, consistent with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was higher in intact zzso zzso cells despite a lower expression of zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso levels than zzso zzso zzso This suggests a novel zzso control over zzso zzso zzso In zzso high-fat zzso obesity was accompanied by increased visceral fat zzso differentiation in zzso but not zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso activity is zzso in mouse zzso zzso where it promotes zzso differentiation and contributes to visceral fat zzso in zzso
