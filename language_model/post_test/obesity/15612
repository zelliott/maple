zzso is an zzso hormone that interacts with a putative zzso in the zzso to regulate body zzso The relationship of zzso to zzso abnormalities associated with obesity together with hormonal and zzso regulation of zzso have not been extensively zzso zzso 116 subjects (62 men and 54 zzso with a wide range of body weight zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso were characterized on a zzso ward with regard to body zzso zzso zzso insulin sensitivity, energy zzso zzso zzso and blood zzso zzso of the subjects had normal zzso tolerance zzso men and 35 zzso and 31 had zzso diabetes zzso (12 men and 19 zzso In both men and women, zzso zzso levels were highly correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso zzso and percent body fat zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso zzso all P zzso However, men exhibited lower zzso levels at any given measure of zzso Compared with those in men, zzso levels rose zzso more rapidly as a function of zzso in women zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso times more rapidly as a function of body fat zzso zzso zzso zzso body zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso body zzso in zzso zzso was associated with insulin resistance zzso zzso zzso P zzso and high waist to hip ratio zzso zzso zzso P zzso only in zzso On the other hand, during the zzso zzso clamp studies, zzso acutely increased zzso zzso zzso only in zzso There was no correlation noted between zzso zzso levels and either resting energy expenditure or zzso zzso in men or women zzso zzso zzso In zzso and multiple zzso models with zzso as the dependent zzso zzso diabetes zzso did not enter the equations at a statistically significant zzso The data indicate that there are important zzso differences in the regulation and action of zzso in zzso zzso zzso levels increase with progressive obesity in both men and zzso However, for any given measure of zzso zzso levels are higher in women than in men, consistent with a state of relative zzso zzso These findings have important implications regarding differences in body composition in men and zzso The observation that serum zzso is not related to energy expenditure rates suggests that zzso regulates body fat predominantly by altering eating behavior rather than zzso
