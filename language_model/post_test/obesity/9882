zzso studies associate cancer with zzso but the zzso connections remain zzso In this study, we show that obesity zzso tumor growth in mice irrespective of concurrent diet, suggesting a direct effect of excess white zzso tissue zzso When transplanted into mice, zzso zzso cells zzso can serve as zzso zzso zzso that promote tumor growth, perhaps helping explain the zzso zzso In developing this hypothesis, we showed that zzso are expanded in obesity and that they traffic from zzso zzso to tumors in several mouse models of zzso zzso a comparison of circulating and zzso cell populations in lean, and obese mice revealed that cancer zzso a zzso increase of zzso frequency in the systemic zzso We obtained evidence that zzso mobilized in this way can be recruited into tumors, where they can be incorporated into blood vessels as zzso and they can differentiate into zzso in an zzso zzso zzso this evidence, we found that increased tumor zzso zzso by changes in tumor vascular zzso and a zzso increase in vascular zzso was associated with zzso zzso and elevated proliferation of neighboring zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso recruited from zzso zzso tissue can be recruited by tumors to zzso the supportive properties of the tumor zzso
