High energy intake and, specifically, high dietary fat intake challenge the zzso metabolism and correlate with many zzso disorders such as obesity and zzso However, dietary restriction zzso is known to prevent the development of zzso zzso The current western diets are highly enriched in fat, and it is as yet unclear whether DR on a certain high-fat zzso diet elicits similar beneficial effects on zzso In this research, we report that zzso improves zzso health of mice compared with mice receiving the same diet on an ad zzso basis zzso Already after five weeks of zzso the serum levels of cholesterol and zzso were significantly decreased in zzso mice, whereas their zzso sensitivity and serum zzso levels were zzso The body weight and measured serum parameters remained stable in the following 7 weeks of zzso zzso zzso zzso To understand the molecular events associated with this adaptation, we analyzed gene expression in white zzso tissue zzso with whole zzso zzso zzso strongly influenced gene expression in zzso in total, zzso genes were zzso expressed between both groups of mice, with a major role for genes involved in zzso metabolism and zzso zzso This was confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse zzso and substantiated by increase in zzso density in zzso of zzso zzso These results provide new insights in the zzso flexibility of dietary restricted animals and suggest the development of zzso zzso
