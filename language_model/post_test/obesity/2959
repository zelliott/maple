The influence of the zzso zzso of lean and genetically obese zzso mice on insulin zzso from zzso pancreatic zzso of lean and zzso mice has been studied by zzso the zzso of these animals in series with the isolated zzso and measuring insulin zzso at zzso intervals over a period of 60 zzso It has been shown that the zzso zzso of both lean and obese mice stimulate insulin zzso from lean mouse zzso but not from obese mouse zzso The maximum stimulation occurs in the first 10 zzso and with the lean mouse zzso returns to the zzso level in about 20 zzso whereas with the obese mouse zzso insulin zzso is about double that from the control zzso even after 40 zzso A concentration of pure zzso zzso equivalent to about three times the amount released from the zzso zzso under the experimental conditions used, caused only a small stimulation of insulin zzso zzso interpretations of these findings and further lines of investigation are zzso
