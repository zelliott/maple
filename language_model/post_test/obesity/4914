zzso is a highly zzso and genetically complex trait with hundreds of potential zzso zzso An zzso of zzso zzso progeny between the zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse strains was generated to identify quantitative trait zzso zzso that are involved in the weight of four fat zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Sex and lean body weight were treated as zzso in the analysis of these fat zzso This analysis zzso genetic effects related to overall body size from those influencing the zzso of a zzso We identified multiple significant zzso zzso zzso associated with increased lean body weight and individual fat pad weights are contributed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso are distinct from these body size zzso and zzso zzso are contributed by the zzso zzso An extended network of zzso zzso is also zzso A zzso on zzso 19 is the center of a network of eight interacting zzso zzso 4 is the center of six, and zzso 17 the center of four interacting zzso We conclude that interacting networks of multiple genes characterize the regulation of fat pad zzso and body zzso zzso patterns and a zzso approach were used to generate hypotheses regarding the identity of the genes and pathways underlying the zzso
