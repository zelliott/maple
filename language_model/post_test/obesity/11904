zzso is associated with an increase in zzso tissue mass due to an imbalance between high dietary energy intake and low physical zzso however, the type of dietary protein may contribute to its zzso The aim of the present work was to study the effect of soy protein versus zzso on white zzso tissue zzso zzso and the zzso functions of zzso in rats with zzso zzso The results showed that rats fed a Soy zzso zzso zzso zzso diet gained less weight and had lower serum zzso concentration than rats fed a zzso zzso zzso zzso diet, despite similar energy zzso zzso studies indicated that rats fed the Soy zzso diet had significantly smaller zzso than those fed the zzso zzso diet, and this was associated with a lower zzso zzso zzso acid synthesis in isolated zzso was reduced by the amount of fat consumed but not by the type of protein zzso zzso of genes of fatty acid zzso increased in zzso tissue of rats fed Soy zzso zzso analysis revealed that Soy protein consumption modified the expression of 90 genes involved in zzso functions and inflammatory response in zzso zzso Network analysis showed that the expression of zzso was regulated by the type of dietary protein and it was identified as a central regulator of the expression of zzso metabolism genes in zzso zzso Thus, soy maintains the size and zzso functions of zzso tissue through zzso zzso zzso zzso and global changes in gene zzso
