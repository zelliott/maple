To evaluate feasibility and clinical outcomes of zzso performed through zzso access in a large series of consecutive zzso 

All patients submitted to zzso conservative surgery for zzso zzso through an initial zzso approach zzso zzso skin zzso were zzso zzso zzso findings, surgical technique, rate of zzso enlargement, operative time, surgical complications and length of recovery were the main analyzed zzso 

One hundred and zzso out of 212 patients experienced zzso approach for zzso zzso In 97 zzso multiple zzso were present zzso zzso The size of the largest zzso ranged from 2 to 19 zzso zzso zzso In 161 zzso patients zzso was ended through zzso access with a mean length of skin incision of zzso zzso zzso The correlation between severe obesity and zzso enlargement was statistically significant zzso The mean operative time was 57 zzso zzso One zzso zzso injury was successfully managed through zzso zzso zzso or vascular complications never zzso zzso blood loss was not significant except in three cases zzso requiring zzso zzso complications were observed in nine patients zzso The median zzso stay in uncomplicated patients was zzso days zzso 

Our report supports the wide application of zzso zzso and suggests that more than zzso of women with fit zzso zzso could be successfully managed in this way with a failure rate of zzso in eligible zzso The main criteria of minimal invasive surgery seem to be by zzso zzso which should be considered a valid option for zzso zzso conservative zzso
