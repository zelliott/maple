The systemic treatment with zzso inhibitor has been shown to result in weight reduction and zzso tissue loss in various models of zzso To verify the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso against zzso we evaluated zzso peripheral and central zzso zzso zzso was injected zzso zzso for 7 days in various animal models and zzso zzso in zzso nucleus zzso zzso mice, zzso mice, and normal zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso after zzso injection was evaluated in ARC zzso mice and normal zzso A zzso taste zzso zzso was performed using zzso zzso zzso as a positive control agent in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso fatty zzso zzso As a result, 7 days of zzso zzso injection reduced the cumulative food intake and the body weight significantly in both treated obese zzso zzso zzso zzso g vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decrease vs zzso zzso zzso zzso in treated zzso rat versus control zzso zzso P zzso zzso and non-obese zzso zzso and zzso fat zzso and the size of zzso were significantly decreased in treated zzso A single zzso injection decreased food intake and body weight in ARC zzso mice and zzso mice but not in normal zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso were not altered by single zzso zzso zzso also induced a zzso zzso comparable with zzso injection, which is a commonly used agent to produce a zzso In conclusion, zzso causes significant body weight and appetite reduction, possibly by decreasing zzso directly and inducing central zzso which is partly explained by a zzso These results should be carefully verified to assess the utility of zzso as an zzso zzso
