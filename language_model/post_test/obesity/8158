The intake of a Western diet enriched in animal fat has been shown to be a major risk factor for Type 2 diabetes and zzso Previous zzso studies have indicated that these conditions may be triggered by the zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, data are lacking in this regard from both humans and zzso zzso 

Here we have investigated the relationship between plasma zzso and zzso syndrome in zzso zzso fed a high-fat and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We investigated this relationship in zzso of monkeys fed a zzso for a period of 8 months to 5 zzso Animals were classified as control, zzso or diabetic based on zzso plasma parameters and insulin zzso 

zzso treatment produced significant increases in body weight and body fat and also resulted in a decline in insulin zzso In parallel to the reduction in insulin sensitivity, significant increases in both plasma zzso and zzso levels were observed, which further increased as animals progressed to the diabetic zzso Plasma levels of the rare zzso zzso zzso a marker of increased zzso flux through zzso zzso zzso zzso were also elevated in both zzso and diabetic zzso Furthermore, plasma zzso levels were significantly elevated in diabetic zzso which may indicate a shift in zzso zzso selectivity from zzso to zzso or zzso In contrast, branch chain zzso acids were unchanged in zzso zzso zzso and only plasma zzso levels were elevated in diabetic zzso 

Together, these data indicate that zzso zzso de zzso synthesis of zzso in zzso zzso and that increased production of plasma zzso is significantly correlated with the decline in insulin zzso
