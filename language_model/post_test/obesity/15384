We investigated the regulation of the zzso expression of the insulin zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso three major actors of insulin action, in skeletal muscle from 10 healthy lean volunteers, 13 obese patients with Type II zzso diabetes zzso and 7 zzso obese zzso The in zzso regulation by insulin was studied using a zzso zzso zzso zzso There were no differences in the zzso zzso of the three zzso in skeletal muscle between zzso zzso infusion produced a twofold reduction in insulin zzso zzso zzso expression in the three groups zzso In contrast, insulin increased zzso zzso expression in muscle from zzso subjects zzso in lean and zzso in obese, zzso but this effect was totally impaired in Type II diabetic patients zzso zzso A similar zzso in insulin action on zzso zzso expression was observed in abdominal subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso zzso in lean and zzso zzso in obese and zzso zzso in Type II diabetic zzso The lack of action of insulin on zzso zzso in diabetic subjects was probably not due to a deleterious effect of zzso since improvement of the zzso control for 10 days did not restore the response in muscle or in zzso zzso This study provides evidence for a zzso in the regulation by insulin of zzso gene expression in Type II diabetic patients, thus reinforcing the concept that zzso at the gene expression might be involved in the zzso of Type II zzso
