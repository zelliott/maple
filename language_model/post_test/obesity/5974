Estimates generated using zzso indicated that the clearance of zzso was influenced by zzso age and daily dosage of zzso The final zzso model was zzso zzso zzso zzso * zzso * zzso 65 ) * zzso 25) * zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso * zzso where zzso is total body zzso zzso is total body weight zzso zzso zzso is daily dosage of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 for patient was 65 years old or over and 0 otherwise, zzso zzso zzso 1 for patient was 25 zzso or over and 0 otherwise and zzso is apparent volume of zzso The clearance of zzso decreased significantly by zzso with a zzso higher than 25 zzso The clearance of zzso also decreased significantly by zzso when patient age was more than 65 zzso
