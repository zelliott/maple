The development of new technologies to isolate and identify microbial zzso has markedly increased our understanding of the role of zzso in health and zzso The idea, first proposed as part of the hygiene hypothesis, that environmental microbes influence the zzso zzso of the immune system in early life, has now been considerably extended and zzso The abundant zzso present in zzso surfaces, especially the gut, is actively selected by the host through complex zzso systems that respond zzso depending on the molecular patterns presented to zzso zzso zzso mice are more likely to develop allergic airway inflammation and show zzso in normal motor control and zzso These effects can be reversed by zzso microbial zzso but remain unchanged if zzso occurs in zzso What emerges from these recent studies is the discovery of a complex, major early environmental zzso of lifetime human zzso To change the natural course of zzso zzso and other chronic inflammatory conditions, active manipulation of the extensive zzso zzso and zzso zzso present in zzso surfaces may be required, specifically during the developing zzso zzso the human zzso and adapting it to our health needs may be a challenge akin to, but far more complex than, the one faced by humanity when a few dozen species of plants and animals were zzso during the transition between zzso and sedentary societies after the end of the zzso zzso
