To compare the performance of zzso zzso zzso and oral zzso tolerance testing zzso in screening for diabetes zzso in obese zzso 

A consecutive series of zzso zzso female, 83 zzso obese zzso mass zzso 30 zzso zzso aged zzso zzso zzso years, was studied with zzso and zzso The association of categories of zzso tolerance zzso and impaired zzso tolerance zzso and zzso zzso zzso and impaired zzso zzso zzso with hypertension and zzso were also zzso 

zzso of diabetes and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso had a sensitivity of zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and zzso in those above the zzso the sensitivity for diabetes would have been zzso with a positive zzso value of zzso but zzso of cases of zzso would not have been zzso Patients with impaired zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso showed lower insulin sensitivity and impaired beta cell function, and a weaker association to zzso when compared to zzso 

zzso zzso zzso does not show a sufficient sensitivity for the screening of diabetes in obese zzso zzso zzso zzso has a satisfactory sensitivity for diabetes, but not for zzso zzso has different zzso features than zzso and cannot be assumed to have the same zzso value of zzso
