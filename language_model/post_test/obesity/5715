zzso obese zzso rats are zzso zzso and zzso In order to investigate zzso mechanisms underlying zzso in these animals, zzso metabolism and turnover were studied in discrete zzso zzso known to participate in the control of feeding zzso zzso studies in genetically obese zzso rats and in their lean zzso controls were zzso by investigating feeding behavioral responses to the acute administration of zzso (15 and 30 zzso zzso an alpha zzso zzso and to zzso zzso 1, 2 and 5 zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rats had significantly lower zzso of zzso acid, the main zzso zzso of zzso in the nucleus zzso zzso and in the nucleus zzso zzso when compared to their lean zzso zzso The rate of zzso of zzso after zzso zzso was reduced in the zzso nucleus zzso nucleus zzso and nucleus zzso of the obese zzso No differences were observed in zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso acid between obese and lean zzso rats in the brain areas zzso However, the rate of zzso of zzso was lower in the zzso and in the median zzso of the obese zzso The feeding behavioral tests showed significantly zzso zzso responses to zzso in obese zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was similar in both zzso It is concluded that zzso activity is reduced in obese zzso rats, particularly in the zzso which plays a key role in the control of feeding zzso The reduced zzso activity may be associated with enhanced alpha zzso feeding responses in obese zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
