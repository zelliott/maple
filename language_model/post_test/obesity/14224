Current guidelines recommend measurement of both zzso and waist circumference zzso in individuals with zzso between zzso and zzso zzso We investigated the relative contributions of zzso and zzso toward identifying risk of adverse vascular events in a community-based zzso 

We evaluated zzso Study participants zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using pooled zzso zzso to assess the incremental zzso utility of zzso in predicting risk of a first cardiovascular disease zzso event in the three zzso categories zzso zzso zzso overweight, 25 to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and to assess the incremental zzso utility of zzso and zzso separately for predicting risk of a first cardiovascular zzso 

On follow-up (16 zzso 430 participants zzso zzso had experienced a first zzso zzso In overweight women, but not in overweight men, larger zzso was found to be an independent predictor of zzso zzso zzso (in women, zzso odds ratio zzso per zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in men adjusted OR per zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In obese individuals and in those with normal zzso zzso was not associated independently with incident zzso When zzso and zzso were analyzed separately for predicting risk of a first cardiovascular event, the c statistics associated with the multivariable zzso models incorporating zzso zzso zzso were nearly identical in men and zzso 

zzso of zzso aids identification of vascular risk among overweight zzso Among normal weight or obese women and men zzso of zzso zzso zzso did not appear to substantially add to prediction of risk of vascular zzso
