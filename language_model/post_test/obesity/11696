In man, circulating zzso levels are increased with obesity and are regulated by a complex of zzso feeding and zzso zzso zzso and precise methods to zzso circulating serum free zzso zzso zzso are needed for zzso and clinical zzso We developed a zzso zzso zzso to measure human zzso in zzso The detection limit was zzso zzso The recovery of zzso added to serum was zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of variation zzso ranged from zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso respectively, and the zzso had an overall recovery rate for serial dilution in the range of zzso zzso Measured serum zzso zzso in 201 adults correlated zzso zzso directly with body mass index zzso zzso particularly when results were separated by gender zzso zzso for male, zzso zzso for female, zzso We conclude that this zzso zzso zzso is accurate for measuring zzso in human zzso
