zzso determined zzso involving zzso and zzso zzso have focused attention on the four zzso zzso zzso as primary sources of zzso and zzso zzso All four zzso cell groups contain zzso zzso To determine which of these cell groups normally mediates the effects of zzso on food intake and body weight gain, we injected zzso zzso into each nucleus and determined the zzso effects of disruption and zzso to zzso injected zzso zzso injections of zzso in zzso rats decreased food intake during the dark period, but not during the light zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso all resulted in zzso zzso by contrast, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity to zzso on feeding and body weight zzso Although rats with ARC and zzso zzso were obese, they were still capable of reducing caloric efficiency over the 5 days of study and increasing zzso protein content in zzso brown zzso zzso zzso efficiency and zzso protein content were unchanged in rats with zzso and zzso zzso Finally, the slope of the relationship between zzso and zzso white zzso tissue was increased in rats with zzso zzso and abolished in rats with ARC zzso Thus, zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso produced obesity via separate zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso cell groups, each with a different role in energy balance, are all necessary for normal zzso zzso
