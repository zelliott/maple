The role of skeletal muscle in zzso zzso zzso is not well zzso Here we show that zzso zzso a newly identified regulator of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is necessary for zzso zzso When challenged to acute cold (4 zzso zzso mice were not able to maintain their core body temperature zzso zzso and developed zzso zzso zzso of brown zzso tissue and functional zzso of zzso allowed us to highlight the role of muscle in zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso background fully restored zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is the basis for zzso heat zzso We show that zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso leak is an important mechanism for zzso heat zzso Here we present data to suggest that zzso can continue to interact with zzso in the presence of zzso which can promote zzso of the zzso pump and cause futile zzso We further show that loss of zzso zzso mice to zzso zzso which suggests that zzso zzso is recruited during zzso zzso These data collectively suggest that zzso is an important zzso of muscle zzso and zzso energy zzso
