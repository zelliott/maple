It is well known that sometimes it is difficult to distinguish between type 1 and 2 diabetes zzso using clinical criteria, in subjects with disease onset relatively early in adult zzso The measurement of C zzso level and of zzso markers may represent important additional tools for establishing the correct zzso The aim of the study is to assess the trend of zzso C zzso in patients with clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and to relate it to the type of treatment, the body weight and the zzso for pancreatic zzso 

we studied a group of 268 patients with type 2 diabetes, aged between 30 and 50 years, with a diabetes duration of less than 5 zzso In all patients, we measured zzso C zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso against zzso acid zzso zzso the body mass index and recorded the current zzso zzso 

Based on zzso C zzso value, diabetic subjects fell under 3 zzso a) low C zzso zzso zzso zzso b) normal C zzso zzso zzso zzso and c) high C zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients with low C zzso were treated more often with insulin, while those in high C zzso group received more often zzso A direct correlation between C zzso and body weight was zzso Mean C zzso was lower in patients positive for at least one pancreatic zzso compared to those who were negative for zzso 

Low zzso C zzso can be considered criterion for transferring the patients, initially diagnosed as type 2 diabetes, in the type 1 diabetes zzso
