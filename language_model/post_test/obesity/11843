Little is known about how diet and energy metabolism interact in determination of lifespan under ad zzso zzso From 12 weeks of age until death, male and female zzso zzso and transgenic zzso mice with increased skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso were fed one of three different zzso diets differing in zzso zzso control zzso and two high-fat zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Compared to control and zzso zzso feeding rapidly and significantly increased body fat content in zzso Median lifespan of zzso was decreased by zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso significantly increased insulin resistance zzso of zzso from 24 weeks on compared to zzso zzso mice had lower lean body mass and increased energy zzso insulin sensitivity, and maximum lifespan zzso compared to zzso They showed a delayed development of obesity on zzso but reached similar maximum zzso as zzso zzso median lifespan was only slightly reduced by zzso zzso and unaffected by zzso compared to zzso zzso analyses showed that decreased longevity was more strongly linked to a high rate of fat gain than to zzso zzso Furthermore, insulin resistance was zzso and zzso energy expenditure was positively correlated with zzso We conclude that zzso dietary zzso ratios strongly affected obesity development, zzso zzso and zzso zzso that skeletal muscle zzso zzso alleviated the zzso effects of high-fat zzso and zzso that early imbalances in energy zzso leading to increased insulin resistance are zzso for a decreased zzso
