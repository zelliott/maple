zzso children are predisposed to left zzso zzso zzso and cardiac zzso We evaluated zzso function of obese children with conventional zzso and tissue zzso imaging zzso and correlated these with zzso serum zzso zzso and insulin zzso 

Thirty obese children were examined by conventional zzso and TDI and compared with an zzso control zzso In the obese children, zzso serum zzso zzso and insulin levels were zzso 

zzso and zzso function of the zzso was normal in obese zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso relative wall thickness zzso and zzso zzso diameter were significantly greater in obese zzso The early to late relaxation zzso ratio zzso determined by TDI for the right zzso and zzso zzso zzso were significantly lower in the obese group, zzso and zzso correlated with body mass index zzso In the obese group, zzso and zzso zzso wall thickness correlated with insulin, very low density zzso and zzso zzso However, we failed to show this correlation when these zzso were zzso to zzso 

Left zzso zzso as evidenced by increased zzso mass, was present in obese zzso Higher zzso insulin, very low density zzso and zzso levels were associated with zzso zzso TDI revealed zzso changes in zzso function of the right zzso and zzso
