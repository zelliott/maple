We reviewed our experience with 3 operative techniques for abdominal zzso to determine differences in complication rates and levels of patient zzso 

This retrospective study included 92 consecutive patients who underwent abdominal zzso over a zzso zzso Patients underwent one of 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso incisions with minimal undermining zzso zzso zzso or zzso incisions with extensive undermining zzso zzso zzso zzso patient satisfaction surveys were zzso 

Median zzso weight was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients zzso had a previous gastric zzso Median body mass index zzso was 38 zzso zzso zzso Median follow-up for complications was zzso week zzso zzso Forty of 92 patients zzso suffered wound zzso The zzso rate was zzso zzso complication rates were higher among zzso patients zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was a trend towards increased complications among those with higher zzso and zzso zzso There was not a significant relationship between operative technique and overall complication zzso Mean length of follow-up for patient questionnaire completion was 2 years, 11 months zzso zzso zzso Eighty-one percent of those responding to the mailed questionnaire were satisfied with their operative zzso There were no statistically significant differences between the technique used and patient satisfaction zzso zzso zzso repair was performed in zzso of patients without increased wound zzso 

Patients were satisfied with the results of their zzso although complications were zzso Higher zzso larger zzso size, and hypertension were correlated with increased complication zzso The minimal zzso extensive zzso and the zzso zzso techniques result in similar patient satisfaction rates and complication zzso
