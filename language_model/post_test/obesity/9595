The quantitative relation between insulin binding to circulating zzso in zzso and zzso tolerance in obese children in zzso is zzso zzso obese children and 11 healthy control children participated in this zzso The oral zzso tolerance test zzso was performed by giving them zzso zzso zzso of body zzso orally in the morning, and the binding of zzso insulin to circulating zzso in zzso was measured prior to zzso The zzso tolerance expressed by zzso zzso zzso zzso the sum of the plasma zzso zzso sugar zzso values at zzso was significantly correlated with the degree of overweight zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso and more highly with zzso zzso zzso per zzso the sum of zzso insulin zzso values at zzso zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso zzso binding to zzso in zzso zzso zzso was zzso correlated with the degree of overweight zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was zzso correlated significantly with insulin binding to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso These data suggest that the decrease of insulin receptors might be one cause for the impairment of the zzso tolerance associated with obesity in zzso
