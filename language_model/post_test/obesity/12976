We have zzso investigated zzso stress, zzso tolerance and zzso insulin responses in the obese zzso zzso a widely used model of insulin zzso The plasma level of the zzso zzso product zzso zzso a sensitive in zzso marker of zzso stress, was elevated approximately zzso in zzso old obese relative to zzso zzso lean zzso zzso zzso of the diet with vitamin E (as zzso zzso zzso zzso for 4 weeks, reduced plasma zzso zzso and zzso reversed zzso zzso in the obese zzso rat without worsening zzso zzso We therefore provide evidence of zzso stress, measured as elevated plasma zzso zzso for the first time in the obese zzso rat which now provides a rationale for the beneficial effects of antioxidants on insulin action previously reported in this model of insulin zzso
