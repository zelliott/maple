zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso function determines tissue sensitivity to zzso and strongly affects the development of type 2 diabetes and zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso mediates zzso steroid exposure to mouse liver zzso by zzso zzso of zzso and is zzso dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso improves insulin intolerance and zzso Here, we evaluated the potential beneficial effects of zzso inhibitor zzso zzso in zzso obese zzso and zzso mice by examining the possible influence of zzso on the expression of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and in zzso in zzso Treatment of zzso mice with zzso markedly reduced zzso zzso zzso levels and reduced weight gain, zzso and insulin zzso The reduction of zzso zzso gene expression was accompanied by zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso activity and zzso in the zzso Moreover, zzso treatment also suppressed the expression of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and improved zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, the treatment of primary cultures of zzso with increasing zzso of zzso led to a zzso zzso of zzso zzso levels, which correlated with the suppression of both zzso and zzso activity and their gene zzso zzso of zzso to primary zzso also resulted in suppression of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso exerts some of its beneficial effects, at least in part, by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
