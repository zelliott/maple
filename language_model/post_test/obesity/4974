zzso studies suggest that the fatty acid zzso composition of zzso in skeletal muscle cell membrane may zzso insulin sensitivity in zzso We examined the impact of a zzso low-fat dietary intervention on membrane zzso composition and insulin zzso DESIGN Muscle membrane zzso profiles were determined in muscle zzso zzso zzso from 21 obese subjects before and after 6 months of dietary zzso Diet instructions emphasized low intake of zzso of marine origin by recommending lean fish and prohibiting fatty fish and fish oil zzso zzso resistance was estimated by the zzso model assessment zzso zzso The mean weight loss was zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso decreased from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased 51% zzso zzso mainly due to a zzso increase zzso in zzso zzso Changes in zzso correlated significantly with changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and waist circumference zzso zzso A zzso linear zzso analysis that included changes in weight, fat mass, waist zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicated that zzso and zzso zzso were independent zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso low-fat dietary intervention zzso increased incorporation of zzso zzso and reduced zzso in skeletal muscle membrane zzso of obese subjects, a setting that may impact on insulin zzso
