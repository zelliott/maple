High dietary fat intake and obesity may increase zzso to certain forms of zzso To study the interactions of dietary fat, zzso and zzso zzso cancer, we created a population of zzso mice zzso obesity zzso and the zzso zzso We fed the zzso mice either a zzso or a zzso diet and measured growth, body zzso age at zzso tumor zzso tumor number and severity, and formation of pulmonary zzso zzso zzso across the zzso facilitated analyses of zzso and zzso zzso diet interaction zzso Here we describe development of the zzso population zzso zzso zzso which resulted from a cross between the zzso obesity model zzso and zzso zzso effects of diet on growth and body zzso and zzso and zzso zzso diet and/or gender interaction effects for growth and zzso zzso We identified 38 zzso for body composition traits that were significant at the zzso zzso level, likely representing nine distinct zzso after accounting for zzso zzso zzso zzso diet and/or gender interactions were present at 15 of these zzso indicating that such interactions play a significant role in defining the genetic architecture of complex traits such as body weight and zzso
