Recently, a zzso of obesity characterized as a metabolically healthy but obese zzso individual has been zzso However, limited data are available on these zzso zzso zzso and inflammatory profiles, and the effect of weight loss on these zzso We investigated zzso and inflammatory markers in zzso women to determine the effects of a zzso weight loss on those zzso 

One hundred and zzso zzso Korean women participated for 12 weeks in a clinical intervention study involving a 300 zzso intake zzso The subjects were divided into two groups: zzso and metabolically abnormal obese zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and oxidized zzso zzso zzso as well as blood zzso zzso and insulin zzso were determined at baseline and after weight zzso 

At zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso and oxidized LDL zzso levels were significantly lower in the zzso group than in the zzso zzso zzso fat at zzso zzso and visceral fat at zzso zzso were significantly lower in the zzso group than in the zzso zzso The treatment induced weight loss averaging zzso of initial body weight, and the degree of weight loss between the two groups was zzso zzso fat at zzso and zzso was reduced from its initial values by zzso and zzso respectively, after weight zzso The levels of zzso zzso and oxidized LDL zzso were significantly reduced in the zzso group after the zzso weight loss, whereas these effects were not seen in the zzso zzso 

Our results showed that zzso individuals exhibited lower visceral fat zzso and more favorable zzso and inflammatory states than zzso zzso After a zzso weight loss program, significant reductions in blood zzso zzso and oxidized LDL levels were observed in zzso zzso However, there was no measurable effect of weight loss on zzso profiles and inflammation in zzso individuals, indicating differing effects of weight loss on these markers between zzso and zzso zzso
