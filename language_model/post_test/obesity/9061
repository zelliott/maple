Clinical trials of zzso zzso zzso and zzso type zzso zzso zzso have demonstrated a significant reduction in zzso zzso and zzso diabetes zzso This finding raises the question on the zzso role of the zzso system zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in the circulation but also on the tissue level, suggests profound changes in the regulation of this system in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and molecular mechanisms that link the zzso with the zzso zzso include interactions between insulin and zzso type zzso zzso effects that change zzso partition to zzso such as skeletal muscle and zzso zzso zzso of zzso which may limit the storage capacity of zzso tissue and allows zzso zzso storage which leads to zzso influence on zzso zzso and influence on insulin zzso from pancreatic zzso Most of these mechanisms are linked with decreased insulin zzso zzso experimental evidence on these possible mechanisms, however, is rare, and several zzso remain, which are partly due to species differences between zzso models and zzso Thus, data from clinical trials clearly suggest that the zzso plays an important role for the zzso of the zzso Syndrome, but the molecular mechanisms are not understood very well at zzso
