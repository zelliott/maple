zzso zzso zzso zzso is a common human zzso that affects cellular zzso status and may lower flux into zzso pathways of zzso zzso zzso stress may zzso systemic zzso tolerance and zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso zzso zzso systemic zzso dysfunction by increasing zzso stress but in zzso prevents zzso zzso stress and zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice received a standard zzso diet, a zzso diet to induce obesity zzso or a zzso zzso After 31 zzso zzso increased zzso and body mass compared with the zzso diet but to a greater extent in zzso than zzso mice (24 and zzso lower, zzso zzso free fatty acids were increased by zzso and zzso by zzso in zzso mice, but not in zzso mice, by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso tolerance or the increased insulin levels seen in zzso zzso There was no zzso hypertension or cardiac dysfunction in either mouse zzso However, zzso zzso increased zzso activity by zzso and blunted markers of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso and advanced zzso end product zzso These results reveal a complex interplay between zzso zzso effects and zzso zzso where zzso zzso decreases weight gain and zzso with zzso but zzso serum free fatty zzso without affecting zzso zzso On the other hand, it modestly suppressed indexes of zzso flux into zzso pathways in zzso suggesting potential protective zzso
