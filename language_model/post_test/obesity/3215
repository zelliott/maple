Few studies have investigated the prospective associations between diet or drinking patterns and abdominal zzso we therefore investigated whether food and zzso groups or patterns predicted zzso changes in waist circumference zzso and whether these associations were independent of concurrent changes in zzso as a measure of general zzso The subjects were zzso middle-aged men and women with repeated zzso of dietary zzso zzso and zzso from 1982 to zzso zzso from ten food groups and from coffee, tea, wine, beer and spirits were assessed; zzso food factors were identified by factor zzso Multiple linear zzso analyses were done before and after adjustment for concurrent changes in zzso A high intake of potatoes seemed to prevent gain in zzso for men, while a high intake of refined bread was associated with gain in zzso for zzso The association persisted for refined bread, but not for potatoes, after adjustment for concurrent zzso zzso Among women, but not men, high zzso of beer and spirits were associated with gain in zzso in both zzso A high intake of coffee for women and moderate to high intake of tea for men were associated with gain in zzso but the associations were weakened, especially for women, after adjustment for zzso zzso None of the food factors was associated with zzso zzso Based on the present study, we conclude that very few food items and no food patterns seem to predict changes in zzso whereas high zzso of beer and spirits among women, and moderate to high tea intake among men, may promote gain in zzso
