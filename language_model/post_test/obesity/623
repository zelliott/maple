zzso acid zzso were determined in 15 zzso and 61 zzso subjects with the aid of zzso acid and zzso zzso The diet was standardized and of natural zzso The total zzso acid formation was within normal limits in patients with zzso types zzso and zzso On the average the production of zzso acid zzso represented less than 50% of the total zzso acid synthesis in both zzso The corresponding value recorded for the controls was zzso zzso The synthesis of C in zzso type zzso was significantly below zzso Of the 27 patients with the type IV pattern, 18 had a synthesis of C and C + zzso acid zzso that exceeded the upper range recorded for the zzso In these subjects the C formation represented zzso of the total zzso acid zzso Similar findings were also encountered in the five patients with the type V zzso pattern zzso The zzso acid pool size of the 11 patients with zzso type IV, who had been zzso or suffered from zzso was 900 zzso smaller on the average than that of the other subjects with the same type of zzso However, the pool size in the former subjects still tended to be higher than that of the control subjects without evidence of gallbladder zzso In all groups of subjects the formation of zzso acids tended to be higher in the male than in the female zzso zzso acid synthesis showed no linear correlation to actual body weight, relative body weight, or body surface zzso A moderate weight reduction in five patients (one with type zzso and four with type IV zzso was followed by a 50% reduction of the C and CD zzso
