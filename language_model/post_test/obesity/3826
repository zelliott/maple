To test the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (the rate of zzso rise before zzso as a predictor for zzso after radical zzso in the context of patient obesity as measured by body mass index zzso 

The rates of zzso zzso were examined among 215 patients who underwent radical zzso between 1992 and zzso zzso zzso rates as a function of zzso zzso 2 zzso or less versus greater than 2 zzso were compared in two groups: zzso patients zzso to overweight, zzso less than 30 zzso and obese patients zzso to severely obese, zzso 30 zzso or zzso 

A zzso zzso greater than 2 zzso was associated with higher zzso rates after radical zzso compared with a zzso of 2 zzso or less, with zzso zzso survival rates of zzso versus zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was independently significant on zzso analysis, along with biopsy zzso score, percent positive cores, and zzso In this study zzso of patients were zzso zzso zzso zzso greater than 2 zzso was associated with higher zzso rates in zzso patients zzso zzso zzso but not in obese patients zzso zzso zzso The two zzso groups did not differ with respect to any zzso zzso patients with slowly rising zzso zzso 2 zzso or less) fared just as poorly as zzso patients with rapidly rising zzso zzso greater than 2 zzso zzso was independently associated with higher zzso zzso 

zzso zzso greater than 2 zzso was associated with a higher risk of zzso after radical zzso but its clinical usefulness might be limited to zzso zzso zzso zzso higher zzso rates, regardless of other zzso factors including zzso zzso
