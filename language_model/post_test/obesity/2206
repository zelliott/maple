zzso within zzso 2 of the zzso zzso which encodes zzso zzso 1 zzso have been associated with addiction, zzso and brain volume zzso We used comparative zzso to identify a zzso zzso sequence zzso in zzso 2 of the zzso gene that had been zzso for 310 million zzso The zzso of zzso zzso acted as an zzso in zzso and zzso root zzso cells and responded to zzso zzso through the zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso However, zzso was significantly more active in zzso and zzso root zzso cells but, significantly, and in contrast to zzso was highly active in zzso cells where it also responded strongly to zzso of zzso zzso zzso is in strong linkage zzso with two other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso that have been associated with addiction, obesity zzso and reduced zzso white matter volumes in schizophrenia patients as a result of zzso misuse zzso Considering their high linkage zzso and the increased response of zzso to zzso signaling when compared with zzso it is possible that the functional effects of the different zzso of zzso may play a role in the conditions associated with zzso and zzso Further analysis of the different zzso of zzso may lead to a greater understanding of the role of zzso gene zzso in these conditions as well as chronic inflammatory zzso
