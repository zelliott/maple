The zzso responses of ten lean and ten moderately obese women to food, exercise, and food plus exercise were measured using open circuit zzso for five minutes every half hour for four hours under six conditions: during five minutes of bicycle exercise at a workload of 300 zzso with and without eating a 910 zzso mixed zzso cycling at a workload just below the zzso threshold with and without zzso and at rest with and without zzso Over the four-hour period, the zzso effect of food at rest was similar for the lean and obese groups: 50 zzso and 47 zzso zzso Eating before exercise increased the exercise zzso rate by zzso for the lean women and by zzso for the obese women zzso less than zzso Exercise zzso the zzso effect of food for the lean women but nor for the obese zzso the zzso effect of food was zzso times greater during exercise than at rest for the lean group, but only zzso times greater for the obese women zzso less than zzso This reduced response to the combined stimulus of food plus exercise may constitute a subtle zzso factor associated with zzso
