Nutrition in the first weeks of life may program disease risk in zzso We examined the influence of initial infant feeding on zzso risk factors in zzso 

A total of zzso persons born during 1 week in 1958 in England, Scotland, and Wales were zzso periodically from birth into zzso zzso feeding was recorded from a parental questionnaire at 7 years old as never zzso zzso partially or wholly for zzso month, or zzso zzso zzso zzso waist zzso hip zzso zzso zzso body mass zzso blood zzso forced zzso zzso total, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso von zzso zzso and tissue zzso zzso zzso were measured at 44 to 45 years of zzso 

zzso zzso month was associated with reduced waist zzso zzso ratio, von zzso factor, and lower odds of obesity compared with formula feeding after adjustment for birth weight, zzso maternal weight, maternal smoking during pregnancy, socioeconomic position in childhood and adulthood, region of birth, zzso and current smoking zzso zzso feeding status was not associated with other zzso risk factors after adjustment, except for lower zzso and zzso protein levels in zzso 

The inverse associations of zzso zzso month with measures of central obesity and inflammatory markers in the current study are small and of little public health zzso Although there was no substantial long-term protective effect of zzso zzso month on other zzso risk factors in adult life, further studies with zzso data on exclusive zzso are needed to confirm these zzso
