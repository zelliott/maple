In an attempt to identify the genetic basis for zzso to zzso diabetes zzso within the context of zzso we generated 401 genetically obese zzso zzso zzso zzso rats that demonstrated wide variation in multiple zzso measures related to diabetes, including plasma zzso zzso percentage of zzso zzso plasma insulin zzso and pancreatic zzso zzso Using selective zzso zzso scanning approaches, we have identified three quantitative trait zzso zzso on zzso 1 zzso zzso for pancreatic zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso for body mass index and zzso zzso for plasma zzso zzso and zzso 16 zzso zzso for zzso effect on plasma zzso zzso The obese zzso progeny demonstrated sexual zzso for these traits, with increased diabetes zzso in the males appearing at approximately 6 weeks of age, as sexual maturation zzso For each of the zzso the linked zzso demonstrated sexual zzso (more severe affection in zzso The zzso on zzso 1 maps to a region zzso to that previously linked to zzso in studies of diabetes zzso in the zzso zzso zzso which is genetically closely related to the zzso zzso we zzso Several candidate zzso including zzso zzso zzso obesity 1 zzso adult obesity and diabetes zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso map to zzso regions zzso to the zzso region identified on rat zzso zzso
