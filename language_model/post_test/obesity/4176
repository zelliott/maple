Weight loss leads to reduced resting energy expenditure zzso independent of zzso mass zzso and fat mass zzso loss, but the effect of changes in zzso composition is zzso 

We hypothesized that a decrease in zzso adjusted for zzso with weight loss would be partly explained by a disproportionate loss in the high zzso activity component of zzso 

zzso overweight and obese women zzso mass index (in zzso zzso aged zzso y followed a low-calorie diet for zzso zzso zzso zzso Body composition was measured by magnetic resonance imaging, zzso X-ray zzso and a zzso zzso zzso measured by indirect zzso zzso was compared with zzso calculated from detailed zzso analysis zzso by using specific organ zzso rates zzso organ zzso 

Weight loss was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso free zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso heart zzso liver zzso and kidney mass zzso were observed (all P zzso Relative loss in organ mass was significantly higher zzso zzso than was the change in low metabolically active zzso components zzso bone, and residual zzso After weight loss, zzso - zzso decreased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and correlated with the decrease in free zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso Women with high zzso zzso zzso as zzso - zzso zzso zzso had less weight loss and zzso zzso liver, and kidney zzso 

After weight loss, almost 50% of the decrease in zzso was explained by losses in zzso and zzso The zzso in zzso explained by body composition increased to zzso by also considering the weight of individual zzso
