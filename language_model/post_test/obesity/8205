The zzso value of body mass index zzso waist circumference zzso and zzso ratio zzso to define zzso risk is unclear in childhood zzso 

zzso The associations between zzso zzso or zzso and zzso risk markers were analyzed in a zzso data collection of obese zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso were zzso evaluated in zzso patients zzso years, zzso zzso from the zzso zzso Patients zzso 

zzso were correlated with zzso model assessment for insulin resistance, zzso insulin, blood pressure, zzso lipids and zzso acid, applying adjusted zzso models, with age group, zzso stage and gender as zzso 

zzso model assessment for insulin resistance and zzso insulin were most strongly correlated with zzso independent of age group or zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid were most strongly correlated with zzso with stronger associations for zzso zzso between zzso and zzso as well as zzso markers and zzso blood pressure showed only minor zzso The pattern of relationship changed during the course of zzso development with the strongest associations for zzso zzso None of the parameters showed a dependency on zzso that was superior to zzso or zzso 

There is only small additional benefit in using zzso zzso for routine pediatric care in addition to zzso for predicting zzso zzso For all zzso the relationship is strongest during zzso emphasizing that among obese zzso zzso zzso measures zzso and zzso best predict zzso zzso zzso does not seem to be superior to zzso or zzso in predicting zzso or cardiovascular risk related to childhood zzso
