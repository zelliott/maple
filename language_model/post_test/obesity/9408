The common zzso zzso of the fat mass and zzso gene zzso is strongly associated with zzso but the biological function is still zzso We compared the zzso gene expression in subcutaneous zzso tissue and peripheral blood zzso cells zzso between overweight and normal weight zzso We also investigated if zzso levels of zzso in zzso tissue correlated with the zzso or inflammatory markers and zzso levels of genes involved in the response to zzso zzso and cell zzso 

The zzso expression of zzso in zzso tissue was greater in obese than normal weight individuals zzso zzso but there was no difference in zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso levels did not correlate with zzso or inflammatory markers and zzso expression was not influenced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso level correlated positively with gene expression levels of zzso and zzso in subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso p zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso adjusted for zzso and zzso cell zzso 

Altogether, zzso expression appeared not to have a zzso impact on clinical or zzso parameters zzso the zzso zzso The correlations with the genes related to zzso and cell death suggest novel biological activities for zzso
