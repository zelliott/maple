The influence of obesity on the retention of a zzso of zzso was studied in 15 zzso zzso women, 15 obese zzso women zzso above desirable zzso and 27 young men ranging in weight from zzso below to zzso above a desirable zzso The women showed a clear-cut inverse linear correlation between the 72 zzso zzso of zzso and the percent zzso from desirable weight over the entire weight range examined zzso equals 66 minus zzso r equals zzso P less than zzso the average zzso in the 6 most obese women zzso above desirable zzso was 45 plus or minus 11 zzso significantly lower than the values of 65 plus or minus zzso in 15 zzso women zzso less than zzso The obese men showed no correlation whatever between zzso of zzso and relative body zzso the average zzso of the 6 most obese men was 55 plus or minus 7, not significantly different from the value of 56 plus or minus 12 in zzso zzso This sex difference makes untenable the hypothesis previously proposed by others that retention of zzso zzso is obese women zzso were not studied ) is due to simple zzso of zzso in zzso Various alternative possibilities to explain the present data are discussed and it is concluded that a possibility worth examining is that the zzso tissue of women contains specific zzso binding protein zzso zzso while the zzso tissue of men does zzso
