Acute zzso (AP) and chronic zzso zzso share zzso but zzso can be more severe and is associated with a higher rate of zzso We investigated features of zzso that protect against severe zzso The amount of zzso fat zzso is increased in obese patients and zzso is increased in patients with zzso so we studied whether zzso or fat regulate severity of zzso attacks in patients with zzso 

We reviewed records from the University of Pittsburgh Medical zzso Hospital zzso Database zzso for patients with a diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso 23), zzso zzso zzso zzso or both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso samples from these patients and 50 randomly selected controls (no pancreatic disease) were zzso and zzso data were correlated with zzso zzso zzso An zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso system, with or without collagen type I, was used to study the effects of zzso on zzso zzso We studied the effects of zzso fatty acids zzso and zzso on zzso cells in zzso 

zzso of zzso were significantly higher in zzso patients with zzso than in zzso zzso In patients with zzso or zzso areas of zzso were surrounded by significantly more zzso than in controls or patients with zzso Fat zzso zzso zzso necrosis zzso indicated by zzso zzso contributed to most of the necrosis observed in samples from patients with zzso however, findings of zzso zzso necrosis and total necrosis were significantly lower in samples from patients with zzso or zzso Fibrosis appeared to wall off the fat necrosis and limit zzso zzso zzso reducing zzso zzso In zzso collagen I limited the zzso flux between zzso cells and zzso and prevented increases in zzso in the zzso zzso This was associated with reduced zzso cell zzso However, zzso but not zzso caused zzso cell zzso 

Based on analysis of pancreatic samples from patients with zzso zzso or zzso and in zzso studies, zzso reduces the severity of acute zzso of zzso by reducing zzso flux between zzso and zzso zzso
