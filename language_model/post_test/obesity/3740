To compare zzso zzso with both zzso and zzso pressure monitoring in obese zzso zzso 

From a large database of zzso patients with zzso monitoring, obese subjects were selected in whom data were recorded for at least 30 minutes before and after zzso pressure zzso placement for zzso zzso Using a contraction detection algorithm, the relationship between the methods was determined with regard to both frequency and contraction zzso 

Of the 25 subjects zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso 75th zzso zzso seven underwent zzso at the time of zzso pressure zzso zzso zzso identified 248 zzso compared with 336 by zzso whereas zzso pressure zzso monitoring identified 319 zzso compared with zzso by zzso Using the zzso zzso Index, zzso contraction detection correlated better with the zzso pressure zzso zzso than with zzso zzso zzso zzso contraction lengths closely zzso those calculated from the zzso pressure zzso zzso 

zzso monitoring routinely is employed for managing labor, and zzso may be unreliable in obese zzso In the obese women in this study, the zzso contraction pattern correlated better with the zzso pressure zzso than zzso zzso may provide another zzso means of monitoring labor, particularly for those women in whom zzso is zzso
