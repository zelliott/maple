This study sought to assess the impact of body mass index zzso on cardiac zzso and clinical course in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

It is unresolved whether clinical variables promoting left zzso zzso zzso in the general population, such as zzso may influence cardiac zzso and clinical course in patients with zzso 

In 275 adult zzso patients (age 48 zzso 14 years; zzso zzso we assessed the relation of zzso to zzso mass, determined by cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso and heart failure zzso 

At zzso analysis, zzso proved independently associated with the magnitude of zzso zzso and obese zzso patients zzso 25 to 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso and zzso increased likelihood of an zzso mass in the highest zzso zzso zzso compared with normal weight patients zzso zzso zzso hazard ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso zzso Other features associated with zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso obstruction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso p zzso systemic hypertension zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso and male sex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso During a median follow-up of zzso years zzso zzso zzso to zzso obese patients showed an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso for developing New York Heart Association zzso functional class III to IV symptoms compared to zzso patients, independent of zzso zzso zzso the proportion of patients in zzso functional class III at the end of follow-up was zzso among obese patients, compared with zzso among those of normal weight zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso patients, zzso factors such as obesity are independently associated with increase in zzso mass and may dictate progression of heart failure zzso
