An zzso induced zzso zzso zzso model was applied to lean zzso zzso and obese zzso zzso mice zzso genetic background) in order to study the relation between obesity and zzso zzso As compared to lean mice, obese mice showed a significantly shorter zzso time zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso and lower total blood flow zzso versus zzso zzso A significant negative correlation was observed between body weight and both zzso time zzso zzso and blood flow zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso profile revealed significantly higher levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complex, Factor V activity and combined zzso zzso activity, and moderately elevated Factor VIII activity in obese zzso The degree of zzso damage and the zzso extension were, however, not significantly zzso A significant positive correlation was observed between body weight and either zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels zzso zzso or Factor V levels zzso zzso Thus, this injury induced zzso artery zzso model in mice establishes zzso a correlation between obesity and zzso zzso
