zzso zzso is a zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dual zzso zzso that reduces body weight in obese subjects through increased energy expenditure and decreased energy zzso The zzso effects of zzso have been attributed primarily to zzso zzso We examined whether a long acting zzso dual zzso zzso exerts zzso effects in zzso obese mice that are distinct from those obtained with a zzso zzso 

We developed a zzso dual zzso zzso zzso and a corresponding zzso zzso zzso matched for zzso zzso potency and zzso The zzso effects of these two peptides with respect to weight loss, caloric reduction, zzso control, and zzso zzso were compared upon chronic dosing in zzso obese zzso zzso Acute studies in zzso mice revealed zzso pathways that were modulated independent of weight zzso Studies in zzso and zzso mice enabled zzso of the contribution of zzso versus zzso zzso to the pharmacology of zzso 

zzso zzso exhibits superior weight loss, zzso activity, and zzso efficacy comparable to zzso zzso in plasma zzso parameters including insulin, zzso and zzso were more pronounced upon chronic treatment with zzso than with zzso zzso zzso zzso also increased fatty acid zzso and reduced zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso effects of zzso require zzso of both zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso dual zzso reverses obesity in zzso mice and is a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of zzso
