Low muscle strength is associated with poorer physical function, but limited empirical evidence is available to prove the relationship between muscle mass and physical zzso We tested the hypothesis that persons with lower muscle mass or muscle strength have poorer zzso performance zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso 

A cohort of 449 men and women aged 65 years and older living in Amsterdam and its surroundings participating in the second examination zzso of the zzso Aging Study zzso 

zzso skeletal muscle mass was measured using zzso X-ray zzso zzso Grip strength was used as an indicator of muscle zzso Timed functional performance tests, including walking and repeated chair stands, were used to assess zzso 

After adjustment for body height and age, leg muscle mass was positively associated with zzso in men zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso In women an inverse association was observed, which became positive after additional adjustment for body mass index zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Grip strength was positively associated with zzso in men and zzso After additional adjustment for zzso zzso and psychological zzso the associations between leg muscle mass and zzso disappeared, whereas grip strength remained to be independently associated with zzso in men zzso zzso P zzso zzso with a tendency in women zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso were similar when zzso of leg muscle mass or grip strength were zzso 

These results suggest that low muscle strength, but not low muscle mass, is associated with poor physical function in older men and zzso However, prospective studies are needed to investigate the association between loss of muscle mass and physical zzso
