Lines of mice have been developed in our laboratory by divergent long-term selection for body fat zzso This has resulted in a fivefold zzso vs zzso higher fat percentage in the Fat line at 14 weeks of age, with little difference between the Fat and zzso lines in zzso body zzso As part of an approach to characterize the zzso mechanisms underlying these different zzso zzso Y zzso zzso levels in the zzso and cerebral zzso of ad zzso and zzso mice of the Fat and zzso selected lines were zzso zzso differences in zzso gene expression were confined to the zzso Under ad zzso conditions, zzso zzso zzso levels did not differ significantly between the Fat and zzso zzso After an overnight fast of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were increased significantly zzso by zzso in zzso animals relative to fed mice from the same zzso However, zzso did not significantly stimulate zzso gene expression in the Fat zzso Most plasma zzso zzso in the zzso line fell below the sensitivity threshold of the zzso zzso zzso but levels in the Fat line were at least 30 to 50 times higher under zzso and fed conditions zzso After zzso plasma zzso levels in the Fat line decreased significantly zzso zzso by zzso Thus, unlike the situation in other zzso models, obesity in the Fat line is not associated with increased zzso zzso zzso levels in the ad zzso zzso The decreased sensitivity of zzso zzso gene expression to zzso in the Fat line is consistent with an zzso effect of higher circulating zzso zzso
