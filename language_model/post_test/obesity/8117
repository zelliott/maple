Poor early graft function zzso after living donor kidney transplantation zzso has been found to decrease zzso graft survival zzso However, its influence on long-term graft survival remains zzso 

Data were collected on zzso adult zzso performed between July 1996 and February zzso Poor zzso was defined as the occurrence of delayed or slow graft zzso Slow function was defined as serum zzso above zzso zzso at zzso day 5 without zzso 

The zzso of slow and delayed graft function was zzso and zzso zzso zzso overweight, zzso dialysis and warm zzso were identified as risk factors for the occurrence of poor zzso The zzso survival was worse for poor zzso as compared to immediate graft function with an adjusted hazard ratio zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso graft survival was impaired in the poor zzso group with an adjusted zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

Poor zzso occurs in zzso of living donor kidney zzso zzso Both, zzso and long-term graft zzso are significantly lower in patients with poor zzso as compared to patients with immediate graft zzso These results underline the clinical relevance of poor zzso as phenomenon after zzso
