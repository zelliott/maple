We explored the associations of three zzso in the zzso protein 2 zzso zzso one zzso in the zzso zzso region and five zzso in the zzso protein 3 zzso gene with obesity and diabetes related traits in subjects with impaired zzso tolerance participating in Finnish Diabetes Prevention zzso zzso zzso overweight individuals zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso age: 55 zzso 7 zzso for whom DNA was available were zzso to either an intensified diet and physical activity group or to a conventional care control zzso 

We zzso the data from the baseline and annual follow-up visits from years 1, 2 and zzso zzso of zzso plasma zzso and serum insulin in oral zzso tolerance test, serum total cholesterol, zzso and zzso were zzso The median follow-up time for type 2 diabetes zzso was 7 zzso zzso zzso were screened by restriction zzso length zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso gene zzso zzso was associated with increased serum total and zzso levels, at baseline and during the follow-up zzso The same zzso was associated with a higher risk of type 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso gene associated with serum total and zzso at zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was associated with measures of abdominal obesity at baseline and in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was associated with higher zzso ratio, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was associated with increased serum total and zzso zzso 

zzso variation in the zzso gene cluster may act as a modifier increasing serum zzso levels and zzso of abdominal zzso and may thereby also contribute to the zzso aberrations observed in obesity and type 2 zzso
