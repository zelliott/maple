This study examined the contribution of subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso zzso to obese African Americans' zzso elevated zzso risk, despite a protective obesity zzso of reduced visceral zzso tissue zzso and zzso fat fraction zzso relative to obese Hispanics with similar zzso zzso 

zzso AA and Hispanic adults (N zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso , zzso zzso with zzso SAT, and zzso measured by zzso SAT gene expression measured by zzso zzso and insulin sensitivity zzso disposition index zzso by zzso Multiple linear zzso examined zzso of ethnicity and zzso expression on outcomes zzso age, sex, total fat zzso with standardized zzso zzso zzso 

SAT zzso expression significantly associated with insulin parameters and this varied by ethnicity zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and positively associated with zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso with no significant relationship in zzso SAT zzso associated with zzso in the combined sample zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso with no difference between zzso zzso After controlling for zzso zzso associations with zzso risk in AA became zzso 

These results suggested that in AA and not Hispanics, SAT zzso is associated with zzso and zzso and may be zzso by zzso
