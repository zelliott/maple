zzso is epidemic in zzso heart disease, with reported rates of zzso to zzso in children and zzso in zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of obesity on zzso function and size in patients after initial repair for zzso of zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance studies in zzso zzso mass index zzso zzso and obese zzso mass index zzso zzso children and adults with repaired zzso of zzso were zzso The left zzso ejection zzso the right zzso ejection zzso left and right zzso zzso volumes zzso to actual body surface area, to zzso and to body surface area using ideal body weight were evaluated in 36 obese patients and 72 zzso zzso zzso Compared with zzso patients, obese patients had lower right zzso ejection zzso zzso 46 zzso zzso vs 51 zzso zzso p zzso zzso and left zzso ejection zzso zzso 57 zzso zzso vs 61 zzso zzso p zzso zzso higher right zzso zzso volumes zzso to height zzso 160 zzso 59 vs 135 zzso 41 zzso p zzso zzso and left zzso zzso volumes zzso to height zzso 86 zzso 25 vs 70 zzso 20 zzso p zzso zzso and higher right zzso zzso volumes zzso to ideal body weight zzso 166 zzso 55 vs 144 zzso 38 zzso p zzso zzso and left zzso zzso volumes zzso to ideal body weight zzso 90 zzso 22 vs 75 zzso 15 zzso p zzso In conclusion, obesity is a modifiable risk factor associated with worsened zzso zzso function and zzso zzso in patients with repaired zzso of zzso The standard method of indexing zzso volumes using actual body surface area may underestimate volume load in obese zzso
