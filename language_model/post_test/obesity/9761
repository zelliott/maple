Generally, patients' actual body weight zzso is used to calculate the number of zzso cells to be harvested for zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso In our institution, zzso patients weighing at least zzso more than their ideal body weight zzso have their adjusted ideal body weight zzso used for determination of blood volume to be processed to achieve a minimum target of zzso cells per zzso as well as zzso cell dosage calculation at zzso zzso is calculated as zzso zzso zzso We have used zzso for zzso patients who have had zzso zzso zzso with a median zzso of 69 zzso zzso zzso zzso Median actual weight was 90 zzso zzso zzso zzso Median volume of peripheral blood processed to achieve a minimum zzso zzso zzso for these patients was zzso L zzso zzso zzso and the median zzso zzso collected for zzso was zzso zzso zzso For zzso patients zzso median zzso 75 zzso range, zzso zzso the corresponding median zzso volume was 16 L zzso zzso zzso and median zzso zzso harvested was zzso zzso zzso In total, 35 in a total transplant cohort of 82 patients had zzso used to determine zzso cell dose at time of zzso with a median of zzso (if their zzso was used in the zzso zzso compared to median dose of zzso zzso for the zzso patient zzso All patients zzso with no significant difference between median times to zzso and zzso zzso for the overweight (13 and 15 days, zzso compared with zzso (12 and 14 days, zzso patient zzso We conclude that the use of zzso is a useful tool for successful harvest and subsequent transplant for overweight patients, with no adverse effect on zzso zzso
