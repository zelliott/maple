zzso zzso zzso rats with a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso are obese and zzso with prolonged zzso zzso To determine whether their zzso deficits could be corrected by zzso installation, we employed viral zzso to introduce the zzso gene into either the zzso nucleus zzso or the zzso nucleus zzso of the zzso sites of zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso viral zzso zzso zzso the human zzso gene zzso were zzso zzso to produce zzso zzso gene zzso zzso of the zzso gene in the ARC and zzso was verified using reverse zzso chain zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso but not in the zzso resulted in zzso of zzso cycle zzso increased zzso zzso development, and decreased serum zzso zzso Compared to zzso rats, zzso expression of zzso Y zzso and zzso were decreased in ARC zzso zzso Parallel decreases were noted in zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso whereas zzso zzso hormone zzso levels zzso These studies showed that zzso zzso can be successfully used to install functional zzso in the zzso for extended zzso The zzso stimulation of the zzso zzso axis in zzso rats was probably brought about by the observed decreases in zzso and zzso which inhibit zzso zzso Because these changes were seen in zzso but not in zzso rats, the results suggest that the ARC may be the primary site where zzso acts to regulate the zzso zzso
