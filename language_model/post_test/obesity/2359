Previous studies with the novel once daily zzso zzso zzso analogue zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso have revealed profound zzso and zzso effects, but also potent effects on gastric zzso zzso and long-term and lasting reductions in body zzso In this study, we examined the acute and chronic effects of two different zzso zzso with different zzso profiles on zzso food intake and body zzso 

On the basis of a series of zzso studies, the doses of zzso and zzso with similar acute zzso effects were zzso GE was assessed using a standard zzso release zzso After the acute test, rats were zzso zzso for 14 days in which period food intake and body weight was zzso On day 14, the GE rate was zzso 

While both compounds exerted robust acute reductions in zzso the effect was markedly diminished following 14 days of dosing with zzso In contrast, zzso rats still displayed a profound reduction in GE at the zzso zzso Both compounds exerted similar effects on body zzso 

The data suggest that the zzso zzso zzso receptors in rats are subject to zzso but that this effect is dependent on full zzso exposure as obtained by zzso The body zzso effects of zzso zzso stimulation are not subject to zzso These data indicate that regulation of appetite signals in the brain, and not zzso is the main mechanism for zzso weight zzso
