Low zzso vitamin D zzso levels have been associated with an increased risk of zzso however an association with zzso zzso rate zzso is not zzso We explored the relationship between zzso levels and prevalent chronic kidney disease zzso zzso and impaired zzso in a zzso zzso cohort of Australian adults zzso zzso 

zzso adults zzso 25 years of age participating in the baseline survey of the zzso study zzso were zzso The zzso was estimated using an zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso with zzso defined as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was defined as a spot urine zzso to zzso ratio zzso of zzso zzso zzso for men and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso were considered vitamin D zzso The associations between zzso level, zzso and impaired zzso were estimated using zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of the study population had a zzso level zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly associated with an impaired zzso in the zzso model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not in the zzso model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly associated with zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso models zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Vitamin D zzso is common in this population, and zzso levels of zzso zzso were independently associated with zzso but not with impaired zzso These associations warrant further exploration in prospective and zzso zzso
