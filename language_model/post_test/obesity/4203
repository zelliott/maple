zzso protein 4 zzso is an zzso bound in plasma to zzso zzso which prevents its zzso zzso and subsequent zzso in the zzso zzso of this interaction have been suggested to be implicated in the zzso of zzso that are thought to contribute to the development of insulin resistance associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes zzso zzso However, the factors linking zzso to zzso in humans are not zzso zzso this study evaluated parameters influencing the zzso interaction and their relation to obesity and zzso The zzso and zzso levels were zzso in plasma of 16 lean controls, 28 overweight controls, and 14 overweight zzso patients by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso binding were determined by linear zzso laser zzso of zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were assessed by zzso using zzso zzso gel zzso Plasma levels of both zzso and zzso did not differ among the groups of lean controls, overweight controls, and overweight zzso zzso Using zzso zzso 4 mass signals were observed for zzso representing native, zzso zzso and zzso zzso No differences in peak intensity of zzso zzso were observed among the zzso Moreover, no differences in the ratio of zzso and zzso were zzso The results suggest that circulating zzso and zzso were not affected by human obesity or zzso which might be attributed to the absence of zzso of zzso zzso and the ratio of zzso and zzso that might modify the zzso zzso
