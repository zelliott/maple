zzso resistance is associated with zzso low serum zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso and high serum total cholesterol zzso to zzso zzso Several reports have demonstrated that either zzso or zzso may favorably lower serum zzso zzso However, their effects on insulin sensitivity are zzso The primary aim of this study was to compare the effects of zzso and zzso on insulin sensitivity and serum zzso zzso in subjects with high zzso zzso We enrolled 25 zzso patients, similar in terms of age and weight with zzso ratios greater than zzso Thirteen subjects were treated with zzso 20 zzso per day, and 12 received zzso 300 zzso twice per zzso Plasma zzso zzso and zzso were measured, and a zzso oral zzso tolerance test zzso and a modified insulin suppression test were performed before and after 3 months of zzso The study showed the mean plasma zzso zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso and zzso ratio were significantly reduced in the zzso group, but no obvious effects on plasma zzso zzso and zzso were zzso In the zzso group, plasma zzso and zzso were markedly zzso but no significantly different effects in other plasma lipids were zzso zzso did not affect zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso significantly increased zzso zzso Neither drug affected the serum zzso concentration during the zzso We conclude that zzso significantly lowers plasma zzso and zzso ratio, and zzso zzso and adversely affects insulin sensitivity, while zzso markedly reduces plasma zzso zzso without altering insulin sensitivity in subjects with high zzso zzso
