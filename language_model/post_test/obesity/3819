We aimed to determine the influence of meal time on zzso zzso cortisol rhythms and weight loss in obese zzso 

Twelve obese subjects zzso mass zzso zzso were hospitalized for 64 d and then randomly assigned to one of three zzso stages with a zzso zzso between zzso In stage 1, the subjects received a zzso diet zzso zzso zzso into five meals per zzso In stage 2, the subjects received the same diet between zzso and zzso zzso In stage 3, they received the same diet between zzso and 2000 zzso Between admissions, the subjects were discharged from the hospital and consumed their usual diet at zzso zzso cortisol rhythm (in six samples collected over a zzso zzso was determined during each stage, and zzso zzso indirect zzso and urinary nitrogen zzso variables were zzso 

zzso cortisol zzso rhythms were similar during all stages when measured on day 1 or 18 of zzso Despite significant reductions in all zzso zzso except zzso ratio, no significant changes were observed in zzso cortisol rhythm after zzso of the eating zzso Starting on day 4 of treatment, nitrogen zzso and zzso levels decreased zzso on day 10, nitrogen balance was negative in all study zzso 

Administration of a zzso diet led to changes in weight, body zzso resting zzso rate, and nitrogen balance but did not significantly alter zzso zzso cortisol zzso
