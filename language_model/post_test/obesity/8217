zzso clock genes are critical regulators of energy zzso and zzso However, whether variation in the zzso genes is associated with zzso zzso in humans remains to be zzso In this study, we zzso zzso 20 tag single zzso zzso zzso in 8 candidate genes involved in zzso clock, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Chinese subjects in Taipei and zzso populations in zzso Their associations with zzso zzso were zzso We found that genetic variation in the zzso zzso zzso was associated with body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso corrected P zzso zzso Another zzso zzso in the zzso gene was associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso corrected P zzso zzso These associations were consistent in both Taipei and zzso zzso zzso zzso and joint effects between zzso on zzso and related zzso were zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso levels in human abdominal zzso tissue were significantly increased in obese subjects compared to non-obese zzso
