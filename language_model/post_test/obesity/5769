Clinical studies have shown increased levels of zzso causing functional iron zzso in obese zzso This study examined whether obesity contributes to increased zzso and zzso levels in adult zzso zzso 

In a zzso design, 37 obese zzso mass index zzso zzso stable zzso patients and 37 patients with normal zzso zzso zzso matched for age, gender and race, who fulfilled a strict set of inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso markers of iron status and zzso and routine zzso and zzso variables were measured on samples obtained prior to the midweek zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso were similar with regard to basic zzso and use of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso red cells and zzso were similar in the two zzso zzso iron and zzso zzso levels were on the low side and not different between obese and lean zzso total zzso capacity showed a trend towards higher levels in obese patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso of serum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso were high but similar between the two zzso zzso zzso showed a significant correlation only with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso levels are already considerably elevated in dialysis patients, but obesity does not have an additional zzso Further studies should examine whether increased weight contributes towards zzso zzso in zzso individuals, in whom there is a lesser burden of systemic zzso
