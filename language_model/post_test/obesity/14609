The prevalence of obesity is increasing in most parts of the zzso The objective of this study was to examine whether changes in food patterns were associated with changes in zzso among women over 9 zzso Data were from zzso women participating in the Swedish zzso zzso in 1987 and zzso Diet was assessed with a zzso at both time points and 4 food patterns were derived using zzso factor analysis zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our exposure variables were defined as change in factor score for each food pattern from 1987 to zzso Our outcome variable was defined as change in zzso during the same period, and we also examined change in zzso zzso weight and overweight women had positive changes in weight and zzso during zzso whereas obese women had negative changes in zzso and zzso we observed a significant interaction between change in food patterns and baseline zzso zzso subjects who increased their factor score for the Healthy pattern had larger decreases in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for a 1 unit increase in zzso score, zzso zzso to zzso P zzso whereas normal weight and overweight women who increased their Healthy pattern score had smaller increases in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso for zzso zzso women who increased their Healthy pattern zzso zzso had almost a 4 zzso decrease in weight and a 1 unit decrease in zzso at zzso In conclusion, changes in eating patterns were significantly related to changes in zzso over 9 y and the effect was modified by baseline zzso zzso analysis is helpful in generating hypotheses regarding the role of diet in zzso and additional research is needed to understand which elements of our patterns are protective or risk factors for weight zzso
