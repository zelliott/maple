This phantom study investigates whether zzso maps from transmission data zzso by increased noise from zzso of zzso counts can still provide useful zzso correction in the regular and obese zzso zzso was used for both zzso and transmission on a triple head simultaneous zzso transmission zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transmission counts were zzso by zzso zzso counts estimated from the two parallel zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to simulate organ counts from injections of 900 and 400 zzso zzso for regular and obese chest zzso Line source activity was 350 zzso Control zzso maps were obtained with no zzso zzso Noise control included catering for negative and zero transmission counts, zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso was tried before and after zzso and before and after setting negative zzso to zzso zzso zzso at the heart in anterior transmission projections was typically zzso for the regular and zzso for the obese zzso For the obese chest, zzso before zzso negative counts best preserved mean zzso in soft tissue and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the regular chest were zzso and zzso for soft tissue and lung and for the obese chest, zzso and zzso The accuracy of the zzso zzso zzso plots for the regular chest was the same as with control map zzso correction and 3 times better than with no zzso For the obese chest it was as good as with control map correction only if zzso map zzso was zzso zzso zzso soft tissue and lung zzso in 28 patient studies indicated that zzso is practical for a wide range of chest zzso zzso zzso on a zzso system offers an accurate, inexpensive method of zzso correction for the majority of chest zzso
