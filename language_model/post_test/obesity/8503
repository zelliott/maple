To investigate the hypothesis that insulin resistance plays a role in the zzso of hypertension and zzso we measured serum zzso levels, the zzso zzso ratio, and the insulin response to oral zzso zzso in a group of young obese subjects zzso zzso zzso with hypertension and normal zzso tolerance and in zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso with normal zzso zzso matched for age and body mass zzso Leisure time physical activity was evaluated by a questionnaire outlining three levels of physical activities during leisure zzso zzso with hypertension had higher zzso serum insulin (19 zzso 2 v 13 zzso 1 zzso P zzso and lower zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso v zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso than zzso zzso zzso with hypertension had higher peak serum insulin and lower plasma zzso zzso area ratio in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso v zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso than zzso zzso zzso total cholesterol, zzso cholesterol, and zzso were higher in the obese zzso subjects than in obese zzso zzso Blood pressure correlated with either zzso serum insulin, zzso zzso ratio, or zzso zzso area ratio during zzso The level of leisure time physical activities was lower in obese zzso subjects than in obese zzso zzso There were significant correlations between the levels of physical activity and the zzso plasma zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso P zzso or the zzso serum insulin concentration zzso zzso zzso P zzso The study provided evidence that a low level of leisure time physical activity is associated with insulin resistance and zzso zzso which are the key zzso abnormalities that link hypertension, zzso and zzso in young zzso
