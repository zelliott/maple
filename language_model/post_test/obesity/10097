zzso a hormone zzso by zzso plays a pivotal role in the control of body zzso zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso gene develop zzso zzso It is possible, therefore, that zzso zzso gene zzso contribute to human zzso To test this possibility, we determined the entire coding sequence of the human zzso zzso zzso from peripheral blood zzso of 22 zzso obese patients with zzso index zzso between zzso and zzso zzso We identified five common DNA sequence zzso distributed throughout the coding sequence at zzso zzso zzso zzso 656 and zzso one rare silent zzso at zzso zzso and one novel alternatively spliced form of zzso None of the five common zzso including the three that predict zzso acid changes, are zzso zzso causing zzso zzso because zzso for the zzso sequences were also found in lean zzso Furthermore, the frequency of each zzso zzso and the distribution of zzso and zzso were similar in 190 obese zzso zzso and 132 lean zzso zzso zzso white British males selected from a zzso zzso zzso In these subjects, there was no evidence for a significant effect of the common zzso on obesity or zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso in the zzso zzso gene are not a common cause of human zzso
