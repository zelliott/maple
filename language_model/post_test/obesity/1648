zzso and zzso storage in human zzso tissue are inhibited by zzso such as zzso zzso of zzso to zzso is zzso by zzso in human zzso We sought to characterize zzso zzso zzso in human zzso and to establish its role in the zzso action of zzso zzso and zzso primary zzso cultures were established from fat samples obtained in subjects undergoing abdominal zzso zzso of zzso to zzso for 24 h was measured in zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in human zzso was achieved using zzso zzso In whole zzso tissue sample, cortisol production was positively correlated with zzso zzso in both subcutaneous and zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso stimulation of zzso zzso was higher in zzso compared with subcutaneous fat from men as well as subcutaneous and zzso fat from women zzso zzso A significant positive correlation was observed between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso rates in subcutaneous and zzso zzso tissue of men and women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 26, P zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso or zzso significantly reduced zzso and zzso zzso zzso rates zzso zzso The zzso action of zzso on zzso differentiation was zzso following zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso Specifically, zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso zzso expression in differentiated zzso exposed to zzso were reduced further upon zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso and is particularly effective in zzso zzso of obese zzso The interplay between zzso and zzso zzso zzso may locally zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso zzso
