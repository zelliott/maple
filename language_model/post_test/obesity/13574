zzso variations in DNA that increase zzso to disease is one of the primary aims of genetic studies using a forward zzso zzso However, identification of zzso genes by means of such studies provides limited functional information on how genes lead to zzso In fact, in most cases there is an absence of functional information altogether, preventing a definitive identification of the zzso gene or zzso Here we develop an alternative to the classic forward zzso approach for zzso complex disease traits where, instead of identifying zzso genes directly affected by variations in DNA, we identify gene networks that are zzso by zzso zzso and that in turn lead to zzso Application of this method to liver and zzso gene expression data generated from a segregating mouse population results in the identification of a zzso network supported as having a zzso relationship with disease traits associated with zzso zzso Three genes in this network, zzso zzso zzso zzso beta zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso are validated as previously unknown obesity zzso strengthening the association between this network and zzso disease zzso Our analysis provides direct experimental support that complex traits such as obesity are emergent properties of molecular networks that are modulated by complex genetic zzso and environmental zzso
