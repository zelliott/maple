zzso volume and pH were studied immediately after induction of zzso and zzso zzso in 40 zzso obese patients undergoing gastric bypass zzso Of 14 patients receiving intramuscular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had gastric pH values zzso zzso of these patients had both a gastric pH zzso and a zzso 20 zzso When the drug administered was intramuscular zzso zzso zzso zzso of the patients had gastric pH zzso zzso zzso had both gastric pH values zzso and zzso 20 zzso zzso between the two drugs were not zzso Thirteen patients received zzso orally at midnight preoperatively and again 2 to 4 hours before the induction of zzso Patients in this group had gastric pH values that were significantly higher than those observed in patients given zzso zzso Only zzso had gastric pH values zzso zzso volumes observed in patients receiving zzso were not significantly different from those receiving zzso zzso Whereas only zzso of patients receiving zzso had both low pH values and gastric zzso 20 zzso this was not statistically different from the observations made in patients receiving zzso or zzso Despite this, it is concluded that zzso administered before the induction of zzso in zzso obese patients may reduce the high risk of aspiration zzso in such zzso
