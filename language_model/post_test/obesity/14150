zzso and zzso perspectives add considerably to our understanding of the zzso of obesity and its related zzso One zzso to obesity represents the zzso consequences of an zzso preserved mechanism by which the developing zzso monitors nutritional cues from its mother and adjusts its zzso trajectory zzso zzso of a nutritionally sparse environment leads to a zzso that promotes zzso zzso by zzso fat deposition, insulin resistance, zzso and low energy zzso But this zzso mechanism evolved to accommodate gradual changes in nutritional zzso rapid transition to a situation of high energy density results in a mismatch between predicted and actual environments and increased zzso to zzso zzso This zzso may also explain why breast and bottle feeding zzso different risks of zzso We discuss how early environmental signals act through zzso mechanisms to alter zzso zzso zzso action and neuroendocrine control of zzso A second zzso involves zzso in fetal insulin levels, as seen in zzso diabetes, leading to increased prenatal fat mass which is subsequently amplified by zzso zzso Both classes of zzso may coexist in an zzso This zzso approach to obesity suggests that potential interventions will vary according to the target zzso
