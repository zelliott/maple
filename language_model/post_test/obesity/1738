To test differences in zzso duration by zzso maternal weight status, and determine whether body image concerns mediate any zzso 

A prospective zzso cohort of zzso women was followed from pregnancy to, at zzso 6 months zzso zzso responses on body concerns were obtained during pregnancy and at 4 months zzso zzso zzso compared zzso duration in zzso and normal weight zzso Cox zzso hazard zzso was used to determine whether body image variables zzso the relationship between maternal weight and zzso 

Although intended duration was similar between groups, zzso women had a shorter median duration of any zzso zzso weeks) compared to normal weight women zzso weeks) zzso zzso and they experienced higher risk of zzso zzso over the entire first year zzso zzso risk zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso women reported lack of body zzso zzso more frequently than normal zzso women zzso zzso Lack of body zzso zzso was zzso associated with duration after adjusting for maternal zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, the effect of zzso on duration was reduced by this variable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso suggesting zzso 

Women with high zzso zzso have reduced zzso duration that is zzso by lack of zzso with one's zzso Further research into the interplay between body image, weight status, and zzso outcomes may point to behavioral targets amenable to intervention and modification that may in turn improve zzso outcomes for zzso women and their zzso
