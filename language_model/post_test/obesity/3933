The objectives were to identify quantitative trait zzso linked to serum zzso concentration and to estimate zzso in two populations of African zzso 

We conducted a zzso scan for serum zzso concentration in two populations of African zzso zzso zzso markers were typed in an African-American population consisting of zzso families from the Chicago area and in a Nigerian zzso population consisting of 146 zzso zzso analysis was performed to identify zzso zzso component model was used to estimate zzso 

Estimates of zzso adjusted for age, zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso for the African-American and Nigerian families, zzso In both zzso zzso was significantly zzso correlated with zzso zzso and zzso After adjusting for age, zzso and zzso we found evidence of genetic linkage to zzso on zzso 11 zzso of detection zzso score zzso zzso and 17 zzso score zzso zzso in the Nigerian zzso Among the African-Americans, we found genetic linkage on zzso 2 zzso score zzso zzso 4 zzso score zzso zzso and 11 zzso score zzso zzso Analysis based on combined data yielded a maximum zzso score of zzso on zzso zzso 

zzso of the finding on zzso 11 suggests that this region is likely to be involved in regulation of zzso either through a primary influence on hormone levels or through pathways influencing body zzso These results suggest that zzso could be a potential therapeutic target for zzso
