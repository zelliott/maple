Over zzso American adults are overweight, and obesity accounts for zzso billion annually in medical zzso Since measuring obesity by body mass index zzso fails to account for fat distribution and zzso recent work has explored quantitative measures of visceral fat area zzso and subcutaneous fat area zzso obtained from CT zzso However, use of CT to zzso zzso tissue has not been evaluated in zzso cancer zzso patients and the optimal zzso location for measuring zzso and zzso has yet to be zzso We measured zzso and zzso at three different zzso locations to determine which location was optimal in zzso zzso 

A database of patients undergoing zzso surgery from 2002 to 2009 was reviewed to identify patients with zzso CT zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso were calculated at the level of zzso zzso and zzso 

A total of zzso zzso cancer patients had zzso imaging available and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso by CT at the levels of zzso zzso and zzso were all significant independent zzso for medical complications of obesity including diabetes zzso zzso zzso and hypertension zzso zzso on zzso zzso The location used for imaging did not affect zzso zzso Additionally, waist circumference was also a significant independent predictor of diabetes zzso zzso and hypertension zzso zzso 

zzso measures of obesity from CT imaging in zzso patients correlated significantly with medical conditions known to be associated with zzso This indicates that direct measurement of zzso is valid in zzso cancer zzso
