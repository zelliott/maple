To examine the relationship between maternal pregnancy dietary and supplement iron intake and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso pulse wave zzso zzso function zzso by zzso artery flow zzso zzso blood pressure, and zzso zzso by body mass zzso test for mediation by zzso zzso birth weight, zzso age, and child dietary iron zzso and for effect modification by maternal vitamin C intake and offspring zzso 

Prospective data from zzso mothers and children pairs at 10 years of age enrolled in an English birth zzso the Avon zzso Study for Parents and Children zzso was zzso 

zzso zzso mothers reported dietary iron intake in pregnancy below the UK reference zzso intake of zzso zzso zzso zzso reported taking iron supplements, and 129 zzso were anemic by 18 weeks zzso No associations were observed apart from maternal iron intake from supplements with offspring zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to 0, zzso in the sample with all relevant data observed, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to 0, zzso in the sample with missing data zzso 

There was no evidence of association between maternal pregnancy dietary iron zzso or maternal zzso concentration (which is less likely to be biased by zzso zzso with offspring zzso There was a modest inverse association between maternal iron supplement intake during pregnancy with offspring zzso blood pressure at 10 zzso
