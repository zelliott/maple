The purpose of this study was to determine whether exercise prescriptions differing in volume or intensity also differ in their ability to retain insulin sensitivity during an ensuing period of training zzso zzso zzso subjects were assigned to one of three zzso exercise zzso 1) low zzso intensity zzso of approximately 12 zzso 1,200 zzso at zzso peak zzso consumption zzso 200 zzso zzso 2) low zzso intensity ( approximately 12 zzso 1,200 zzso at zzso zzso 125 zzso and 3) high zzso intensity ( approximately 20 zzso 2,000 zzso at zzso zzso 200 zzso zzso sensitivity zzso zzso tolerance test, zzso was measured when subjects were sedentary and at zzso h and 15 days after the final training zzso zzso increased with training compared with the sedentary condition zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso h with all of the exercise zzso zzso decreased to zzso zzso values after 15 days of training zzso in the zzso zzso In contrast, at 15 days zzso was significantly elevated compared with sedentary zzso zzso zzso zzso in the prescriptions utilizing 200 zzso zzso zzso intensity, high zzso zzso In the zzso group, indexes of muscle zzso density followed a pattern zzso insulin action by being elevated at 15 days compared with zzso this trend was not evident in the zzso zzso These findings suggest that in zzso subjects a relatively chronic persistence of enhanced insulin action may be obtained with zzso exercise zzso this zzso however, is dependent on the characteristics of the exercise training zzso
