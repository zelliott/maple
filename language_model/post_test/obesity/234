The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of different zzso of resistance training on body composition and power in zzso The study was a zzso zzso design involving 31 zzso children who were overweight or obese zzso zzso zzso divided into 3 groups and resistance trained 3 times per zzso Group 8 zzso trained for 8 weeks, group 16 zzso trained for 16 weeks, and group 24 zzso trained for 24 zzso All participants were measured at weeks 0, 8, 16, and 24 for body composition and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso continued to be tested during the testing weeks after zzso of their training zzso Body composition and bone mineral content were measured by zzso X-ray zzso zzso improvements in body composition were seen in the initial zzso training phase, and these improvements were maintained for the subsequent 16 zzso zzso changes in percent body fat ( approximately zzso were observed at 8 weeks in all 3 zzso Total fat mass decreased significantly at week 8 in zzso and zzso zzso By week 24, total fat mass was significantly reduced by zzso in zzso zzso improvements were observed in zzso jump power, which improved by zzso at week 16 in zzso These results suggest that an zzso resistance training program is sufficient time to significantly change body zzso strength, and power measures in children who are overweight or zzso However, further improvements are realized with zzso resistance training zzso On zzso of the training programs, the zzso and zzso groups maintained the benefits of the exercise program until the end of the study zzso
