This study investigated the effect of zzso and low-energy density zzso on gastrointestinal and zzso factors, which act to regulate acute energy zzso Sixteen overweight and obese men zzso zzso zzso zzso each received 3 oral zzso in zzso order: zzso zzso high-fat zzso zzso zzso low-energy density, high-fat zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Over 180 zzso gastric zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and subsequent energy intake was zzso Total energy intake did not differ between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was slower following the zzso high-fat zzso zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but did not differ between the zzso high-fat and zzso high-fat zzso zzso zzso Plasma zzso like zzso did not differ substantially between zzso zzso zzso was lower following zzso high-fat zzso zzso than zzso high-fat zzso zzso and low-energy density, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso We conclude that an increased energy density slows gastric zzso and reduces zzso but that a high fat content zzso the effect of energy density on gastric zzso The zzso zzso of these gastric and zzso factors may explain, at least in part, the lack of differences in subsequent energy intake in response to oral zzso with increasing energy zzso
