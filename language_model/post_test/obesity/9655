To clarify the necessity of improving zzso metabolism in zzso zzso syndrome zzso women as early as possible, 111 zzso women with normal zzso tolerance and 92 healthy zzso controls were recruited to investigate zzso levels distribution, insulin sensitivity and zzso cell zzso 91 zzso women and 33 controls underwent zzso clamp to assess their insulin sensitivity, which was expressed as M zzso zzso cell function was estimated by zzso model assessment zzso index after adjusting insulin sensitivity zzso zzso Compared with lean controls, lean zzso women had similar zzso plasma zzso zzso higher zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lower M value but similar zzso index, while zzso zzso women had higher levels of both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and lower levels of both M value and zzso zzso Linear zzso and zzso analysis found zzso was independently associated with M value and zzso index in zzso women zzso and the zzso of zzso indicating impaired zzso cell function of zzso women was zzso In conclusion, insulin resistance and zzso of zzso metabolism were common in Chinese zzso women with normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated impaired zzso cell function in zzso women with normal zzso zzso
