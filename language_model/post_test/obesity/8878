The study subjects were 192 overweight and obese zzso zzso zzso zzso and 103 Thai controls zzso zzso zzso zzso whose ages ranged from zzso zzso All subjects were evaluated for serum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso variation in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly lower in the zzso group zzso zzso For the zzso and control group, the median ages were 38 and 37 years, serum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso zzso showed no association between zzso deletion zzso and the two zzso At serum zzso concentration zzso zzso there was no relationship between zzso deletion zzso and zzso zzso zzso had a significant negative correlation with age in all subjects (R zzso zzso P zzso The results did not support the hypothesis that zzso deletion zzso is associated with a low zzso concentration in zzso zzso However, serum zzso had a significant negative correlation with zzso serum zzso can possibly be used to indicate the aging of cells in zzso including the zzso Further studies are needed to investigate other zzso genes located on zzso 12 to prove zzso gene zzso association with low serum zzso and zzso
