It is well known that blood pressure measurement with a standard zzso zzso wide cuff is erroneous for large zzso 

To compare arm blood pressure zzso with an appropriate cuff and zzso blood pressure zzso zzso with a standard zzso and both zzso by the zzso zzso zzso 

One hundred and zzso obese patients were studied zzso mass zzso zzso The patients had three arm zzso taken by an automatic zzso device using an appropriate cuff and three zzso zzso with a standard cuff in the sitting position after a five-minute zzso Data were zzso by the analysis of zzso The correction values were obtained by the linear zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso arm zzso with an appropriate cuff were significantly lower zzso than zzso zzso with a standard zzso The zzso obtained by zzso were significantly lower zzso than those found for zzso zzso and zzso blood pressures and upper arm zzso blood zzso The equation to correct zzso in zzso in obese patients with arm circumference between zzso zzso was: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This study showed that zzso blood pressure measurement zzso the values of arm blood pressure zzso In addition, it is possible to correct zzso zzso with an zzso
