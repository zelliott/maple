zzso fat content is an important variable in the association between regional body fat distribution and plasma high density zzso zzso cholesterol zzso In the present study, we report on the role of plasma zzso zzso as well as abdominal and zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso activities in the association between body fat distribution and plasma zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso abdominal and zzso zzso tissue zzso activities and plasma zzso levels were measured after an overnight fast in a sample of 16 obese women zzso zzso zzso zzso years zzso zzso zzso percent body fat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to assess body fat zzso Plasma zzso zzso activity was neither correlated with total zzso nor with the level of zzso zzso zzso fat deposition was, however, positively correlated with zzso activity zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis showed that the association between zzso fat and zzso was independent from total zzso Plasma zzso zzso and abdominal zzso activities showed no significant correlation with plasma zzso levels, whereas zzso zzso activity was positively correlated with the zzso zzso cholesterol ratio zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso zzso activity was, however, zzso correlated with zzso cholesterol zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso but not with zzso cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the high zzso activity in obese women with excess deep abdominal fat could be responsible for the reduction in plasma zzso cholesterol zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
