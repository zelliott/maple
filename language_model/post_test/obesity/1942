Rapid strides in understanding the physiology controlling energy or zzso intake and energy expenditure have zzso the search for the genetic basis of zzso Several single gene defects are known that produce obesity in zzso All of these have been cloned within the past 4 years, providing a rich new base for understanding zzso Since obesity is likely to be zzso a number of laboratories have used the quantitative trait locus zzso technique of zzso scanning to identify candidate zzso regions and, eventually, genes that may influence body weight and body zzso So far, 18 zzso have been identified in association with zzso strains of mice or rats with variable zzso to zzso A number of zzso disorders are known to exist in humans, but no specific genes have yet been identified for zzso The potential for inserting new genetic material into zzso has produced numerous transgenic mice with increased or decreased quantities of body zzso These models will provide a continuing source of new insights into zzso Several areas in the human zzso have been linked to the development of zzso Among the candidate genes with evidence of linkage to body fat are zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The new insights described above have zzso the pharmaceutical industry to increase their efforts for new drug development aimed at the growing problem of zzso
