zzso fat has been reported to influence insulin zzso 

The objective of the study was to determine how identical weight loss zzso loss of zzso of body weight over 3-6 zzso in women taking zzso or zzso combined with a zzso diet influences body composition and insulin zzso 

zzso obese women zzso mass index (in zzso zzso zzso zzso were randomly assigned to receive either zzso zzso zzso 3 times zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 24) with a zzso zzso zzso insulin sensitivity zzso clamp zzso serum fatty zzso and body composition zzso resonance zzso were measured before and after weight zzso 

The groups did not differ significantly at baseline with respect to age, body weight, zzso and subcutaneous fat volumes, or insulin zzso Weight loss did not differ significantly between the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity improved significantly zzso zzso and similarly after weight loss in the zzso (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fat and subcutaneous fat decreased significantly in both groups, but the ratio of the 2 decreased significantly only in the zzso zzso The proportion of zzso acid zzso in serum zzso was zzso related to insulin sensitivity both before zzso zzso zzso P zzso and after zzso zzso zzso P zzso weight loss, but it did not change significantly in either zzso 

Weight loss rather than zzso of fat zzso enhances insulin zzso A decrease in fat zzso by zzso appears to favorably influence the ratio between zzso and subcutaneous fat, which suggests that zzso fat or its composition influences fat zzso
