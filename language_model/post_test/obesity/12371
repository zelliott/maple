zzso association studies zzso are useful to reveal an association between single zzso zzso and different measures of zzso A multitude of new zzso has recently been reported, but the exact function of most of the according genes is not zzso The aim of our study was to start zzso the function of some of these zzso 

We performed an expression analysis of zzso zzso namely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso via real-time zzso in zzso tissue of the kidney zzso the zzso and zzso as well as the zzso of obese zzso diabetic fatty zzso and zzso lean zzso rats at an age of 22 zzso 

All of our target genes except for zzso showed the highest expression in the zzso This suggests a critical role of these zzso genes in the central regulation of energy zzso Interestingly, the expression pattern in the zzso showed no differences between obese zzso and lean zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly lower expressed in the kidney fat of zzso than zzso zzso zzso was even lower expressed in subcutaneous and zzso fat, while zzso was higher expressed in the subcutaneous and zzso fat of zzso zzso 

The expression pattern of the investigated obesity genes implies for most of them a role in the central regulation of energy balance, but for some also a role in the zzso tissue zzso For the development of the zzso zzso peripheral rather than central mechanisms of the investigated genes seem to be zzso
