Since high energy zzso zzso hypertension and diabetes are linked to obesity and an zzso hormonal profile, we wanted to test whether energy zzso physical activity, blood pressure and serum zzso are related to the risk of zzso cancer independent of the body mass index zzso A cohort of zzso women, aged zzso years, attended a Norwegian health screening twice during zzso they answered questions about diet, physical activity and chronic diseases, and their zzso weight, blood pressure and zzso serum zzso were zzso By the end of 1996, during zzso years of zzso 130 cases of zzso zzso were zzso The relative risks zzso for zzso cancer were estimated in zzso hazards models including potentially zzso zzso zzso women zzso or zzso 30 zzso were at zzso times increased risk of zzso cancer compared to normal weight women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Among overweight women zzso or zzso 25 zzso zzso serum zzso in the upper zzso zzso in the lower zzso was associated with a zzso times increase in risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas among obese women, blood pressure above zzso zzso zzso below zzso zzso in both surveys was associated with a zzso times increase in risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Especially in women younger than 50 years, high energy intake zzso zzso zzso higher risk compared to low energy intake zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recreational activity tended to be zzso Among obese women with zzso jobs at both zzso zzso declined to zzso zzso zzso zzso as the level of sustained occupational activity increased zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso and high energy intake are major risk factors for zzso cancer independent of zzso and that hypertension and relative zzso are significant markers of risk, especially among the heaviest zzso
