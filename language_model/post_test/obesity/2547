zzso zzso transfer protein zzso is a protein that exerts a central regulatory role in zzso zzso zzso assembly and zzso The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of an zzso program on zzso content of zzso and its relation to zzso zzso zzso production in response to zzso zzso Female rats either fed a standard zzso or an zzso high-fat zzso zzso as zzso diet for 8 weeks were subdivided into sedentary zzso and trained zzso zzso Exercise training consisted of continuous running on a zzso zzso treadmill 5 zzso for 8 zzso At the end of this period, all rats in the zzso state were zzso infused with a zzso solution of zzso for 3 h followed by an injection of zzso zzso to block zzso zzso An additional control group consisting of zzso rats fed the zzso diet was infused with saline zzso zzso Plasma zzso zzso was thereafter measured during 90 zzso to estimate zzso zzso Under zzso diet, zzso zzso content and plasma zzso zzso after zzso blockade zzso reflecting zzso synthesis and zzso were not changed in zzso rats, whereas liver zzso content was highly increased zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, training reduced liver zzso protein content in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso fed rats zzso Plasma zzso zzso was also lower zzso in zzso than in zzso rats fed the zzso zzso This effect was not observed in zzso fed zzso Furthermore, the exercise zzso decrease in zzso production in zzso rats was associated with a decrease in liver zzso zzso It is concluded that in addition to a reduction in liver zzso content, exercise training reduces zzso synthesis and/or zzso in zzso fed rats probably via zzso zzso
