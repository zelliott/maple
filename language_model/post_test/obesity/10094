Recent data have suggested that zzso zzso and zzso a 16 zzso zzso which acts centrally to regulate weight gain by suppressing appetite and zzso the sympathetic nervous zzso To exert such effects, it may function as an zzso zzso in the zzso since specific receptors zzso have been recently reported to be widely distributed in the zzso We have speculated that this zzso now known as zzso may act centrally by stimulating the release of zzso hormone zzso a recognized potent zzso zzso of zzso We tested in zzso the effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso in the dose range of zzso zzso zzso The zzso rat zzso incubation system used involved fresh zzso zzso maintained in zzso with consecutive 20 zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso in the medium by a specific and sensitive zzso The effect of zzso zzso at a dose of 1 zzso and 10 zzso was also zzso Any possible zzso of zzso effects by zzso pathways was then explored by zzso zzso with zzso 10 zzso and zzso zzso of the alpha zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso The active zzso but not the zzso zzso caused a zzso stimulation of zzso release in zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso with a plateau effect at a dose of 10 zzso The addition of either zzso or zzso was without effect on zzso zzso zzso These findings are consistent with the reported presence of zzso receptors in the rat brain, and suggest that zzso may act to regulate appetite at least in part by directly modulating the zzso of zzso from the zzso It would also appear that such effect occurs via a zzso zzso
