zzso is a key regulator of tissue zzso including skeletal zzso Because it has been shown that zzso alters the capacity for zzso zzso it is possible that zzso expression is regulated by the intramuscular zzso zzso zzso we have examined the relationship between zzso protein expression and the intramuscular fatty acid zzso in zzso muscles of animals in which the capacity for fatty acid zzso in muscle is increased zzso obese zzso or reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso Rates of zzso incorporation into zzso were determined in zzso red zzso and white zzso zzso muscles of lean and obese zzso rats and in zzso zzso and zzso muscles of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In obese zzso rats, the rate of zzso incorporation into zzso zzso in zzso and zzso muscles were 28 and zzso greater than in lean rats zzso zzso In zzso zzso mice, the rates of zzso incorporation into zzso zzso were lower in zzso zzso and zzso muscle zzso compared with the respective muscles in zzso mice zzso zzso In the obese animals, zzso protein content was reduced in both zzso zzso and zzso muscles zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso mice, zzso protein content was zzso in both zzso zzso P zzso and zzso muscles zzso P zzso In conclusion, from studies in these two animal models, it appears that zzso protein expression is zzso related to components of intramuscular zzso zzso because 1) zzso protein expression is zzso when zzso synthesis rates, an index of intramuscular zzso zzso are increased, and 2) zzso protein expression is zzso when zzso synthesis rates are zzso zzso we speculate that the intramuscular zzso sensing may be involved in regulating the protein expression of zzso in skeletal zzso
