Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of dietary protein content zzso to 230 zzso in zzso 1 and 131 to 251 zzso in zzso 2) and initial growth rate, estimated from live body weight at 4 zzso of age, on growth rate from 4 to 7 zzso of age, nitrogen zzso energy zzso and zzso acid zzso in genetically fat zzso and lean zzso lines of zzso There was no difference between lines in energy zzso either in zzso or in expenditure zzso zzso rate, zzso or zzso zzso The only divergence between lines was in the partition of a similar amount of retained energy between zzso and protein zzso In both experiments, zzso chickens showed greater protein retention efficiency than FL zzso moreover, the zzso line did not appear more sensitive to low dietary protein contents than the FL zzso zzso birds on their growth rate or live body weight at 4 zzso of age resulted in the selection of different rates of zzso Indeed, the zzso FL and zzso chickens differed less in their nitrogen metabolism than did fast-growing birds, which were also zzso The lower protein retention efficiency observed in FL chickens was related to an increase of dietary zzso acid degradation as revealed by a greater rate of zzso acid zzso in the fed zzso
