In our ongoing effort to identify genes influencing the biological pathways that zzso the zzso disturbances associated with zzso we performed zzso scanning in zzso individuals distributed over zzso Caucasian families to zzso quantitative trait zzso zzso which affect variation of plasma zzso zzso analysis using a quantitative trait zzso component linkage method that localized a zzso on zzso zzso which linked to variation in levels of plasma zzso zzso zzso of odds zzso score zzso zzso and was suggestive of linkage to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso linkage included waist zzso zzso insulin, and zzso but not body mass index or hip zzso Plasma zzso zzso levels were suggestively linked to a second zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Five other zzso with lower zzso scores were identified for plasma levels of zzso zzso and total zzso These newly identified zzso likely harbor genetic elements that influence traits underlying zzso zzso associated with zzso
