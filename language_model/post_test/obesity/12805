To determine the zzso profile of minimally absorbed zzso in zzso patients, an zzso zzso study was performed in eight zzso volunteers between 23 and 68 years of zzso Each subject received a single oral dose of 360 zzso zzso containing approximately 400 zzso of zzso zzso zzso blood samples were collected at specified times over 10 hours after administration of zzso for determination of total zzso unchanged zzso and major zzso in the zzso zzso samples were collected over 24 hours and analyzed to evaluate the urinary recovery of total zzso and the profile of zzso zzso in the zzso In addition, all zzso samples were collected and analyzed for total zzso zzso and zzso recovery of the administered dose of total zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso data only) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso observed concentration zzso and time to zzso zzso values of plasma total zzso were 150 zzso 51 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All these parameters obtained in zzso overweight subjects were similar to those reported previously in healthy zzso On the basis of the area under the zzso curve from 0 to 10 hours zzso two major zzso comprise a total of approximately zzso of the total zzso in zzso The primary zzso zzso has a short zzso zzso 2 hours), whereas the secondary zzso zzso disappeared at a slower zzso No zzso apparent difference in the urinary zzso profile was observed between two gender zzso It is concluded that the disposition of zzso appears to be similar between normal and zzso zzso Of the minimal fraction of the dose that was absorbed zzso the presence of two major zzso accounts for approximately zzso
