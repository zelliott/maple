zzso patients with concentric zzso zzso wall zzso or zzso zzso and normal left zzso zzso mass zzso may have poor zzso It is unclear whether zzso function zzso shown to be present in some patients with concentric zzso zzso zzso zzso mass index and relative wall zzso or zzso zzso are also present in patients with concentric zzso To assess zzso zzso chamber, and zzso function in zzso men with concentric zzso clinical and zzso data of 118 zzso men with concentric zzso were compared with data from 104 zzso men with normal relative wall thickness and normal zzso mass zzso Chamber function was assessed by relating zzso fractional zzso to zzso zzso stress, zzso function was assessed by relating zzso fractional zzso to zzso stress, and pump performance was assessed by stroke volume zzso zzso Compared with zzso men with normal relative wall zzso zzso patients had lower stroke volume zzso zzso 20 versus 111 zzso 20 zzso P zzso zzso zzso was no different between the two groups zzso zzso zzso versus 40 zzso zzso zzso but zzso zzso was lower in patients with concentric zzso (20 zzso zzso versus 22 zzso zzso P zzso despite lower zzso stress zzso zzso 25 versus 117 zzso 37 zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso plots classified zzso and zzso respectively, of the concentric zzso patients below the fifth zzso of zzso patients with normal zzso These data indicate that indexes of chamber and zzso function are lower than those observed in zzso patients with normal zzso Thus, zzso of chamber, zzso and pump performance indicate potential abnormalities in zzso function in men with concentric zzso
