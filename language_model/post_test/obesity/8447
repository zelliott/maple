zzso and hypertension are frequently associated with one another, and changes in body weight are usually accompanied by consensual changes in blood zzso 

To examine formally the zzso conditions required for a weight gain to cause a rise in blood pressure in the resting zzso 

The relevant equations were developed, and then used in a simulation to predict blood pressure and peripheral vascular resistance in response to changes in body zzso The model was tested on data taken from published zzso Furthermore, the impact of the composition of the excess weight, zzso fat versus muscle zzso on the zzso of obesity was incorporated into the simulation by using a range of zzso blood flow rates taken from published zzso 

The key zzso of zzso increases in blood pressure is a zzso increase in cardiac zzso which is not fully accounted for by the zzso contribution of new zzso An increase in muscle tissue relative to fat in newly gained weight is a further factor in the blood pressure increase arising from any given level of excess zzso 

The zzso increase in cardiac output in obesity is best attributed to stimulation of cardiac dynamics by the zzso nervous zzso The low resistance of zzso tissue relative to muscle may be the zzso basis for the dominance of zzso mass in multiple zzso analyses of blood pressure zzso in the population; it further suggests that in the obese zzso fat tissue may provide protection against cardiovascular disease by limiting increases in total peripheral zzso
