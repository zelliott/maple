When zzso zzso rats are placed on a diet relatively high in fat and calories zzso zzso half develop zzso obesity zzso while the rest are zzso zzso When fed a low fat zzso diet from zzso zzso and zzso rats weigh the same, but zzso rats have a number of abnormalities of neural function, many of which are zzso when they become obese after chronic exposure to a HE zzso Because of its important role in the regulation of energy zzso in the zzso we examined the ratio of zzso zzso to its zzso zzso acid zzso as an index of zzso turnover in zzso from various brain areas in these zzso While still on zzso both zzso and zzso rats showed lower zzso turnover in most brain areas sampled during the last hour of the light phase, when animals become active and begin zzso for food, as compared to the first hour of the light phase, when animals are generally zzso and not zzso However, unlike zzso rats, zzso rats did not show a significant zzso difference in zzso turnover in either the zzso or zzso zzso zzso When zzso for 48 zzso both zzso and zzso rats showed a generalized zzso decrease in zzso turnover in the zzso nucleus, zzso lateral zzso zzso zzso and motor zzso as compared to their zzso zzso However, zzso zzso rats showed a zzso greater reduction in the zzso nucleus turnover than zzso zzso zzso Finally, when zzso rats became obese after 14 weeks on the HE diet, their abnormalities in zzso zzso turnover at the end of the light phase were zzso Thus, zzso rats show abnormalities of zzso and zzso zzso in brain zzso turnover which may zzso them to become obese when dietary fat and caloric density are zzso Once obesity develops, these zzso like those of several other zzso zzso and zzso are zzso This may contribute to the persistence of obesity once it zzso
