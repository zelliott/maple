The chronic intake of zzso has been linked to insulin resistance, zzso zzso and zzso fatty liver disease zzso which in turn, may progress to zzso zzso zzso We aimed to evaluate the magnitude of the effects of the chronic consumption of zzso zzso and high fat zzso alone or zzso Four groups of male mice were fed different diets for 16 weeks: standard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso diet zzso zzso zzso diet zzso zzso and zzso diet zzso fat, zzso zzso The food intake was not different among the groups, and the body mass was not greater in the zzso group than in the SC zzso The zzso model assessment for insulin resistance zzso as well as zzso total cholesterol and zzso were greater in the groups zzso zzso and zzso group than in the SC zzso We observed in the groups zzso zzso and zzso compared to the group zzso zzso fatty liver disease zzso with a predominance of zzso zzso by zzso and zzso and a reduction of the zzso zzso by zzso We also observed an increase in zzso zzso by the zzso and the zzso zzso we identified areas of zzso indicating a transition from zzso to zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso This study is relevant in demonstrating that zzso consumption, even in the absence of zzso causes serious and deleterious changes in the liver with the presence of the zzso insulin resistance zzso and zzso with areas of zzso These conditions are associated with a poor zzso
