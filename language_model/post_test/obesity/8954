This study investigates whether zzso plasma zzso zzso levels in obese subjects are associated with the number of zzso and their zzso zzso 

zzso subcutaneous and zzso zzso zzso were obtained from 10 female and four male obese subjects (age 37 zzso 8 years; zzso 48 zzso 13 zzso with a wide range of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vascular cells zzso were isolated and cultured and the number of attached zzso zzso per gram zzso tissue zzso The zzso were differentiated in zzso to become zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso in the culture media was zzso zzso rank correlation zzso were calculated between zzso and zzso number and zzso zzso 

zzso criteria: zzso zzso and for severe zzso conditions zzso zzso zzso criteria: severe zzso pathology zzso class zzso history of zzso surgery, manifest zzso 18 years zzso 60 years and for zzso surgery, zzso zzso All females in the study had regular zzso zzso None of participants received zzso zzso 

No association was observed between zzso and zzso zzso zzso More than 90 zzso zzso of the cultured zzso fraction was able to store fat zzso indicating the presence of zzso A strong negative association was observed between zzso zzso number and zzso A strong association was observed between zzso zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso No association was observed between subcutaneous zzso number and zzso zzso and zzso 

In zzso obese subjects, low number of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso profiles is associated with high zzso
