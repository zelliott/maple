High consumption of refined zzso in particular sugar, has been identified as a possible zzso factor in greater risk of excess weight zzso In spite of data limitations, one recent paper suggests that Australian sugar consumption has decreased over the same time period that obesity has increased, a so called zzso zzso Given the significant public health focus on nutrition, we aimed to estimate Australian sugar supply and consumption over recent decades, to determine whether these data could be used to make any conclusions about zzso role in zzso 

Foods high in sugar were zzso Data relating to sugar supply and consumption from 1988 to 2010 were obtained from multiple zzso Using these data we attempted to generate a time series estimate of sugar in Australia's food zzso 

Australia produces and exports sugar from sugar cane and the sugar in imported foods has received little zzso We were unable to produce a reliable and robust estimate of total zzso in the Australian diet due to data limitations and a lack of current data zzso However, available zzso data showed large increases in the volume and value of imported zzso products between 1988 and 2010 to over 30 grams of sugar per person per zzso Value estimates of local production of zzso products also show substantial increases in this zzso 

The Australian zzso assertion is based on incomplete data, as it excludes sugar contained in imported processed foods, which have increased zzso A major Australian public health target is to improve the quality of the food supply, and actions have been set in terms of achieving broader environmental zzso However, evaluation of progress is hampered by lack of high quality data relating to supply and zzso We recommend the regular collection of comprehensive food supply statistics, which include both local production and zzso This would provide an inexpensive addition to survey data and could assist in monitoring sugar consumption trends in food zzso Such information would also help inform public health zzso
