There is increasing interest in zzso zzso fatty liver disease zzso in the ambulatory care zzso The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and zzso features of zzso zzso 

Fifty zzso zzso patients who had not consumed alcohol for at least the previous 3 months were matched with 100 controls by age and gender zzso zzso zzso and nutritional variables were compared between the zzso zzso patients and the zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses were used to identify independent factors associated with zzso zzso
