In humans, a zzso transition at zzso 29 in the region zzso the signal zzso sequence of the transforming growth factor zzso which results in a zzso substitution at zzso 10, has been associated with zzso zzso 

In the present study, we zzso zzso zzso zzso Swedish men born in 1944 to assess the impact of the zzso zzso on zzso including abdominal zzso and estimates of insulin, zzso and zzso metabolism as well as blood zzso 

The frequency of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and the distribution of zzso was in zzso zzso Data analysis showed that zzso had significantly higher body mass index compared to zzso carriers to the zzso zzso In addition, zzso carriers of the zzso zzso had significantly lower abdominal zzso diameter than both zzso and zzso zzso We also found that zzso had significantly higher zzso insulin values as well as higher zzso zzso index in comparison to zzso carriers of the zzso zzso zzso levels were significantly higher in subjects with the zzso zzso compared to subjects with either the zzso or zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that the zzso zzso in the zzso gene zzso might contribute to prevalent diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes zzso
