During zzso in humans, anterior displacement of the zzso is often helpful to relieve airway zzso However, it appears to be less useful in obese zzso The authors tested the possibility that obesity limits the effectiveness of the zzso 

Total muscle paralysis was induced under general zzso in a group of obese persons zzso zzso 9; body mass index, 32 zzso 3 zzso and in a group of zzso persons zzso zzso 9; body zzso index, 21 zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso confirmed that none of them had zzso zzso The zzso area of the zzso was measured zzso at different zzso airway zzso A zzso zzso plot allowed assessment of the mechanical properties of the zzso The influence of zzso advancement on airway zzso was assessed by comparing the zzso zzso relation with and without the maneuver in obese and zzso zzso 

zzso advancement increased the zzso area at a given zzso pressure, and zzso advancement increased the zzso area in zzso but not in obese persons at a given zzso zzso 

zzso advancement did not improve the zzso airway in obese zzso
