In contrast to the zzso sleep zzso syndrome zzso the zzso syndrome zzso is zzso by persistent zzso during the day and zzso zzso during zzso In this study we wanted to know whether work of breathing zzso in a sitting and zzso position separates both zzso 

zzso population: 20 men, zzso zzso zzso years, Body Mass Index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 14 patients, 13 men age: zzso zzso zzso years, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The control group consisted of 10 normal weighted zzso The zzso pressures were assessed by an zzso zzso at the same time, the minute ventilation zzso and the breathing frequency zzso were measured via a zzso The area under the zzso loop was correlated to zzso After reaching steady state zzso zzso and zzso were determined in sitting and zzso zzso 

In the zzso the zzso index zzso was zzso zzso zzso and the respiratory zzso index zzso was zzso zzso zzso The forced zzso volume zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and the vital capacity zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 out of 20 patients suffered from chronic zzso In the zzso the zzso was zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The majority of zzso patients had an airway obstruction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 12 out of 14 patients suffered from chronic zzso Compared to the zzso population zzso in the zzso group was significantly higher both in the sitting zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso and zzso positions zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso Compared to the sitting position zzso and zzso did not change significantly in both groups lying zzso 

Compared to the zzso group at the same zzso the zzso of the zzso population was significantly increased in the sitting and zzso zzso The main reason for these findings may be the increased airway obstruction due to chronic zzso Both populations did not change the breathing patterns during the different zzso
