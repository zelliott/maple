zzso and diet interact to cause type 2 diabetes zzso and zzso zzso has been implicated as one of many genes associated with type 2 diabetes zzso The common assumption is that zzso in zzso lead to excessive zzso production through zzso zzso However, there is an alternative explanation, wherein zzso at the zzso locus could selectively affect zzso expression in zzso zzso The result would be changes in zzso that would affect the storage and release of fatty zzso Here, we present the novel hypothesis that a variety of zzso could arise from zzso of the various zzso control elements of zzso We also suggest specific quantitative zzso traits that would accompany zzso that selectively affect zzso expression in zzso zzso
