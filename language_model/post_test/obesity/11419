The objectives of this study were to zzso examine skeletal muscle fatty acid zzso in individuals with varying degrees of zzso and zzso determine the relationship between skeletal muscle fatty acid zzso and the zzso of zzso fatty zzso Muscle was obtained from zzso zzso zzso zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and extremely obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso females undergoing abdominal zzso zzso muscle fatty acid zzso was assessed in intact muscle zzso zzso fatty zzso zzso were measured in a separate portion of the same muscle tissue in which fatty acid zzso was zzso zzso zzso was 58 and zzso lower in skeletal muscle from extremely obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients, zzso zzso zzso was zzso (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso fatty zzso content was higher in both the zzso and extremely obese patients compared with zzso patients, despite significantly lower fatty acid zzso only in the extremely zzso No associations were observed between zzso fatty zzso content and zzso zzso These data suggest that there is a zzso in skeletal muscle fatty acid zzso with extreme obesity but not zzso and that the zzso of zzso zzso fatty zzso is not solely a result of reduced fatty acid zzso
