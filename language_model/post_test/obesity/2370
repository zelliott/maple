zzso transfer protein zzso is an emerging zzso risk marker that is important in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Plasma zzso activity is elevated in type 2 diabetes zzso whereas zzso may regulate zzso gene zzso in zzso Of interest, common zzso variations that predict cardiovascular disease have been identified zzso We investigated whether the diabetic state is able to amplify relationships between obesity and zzso gene variations with circulating zzso zzso 

Plasma zzso activity zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene score zzso of zzso zzso zzso based on two tagging zzso zzso and zzso zzso and waist circumference were determined in two Dutch zzso zzso 237 patients with type 2 diabetes and 78 control zzso 

Patients with diabetes were more obese zzso zzso for prevalence of increased waist zzso and had zzso higher plasma zzso activity zzso zzso zzso gene score was not different in diabetic and control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was highest in patients with diabetes with an enlarged waist and lowest in control subjects with a normal waist circumference zzso zzso Multiple linear zzso analysis revealed a positive interaction between diabetes status and waist circumference on zzso activity zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Furthermore, diabetes status zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso with zzso gene score to affect zzso zzso 

Type 2 diabetes and enlarged waist circumference interact to impact on plasma zzso zzso Diabetes may also amplify the association between plasma zzso activity and common zzso gene zzso Our findings support the hypothesis that zzso and zzso interactions govern plasma zzso zzso
