zzso substitution at zzso 54 zzso zzso in the fatty zzso protein 2 gene zzso has been associated with zzso and insulin zzso zzso in the activity of delta 6 and 5 zzso is also supposed to be a factor zzso the development of insulin resistance zzso 

We investigated the relationship between zzso zzso in zzso and the impairment of zzso zzso fatty acid metabolism in obese zzso 

zzso obese children zzso During the study, the children continued their habitual diet, which was documented in a zzso food record using household zzso zzso was performed, and serum zzso and fatty acid composition in plasma were zzso The zzso of zzso 54 in the zzso 2 gene was zzso 

The zzso frequency was zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso There were no significant differences in age, body mass index, zzso serum zzso insulin or serum zzso among the three zzso zzso These were also no significant differences in the intake of energy, the percentage of energy nutrients or in the dietary zzso zzso The content of zzso acid zzso in plasma was lowest in zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso were significantly lower than in zzso or zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

In obese children, zzso of the zzso 2 gene is associated with impaired zzso of zzso and reduced AA zzso The results in the zzso profile suggest that zzso may zzso the to development of insulin zzso
