zzso data have shown that obesity independently increases zzso cancer zzso risk, but the mechanisms are poorly zzso zzso is an inflammatory state, and chronic zzso inflammation zzso zzso 

We conducted this zzso study to seek evidence of zzso zzso inflammation and to evaluate effects of zzso weight zzso 

We measured inflammatory zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of 10 obese zzso women zzso zzso zzso body mass index (in zzso 35 zzso zzso before and after weight loss induced by a zzso zzso 

zzso lost a mean zzso of zzso zzso zzso of their initial zzso Weight loss significantly reduced zzso blood zzso total cholesterol, zzso LDL, tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After weight loss, zzso zzso showed a zzso reduction in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein 1 zzso zzso zzso T cell and zzso counts decreased by zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso Gene zzso showed dramatic zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso 3) and nuclear zzso factor zzso Weight loss reduced expression of zzso and zzso genes and zzso zzso stress pathways and the zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso response zzso 

Our data show that zzso weight loss in obese individuals reduces zzso inflammation and greatly zzso inflammatory and zzso gene zzso These data imply that obesity is accompanied by inflammation in the zzso zzso and that zzso weight loss reduces this inflammatory state and may thereby lower zzso zzso
