We aimed to evaluate the predictability of short-term (5 zzso changes in zzso white zzso tissue zzso gene expression for long-term (12 weeks) changes induced by high-fat diet zzso zzso 

Mice were fed zzso diets containing 10 zzso zzso or 40 zzso zzso of zzso Global gene expression in zzso was analyzed using zzso and confirmed by quantitative zzso As expected, zzso feeding resulted in increased body fat zzso and reduced zzso tolerance after 12 zzso A total of zzso transcripts were significantly changed by zzso after 12 weeks and zzso after 5 days, with an overlap of zzso transcripts zzso zzso zzso Of these, zzso were zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso all in the same direction and highly correlated zzso zzso zzso between the time zzso zzso analysis showed zzso of the main identified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was highly zzso confirming its role as an early marker of fat cell zzso 

The high zzso value of short-term gene expression changes for long-term effects of high fat feeding is a promising step to establish robust early zzso that could shorten animal trials to assess zzso food zzso
