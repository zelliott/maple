The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zzso using a modified lateral position in obese patients with zzso zzso zzso obese patients with zzso stones were enrolled zzso zzso The mean stone diameter was zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients were placed in the lateral position, with the energy source facing their body zzso and the site where the stone was located in direct contact with the water zzso Success rate zzso as the percentage of patients who were zzso or with insignificant fragments after 3 zzso mean number of zzso sessions, mean duration of zzso session and complications were zzso The results were compared with those of 17 obese patients zzso zzso with similar baseline characteristics treated in the standard zzso zzso All zzso were performed using the zzso zzso zzso Both success rate zzso zzso zzso for groups A and B, zzso and mean number of sessions zzso zzso zzso did not differ significantly between the two groups zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the time required to complete zzso was significantly shorter for group A patients zzso zzso compared to group B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No severe complications (including zzso zzso were zzso Our data indicate that zzso in the modified lateral position for zzso zzso in obese patients seems to be feasible and zzso In addition, it is faster than in the zzso position since it overcomes technical zzso Further studies with a large number of patients are required to support our zzso
