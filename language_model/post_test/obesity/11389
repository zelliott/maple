zzso the utility of System zzso computer modeling to study and gain insight into the impacts of physical activity and diet on weight gain and zzso 

A holistic System zzso computer model is presented that zzso the processes of human zzso hormonal regulation, body zzso nutrition, and physical zzso These processes are not independent of one another, and the model captures the complex zzso between them in the regulation of body weight and energy zzso The article demonstrates how such an zzso simulation model can serve as a viable laboratory tool for controlled zzso to investigate the impacts of physical activity and diet on body weight and zzso 

In one experiment, weight loss from a moderate level of daily exercise was slightly less than the loss from zzso Although exercise did have a favorable impact on body composition by protecting against the loss in zzso mass zzso it, however, failed to blunt the drop in resting energy expenditure zzso that accompanies zzso weight zzso The smaller loss in zzso did indeed induce a smaller drop in zzso however, the preservation of zzso also affected a relatively larger loss in zzso which, in turn, induced a larger zzso reduction in the zzso zzso The two adaptations almost totally offset one another, causing minimal differences in zzso In a second experiment, exercise regimens of zzso to high-level intensity proved counterproductive as zzso zzso However, when the diet was changed from a balanced composition to one that was highly loaded with zzso it became possible to sustain the intense exercise regimen over the experimental period and achieve a significant drop in body zzso 

The results underscore the significant interaction effects between physical activity, diet, and body composition and demonstrate the utility of computer-based zzso to study, gain insight into, and make predictions about their zzso
