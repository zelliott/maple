To examine the magnitude of overweight and its association with blood pressure zzso among zzso 

zzso study with all children in age range zzso years zzso boys and zzso zzso from two schools catering to urban affluent high zzso class zzso for zzso zzso by trained investigators and zzso measurement by a pediatrician using zzso 

The prevalence of overweight based on conventional body mass index zzso zzso was zzso for boys and zzso for girls but varied for different zzso zzso of high zzso blood pressure zzso was zzso in boys and zzso in girls and increased with increasing levels of zzso weight, zzso skin fold thickness zzso and percent body zzso Mean level of zzso among overweight children was significantly zzso higher by about 12 zzso zzso whereas that for zzso blood pressure was higher by 8 zzso zzso zzso as compared to their zzso zzso zzso zzso This was true in both sexes and for all indicators used for assessing zzso zzso of zzso increased suddenly beyond zzso value of 20 zzso in boys and zzso zzso in girls, beyond zzso value of 12 zzso for boys and 14 zzso for girls whereas such zzso for body fat were above zzso in both zzso These zzso appear much lower than the conventional ones and therefore indicate the need for validation of conventional zzso in different zzso 

Our findings highlight that zzso measurement needs to be a routine part of physical examination in school children, and the use of zzso anchored to zzso risks may be essential for assessment of zzso
