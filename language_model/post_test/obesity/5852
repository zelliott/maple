zzso zzso is an active component in zzso Previous in zzso experiments showed that zzso zzso could inhibit zzso and promote zzso zzso in zzso This study focused on the effect of zzso zzso in insulin resistance and zzso fat deposit in obese mice induced by high fat diet and its molecular zzso zzso male zzso mice induced by high fat diet were randomly divided into the zzso obesity group zzso group), the zzso zzso group zzso zzso and the zzso group zzso group), and continuously fed with high fat zzso In addition, male zzso mice fed with normal diet were selected as the normal group zzso zzso Mice in zzso group and zzso groups were zzso injected with zzso zzso and zzso with the dosage of 20 zzso zzso zzso and 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso NC and zzso groups were zzso injected with the same amount of zzso Two weeks later, the zzso zzso tolerance test zzso was zzso Three days later, the mice were killed, and their serum samples were collected to detect insulin and free fatty acid zzso Their zzso were weighed to examine the zzso content, and a pathological detection was zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were detected by Western zzso The results showed that the treatment with zzso zzso for two weeks could improve the zzso tolerance of obese zzso Except for zzso zzso the areas under the zzso tolerance curve zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso group were less than that in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a much lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The fat level of obese mice was significantly reduced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and so were liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The increased serum zzso of obese mice declined after the treatment of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could partially recover the expression of zzso in zzso zzso but without obvious change in the expressions of zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso The above findings indicated that zzso zzso could reduce the release of zzso and alleviate the zzso deposit of zzso by zzso the expression of zzso in zzso zzso which may be one of its mechanisms for improving the insulin resistance and abnormal zzso metabolism of zzso
