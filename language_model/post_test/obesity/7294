zzso action in the brain contributes to adequate regulation of body weight, zzso survival, and suppression of zzso zzso zzso We previously demonstrated by zzso in lean humans that insulin stimulates activity in beta and zzso frequency bands, whereas this effect was abolished in obese zzso 

The present study aims to define zzso signals associated with the suppression of the zzso response in obese zzso 

We determined zzso zzso of spontaneous zzso activity by zzso during a zzso zzso clamp and related it to measures of zzso fat deposition and zzso of peripheral insulin zzso zzso fat mass and zzso zzso content were zzso by magnetic resonance imaging and zzso Multiple zzso analysis was used to analyze associations of zzso insulin sensitivity and zzso markers related to zzso 

zzso healthy, zzso humans participated in the zzso 

In a multiple regression, zzso stimulation of zzso activity was zzso correlated to body mass index, visceral fat mass, and zzso zzso zzso Although zzso saturated zzso fatty acids zzso the correlations of zzso activity with abdominal and zzso zzso stores, zzso displayed no independent correlation with zzso cortical activity in the zzso frequency zzso 

Thus, insulin action at the level of zzso activity in the brain is diminished in the presence of elevated levels of saturated zzso fatty zzso
