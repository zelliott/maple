To compare effects of different oral zzso drugs as zzso therapy on zzso zzso in type 2 zzso 

Sixty overweight type 2 diabetic patients not on zzso therapy were zzso to zzso zzso or zzso after a zzso dietary zzso Drug doses were zzso for 3 months to zzso zzso and were kept fixed for a further 3 zzso LDL zzso zzso zzso and zzso were prepared by density zzso zzso at zzso and study zzso zzso cholesterol, total zzso and zzso were measured and mass of zzso zzso HDL zzso were prepared by zzso The primary end point was change in proportion of LDL as zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and cholesterol were comparable across groups at baseline and over zzso zzso mass and the zzso ratio fell with zzso zzso mass zzso to zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso P zzso zzso P zzso zzso with no change on zzso zzso reductions were associated with zzso zzso zzso Changes were independent of zzso zzso control, and zzso Total HDL cholesterol increased on zzso zzso to zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not zzso zzso to zzso zzso P zzso zzso or zzso zzso to zzso zzso P zzso zzso largely due to an zzso increase zzso to zzso zzso P zzso zzso cholesterol fell on zzso zzso to zzso zzso P zzso On zzso and zzso the zzso ratio increased compared with no change on zzso 

For the same improvement in zzso control, zzso and zzso produce favorable changes in HDL and LDL zzso compared with zzso in overweight type 2 diabetic zzso Such changes may be associated with reduced zzso risk and may inform the choice of initial oral zzso zzso
