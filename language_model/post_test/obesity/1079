zzso is commonly associated with a high zzso and prevalence of zzso cardiovascular disease and Type II zzso Interestingly, studies have also reported decreased zzso levels in obese zzso This may constitute an independent risk factor in the zzso of coronary artery disease as obese subjects would have a decreased capacity to prevent the zzso modification of zzso zzso which is a mechanism suggested as central to the development of zzso As part of a study to investigate responses to weight loss, we have assessed the effects on zzso status of a decrease in body mass of zzso either after 6 days of complete zzso or 11 days of a very low calorie diet zzso zzso There were significant differences between the two groups in the synthesis rate of zzso zzso in response to weight zzso Both the fractional and the zzso synthesis rate of zzso decreased significantly zzso in the zzso group by zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, no change in synthesis rates was observed in the very low calorie diet group zzso Total zzso concentration of zzso was unaffected by the weight loss within both zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso synthesis is depressed in response to a very rapid weight loss induced by zzso An acute reduction in zzso synthesis in response to a rapid weight loss may constitute a risk factor during periods of increased zzso zzso
