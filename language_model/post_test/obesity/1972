The hormone zzso acts on the brain to regulate zzso zzso and zzso however, its cellular targets and molecular mechanisms of action remain to be fully zzso The zzso which are derived from the precursor zzso zzso are also implicated in the zzso regulation of body zzso zzso zzso express the zzso zzso and thus it is conceivable that the zzso gene itself may be part of the signaling zzso involved in zzso action on the zzso Using in zzso zzso and computerized image analysis, we tested the hypothesis that the zzso gene is a target for regulation by zzso by comparing cellular levels of zzso zzso in the zzso among groups of zzso zzso mice, zzso zzso mice, and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were significantly reduced throughout the zzso nucleus in zzso zzso mice relative to zzso controls, whereas zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso mice were indistinguishable from zzso zzso These observations suggest that one or more products of zzso serve as an zzso link between zzso and the central mechanisms governing body weight regulation and zzso
