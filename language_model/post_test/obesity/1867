zzso formulas have been used to clinically predict whether patients will develop the zzso sleep zzso syndrome zzso However, these models do not take into account the disproportionate zzso anatomy that accompanies zzso independently of zzso 

To determine the accuracy of a zzso model, which combines zzso of the oral cavity with body mass index and neck zzso in predicting whether a patient has zzso 

zzso prospective zzso 

zzso zzso referral sleep clinic and research zzso 

300 consecutive patients evaluated for sleep disorders for the first zzso 

Body mass index, neck zzso and oral cavity zzso were zzso and a model value was calculated for each zzso zzso was used to determine the number of abnormal respiratory events that occurred during zzso Sleep zzso was defined as more than five episodes of zzso or zzso per hour of zzso 

The zzso model had a sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso a specificity of zzso zzso zzso to zzso a positive zzso value of zzso zzso zzso to zzso and a negative zzso value of zzso zzso zzso to zzso No significant discrepancies were revealed in tests of zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso model provides a zzso accurate, and zzso method for predicting whether patients in an ambulatory setting have zzso The model may be clinically useful as a screening tool for zzso rather than as a replacement for zzso
