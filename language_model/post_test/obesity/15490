zzso is influenced by genetic and environmental zzso Additionally, synergistic effects of genes and environments may be important in the development of zzso 

The aim of this study was to test for genetic effects on food consumption frequency, food preferences, and their interaction with subsequent weight zzso 

Complete data on the zzso of consumption of 11 foods typical of the Swedish diet were available for 98 zzso and 176 zzso twin pairs aged zzso y who are part of the Swedish Twin zzso The data were collected in 1973 as part of a questionnaire zzso Body mass index was measured in 1973 and again in zzso 

There was some evidence that genetic effects influenced the frequency of intake of some zzso zzso among zzso twins exceeded that among zzso twins for intake of flour and grain products and fruit in men and women, intake of milk in men, and intake of vegetables and rice in women, suggesting that genes influence preferences for these zzso zzso conducted for twins reared together and apart also suggested greater zzso than zzso zzso but zzso zzso correlations were all zzso suggesting that the genes that affect consumption zzso are not responsible for zzso the relation between the frequency of intake and weight zzso 

zzso effects and the frequency of intake are independently related to change in body mass zzso However, there was no suggestion of differential genetic effects on weight gain that were dependent on the consumption frequency of the foods zzso
