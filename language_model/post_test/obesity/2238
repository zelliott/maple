To investigate the joint influence of physical activity and family history of diabetes on the subsequent risk of developing zzso and Type 2 diabetes among Chinese zzso 

A prospective community-based cohort study was conducted among adults aged 35 years and older during zzso in zzso zzso Four communities (three urban and one zzso were randomly selected from 11 urban districts and two rural zzso zzso and Type 2 diabetes were defined using World Health Organization criteria based on zzso blood zzso concentration and zzso diagnosis, zzso Physical activity, parental diabetes history, and other important zzso were assessed at baseline and in the third-year follow-up zzso 

At study conclusion data were collected from zzso participants zzso rate zzso The zzso cumulative zzso of zzso and Type 2 diabetes was zzso and zzso zzso After adjustment for potential zzso zzso compared with those with positive family history and insufficient physical activity, the adjusted relative risk ratio zzso zzso of developing zzso was zzso zzso zzso for participants with sufficient physical activity and a positive family zzso zzso zzso zzso for participants with insufficient physical activity and a negative family zzso and zzso zzso zzso for participants with sufficient physical activity but a negative family zzso Participants who had a negative family history and insufficient physical activity were also less likely to develop Type 2 diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and participants with a negative family history and sufficient physical activity were the least likely to develop Type 2 diabetes zzso zzso zzso 

zzso physical activity and negative family history of diabetes may jointly reduce the risk of developing zzso and Type 2 diabetes in Chinese zzso
