zzso is a zzso trait that contributes to hypertension and subsequent zzso disease zzso thus, the investigation of genetic variation that zzso individuals to obesity is an important zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is known for its appetite and energy zzso zzso linkage and association studies have suggested that zzso genetic variation contributes to zzso for zzso rendering zzso an attractive candidate for study of disease zzso 

To explore whether common genetic variation at the human zzso locus influences plasma zzso or zzso traits, we systematically zzso the gene for zzso discovery and then zzso common zzso zzso across the locus in an extensively zzso twin sample to determine zzso Finally, we zzso validated the zzso associations using zzso zzso region zzso and zzso analyses in neuroendocrine zzso 

Four common genetic zzso were discovered across the zzso and three were typed in zzso zzso Plasma zzso was highly zzso zzso zzso and genetic zzso was noted between plasma zzso and body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso extending from the zzso promoter zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso predicted not only plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso but also other zzso syndrome zzso zzso studies with zzso zzso reporters confirmed regulatory roles in altering gene expression for both zzso zzso zzso zzso and promoter zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso genetic variation at the zzso locus influences multiple zzso zzso syndrome traits, likely zzso zzso to obesity and subsequent zzso zzso
