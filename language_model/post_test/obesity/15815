zzso is not only associated with zzso zzso but also with cognitive dysfunction and changes in the central nervous zzso The present pilot study was carried out to investigate functional connectivity in obese and non-obese adolescents using zzso zzso 

zzso recordings were performed in 11 obese zzso zzso zzso zzso and 8 lean zzso zzso zzso zzso female adolescents (age zzso zzso during an zzso zzso zzso From these recordings, the synchronization likelihood zzso a common method that estimates both linear and zzso zzso between zzso signals, was calculated within and between brain regions, and within standard frequency bands zzso zzso zzso zzso beta and zzso The obese adolescents had increased synchronization in delta zzso zzso and beta zzso zzso frequency bands compared to lean controls zzso total) zzso zzso zzso total) zzso zzso 

This study identified increased zzso functional connectivity in severe obese zzso Considering the importance of functional zzso between brain areas for cognitive zzso the present findings strengthen the hypothesis that obesity may have a major impact on human brain zzso The cause of the observed excessive synchronization is unknown, but might be related to disturbed motivational zzso the recently demonstrated increase in white matter volume in obese subjects or altered zzso processes like zzso The question arises whether the changes in brain structure and communication are a dynamic process due to weight gain and whether these effects are zzso or zzso
