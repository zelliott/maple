Most of the cardiovascular risk factors strongly associated with obesity and overweight vary with age and zzso However, few reference values are available for healthy European zzso Our objective was to establish pediatric reference ranges for waist zzso zzso and zzso blood pressures, zzso zzso levels zzso cholesterol, zzso zzso cholesterol, zzso zzso cholesterol, and zzso zzso and zzso 

A representative sample of 1976 healthy French individuals zzso female participants and zzso male zzso aged 7 to 20 years was used to obtain zzso and zzso normal ranges for each of the zzso cardiovascular risk factors, based on the zzso and Wright zzso 

Mean waist circumference increased with age in both genders and was slightly higher in males than in zzso Whereas zzso blood pressure increased gradually with age, with the increase being steeper in males than in zzso no gender effect was found for zzso blood pressure, which was therefore modeled after pooling males and zzso Total cholesterol, zzso zzso cholesterol, zzso zzso cholesterol, and zzso values varied little with age and zzso zzso and insulin levels revealed zzso peaks, which were sharper in females than in zzso reflecting the normal insulin resistance during zzso 

These ranges can be used as references for European children to monitor cardiovascular risk factors and to plan interventions and education zzso
