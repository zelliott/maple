What are the relationships between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso ratio and the zzso of zzso and zzso syndrome zzso in zzso Chinese women with zzso zzso syndrome zzso 

There is a relatively high zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso Chinese women with zzso especially in patients without zzso Patients with zzso are more obese, and have a more adverse zzso and zzso zzso profile and higher zzso levels and zzso zzso The increased zzso levels and zzso ratio and the zzso are strongly associated with zzso suggesting that there is an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases in these zzso 

zzso and zzso have been widely studied in women with zzso but to date no data from zzso Chinese subjects have been zzso The zzso ratio has been reported to be strongly associated with zzso and insulin resistance zzso and to be a reliable zzso that reflects zzso disturbances and the potential to develop zzso but its relationship with zzso is zzso DESIGN This zzso study included zzso patients with zzso and zzso control women between 17 and 40 years of age from a population in zzso China during zzso 

The diagnosis of zzso was based on the revised 2003 Rotterdam zzso The control group, consisting of women with zzso due to a zzso obstruction or the husband's infertility, women undergoing a zzso check and healthy volunteers, was recruited from the same hospital during the same zzso All women were not taking any medication known to affect zzso or zzso or hormone metabolism for at least 3 months prior to the study, and were studied during the zzso phase of their zzso zzso zzso was assessed by the National zzso Education zzso treatment Panel zzso III criteria modified for Asian zzso zzso was defined by one or more of the following conditions: zzso total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso 

The prevalence of zzso in patients with zzso was zzso about two times than that in the controls, zzso The most common components of zzso in patients with zzso were decreased zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso patients with zzso had significantly higher zzso ratios, and lower zzso and zzso levels when compared with the controls or patients without zzso and had significantly higher zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso insulin and zzso levels, zzso model assessment zzso zzso levels, zzso levels, zzso indexes, zzso zzso and zzso ratios when compared with all of the control women, with or without zzso and patients without zzso The frequency of zzso in patients with zzso was zzso more than five times than that in the zzso The main two risk factors were increased waist circumference and low zzso zzso In the four zzso zzso based on the Rotterdam criteria, the zzso and/or zzso presented the highest prevalence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that increased zzso levels, an increased zzso ratio and zzso was strongly associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso after adjustment for zzso 

The relatively minor limitations of this study are discussed within the zzso zzso TO OTHER zzso The zzso patterns found in zzso Chinese with zzso are compared with that of other zzso
