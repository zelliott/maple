To report on a new zzso approach developed for the assessing zzso in obesity zzso project and the likely population health benefit and strength of evidence for 13 potential obesity prevention interventions in children and adolescents in zzso 

We used the best available evidence, including evidence from zzso zzso study designs, to determine the health benefits as body mass index zzso units saved and zzso life years zzso zzso We developed new methods to model the impact of zzso on zzso zzso where this was not measured and the impacts on zzso over the child's lifetime (on the assumption that changes in zzso were maintained into zzso A working group of zzso provided input into decisions on the selection of interventions, the assumptions for zzso and the strength of the zzso 

The likely health benefit varied zzso as did the strength of the evidence from which that health benefit was zzso The greatest health benefit is likely to be achieved by the zzso of TV advertising of high fat and/or high sugar foods and drinks to zzso zzso adjustable gastric zzso and the zzso zzso zzso with an active physical education zzso zzso 

The use of consistent methods and common health outcome measures enables valid comparison of the potential impact of interventions, but comparisons must take into account the strength of the evidence zzso Other considerations, including zzso and zzso to zzso will be presented in future zzso zzso Information gaps identified include the need for new and more effective initiatives for the prevention of overweight and obesity and for better evaluations of public health zzso
