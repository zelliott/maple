The loss of information from zzso a continuous outcome is well documented in the zzso One advantage of zzso is that it allows zzso of odds ratio parameters through a zzso zzso zzso The objective of this paper is to develop a new zzso of the same odds ratio parameters through zzso analysis on the original continuous outcome without the inherent loss of information caused by zzso Through a zzso zzso development the relative sample sizes required to attain a specified power when testing the odds ratio zzso are compared for the zzso procedure and the proposed zzso The comparison highlights the substantial sample size savings attained by the proposed approach, particularly for large values of the odds ratio zzso and for small proportions of zzso successes or zzso In a zzso Carlo simulation the zzso and absolute biases of the two odds ratio zzso and the length of their respective confidence intervals again demonstrate the improvement attained by the proposed zzso In addition, coverage probabilities of the confidence intervals of the proposed approach zzso quickly to the nominal zzso The cost savings due to the reduction in required sample size when using this method make it a very attractive study design and analysis tool for medical zzso
