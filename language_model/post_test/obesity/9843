Many zzso measures, including body mass index zzso zzso ratio zzso and subcutaneous fat zzso are used as indicators of nutritional status, fertility and zzso of future health zzso While zzso is currently the best available estimate of body zzso zzso and zzso thickness at various sites zzso zzso zzso and zzso are used as zzso of body fat zzso Copy number variation zzso is an attractive emerging approach to the study of associations with various zzso In this study, we investigated the dosage effect of genes in the zzso zzso widely associated with fat distribution zzso in large zzso We used the zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso data of zzso healthy unrelated adults in zzso zzso and identified zzso associated with zzso and fat zzso traits including zzso and subcutaneous zzso thickness at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of each zzso was performed using Golden zzso zzso zzso and single zzso analysis was used to identify zzso associated with each zzso We found one zzso for zzso zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso at the zzso significance level after zzso zzso Genes included in the zzso were used for the analysis of functional zzso using the Database for zzso zzso and Integrated Discovery zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso analysis identified five significant gene clusters zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso family members, and zinc finger zzso for zzso three zzso zzso zinc finger zzso zzso for zzso and one zzso for zzso zzso was excluded from this analysis because the entire structure of no gene was identified in the zzso Based on the analysis of genes enriched in the zzso the fat distribution traits of zzso zzso were related to the fat zzso associated with the aging zzso In addition to structural variation, dosage effect analysis of genes based on zzso is useful to gain an understanding of the comprehensive biological phenomena underlying particular zzso and/or zzso
