This study investigated the effects of dietary zzso zzso acid zzso in the form of free fatty acid zzso or zzso zzso on serum and liver zzso composition and gene expression associated with zzso and zzso in zzso zzso obese zzso zzso Animals were fed a control diet, zzso zzso supplemented with zzso zzso or zzso supplemented with zzso zzso for 8 zzso zzso with both forms of zzso significantly reduced the weights of whole body and zzso tissue and was positively associated with significant liver zzso Both forms of zzso significantly decreased serum zzso zzso but had no effect on total cholesterol levels, which were increased in mice fed zzso There was a prominent increase in serum zzso zzso zzso levels in mice that received either form of zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso including the expression of genes for fatty acid zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly lower in the zzso of mice that received zzso as compared to zzso The gene expressions of zzso regulatory element binding zzso zzso in both liver and zzso tissue were suppressed in mice that were fed either form of zzso as compared to the mice fed zzso alone, whereas there were no increases in the levels of expression of zzso zzso These findings demonstrated that free and zzso forms of zzso have differing effects on liver and zzso tissue zzso
