An activity that enhances insulin release from zzso rat pancreatic zzso has recently been isolated from human serum zzso zzso weight zzso zzso To characterize this activity we have studied the zzso effect of serum zzso from obese and non-obese children obtained by zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso The serum zzso activity zzso in the zzso system at zzso minutes, which corresponded to the retention time of the zzso zzso zzso isolated from bovine zzso zzso activity was found in serum zzso from both obese and zzso zzso The relative zzso potency of the active zzso was higher than that of the original total serum zzso indicating the presence of some zzso which inhibit insulin zzso in the total serum zzso zzso zzso loading increased the relative zzso activity in the zzso zzso from obese zzso This study suggests that the insulin zzso in human serum might be identical to zzso zzso zzso as these substances behave similarly on zzso zzso and have parallel zzso zzso
