Worldwide, the high prevalence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso cause of zzso infertility, is an evolutionary paradox, which provides insight into the zzso of zzso human populations to cardiovascular disease and zzso We propose that zzso Type 2 diabetes zzso and the zzso zzso are modern zzso expressions of a zzso zzso attuned to the dietary and energetic conditions of the zzso This zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso persisted at high prevalence throughout the entire agrarian zzso around 12,000 years ago until zzso zzso we zzso because it zzso a fertility advantage in an environment defined by chronic and often severe seasonal food zzso zzso we argue that genetic adaptations to a high zzso low protein agrarian diet, with increased sensitivity to insulin action, were constrained because these adaptations compromised fertility by raising the lower bound of body weight and energy intake optimal for zzso and zzso After 1800, the progressive zzso of dietary energy zzso released human populations from this zzso This release, through the powerful mechanism of fertility selection, increased, in decades rather than centuries, the prevalence of a zzso better suited to zzso zzso This putative mechanism for rapid and recent human evolution can explain the lower zzso to zzso of today's zzso zzso This hypothesis predicts that the increasing rates of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, which typically accompany economic development, will be tempered by natural, but particularly zzso selection against the zzso ancestral zzso that currently zzso zzso
