zzso zzso zzso zzso have been shown to mimic insulin action in zzso and in intact zzso but it is not known which zzso is involved in insulin action under zzso conditions, nor is it known whether insulin resistance alters the zzso profile under such zzso We therefore investigated the effects of zzso zzso on changes in the zzso of serum zzso zzso substances zzso in healthy men and insulin resistant zzso zzso zzso zzso Two classes of zzso were partially zzso from serum before and after zzso zzso The first was zzso from an zzso exchange zzso with zzso pH zzso and zzso was determined by zzso of zzso zzso in zzso The second was zzso with zzso pH zzso and zzso was determined by zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso In healthy men, the zzso of the pH zzso zzso was not altered by zzso zzso whereas zzso of the pH zzso zzso increased to approximately zzso of the zzso zzso value at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso There was no change in either zzso after zzso zzso in the zzso zzso These data suggest that the pH zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso effect on peripheral zzso zzso in man under zzso zzso The data further show, for the first time, a defective change in the zzso of an insulin zzso isolated from zzso humans after zzso suggesting that inadequate zzso of zzso is associated with insulin zzso
