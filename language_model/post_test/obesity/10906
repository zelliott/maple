zzso and retrospective cohort zzso 

Mexican American children, ages 5-11 zzso zzso zzso were studied in zzso zzso zzso zzso boys zzso zzso and retrospective zzso zzso zzso boys zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and heights zzso were extracted from each child's school medical zzso zzso were made by the school nurses (one nurse per zzso Body mass index zzso zzso was calculated from obtained weights and zzso 

The prevalence of obesity in the zzso sample was zzso for girls and zzso for zzso The highest prevalence was noted in 4th grade for both the girls zzso and boys zzso The 5 year zzso rates derived from the retrospective sample were zzso for girls and zzso for zzso The largest increase in the number of girls becoming obese was observed between K and 1st grade zzso The largest increase for boys was found between the 1st and 2nd grades zzso zzso zzso parameters were calculated to estimate the probability of becoming obese in 5th grade given a child's K zzso Using the generated zzso zzso in K equal to zzso zzso and zzso would have a zzso zzso and zzso probability of being obese by 5th zzso 

This study provides schools with a simple procedure for identifying Mexican American children at risk for zzso This procedure may assist in the development and zzso of interventions aimed at averting the onset of obesity in this zzso
