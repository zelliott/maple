The aim of this study was to investigate the differences in body composition between physically active and inactive patients with chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso and the relationship of obesity zzso to body mass index zzso and percentage of fat mass zzso with physical activity in the daily life zzso in this zzso 

Body composition zzso zzso zzso and level of zzso zzso monitors zzso and zzso were evaluated in 74 patients with COPD zzso men, 65 zzso 9 years old, zzso zzso 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso 27 zzso 6 zzso zzso Patients were divided in two groups: physically active zzso zzso of physical activity of at least moderate intensity, or zzso zzso and inactive zzso not achieve these zzso The sample was also classified according to zzso zzso normal weight, overweight, and zzso and their zzso zzso zzso high zzso and zzso zzso 

In the whole group, zzso moderate correlated zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso but not with zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso inactive patients had higher body weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and lower zzso as % of body weight zzso zzso zzso than active zzso zzso patients zzso to zzso had a worse zzso level than zzso and zzso patients zzso zzso A poorer zzso level occurred in zzso obese patients zzso zzso zzso despite the weak correlation between zzso and zzso moderate in the whole zzso 

zzso active patients with COPD have zzso more zzso and less zzso than inactive zzso More pronounced physical zzso occurs in obese patients, although body composition does not qualify as an important correlate factor of the level of zzso in patients with zzso
