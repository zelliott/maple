zzso tissue development is tightly regulated by altering gene zzso zzso are strong zzso regulators of zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso might influence human zzso by targeting specific zzso zzso We identified zzso that showed varying abundance during the differentiation of human zzso into zzso Among them, zzso strongly affected zzso zzso as zzso zzso impaired zzso and reducing zzso enhanced zzso A key zzso of zzso actions was the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a major regulator of zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso zzso expression by targeting both the zzso zzso coding and 3' untranslated zzso zzso tissue from obese women contained significantly lower zzso and higher zzso zzso levels than that from zzso zzso Our findings reveal that zzso reduces zzso by zzso zzso zzso and suggest that zzso in this regulation is linked to human zzso
