The present study evaluated the effect of nutritional imbalances during pregnancy, either by excess or zzso on fertility and zzso development in zzso zzso zzso zzso Twenty-five zzso zzso were zzso from mating to zzso with a standard diet fulfilling either zzso folds their daily maintenance requirements for pregnancy zzso group, zzso zzso zzso or only the 50% of such requirements zzso group, zzso zzso zzso Ten out of 12 overfed but only two out of 13 underfed zzso became pregnant zzso Fetal development was determined in the pregnant females at Days 35, 50, 75 and 90 of zzso The zzso from undernourished zzso were smaller than the zzso from overfed females as early as at 35 days of pregnancy zzso and remained smaller until Day 90 of zzso However, at the end of pregnancy, there were significant changes in the zzso patterns of zzso Thus, weight and size of the offspring from both nutritional treatments were finally similar at zzso the same was found at zzso There was thereafter a sex-related effect on the growth during the zzso period, with male zzso of both nutritional origins being significantly heavier and more zzso at weaning that their sisters zzso In conclusion, fetal growth zzso by zzso from zzso stages is mainly regulated at the end of the pregnancy, so that ensure an adequate zzso and size and, therefore, the survival of the zzso zzso the zzso development of the offspring is affected by sex, independently from nutritional origin, with male zzso growing faster than zzso
