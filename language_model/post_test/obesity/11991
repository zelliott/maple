zzso adolescents achieve less moderate to vigorous physical activity zzso than zzso zzso but the nature and extent of the deficit is zzso This study aimed to describe differences in zzso across weight status categories by domain of activity zzso play, and active zzso and specific zzso zzso team sports, playground games, and zzso using minutes of activity, estimated intensity, and estimated energy expenditure as metrics of zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso data were collected on a random sample of 2,200 Australian children aged zzso zzso zzso of activity, intensity zzso zzso of tasks zzso and energy expenditure zzso within each domain were estimated using an energy cost zzso 

zzso adolescents reported 174 zzso lower zzso energy expenditure than zzso peers zzso zzso more than accounting for the entire difference in total daily energy expenditure zzso zzso Of this difference, 121 zzso was associated with lower sports participation zzso zzso and 45 zzso with less free play zzso zzso zzso There were no differences in minutes of active transport or in reported activity intensity across weight status categories in sport, free play, or active zzso The differences in zzso participation between obese and zzso adolescents were largely because of different levels of participation in team sports, zzso partner sports zzso and dancing zzso 

More than two-thirds of the difference in energy expenditure between obese and zzso Australian adolescents was because of lower participation in zzso Strategies for engaging obese adolescents in sport may help to zzso deficits in energy zzso
