The aim of the current study was to investigate the relationship between the zzso zzso Efficiency Slope zzso and traditional measures of zzso function in an zzso pediatric zzso zzso treadmill exercise testing with indirect zzso was completed on 56 obese children aged zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso threshold zzso were zzso In line with comparable research in zzso samples, zzso and zzso zzso were both correlated with zzso zzso and VT zzso zzso in the obese pediatric zzso zzso were also found with zzso zzso including height zzso body surface area zzso body mass zzso and fat free mass zzso In comparing our data to a published sample of healthy weight children, zzso and zzso exercise zzso were both higher in our obese zzso However, when we adjusted for any of body mass zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso the obese children were found to be less zzso The results of this study suggest the use of zzso to be an appropriate measure of efficiency of ventilation and zzso function in obese children, while also showing that our sample of obese children were less efficient on a per zzso basis when compared with their healthy weight zzso
