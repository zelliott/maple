The prevalence of obesity in adults and children is rapidly increasing across the zzso Several general zzso zzso associated with obesity have been zzso but the specific impact of these zzso on drug metabolism and elimination and its consequences for drug dosing remains largely zzso In order to broaden our knowledge of this area, we have reviewed and summarized clinical studies that reported clearance values of drugs in both obese and non-obese zzso Studies were classified according to their most important zzso or elimination zzso This resulted in a structured review of the impact of obesity on zzso and elimination zzso including phase I zzso phase II zzso liver blood flow, zzso zzso and zzso zzso This literature study shows that the influence of obesity on drug metabolism and elimination greatly differs per specific zzso or elimination zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is lower in obese as compared with non-obese zzso In contrast, clearance of drugs primarily zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso mechanisms, zzso zzso zzso or zzso appears higher in obese versus non-obese zzso Additionally, in obese patients, trends indicating higher clearance values were seen for drugs zzso via zzso zzso zzso and zzso while studies on zzso drugs showed somewhat zzso zzso Very limited information is available in obese children, which prevents a direct comparison between data obtained in obese children and obese zzso Future clinical studies, especially in children, adolescents and zzso obese individuals, are needed to extend our knowledge in this clinically important area of adult and zzso clinical zzso
