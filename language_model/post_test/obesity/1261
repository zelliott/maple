zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that may be of importance in the zzso of zzso zzso Because of the known link between obesity and hypertension, we hypothesized that decreased responsiveness to zzso might be seen in an obese zzso zzso In this study, the in zzso zzso actions of zzso zzso were compared in zzso lean zzso zzso 7) and obese zzso zzso rats zzso zzso zzso zzso dose zzso lowered mean zzso pressure in both zzso but the zzso dose zzso was zzso higher in zzso rats zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the duration of effect was markedly reduced in the zzso rats, to 1-2 zzso from about 5 zzso in the lean zzso There was no evidence for an increased rate of degradation of zzso in the zzso zzso Although the rats used in this study were not zzso zzso had reduced sensitivity and duration of zzso The evidence suggests possible defects at the target zzso or altered metabolism of zzso in zzso
