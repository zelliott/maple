The primary objective of this study was to further determine the mechanisms by which zzso prevents obesity induced by zzso 

Female zzso zzso rats were randomly assigned to 6 groups: a zzso zzso an zzso zzso control zzso 3 zzso groups orally administered 400 zzso zzso 1,200 zzso zzso and 3,600 zzso zzso of an zzso preparation, respectively, and an zzso group receiving zzso zzso of zzso All animals were allowed free access to a high-fat diet and water for 4 zzso Some zzso including zzso zzso Y zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin and zzso zzso were measured by zzso
