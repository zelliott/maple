The aim of this study was to evaluate in zzso women (10 sedentary obese zzso the effects of 10 days of exercise on the suppression of whole body and regional zzso by zzso zzso was determined using zzso infusion and zzso of zzso zzso tissue during a zzso zzso clamp zzso zzso and 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were positioned in abdominal and zzso zzso zzso tissue to monitor zzso zzso and blood zzso zzso plasma zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso before and after training, respectively zzso zzso Plasma zzso was suppressed to a greater extent after zzso 47 zzso zzso zzso and 42 zzso zzso zzso of zzso than before zzso 62 zzso zzso zzso and 55 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The rate of appearance of zzso was suppressed to 49 zzso zzso and 40 zzso zzso of zzso during zzso and to 38 zzso zzso and 30 zzso zzso of zzso during zzso zzso zzso before and after training, zzso There were no differences in the suppression of zzso in abdominal as well as zzso zzso zzso tissue as evidenced by similar reductions in zzso zzso levels before and after training in each of these zzso The results indicate that the zzso response to insulin can be improved through endurance exercise zzso zzso zzso tissue or skeletal muscle may be the site of improved zzso response to insulin after training, as improvement was not evident in abdominal or zzso zzso zzso zzso
