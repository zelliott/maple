zzso calcium concentration has recently been shown to predict cardiovascular mortality in a large zzso zzso Since impaired zzso tolerance zzso is an independent cardiovascular risk factor, we examined the association between zzso intolerance and serum calcium in a zzso cohort zzso To characterize this association, we measured total serum zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso D zzso and zzso D zzso levels in a cohort of zzso randomly selected white individuals aged 40 to 65 years in whom an oral zzso tolerance test had been zzso In zzso zzso the zzso plasma zzso was positively associated with increasing total serum calcium and zzso in men and women after adjustment for age, zzso season, and zzso The adjusted odds ratio zzso between increasing zzso of total serum calcium and zzso was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso The OR comparing the top with the bottom zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso The association with zzso of serum zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso These data suggest that zzso is associated with an increase in both total serum calcium and zzso that cannot be explained by zzso by aging, zzso or zzso This relationship may explain the previously observed association between serum calcium and cardiovascular zzso Whether this association is a manifestation of a shared cellular zzso or represents a common relationship with an unknown zzso factor are important questions for further zzso
