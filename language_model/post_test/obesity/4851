zzso activity zzso zzso the most variable component of energy zzso can account for differential capacities for human weight zzso Also highly zzso spontaneous physical activity zzso may similarly affect weight balance in zzso In the following study, we zzso the rat model of zzso the zzso obese zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso rat strain, to investigate how access to a high-fat diet alters zzso and the associated energy expenditure zzso zzso zzso and DR rats showed no differences in the amount of zzso before access to the high-fat zzso After 29 days on a high-fat diet, the zzso rats showed significant decreases in zzso whereas the DR rats did zzso Next, we wanted to determine whether the zzso and DR rats showed differential sensitivity to zzso of zzso into the zzso nucleus of the zzso zzso zzso guide zzso were zzso aimed at the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in 500 zzso was zzso through the guide zzso into the zzso then zzso and energy expenditure were measured for 2 zzso Using the response to vehicle as a zzso the DR rats showed significantly greater increase in zzso compared with the zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso obesity is associated with decreases in zzso and a lack of increase in zzso A putative mechanism for changes in zzso that accompany obesity is a decreased sensitivity to the zzso effects of zzso such as zzso
