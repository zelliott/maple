zzso which is often associated with diabetes, is increasingly encountered in the zzso population, and this may produce difficulty in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso when used in place of zzso zzso increase zzso and infectious complications in these already challenged zzso 

This prospective study was undertaken to assess the feasibility of zzso zzso zzso creation in 71 obese patients zzso zzso zzso zzso We performed a zzso zzso in which zzso zzso formation was followed by subcutaneous zzso of the zzso component for safe and easy zzso 

zzso suitable for zzso having blood flows of 799 zzso 285 zzso and sufficient to perform adequate zzso zzso zzso were achieved in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso rates were zzso and 59% at 6 and 12 months, respectively, and secondary zzso rates were zzso both at 6 and 12 zzso 

zzso does not prevent successful zzso zzso zzso formation, and may protect zzso zzso vessels from the zzso damage that occurs before the onset of zzso zzso
