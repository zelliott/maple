The relationship between five zzso measures zzso mass index, waist to hip ratio, zzso index, waist circumference and waist to height zzso and seven cardiovascular risk factors zzso cholesterol, high and low density zzso cholesterol, ratio of total cholesterol to high density zzso and ratio of high density zzso to low density zzso cholesterol, zzso and zzso blood zzso were studied in 165 men and 202 women aged between 40 and 69 years living in an urban area of Cambridge, zzso zzso between the zzso measures varied between zzso and zzso and were generally higher in males than zzso Tests of zzso of the five correlation zzso for each risk factor revealed no significant zzso for zzso but significant differences for high density zzso and ratio of total cholesterol to high density zzso were found in zzso zzso to hip ratio showed the highest correlations with the risk factors in women (3 out of zzso but no consistent pattern was found for zzso Males had significantly lower cholesterol, low density zzso cholesterol levels than females for any given waist to hip ratio and zzso index, waist circumference and waist to height zzso In addition, men also had lower total cholesterol to high density zzso cholesterol and high density zzso cholesterol to low density zzso cholesterol levels for waist to hip ratio or zzso zzso
