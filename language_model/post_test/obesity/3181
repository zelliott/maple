The energy restriction is the most common nutritional approach to treat zzso whose efficiency depends on zzso response against changes in body zzso In that context, the aim of the present work was to in zzso examine the zzso zzso of obese volunteers by the zzso breath test, before and after weight zzso zzso volunteers zzso and zzso zzso 16 controls zzso mass zzso zzso zzso and 16 obese zzso mass zzso zzso zzso who followed a caloric restriction program for 10 weeks zzso zzso Before and after zzso the zzso breath test was performed by zzso of 1 zzso zzso and 20 zzso zzso dissolved in 200 zzso orange zzso Breath samples were recovered at baseline and at 10 zzso intervals for 2 h after zzso The zzso in breath was measured by isotope ratio mass zzso and the percentage of zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso The percentage of oxidized zzso marginally tended to be lower in obese than in controls zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso After the intervention, the mean of weight loss was zzso zzso zzso p zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso statistically increased zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso p zzso In fact, the body weight and the percentage of oxidized zzso were zzso related zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Thus, the zzso in zzso showed the zzso adaptation of obese volunteers treated by zzso intake and provided new information about the weight loss process induced by an zzso zzso
