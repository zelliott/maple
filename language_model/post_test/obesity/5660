Among obese subjects, zzso zzso in both males and females is not as uncommon as previously zzso Whereas this finding was extensively evaluated in zzso mostly in the context of zzso zzso syndrome, little attention has been paid to obese males with zzso zzso As zzso seems to be a marker for insulin resistance, the present study was designed to evaluate the hypothesis that the clinical syndrome of obesity and zzso would take a different clinical course than that of simple zzso 

To characterize the course of zzso zzso and obesity in zzso we examined 22 children and adolescents with this complex, together with their parents and grandparents and found them to follow a zzso sequence of the zzso zzso We compared the findings to 13 zzso males with obesity but no clinical apparent zzso zzso We analyzed the clinical course, fat distribution, zzso insulin and zzso and zzso 

zzso of obesity in the zzso syndrome group was at a mean age of zzso years, as compared to zzso years in the zzso The zzso syndrome patients had a zzso zzso distribution of fat and their zzso blood zzso was significantly zzso zzso cholesterol was zzso zzso of the zzso suggested zzso dominant inheritance of the obesity and zzso zzso complex, extending to hypertension and zzso heart disease in the parents' generation, and further extending to include diabetes type 2 in the grandparents' zzso 

This zzso syndrome is inherited as an zzso dominant zzso with onset of zzso obesity at age zzso years, zzso zzso during childhood or adolescence, extending to hypertension and zzso heart disease during young adulthood, and further extending to include diabetes type 2 in late zzso It is recommended that such children should be followed up as an zzso group, and would probably benefit from intensive weight reduction, which may prevent the later manifestations of the zzso
