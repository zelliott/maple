The zzso of zzso cancer has been rising over the past few decades along with a parallel increase in zzso zzso studies have provided evidence for a potential association between the zzso By contrast, clinical data for a link between type 2 diabetes zzso a condition strongly associated with zzso and zzso cancer are limited and largely not supportive of such an zzso zzso leads to zzso a zzso state, and insulin resistance, which, in turn, leads to high circulating insulin and zzso growth zzso levels, thereby possibly increasing the risk for zzso zzso Thus, insulin resistance possibly plays a pivotal role in underlying the observed association between obesity and zzso cancer, potentially leading to the development and/or progression of zzso cancer, through its zzso with other factors including zzso growth zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this review, zzso and clinical evidence and potential mechanisms underlying the proposed association between obesity and zzso cancer risk are zzso If the association between obesity and zzso cancer demonstrated in zzso studies proves to be zzso targeting obesity zzso downstream zzso of zzso could be of importance in the prevention and management of zzso zzso
