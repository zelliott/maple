The aim of the study was to zzso the differential role of the zzso and zzso in the regulation of zzso of the gut hormones, zzso gastric zzso zzso and zzso and the pancreatic hormones, insulin, zzso and pancreatic zzso in zzso We measured the plasma levels of the hormones (and zzso during zzso and after a test meal in 34 obese patients, of whom 5 were waiting for bypass surgery and 29 had had a zzso bypass with a zzso or zzso zzso ratio between the functioning segments 3, 9, or 15 months zzso The major findings were that surgery bypass zzso has no important influence on the levels of zzso and pancreatic zzso zzso reduces the level of gastric zzso zzso insulin (and zzso and enhances the pancreatic zzso level, independently of the zzso ratio, and zzso increases zzso zzso most effectively so with a short zzso and long zzso segment left in zzso These findings suggest that the upper zzso and terminal zzso has no important role in regulation of zzso of these hormones apart from that in zzso in zzso which is related to the length of functioning zzso
