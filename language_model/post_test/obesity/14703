To zzso measure habitual physical activity and sedentary zzso in a clinical sample of obese children and to compare with zzso and zzso non-obese zzso 

zzso comparison of obese children matched for age and gender with non-obese zzso 

A total of 116 obese children zzso mass index zzso or zzso zzso and 53 non-obese control children zzso zzso zzso were matched with 53 of the obese children zzso age zzso zzso zzso years; 25 M and 28 zzso 

zzso physical activity and sedentary zzso were measured over a zzso period using zzso zzso Total physical activity zzso zzso count per minute zzso percentage of monitored time in sedentary zzso light and moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity zzso were zzso 

zzso children zzso spent on average zzso of their monitored time in sedentary zzso and zzso of their monitored time in zzso Total activity zzso zzso was significantly higher in the non-obese group zzso than the obese group zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso 7, zzso Time spent in sedentary zzso averaged zzso zzso zzso in the obese group and zzso zzso zzso in the non-obese group, with no significant zzso difference zzso zzso zzso zzso Light intensity activity was similar in the obese and non-obese groups zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Participation in zzso was significantly higher in the non-obese vs obese group zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This study supports the hypothesis that a clinical sample of obese children is less physically active than non-obese children, although the difference in total activity and zzso between the groups was zzso
