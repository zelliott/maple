To determine in black and white youths the degree to which zzso and cardiovascular fitness zzso explained independent proportions of the zzso in zzso insulin zzso 

Youths 14 to 18 years of age zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso was measured after a 12-hour zzso zzso body fat zzso was measured with zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined with a zzso treadmill zzso 

Girls had higher zzso and lower zzso than zzso zzso were higher in zzso than zzso There was a race by sex interaction for zzso insulin zzso such that black girls had the highest and white girls had the lowest zzso When zzso and zzso was controlled zzso this interaction was no longer zzso Multiple zzso models that controlled for race, sex, and their interaction showed that zzso both higher zzso and lower zzso were significantly associated with higher insulin zzso zzso there were significant interactions with sex, such that the deleterious effects of low zzso and high zzso were greater in boys than in zzso zzso there was a significant zzso interaction, such that youths who were both fit and lean had especially low insulin zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that both zzso and zzso explained significant independent proportion of the insulin zzso for the boys but that only zzso did so for the zzso 

zzso to prevent zzso in youths should be designed both to minimize zzso and maximize zzso
