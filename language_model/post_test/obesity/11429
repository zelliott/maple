zzso is the zzso zzso in zzso and has drawn much attention during the investigation for zzso and zzso zzso Thirteen new compounds have been evaluated for their zzso and zzso as zzso zzso on human zzso expressed in zzso and Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells using zzso binding zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed higher zzso activity for the zzso Among the compounds tested, zzso exhibited full zzso activity zzso zzso zzso despite its lower binding affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso had moderate zzso activity and were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sodium zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso had very low binding affinity towards zzso and they did not induce zzso zzso We concluded that compounds zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were potential zzso of human zzso Further investigation on their selectivity towards zzso could be useful for the exploration of the zzso properties of the zzso
