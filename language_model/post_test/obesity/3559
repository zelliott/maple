To investigate the effects of soy protein isolate zzso on zzso signaling in the liver of obese rats, as well as the roles of this zzso in regulating the zzso fat zzso 

zzso and lean zzso rats were fed diets containing either zzso or zzso as protein source for 17 zzso zzso and zzso analysis, real-time zzso Western zzso zzso short interfering zzso zzso were performed for liver zzso 

Our study showed that fat content was significantly lowered in the liver of zzso obese rats, accompanied by a reduction in zzso zzso compared to the zzso zzso zzso protein level in the liver of obese rats was zzso compared to the lean group, indicating that the obese zzso exhibits an overall reduction in zzso zzso zzso the repression of zzso in the obese rats was alleviated by feeding the zzso zzso zzso treatment in rat zzso cells confirmed that zzso of zzso exacerbated fatty zzso fat zzso which implicated an important function of zzso signaling in zzso fat zzso 

zzso intake restored zzso signaling and alleviated zzso fat zzso and liver damage in the obese zzso
