The objectives of this study were to compare the effects of diets rich in zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso on body zzso energy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and ad zzso energy intake in overweight zzso 

zzso healthy, overweight men with body mass indexes between 25 and 31 zzso consumed diets rich in zzso or zzso for 28 days each in a crossover zzso controlled zzso At baseline and after 4 weeks of each dietary intervention, energy expenditure was measured using indirect zzso and body composition was analyzed using magnetic resonance zzso 

Upper body zzso tissue zzso decreased to a greater extent zzso zzso with functional oil zzso compared with olive oil zzso consumption zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was a trend toward greater loss of zzso subcutaneous AT volume zzso zzso zzso with zzso compared with OL zzso Average energy expenditure was zzso zzso zzso zzso greater zzso zzso on day 2 and zzso zzso zzso zzso (not zzso on day 28 with zzso compared with OL zzso Similarly, average fat zzso was greater zzso zzso zzso with zzso compared with OL intake on day 2 but not day zzso 

zzso of a diet rich in zzso results in greater loss of AT compared with zzso perhaps due to increased energy expenditure and fat zzso observed with zzso zzso Thus, zzso may be considered as agents that aid in the prevention of obesity or potentially stimulate weight zzso
