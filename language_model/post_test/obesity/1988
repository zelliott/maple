zzso is an zzso zzso zzso factor that acts on its zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso thereby regulating food intake and energy zzso To explore whether zzso in the zzso gene cause obesity in humans, we have searched for zzso in the gene for zzso a biologically active zzso zzso in obese Japanese zzso We have also examined associations between such zzso and obesity in the zzso zzso zzso were used as templates in zzso chain reaction zzso with zzso selected to amplify zzso 2 to 20 of the human zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso products revealed 7 zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso coding region from 17 obese Japanese subjects with a family history of obesity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No zzso and nonsense zzso were found such as those in zzso fatty zzso rats and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred at relatively high zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 91, 100, and zzso zzso zzso frequency of each zzso determined by zzso and zzso strand zzso zzso analyses showed no significant differences between 47 obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 68 non-obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study represents the first report of sequence zzso of the zzso gene in the Japanese and provides evidence against either zzso zzso or association of sequence zzso with obesity in obese Japanese zzso
