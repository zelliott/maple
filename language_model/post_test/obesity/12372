The authors have set out to evaluate the literature relevant to the dynamic regulation of zzso and zzso 

A detailed search of the past and recent literature was conducted on zzso using a combination of zzso zzso zzso bone zzso zzso zzso zzso cell, and zzso 

Throughout one's zzso the bone zzso zzso provides a unique niche for zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso stem cells zzso The zzso changes as a function of biological age and zzso Historically, clinical zzso has observed these changes from an zzso and zzso zzso Nevertheless, these changes also reflect the balance between zzso zzso and zzso processes which can display an inverse or zzso zzso Multiple hormonal factors and nuclear hormone zzso zzso and drugs are responsible for zzso lineage zzso Data from a number of laboratories now implicates zzso feedback zzso between zzso zzso zzso and the central nervous zzso 

This concise review provides a perspective on the mechanisms regulating zzso differentiation in the context of biological aging, zzso and zzso
