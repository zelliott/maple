High birth weight predicts subsequent zzso but zzso a reduced risk of subsequent cardiovascular disease compared with low birth zzso This apparent paradox might be explained if high birth weight programmed a greater proportion of subsequent lean mass, which carries less cardiovascular risk than fat zzso 

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the direct correlation between birth weight and subsequent body mass index zzso represents an association between birth weight and lean zzso and to assess the zzso impact of this zzso 

A total of 234 healthy zzso children zzso boys, 101 girls, mean age zzso zzso zzso zzso standard zzso were zzso Birth weights were obtained from zzso zzso zzso mass was measured by zzso zzso zzso measures included zzso weight zzso waist zzso and subcutaneous fat mass zzso zzso resistance was assessed by the zzso model zzso zzso zzso of insulin resistance included total and zzso zzso cholesterol, zzso and zzso zzso 

Birth weight correlated significantly with lean mass in boys zzso zzso zzso p zzso and girls zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso for zzso did not improve the correlation zzso After adjustment for zzso lean mass correlated zzso with zzso in boys only zzso zzso zzso p zzso Birth weight correlated zzso with zzso in boys zzso zzso zzso p zzso after adjustment for lean mass, this correlation was not zzso 

In boys, the relationships between birth weight, zzso and lean mass are consistent with the zzso Overall, our findings provide limited evidence in support of the argument that higher birth weight predicts lower zzso risk because it marks programming of more lean zzso
