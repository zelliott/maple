We examined the impact of donor obesity on surgical complications and graft function after zzso zzso From January 1994 through December 2001, we performed 711 zzso zzso zzso We analyzed outcomes for three groups based on donor body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso characteristics were similar between the three groups except for donor cause of zzso zzso deaths were more common in the zzso group zzso while trauma deaths were more common in the zzso zzso group zzso In the zzso group, surgical zzso most notably surgical infections and zzso were significantly more zzso in addition, technical failure rates were higher and short-term graft survival was zzso The zzso of technical failure was zzso in the zzso zzso group, zzso in the zzso zzso group, and zzso in the zzso group zzso However, when we looked at only technically successful transplants, we found minimal differences in the three groups with regard to graft survival at 1 and 3 years zzso zzso obesity increased the zzso of surgical complications in our zzso recipients, but did not affect initial graft function zzso Technically successful transplants using obese donors results in good graft function at 1 and 3 years zzso
