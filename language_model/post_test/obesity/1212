zzso the influence of zzso variables on zzso zzso would enhance the scientific basis for the clinical usage of this zzso 

A zzso zzso model for zzso previously developed in rats was scaled to humans by substituting human values for tissue blood flows, tissue masses, and elimination clearance in place of respective rat zzso The model was validated with published serum concentration data from 64 zzso The model was simulated after intravenous zzso administration, 250 zzso over 1 zzso to predict zzso plasma zzso under conditions of different cardiac zzso degrees of zzso zzso or zzso 

The human zzso model is characterized by a steady state volume of distribution of zzso zzso an elimination clearance of zzso zzso and a terminal zzso of 9 zzso Measured zzso zzso are predicted with an accuracy of 6 zzso 37% zzso Greater peak zzso zzso are predicted in subjects with a low versus a high cardiac output zzso and zzso zzso and in subjects who are lean versus obese zzso and 135 zzso zzso obesity influences zzso because it affects cardiac zzso zzso changes are due to differences in fat zzso Changes with gender and age are relatively zzso 

The zzso zzso model developed in rats predicts zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso cardiac output may explain much of the zzso in early zzso disposition between zzso
