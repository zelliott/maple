The effect of obesity on zzso survival in women without disease or disability is zzso 

To investigate whether higher baseline body mass index and waist circumference affect women's survival to 85 years of age without major chronic disease zzso disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes zzso or hip zzso and mobility zzso 

zzso of zzso women from the Women's Health Initiative zzso study and clinical trial programs who could have reached 85 years or older if they survived to the last outcomes evaluation on September 17, zzso zzso was from 40 US clinical centers from October 1993 through December zzso zzso zzso zzso models were used to estimate odds ratios and zzso zzso for the association of baseline body mass index and waist circumference with the zzso adjusting for zzso zzso and health zzso 

zzso exclusive zzso zzso survived without major chronic disease and without mobility disability zzso zzso survived with 1 or more major chronic disease at baseline but without new disease or disability zzso zzso zzso survived and developed 1 or more major chronic disease but not disability during study follow-up zzso zzso zzso survived and developed mobility disability with or without disease zzso and zzso did not survive zzso 

Mean zzso baseline age was zzso zzso years zzso zzso zzso The distribution of women classified as healthy, prevalent zzso incident zzso disabled, and died was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Compared with zzso women, zzso and obese women were more likely to die before 85 years of zzso zzso and obese women had higher risks of incident disease and mobility zzso zzso risks were zzso Relative to zzso women, adjusted odds ratios zzso zzso of mobility disability were zzso zzso for overweight women and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for class I, II, and III zzso zzso zzso circumference greater than 88 zzso was also associated with higher risk of earlier death, incident disease, and mobility zzso 

zzso and abdominal obesity were important and potentially modifiable factors associated with dying or developing mobility disability and major chronic disease before 85 years of age in older zzso
