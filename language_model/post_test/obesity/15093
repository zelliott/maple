zzso zzso involves the breakdown by zzso to small linear and zzso zzso which are in turn zzso to zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso are anchored to the small zzso zzso zzso cells, and each contains a zzso zzso and zzso zzso All four zzso have zzso zzso activity, and the zzso zzso zzso has an additional zzso activity on the zzso zzso of zzso and/or zzso is a strategy for treatment of type 2 zzso We illustrate here the concept of zzso differential zzso of zzso to examine more refined control of zzso of the zzso starch zzso with the aim of slow zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were individually zzso with zzso zzso corn zzso consisting mainly of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as zzso in the presence of four different zzso zzso and three zzso zzso zzso The zzso values show that the four zzso zzso could be zzso zzso The results support the prospect of controlling starch zzso rates to induce slow zzso release through the zzso of activities of the zzso zzso by selective zzso zzso This approach could also be used to probe associated zzso zzso
