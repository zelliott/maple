A zzso in the mouse tub gene causes a zzso characterized by zzso zzso zzso and zzso The role of the intact zzso protein and the zzso resulting in the zzso of zzso mice remain largely zzso In this study, we have investigated whether obese zzso mice exhibit altered expression levels for zzso protein zzso or zzso acid zzso zzso in body zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso revealed that zzso but not zzso zzso levels, were significantly lower in obese zzso mice as compared to zzso zzso The lower levels of zzso zzso in the zzso nucleus of zzso mice were paralleled by lower zzso intensity and numbers of zzso and zzso Y zzso zzso nerve fibers and terminals in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and lateral zzso zzso No obvious differences in zzso nerve fibers and terminals could be zzso zzso of daily food intake revealed that zzso mice displayed progressively higher food consumption as compared to lean zzso zzso over a 15-day observation zzso When moved to an unfamiliar environment, zzso a novel cage, daily food intake was initially lower in zzso mice than in zzso mice suggesting that zzso mice may be more sensitive to zzso zzso The results together show that zzso mice are zzso and zzso within the zzso zzso nucleus, a depressed expression of zzso involved in the regulation of feeding zzso
