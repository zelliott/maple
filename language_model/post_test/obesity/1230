zzso obesity induced by the zzso of zzso diet implies a high consume of zzso which might be involved in oxygen zzso Double bound, in the zzso molecules are a vulnerable point to undergo zzso zzso zzso zzso that are potentially toxic and can produce serious cell injury zzso in cell zzso and zzso To prevent this zzso injury the zzso organisms have zzso mechanisms of defense, the zzso systems, that may be classified as zzso and zzso Vitamin C belongs to the second group and acts as scavenger of free zzso and other zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the oxygen metabolism in isolated zzso of rats which obesity has been reached by the zzso of an zzso zzso rich controlled liquid diet and evaluate the effect of zzso zzso Cellular zzso injury in isolated zzso was induced through a zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso show higher levels of zzso zzso zzso leakage and zzso zzso production in obese rats as compared with zzso Otherwise, when these groups are supplemented with zzso acid these changes decrease zzso zzso levels decrease in zzso of obese rats incubated in the presence of 1 zzso zzso While it is maintained in zzso acid supplemented zzso zzso values were lower in zzso from obese and control rats, incubated with zzso zzso with zzso acid also maintained zzso levels thus indicating that zzso acid is acting as an efficient zzso
