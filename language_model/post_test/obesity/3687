zzso zzso bone mineral density zzso zzso decreases after total knee zzso zzso as a result of the zzso zzso It is not known whether obesity has an effect on this phenomenon or zzso The aim of this study was to assess long-term zzso zzso changes after zzso and compare whether there is a difference between obese and zzso zzso 

A total of 69 zzso in 61 patients were performed, and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were followed up to 7 years zzso The patients were divided into two study groups according to their body mass index, and the groups were compared in relation to zzso and functional zzso 

The mean of zzso bone loss during the zzso follow-up varied from zzso to zzso depending on the region of interest zzso The highest zzso rates were detected during the first three zzso zzso A total of 26 patients were zzso as obese with a body mass index value of zzso zzso The obese patients' total zzso zzso was higher at both baseline zzso and 7 years after operation zzso zzso 

zzso bone loss around the zzso component continued for up to 7 years zzso The loss of bone density was not associated with any negative clinical outcome in this study, but zzso bone loss was of a smaller quantity in the obese which is probably due to higher weight induced stresses on zzso
