To study zzso insulin and zzso zzso zzso was performed in the zzso zzso muscles in normal zzso rats as well as in zzso obese zzso rats during a zzso insulin zzso zzso was given zzso zzso as a constant subcutaneous infusion 24 h before the insulin zzso zzso infusion rates were 5-8 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 140 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for another 100 zzso The relationship between insulin and zzso zzso zzso was evaluated in zzso and in zzso in plasma to calculate zzso insulin zzso Relative zzso recovery of zzso insulin in zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso SE, zzso zzso zzso In normal zzso rats, plasma and zzso insulin zzso were identical when plasma insulin was zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso insulin was lower when plasma insulin zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso infusion rate was achieved in the presence of plasma and zzso insulin zzso of approximately 140 zzso whereas zzso zzso disposal was seen at zzso insulin zzso of approximately 325 zzso corresponding to approximately 500 zzso in zzso In zzso zzso and contracting (1 zzso normal muscle with markedly increased blood flow, the zzso insulin concentration was significantly higher at high rates, but not at low rates, of insulin zzso In zzso obese zzso rats, the zzso insulin concentration was similar to that in zzso even at pharmacological zzso The zzso infusion rate was significantly lower in the obese zzso rats at both insulin infusion rates than in the lean zzso The zzso content in zzso from skeletal muscle was equal in both obese and lean rats during the low insulin infusion zzso During the high insulin infusion rate, zzso zzso zzso decreased significantly in both groups but were significantly higher in the obese zzso zzso The data suggest that transport of insulin and zzso diffusion across the zzso wall are rate limiting for insulin as well as for zzso metabolism in muscle in normal zzso This does not appear to be the case in the zzso obese zzso rats, where the reduced insulin responsiveness in muscle is due to muscular cellular defects rather than an inhibited zzso delivery of zzso
