To assess the zzso zzso effect of the human zzso analog zzso when given with insulin zzso in subjects with type 2 diabetes, with an emphasis on the optimal dose timing relative to zzso 

In this randomized, zzso zzso zzso crossover study, 19 subjects with type 2 diabetes using insulin zzso underwent five consecutive zzso zzso In zzso order, subjects received subcutaneous injections of zzso at zzso zzso or zzso zzso at zzso 0, zzso or zzso zzso relative to the standardized breakfast after an overnight zzso zzso zzso was injected at 0 zzso at doses that were adjusted appropriately for both the content of the standardized meal and the anticipated effects of zzso Plasma zzso zzso were measured before and during the zzso zzso zzso 

When injected at 0 zzso zzso reduced the zzso zzso excursion by zzso compared to insulin zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso was injected at zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso incremental zzso zzso zzso was also significantly reduced zzso but to a lesser extent zzso to zzso zzso treatment was well tolerated and no serious adverse events were zzso 

Administration of zzso either at or just prior to a meal caused a greater reduction in zzso zzso than either administration of zzso or zzso zzso injections in subjects with type 2 diabetes treated with a zzso insulin zzso insulin zzso
