A large incremental increase in zzso indicates excess fat deposition in most children, but the reference values for identifying those at risk for developing obesity have not been zzso 

To determine the mean and zzso of annual incremental change zzso in zzso for Japanese school zzso 

A cohort of zzso Japanese children in one private school in Tokyo in whom height and weight were measured annually between zzso years of zzso Each child's zzso was converted to zzso as based on the zzso Japanese references for the 12 annual zzso to derive the correlation zzso zzso between two successive zzso Using the formula, zzso of zzso zzso zzso the mean and zzso of zzso were zzso 

Excess zzso gain was defined in terms of zzso in Japanese zzso Annual incremental increase greater than 2 zzso of zzso equivalent to 1-2 zzso zzso for younger children and 2-3 zzso zzso for older children, respectively, indicates rapid increase in body fat in Japanese zzso 

Based on analysis of incremental change in zzso in this zzso a zzso has been identified that can be used to identify children at risk for developing zzso
