This study aims at exploring the effects of sodium zzso treatment on zzso zzso which is known to have an important role in the control of energy zzso 

Adult lean and high-fat zzso obese mice were orally treated with sodium zzso zzso and zzso zzso and lateral zzso were separated and subjected to zzso analysis by zzso and mass zzso zzso and in zzso magnetic resonance imaging were also zzso 

zzso zzso treatment reduced body weight gain, food zzso and blood zzso and zzso zzso These effects were associated with zzso and functional changes in the zzso zzso analysis revealed that sodium zzso modified the expression levels of proteins involved in cell zzso zzso growth, and tissue zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso and of proteins related to energy zzso Moreover, zzso studies confirmed results for some targets and further revealed zzso regulation of zzso and zzso zzso suggesting an effect on zzso as zzso zzso test for cell activity based on zzso cell counting also suggested that sodium zzso modified zzso zzso zzso Finally, in zzso magnetic resonance imaging showed that zzso treatment can affect zzso organization in the zzso 

Altogether, these results suggest that sodium zzso regulates proteins involved in zzso and zzso zzso The fact that sodium zzso could zzso zzso plasticity and networks in adulthood makes it a possible and interesting therapeutic strategy not only for obesity management, but also for other neurodegenerative illnesses like Alzheimer's zzso
