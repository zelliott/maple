This is a retrospective zzso case study involving 115 obese and zzso patients who underwent minimally invasive zzso surgery between 2004 and zzso 

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of minimally invasive spinal surgery in obese and zzso patients by operative results and patient zzso 

Spinal surgery in obese patients is associated with increased zzso blood loss, and operative zzso The potential benefits of minimally invasive zzso surgery in obese patients are zzso 

All patients underwent zzso zzso zzso or zzso using zzso zzso Data were collected on patient zzso zzso smoking habits, operative results, and clinical zzso and compared for obese and zzso zzso zzso results included operative times, blood loss, length of stay, and zzso zzso Clinical outcomes were assessed by using zzso and zzso visual analog scale and zzso outcome criteria at most recent zzso 

In this study, zzso of 115 patients were classified as zzso zzso patients tended to undergo surgery at a younger zzso zzso zzso and age did not have an impact on patient outcome at a mean follow-up of zzso zzso No significant differences were seen between obese versus zzso patients in terms of incision zzso operative time, blood loss, and complication zzso In obese patients, all parameters and operative results compared favorably to reported historical results of patients undergoing open zzso zzso Overall, favorable outcome was seen in zzso and zzso of obese and zzso zzso zzso patients, respectively, and in zzso of zzso zzso zzso visual analog scale did not show any significant zzso 

This is the first study comparing operative results from zzso zzso between obese and zzso zzso No major differences were detected in outcome, operative and zzso data including complication zzso With zzso zzso obese patients experienced the same or equally beneficial outcome, compared to zzso patients, while incision zzso blood loss, operative times, and length of stay were less when compared to open zzso Other zzso and age had no significant impact on zzso complications and clinical zzso
