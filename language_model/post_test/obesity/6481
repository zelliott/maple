To determine whether patterns of sleeping zzso rate zzso are altered in zzso zzso to determine the relationship between changes in zzso and body weight, body mass index zzso zzso and zzso mass zzso and to compare resting zzso rate zzso with zzso during different periods of zzso 

zzso healthy, zzso obese zzso zzso and non-obese zzso zzso zzso female subjects (six Caucasians and 12 zzso with an average age of 36 y zzso zzso 

Total energy expenditure zzso or 24 h zzso zzso rate zzso zzso zzso average and zzso and resting zzso rate zzso or resting energy expenditure zzso measured by human respiratory chamber, and external mechanical work measured by a force platform within the respiratory zzso Physical activity index zzso was derived as zzso Body composition was determined by zzso X-ray zzso zzso 

zzso decreased continuously during sleep and reached its lowest point just before the subject was awakened in the morning by the research zzso Although averages for zzso and zzso were similar, zzso was lower than zzso at the beginning of the sleeping period and higher than zzso in the morning zzso The rate of decrease in zzso was faster with increasing body weight zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The relationship between the slope of zzso decrease and zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso with a zzso of zzso and zzso value of zzso 

The rate of decline in zzso rate during sleep is directly related to body weight, zzso and zzso Average zzso tends to be lower than zzso in obese subjects and higher than zzso in non-obese zzso
