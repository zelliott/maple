To determine whether 12 initial weeks on a Very Low zzso Diet zzso included in a two-year support program is associated with better long term weight loss maintenance than a dietary and zzso support program zzso Additionally, to identify characteristics associated with successful treatment or attrition, which can be used in selecting individuals likely to respond to zzso

Two Swedish zzso zzso 

113 obese men and women aged zzso zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso participating in the Swedish zzso zzso zzso 

One group received zzso for 12 initial weeks plus regular dietary and zzso support over two years while the other group received two years of the same supportive program zzso 

Weight loss after two years zzso 

Both treatment groups maintained highly significant weight losses at two years but the initial zzso appeared to have given no significant long term benefit compared to the supportive zzso zzso of selected zzso zzso and dietary characteristics showed that the zzso was more effective than the supportive strategy alone in men and possibly in individuals sharing household with only one zzso High initial zzso was associated with attrition, irrespective of zzso 

A zzso including long term dietary and zzso support is a successful treatment for some severely obese subjects, especially zzso Further research should be directed towards matching treatments to individuals in order to improve the high recidivism rates generally following weight loss zzso
