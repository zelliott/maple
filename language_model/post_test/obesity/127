zzso were conducted to study the effects of a low zzso zzso diet on growth and zzso function in obese and lean male and female zzso zzso The nine feeding regimens included animals ad zzso fed either a zzso zzso and 59% zzso diet zzso or an zzso zzso and zzso zzso diet zzso zzso and appropriate zzso groups to control for the lean rats eating less than the obese rats and the rats fed the zzso diet eating less than those fed the control zzso The rats were 4 weeks old at the start of the experiment which lasted 7 zzso Final body size, zzso length and nonfat dry mass of the lean rats were dependent primarily on the amount of protein zzso whereas growth of the obese rats was related to total energy intake rather than to protein zzso The relative zzso decreased efficiency of energy zzso and increased oxygen consumption and serum zzso zzso in the lean rats fed the zzso diet were consistent with the development of an zzso zzso allowing the excess zzso energy to be dissipated through excess heat zzso There was no evidence for such an zzso zzso in the obese zzso The suggestion that the obese rats were already zzso for protein and storing the excess energy as fat and that the decreased zzso response might be part of a protective mechanism against zzso was zzso
