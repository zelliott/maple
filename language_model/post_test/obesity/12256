Some characteristics of the built environment have been associated with obesity in zzso Our aim was to determine whether individual and environmental zzso characteristics zzso the relation between youth overweight and spatial accessibility to physical activity zzso facilities and to food zzso 

zzso zzso 

zzso students, aged 12 zzso zzso years, randomly selected from eastern France middle zzso

Individual zzso status modulated the relation between spatial accessibility to PA facilities and to general food outlets and zzso The likelihood of being overweight was higher when spatial accessibility to urban PA facilities and to general food outlets was low, but in children of zzso zzso The odds ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso for being overweight of zzso children compared with zzso children was zzso zzso when spatial accessibility to urban PA facilities was zzso This OR was zzso zzso when spatial accessibility to general food outlets was zzso There was no significant relationship of overweight with either nature PA facilities or other food outlets zzso and fast-food zzso 

These results indicate that disparities in spatial accessibility to PA facilities and to general food outlets may amplify the risk of overweight in zzso disadvantaged zzso These data should be relevant for influencing health policies and urban planning at both a national and local zzso
