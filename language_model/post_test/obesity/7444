zzso has been associated with increased risk of prevalent depression among young and middle-aged adults, but the association between obesity (and its various measures, including the zzso syndrome zzso and incident depression has not been examined adequately in the zzso 

This study evaluated the association between various measures of obesity and incident depression over a 10-year period in a large cohort of community-based older zzso 

The authors recruited zzso men aged zzso years living in zzso Australia, between 1996 and 1998, and measured their zzso weight, waist and hip zzso and blood zzso Participants also completed a questionnaire that included information about the clinical diagnosis and treatment for diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol or zzso The authors then used the Western Australian Linked Data System to retrieve information about the following zzso diagnoses between January 1, 1966, and December 31, zzso depressive episode, zzso depressive disorder, and zzso 

The authors excluded 150 men from these analyses because of prior history of depression or missing zzso The mean age of our zzso participants was 72 zzso 4 years at the time of zzso and they were followed up for an average of 8 zzso 2 zzso There were zzso deaths during zzso and zzso men received the diagnosis of zzso The zzso of depression was 5 per 1,000 zzso zzso Cox zzso hazard models showed that men with body mass index zzso or zzso had a zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso increase in the risk of depression compared with that of zzso men zzso zzso The association between depression and waist zzso or zzso zzso and zzso or zzso did not reach statistical zzso Men with zzso at the time of recruitment had a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increase in the adjusted risk of incident zzso 

Our results indicate that obesity and zzso are associated with an increase in the risk of incident depression among older zzso If this association is truly zzso reducing the prevalence of obesity and zzso could potentially lead to a decline in the prevalence and zzso of depression in later zzso
