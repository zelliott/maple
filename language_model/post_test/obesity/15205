In the United zzso organizations involved in health-care commissioning have recently introduced legislation limiting access to total knee zzso through the introduction of arbitrary thresholds unsupported by the literature and based on body mass zzso This study aimed to establish the relationship between body mass index and zzso specific and general outcomes on total knee zzso 

Using national zzso outcome measures zzso linked to the National Joint zzso we identified zzso primary total knee zzso performed for the treatment of zzso The zzso project involves the collection of zzso and general health outcomes before and at six months following total knee zzso The relationships between body mass index and the Oxford zzso zzso zzso zzso index, and zzso zzso Visual zzso zzso were assessed with use of zzso and linear zzso The improvement in these measures was compared for three distinct groups based on body mass index zzso I zzso to zzso zzso Group II zzso to zzso zzso and Group III zzso to 60 zzso with use of multiple zzso analysis to adjust for differences in age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, general health rating, and number of zzso 

The zzso and zzso zzso outcome measures declined to a similar extent with increasing body mass zzso The zzso of the linear zzso equation relating to the change in scores was positive in all cases, indicating that there was a tendency for scores to improve to a greater extent as body mass index zzso After adjustment, the changes in zzso outcome measures in Group I and Group III were equivalent for the Oxford zzso zzso zzso difference, zzso point zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso zzso p zzso zzso the zzso zzso index zzso difference, zzso point zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso zzso p zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Visual zzso zzso zzso difference, zzso points zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso complications were significantly higher zzso zzso at a rate of zzso zzso of zzso zzso in Group III compared with zzso zzso of zzso zzso in Group zzso 

The improvements in zzso outcome measures experienced by patients were similar, irrespective of body mass zzso Health policy should be based on the overall improvements in function and general health gained through zzso zzso patients should not be excluded from the benefit of total knee zzso given that their overall improvements were equivalent to those of patients with a lower body mass zzso
