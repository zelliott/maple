One of my zzso patients who takes zzso is planning to become zzso She told me that zzso advised her to take 5 zzso of zzso acid daily until the end of the first zzso Are there other women who need more than the regular dose of zzso acid included in prenatal zzso 

Women who are at high risk of having babies with neural tube defects and who would benefit from higher doses of zzso acid include those with certain zzso zzso previous zzso with neural tube zzso diabetes, zzso disorders, or zzso or those who take zzso medications or zzso Such women should take 5 zzso of zzso acid for the 2 months before conception and during the first zzso
