We examined the relations among body mass index zzso extent of coronary artery disease, and frequency of high-risk coronary anatomy zzso in zzso consecutive patients who underwent coronary zzso during a zzso zzso zzso was defined zzso zzso of the left main coronary artery and/or significant zzso coronary artery disease zzso zzso zzso was classified into 5 zzso low zzso zzso normal (21 to 24 zzso overweight zzso to 29 zzso obese (30 to 34 zzso and severely obese zzso zzso zzso patients zzso zzso were younger zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso years, p zzso and had higher zzso of zzso systemic hypertension, and diabetes zzso zzso was present less often in obese patients zzso of zzso zzso vs 250 of zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that advancing age zzso zzso male gender zzso zzso zzso diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were independent zzso of high-risk zzso whereas obesity remained a significant negative independent predictor zzso zzso zzso Late (30 to 36 zzso mortality was not different between obese zzso and zzso zzso patients but was significantly higher in patients with zzso zzso than in those without zzso zzso p zzso zzso In conclusion, obese patients who were referred for coronary zzso were younger and had a lower prevalence of zzso zzso patients were probably referred for zzso at an earlier stage of their disease, thus explaining the zzso zzso in several reports of better short-term outcome in obese patients who undergo cardiac zzso
