To assess zzso and zzso events that involve dynamic interplay between multiple cell types, zzso in zzso analysis is zzso We developed a technique based on zzso laser zzso that enabled us to analyze and compare the zzso structures, cellular zzso and vascular function within mouse lean and obese zzso tissue in zzso with high zzso zzso We found increased zzso interaction in the zzso of obese visceral zzso tissue in zzso and high-fat zzso obese zzso These changes were indicative of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso a hallmark of zzso Local zzso zzso in obese zzso tissue was indicated by increased zzso expression and formation of zzso zzso We observed zzso expression of zzso molecules on zzso and zzso in obese visceral zzso zzso suggesting that interactions between these cells contribute to local zzso of inflammatory zzso Furthermore, administration of zzso zzso zzso the cell dynamics seen in obese visceral zzso This imaging technique to analyze the complex cellular interplay within obese zzso tissue allowed us to show that visceral zzso tissue obesity is an inflammatory zzso In addition, this technique may prove to be a valuable tool to evaluate potential therapeutic zzso
