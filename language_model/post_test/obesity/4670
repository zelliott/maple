There is an ongoing debate about the relationship between obesity and morbidity in the elderly, the clinical relevance of overweight and obesity in older patients and the need or harms of zzso The main purpose of our study was to investigate whether a higher zzso is associated with a worse cardiovascular risk in all age groups, especially in the older zzso 

We performed a retrospective evaluation of clinical data from zzso patients who visited a medical outdoor center for diagnostic and/or therapeutic interventions in the period from January 1995 to July zzso Patients were assigned to eight age groups of one decade from zzso years to zzso zzso 

The Body Mass Index zzso of our patients showed a continuous increase with increasing age with peak values in the age decade zzso years zzso zzso zzso This was paralleled by an increase in cardiovascular events and need for continuous medication, demonstrating peak values in the age decade zzso years zzso in the female and zzso in the male zzso In all age decades up to 80 years the zzso values were higher in patients with events compared to those without zzso multivariable linear zzso analysis - including zzso variables zzso pressure, zzso zzso zzso zzso physical activity, zzso - revealed for all age groups a strong positive relation of zzso and a negative relation of fat free mass zzso to the probability for a cardiovascular event and need for zzso 

In all age groups, the percentage of cardiovascular events was directly correlated with the zzso Having in mind the transition to an aging society, therapeutic and preventive strategies should, therefore, include weight management strategies also for the zzso
