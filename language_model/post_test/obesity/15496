zzso zzso a zzso acute phase protein largely regulated by circulating levels of zzso predicts coronary heart disease zzso in healthy zzso We have shown that subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso zzso in zzso In this study we have sought associations of levels of zzso protein and zzso with measures of obesity and of chronic infection as their putative zzso We have also related levels of zzso protein and zzso to markers of the insulin resistance syndrome and of zzso zzso We performed a zzso study in 107 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso were related to all measures of zzso but zzso of zzso to zzso zzso were only zzso and those of zzso zzso and zzso were not significantly correlated with levels of these zzso zzso of zzso protein were significantly related to those of zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein were related to insulin resistance as calculated from the zzso model assessment model, blood pressure, zzso and zzso and to markers of zzso dysfunction zzso levels of von zzso factor, tissue zzso zzso and cellular zzso A mean standard zzso score of levels of acute phase markers correlated closely with a similar score of insulin resistance syndrome variables zzso zzso this relationship being weakened only marginally by removing measures of obesity from the insulin resistance score zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso tissue is an important zzso of a low level, chronic inflammatory state as reflected by levels of zzso tumor necrosis zzso and zzso zzso and that infection with H zzso C pneumoniae, and zzso is zzso Moreover, our data support the concept that such a zzso chronic inflammatory state may induce insulin resistance and zzso dysfunction and thus link the latter phenomena with obesity and cardiovascular zzso
