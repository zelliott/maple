The zzso of acute zzso an inflammation of the zzso is increasing zzso zzso injury is mild in zzso of patients who recover without zzso The remaining patients may develop a severe disease with local complications such as zzso cell zzso zzso and remote organ injury including lung zzso The early prediction of the severity of the disease is an important goal for physicians in management of patients with acute zzso in order to zzso the therapy and to prevent organ dysfunction and local zzso For that purpose, multiple clinical scale scores have been applied to patients with acute zzso Recently, a new problem has zzso the increased severity of the disease in obese zzso However, the mechanisms by which obesity increases the severity of acute zzso are zzso Several hypotheses have been zzso zzso obese patients have an increased inflammation within the zzso zzso obese patients have an increased zzso of fat within and around the zzso where necrosis is often zzso zzso increase in both zzso and zzso fat and inflammatory cells explain the high zzso of pancreatic inflammation and necrosis in obese zzso zzso zzso dysfunction associated with obesity might enhance the systemic inflammatory response by altering the zzso of inflammatory zzso and zzso zzso mismatch leading to zzso associated with a low pancreatic flow might reduce the pancreatic zzso and further enhance pancreatic zzso Recent experimental investigations also show an increased mortality and morbidity in obese zzso with acute zzso and the implication of the zzso zzso and zzso Such models are important to investigate whether the inflammatory response of the disease is enhanced by zzso It is exciting to speculate that manipulation of the zzso milieu has the potential to influence the severity of acute zzso
