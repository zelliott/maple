The purpose of this study is to describe the prevalence of overweight, general zzso and abdominal obesity and examine their associations with socioeconomic status in a rural Chinese adult zzso 

This zzso study was performed on zzso participants zzso 35 years of age zzso men zzso and zzso women zzso Each zzso weight, zzso waist circumference zzso and zzso circumference zzso were measured, and demographic and socioeconomic data were collected using zzso 

The mean body mass index zzso values were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the mean zzso values were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for men and women, zzso The zzso prevalence rates of overweight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso general obesity zzso zzso zzso zzso and abdominal obesity zzso zzso 85 zzso for men and zzso 80 zzso for zzso were zzso zzso and zzso for men and zzso zzso and zzso for women, zzso All gender differences were statistically significant zzso zzso In addition, the zzso prevalence rates of general and abdominal obesity slowly decreased among men but sharply increased among women as age increased zzso In subsequent zzso zzso analysis, educational level was zzso associated with both general obesity and abdominal obesity among women but positively associated with abdominal obesity among zzso No significant correlation was found between obesity and zzso 

These results suggest a high prevalence of obesity which might differ by gender and age, and an inverse association among women and a mixed association among men noted between education and obesity in our zzso Preventive and therapeutic programs are warranted to control this serious public health zzso The zzso characteristics of populations at high-risk of developing obesity should be taken into consideration when designing zzso zzso
