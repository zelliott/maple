The zzso of zzso signaling zzso is a negative feedback regulator of zzso signaling and also influences zzso zzso We investigated association of variations in the coding sequence and promoter region of zzso with extreme obesity in German children and zzso 

An initial screen for sequence variations in 181 extremely obese children and adolescents and 188 healthy zzso adults revealed two previously reported single zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso refers to bases upstream of zzso in zzso 2) within a predicted zzso binding element and zzso zzso zzso for zzso see zzso 

We did not detect significant differences in zzso or zzso zzso for any of these zzso between the zzso study groups (all nominal zzso zzso In addition, we performed a pedigree transmission zzso test zzso for the zzso zzso zzso in families zzso 703 obese children and zzso 281 of their obese siblings and both biological zzso The zzso revealed no transmission zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In conclusion, our data do not suggest evidence for a major role of the respective zzso in zzso in the zzso of extreme obesity in our study zzso
