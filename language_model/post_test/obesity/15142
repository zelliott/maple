zzso of zzso zzso during the zzso cycle and the possible relationship of changes in circulating zzso during the zzso period with zzso function in zzso of obese zzso zzso and lean zzso zzso White zzso zzso were evaluated in two consecutive zzso Plasma zzso zzso throughout the zzso cycle in lean zzso remain zzso but zzso females showed a zzso increase in circulating zzso levels without associated changes in body condition and zzso In these zzso plasma zzso zzso at Days zzso and 0 of the cycle were found to be positively correlated with the zzso rate zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso but the levels of zzso at Day 0 were zzso correlated with the zzso release from Day 3 zzso zzso and, became more evident at Day 5 of the zzso cycle zzso zzso Such relationships were not observed in the females of the lean zzso In conclusion, the present study indicates the existence of a distinctive pattern in the zzso zzso zzso in zzso with obesity and zzso resistance, which is associated with the number and functionality of the zzso zzso present in the subsequent zzso
