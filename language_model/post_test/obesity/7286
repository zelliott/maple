The purpose of this study was to determine whether obesity affects pulmonary responses following a zzso ozone zzso zzso zzso and lean zzso mice were exposed to ozone zzso zzso for 72 zzso In zzso mice, ozone exposure caused pulmonary injury and zzso and these events were associated with reduced pulmonary zzso In zzso mice, zzso zzso recruitment to the lung was reduced and no reduction in compliance was zzso Similar results were obtained in obese zzso mice, indicating that loss of zzso signaling in zzso mice does not account for these zzso zzso To examine the role of zzso zzso in this zzso difference in ozone zzso zzso and zzso mice were raised on zzso or zzso fat zzso Compared with zzso zzso mice, zzso zzso zzso mice were obese and had reduced zzso recruitment following zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso recruitment in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, in obese mice, no effect of zzso zzso on zzso recruitment was zzso zzso differences in the effect of ozone on compliance were observed in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso differences in serum zzso were observed and may account for zzso differences in the effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso In zzso the zzso inflammation induced by prolonged low level ozone exposure was attenuated in obese mice and appeared to result from an absence of zzso zzso recruitment in the obese zzso
