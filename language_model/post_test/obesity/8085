We sought to determine a role for zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso in obesity zzso using the rat model of zzso virus zzso expression of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso received bilateral zzso injections of zzso or control zzso and were fed on regular zzso zzso zzso injection, half the rats from each group were switched to access to a high-fat diet for another 11 zzso We examined variables including body weight, food zzso energy efficiency, meal patterns, zzso zzso fat mass, plasma insulin, plasma zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso had increased food intake and body weight and lowered zzso zzso The zzso was zzso through increased meal size during the zzso Although these rats had normal blood zzso their plasma insulin levels were increased in both zzso and zzso challenge zzso While high-fat diet induced zzso zzso and zzso these effects were amplified in rats with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso expression was appropriately regulated in response to positive energy zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso can cause zzso and obesity and zzso zzso may have actions in zzso zzso
