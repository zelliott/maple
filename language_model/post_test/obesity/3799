A cohort study was conducted among zzso women to determine whether genetic zzso in selected zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were associated with the progression of benign breast disease zzso to breast cancer and whether the selected zzso modified the association between body mass and breast cancer among women with zzso 

Among participants in an ongoing cohort study, zzso Caucasian zzso women had a breast biopsy for zzso Of these women, 61 subsequently developed breast zzso A short questionnaire was administered at baseline in zzso zzso were determined using DNA extracted from blood collected in zzso 

In this zzso body mass index zzso was positively associated with the risk of developing breast zzso In contrast, zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso were associated with a decreased risk of developing invasive breast zzso No statistically significant associations were observed for zzso in zzso zzso zzso or zzso and breast cancer risk or for interactions between the zzso and zzso and breast cancer zzso 

The findings suggest that specific zzso in the zzso and zzso genes may play a role in progression of zzso to breast cancer among zzso Caucasian zzso
