Children with new onset diabetes zzso zzso zzso were evaluated over zzso Patients were zzso diagnosed with type 2 diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso 26) based on zzso a relative with zzso the ability to zzso from insulin, and absence of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that markers of zzso at diagnosis, including zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso protein zzso in addition to initial zzso levels and urine zzso would help in distinguishing type 1 diabetes zzso zzso from zzso 

Children with zzso zzso male, 65 zzso had a mean age of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a racial background of zzso white, zzso black, and zzso zzso In contrast, children with zzso (13 female, 13 zzso had a mean age of zzso zzso zzso zzso with a racial background of zzso black, zzso white, and zzso zzso zzso zzso level was zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso a zzso of zzso zzso had zzso sensitivity in distinguishing zzso from zzso zzso zzso level was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a value of zzso zzso could distinguish the two types of diabetes with zzso zzso zzso zzso were found in zzso of children with zzso compared with zzso of those with zzso and the magnitude was associated with type of zzso zzso zzso level for zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso a value of zzso zzso could distinguish the two types of diabetes with zzso zzso 

In addition to zzso family history of zzso and absence of zzso zzso children with zzso zzso may be distinguished from those with zzso by a combination of zzso parameters zzso zzso zzso and urine zzso
