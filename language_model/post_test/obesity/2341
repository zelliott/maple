The zzso distribution shifted upward in the United States between the 1960s and the 1990s, but little is known about secular trends in the pattern of zzso growth, particularly earlier in the century and early in zzso 

The objective was to examine differences in zzso growth in children born in zzso 

zzso zzso from ages 2 to 18 y were produced for 855 zzso children in the zzso zzso Study born in zzso zzso and zzso Age zzso and zzso zzso at zzso rebound and age zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at maximum zzso were zzso multivariable zzso was used to examine whether maternal zzso infant weight gain, and other zzso zzso the cohort effects on these zzso 

zzso zzso showed that children born in zzso had the lowest zzso values until age 5 y but had the largest values from age 8 y zzso In adjusted models, boys and girls born in zzso had a zzso per year faster zzso and a zzso higher zzso than did children of the same sex born in zzso and girls had a zzso earlier zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and infant weight gain were associated with an zzso pattern of zzso growth but did not account for the observed zzso 

Shifts in the zzso growth rate around the time of zzso initiation were apparent starting after zzso The zzso growth curve did not increase zzso over time; rather, children born during the obesity epidemic were characterized by lower zzso values before the zzso rebound and by rapid subsequent zzso zzso
