The efficacy and potency of zzso in rat heart was documented by comparing zzso and zzso effects on: zzso the zzso response of zzso muscles zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity in a crude membrane preparation from heart zzso In male adult lean zzso zzso rats, the extent of the positive zzso response and the zzso effect on zzso zzso were similar in magnitude for zzso and zzso the two corresponding zzso values for zzso effects being zzso to zzso lower than the zzso values for zzso zzso zzso In male adult obese zzso zzso rats, the zzso effects exerted by zzso on the zzso response and zzso zzso activity were reduced by zzso and zzso respectively, while the extent of similar zzso responses were reduced, respectively, by zzso and zzso zzso With zzso the zzso value for the zzso effect was zzso lower than the zzso value for zzso zzso zzso whereas both zzso values were comparable when zzso was used as a zzso
