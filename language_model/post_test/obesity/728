The purpose of the present zzso study was to evaluate the sensitivity zzso and specificity zzso of body mass index zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to overall zzso in detecting excess zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

Four hundred and fifty zzso girls aged zzso zzso zzso years zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso weight, circumference of mid upper arm, waist and hip, and zzso thickness at zzso zzso zzso and zzso - were taken from all participants using standard zzso zzso and the zzso sum of four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were then converted into seven zzso category zzso 10th, 25th, zzso zzso zzso and zzso Excess zzso was defined as a level of zzso zzso greater than the internally derived zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and SP of each internally derived zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in detecting excess zzso were then zzso 

zzso and SP were zzso and zzso for the 95th zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso for the 95th zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, there was a considerable decrease in overall zzso with the use of zzso zzso instead of zzso at the 95th zzso zzso vs zzso 

zzso of zzso in the study had higher SP but low zzso in detecting excess zzso The use of zzso zzso on the other hand, had the merit of increasing zzso in a screening zzso to evaluate excess zzso in zzso children aged zzso zzso
