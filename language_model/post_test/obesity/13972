zzso obesity is closely associated with cardiovascular disease and the zzso zzso zzso the amount of visceral fat is important and requires a straightforward, reliable, and practical zzso 

We investigated whether visceral fat thickness zzso measured by zzso can adequately assess visceral fat zzso and predict cardiovascular or zzso zzso 

zzso patients zzso men and 106 zzso underwent zzso to estimate visceral fat zzso 

The visceral zzso tissue area had the best correlation with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso correlated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso the zzso model assessment for insulin resistance, and the zzso thickness at the common carotid artery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso in men and with zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso and the zzso model assessment for insulin resistance zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso in zzso Men in the middle and high zzso zzso had a higher odds ratio zzso of coronary artery disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso than did those in the low zzso after adjustment for age, waist zzso and body mass zzso 

zzso might be a reliable index for assessing the amount of visceral fat and for identifying diabetic patients, particularly men, who are at high risk of cardiovascular zzso
