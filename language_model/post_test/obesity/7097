The association between obesity and mortality is reduced or eliminated in older zzso In addition to zzso disability is an important health zzso The objectives of this study were to examine the association between body mass index zzso calculated as weight in zzso divided by height in meters zzso and subsequent disability and mortality among older Americans, as well as to estimate the effect of zzso on life expectancy and zzso life expectancy among older zzso 

We studied zzso zzso white Americans, 1931 African Americans, and zzso Mexican Americans 65 years or older who were not disabled at baseline from 5 sites of the zzso zzso for zzso Studies of the zzso zzso included zzso medical conditions, activities of daily living, and demographic zzso Cox zzso hazards zzso analysis was used to estimate the hazard ratios zzso for subsequent disability and mortality during 7 years of zzso Total life expectancy and zzso life expectancy were estimated using the zzso of zzso chain zzso 

The lowest zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso for disability was at a zzso of 25 to less than zzso zzso with zzso of lower than zzso or 30 or higher at baseline were significantly more likely to experience disability during the follow-up zzso In contrast, the lowest zzso for mortality were seen among subjects with zzso of 25 to less than 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 30 to less than 35 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with subjects with zzso of lower than 25 or 35 or higher experiencing higher hazards for zzso zzso life expectancy is greatest among subjects with a zzso of 25 to less than zzso 

zzso of the effect of obesity on the health of older Americans should account for mortality and zzso of zzso
