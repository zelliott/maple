Recent zzso studies have reported that body fat distribution might be zzso associated with zzso zzso We previously reported that visceral fat area zzso zzso zzso is the optimal zzso for identifying abdominal obesity in Chinese zzso We examined whether zzso zzso zzso reflects the association between abdominal obesity and zzso zzso and if determination of the visceral fat quantity is useful for assessing zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

Participants zzso men zzso women zzso zzso zzso free of cardiovascular disease underwent magnetic resonance imaging and carotid ultrasound assessment to zzso zzso and carotid zzso thickness zzso zzso subjects zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso had a higher zzso than lean subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso had significantly higher zzso than those without abdominal obesity regardless of zzso zzso By zzso zzso analysis adjusted for zzso zzso and cardiovascular risk factors, waist circumference but not zzso was independently correlated with zzso in men zzso Similar findings were observed with an accurate obesity zzso adjusted model, which showed that zzso was an independent risk factor for increased zzso in men but not in zzso 

zzso zzso effectively identified carotid zzso for both lean and obese individuals in middle-aged Chinese zzso
