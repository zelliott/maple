Plasma zzso activity, zzso of zzso and zzso were estimated in 34 subjects of varying ratio of observed to standard zzso The inverse relationship between zzso activity and the ratio of observed to standard weight was zzso No significant correlation was found between zzso or zzso and the ratio of observed to standard zzso It was therefore concluded that the decreased plasma zzso activity in obese subjects is due to decreased production of zzso zzso rather than to excessive zzso
