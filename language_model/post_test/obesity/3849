A popular diet used for weight reduction is the zzso diet, which has most calories derived from fat and zzso but effects of this dietary regimen on coronary vascular function have not been zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso impairment in coronary zzso function is reversed by a zzso zzso We used four groups of male zzso zzso lean and obese on normal and zzso zzso zzso were fed ad zzso for 3 zzso total caloric intake and weight gain were similar in both zzso To assess zzso and vascular function, coronary zzso were zzso and zzso for diameter zzso during administration of zzso or sodium zzso or during zzso When compared with lean rats, zzso zzso zzso was impaired by approximately 50% in obese rats zzso zzso but it was restored to normal by the zzso zzso When the normal diet was zzso zzso zzso zzso was impaired zzso in obese compared with lean zzso Similar to zzso responses to zzso were restored to normal by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso an inhibitor of zzso oxide zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso zzso in lean rats, but it had no effect on zzso or zzso zzso in obese rats on a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso channel zzso blocked zzso zzso in the obese rats, suggesting that the improvement in function was zzso by a zzso factor independent of zzso In conclusion, zzso impairment in zzso zzso of coronary zzso can be dramatically improved with a zzso diet most likely through the production of a zzso factor independent of zzso
