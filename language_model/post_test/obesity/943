The effect of weight reduction on zzso serum lipids and zzso and zzso tissue zzso zzso responsiveness to insulin was assessed immediately after and 3 zzso subsequent to a mean zzso weight reduction in 14 zzso Whereas reduction in zzso serum zzso persisted after 3 zzso reductions in serum cholesterol, zzso zzso cholesterol and zzso zzso zzso cholesterol were not found at 3 zzso In fact, at 3 zzso levels of HDL cholesterol were higher than before weight zzso Maintenance of the zzso state also increased the zzso cholesterol ratio zzso less than zzso an effect strongly associated with the change in the responsiveness of zzso tissue zzso zzso to insulin zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso Moreover, after maintenance of the zzso state, the zzso cholesterol ratio also increased after the zzso of corn oil and a zzso zzso infusion, a response not present before weight zzso Thus the effect of weight reduction on serum lipids and zzso was not only time dependent, but for zzso was strongly associated with changes in zzso tissue zzso
