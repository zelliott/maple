zzso gastric bypass zzso and zzso diversion zzso are highly beneficial operations for type 2 diabetes zzso zzso in obese patients, leading to complete zzso resolution in zzso and zzso of cases, zzso In both zzso and zzso the zzso is excluded from the food stream and the zzso small zzso receives the food zzso while following zzso fat zzso zzso is also extremely zzso This study was carried out to identify clinical features that could give insight on the different mechanisms of action on diabetes zzso 

The files of zzso severely obese patients with zzso undergoing zzso from May 1976 to May 2007 were zzso and the presence of zzso zzso serum zzso zzso at 1-2 months, at 1 year, at 10 years, and zzso or zzso years following the operation was zzso 

The percentage of patients cured zzso serum zzso reduced to zzso zzso zzso on free diet and with no zzso was zzso at 1 month, zzso at 1 and 10 years, and zzso zzso or zzso years, the zzso of zzso patients at 1 month being those with most severe zzso zzso 

As the early results after zzso resemble those reported after zzso it can be hypothesized that the zzso exclusion and the zzso small zzso stimulation are the first mechanisms acting in zzso immediately after the operation, that only subsequently the zzso fat zzso which cannot be immediate, takes over, and that the minimal fat zzso is the mechanism accounting for the long-term results of zzso
