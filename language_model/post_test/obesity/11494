To determine the clinical conditions associated with systemic zzso stress in a community-based zzso Information regarding cardiovascular risk factors associated with systemic zzso stress has largely been derived from highly selected samples with advanced stages of vascular zzso Thus, it has been difficult to evaluate the relative contribution of each cardiovascular risk factor to systemic zzso stress and to determine whether such risk factors act independently and are zzso to the general zzso 

We examined zzso subjects from the zzso Heart Study and measured urinary zzso levels of zzso as a marker of systemic zzso zzso zzso and zzso multivariable zzso models were used to assess clinical zzso of zzso zzso In zzso and zzso models, increased urinary zzso zzso levels were positively associated with female sex, hypertension treatment, smoking, diabetes, blood zzso body mass index, and a history of cardiovascular zzso In contrast, age and total cholesterol were zzso correlated with urinary zzso zzso zzso After adjustment for several zzso decreasing age and zzso cholesterol ratio, sex, smoking, body mass index, blood zzso and cardiovascular disease remained associated with urinary zzso zzso 

zzso diabetes, and body mass index were highly associated with systemic zzso stress as determined by zzso urinary zzso zzso The effect of body mass index was minimally affected by blood zzso and diabetes and may suggest an important role of zzso stress in the deleterious impact of obesity on cardiovascular zzso
