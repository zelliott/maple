To determine the clinical characteristics of patients with small zzso zzso zzso particles among Japanese men with mild zzso intolerance and to investigate the relationship of LDL particle size to the levels of other plasma zzso zzso insulin resistance, and blood pressure zzso 

The subjects were 40 men with impaired zzso tolerance or diabetes treated by diet alone, and 40 healthy men matched for age and body mass index zzso were used as control zzso LDL particle size was measured using zzso gel zzso 

Of the 40 patients with zzso zzso 19 had small LDL zzso size zzso zzso compared with only 4 of the 40 control zzso In the patients with small LDL, the plasma levels of cholesterol, zzso and zzso B, the zzso serum zzso insulin, and the zzso ratio were all higher than in the patients with normal LDL zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso while the zzso zzso cholesterol level was zzso However, there were no significant differences in zzso zzso or insulin sensitivity in a zzso clamp study between the zzso and zzso zzso 

Japanese men with zzso intolerance frequently have small LDL, and this zzso is associated with other zzso and increased zzso zzso
