Childhood and adult obesity have been widely associated with zzso genetic zzso in different zzso This study aimed to investigate the linkage zzso zzso block structure of a region surrounding the candidate zzso zzso and determine the best single zzso zzso zzso combination that explains the higher proportion of zzso observed in children with severe zzso including obese subjects from families with a very high occurrence of zzso A sliding window approach pointed to a block containing the zzso zzso zzso value zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso combination had an increased risk of obesity zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso with respect to those individuals with the reference zzso zzso A further zzso zzso also showed association with obesity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso and OR zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso and did not segregate with the previously described risk zzso The calculation of risk score based on the zzso zzso combined with the zzso zzso showed a much greater effect of the zzso gene on high zzso This score yields an attributable risk of zzso for severe zzso and the increased risk per risk zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that the description of this zzso combination in the zzso gene could be useful for the early identification of inherited zzso to zzso since childhood, with a higher sensitivity than considering the effect of a single zzso
