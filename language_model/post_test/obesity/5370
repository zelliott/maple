The aim of the study was to determine whether physical activity stimulates zzso release on the short-term in normal weight and in obese subjects compared to rest and, zzso whether modest weight loss affects zzso release or sensitivity in the zzso zzso weight zzso 12 zzso 16 zzso zzso zzso age zzso as well as obese subjects zzso 21 zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso age zzso were tested in a resting and a physical activity zzso zzso subjects were matched over two groups for a weight loss period of 3 zzso After weight loss, the tests were zzso The area under the curve zzso zzso for zzso zzso was significantly increased in the physical activity condition compared to rest in lean subjects zzso as well as in the obese subjects after weight loss zzso but not in the obese subjects before weight zzso Physical zzso zzso release in lean and obese subjects after a weight loss period supports the idea of a neuroendocrine loop in addition to zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso weight loss might be effective for increasing zzso sensitivity to acute zzso
