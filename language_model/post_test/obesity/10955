beta zzso receptors are predominantly expressed in the fat cells of visceral zzso tissue in zzso They mediate zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso which are important for the regulation of energy expenditure and, therefore, body zzso Recently, a zzso zzso of the beta zzso zzso gene was reported to be associated with obesity and zzso zzso complications in some ethnic zzso zzso a protein zzso by zzso is proposed as a signal linkage between the central nervous system and peripheral fat zzso It has been shown in zzso that zzso may activate the sympathetic nervous system and, thus, beta zzso receptors in zzso zzso However, little is known about the relationship between the zzso zzso and plasma zzso in zzso 

To determine the effects of the beta zzso zzso gene zzso zzso on zzso measures, zzso parameters and plasma zzso levels, 188 zzso Chinese women zzso age zzso standard zzso 32 zzso 10 zzso with body mass index zzso between zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso was determined by DNA analysis, body fat mass by zzso zzso analysis and plasma zzso by zzso 

zzso zzso frequency was zzso in this population and there was no zzso zzso zzso When the subjects were divided into three groups based on zzso values zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso there was no difference in zzso zzso frequency zzso vs zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso Across the three groups, plasma zzso correlated positively with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso and total fat mass zzso zzso zzso p zzso Within each zzso zzso the waist to hip ratio, fat mass, plasma zzso zzso and insulin were relatively similar between zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso zzso had higher plasma zzso levels than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso in those with zzso above zzso zzso a difference which remained after adjustment for body fat mass zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of the beta zzso zzso gene is not associated with obesity in Chinese zzso Plasma zzso zzso correlate well with zzso and total fat zzso For obese Chinese women, the zzso zzso of the beta zzso zzso gene may contribute to an increased plasma zzso zzso
