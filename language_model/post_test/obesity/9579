zzso zzso were determined after oral administration of its zzso zzso to 12 obese subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso mean percent ideal body zzso zzso who were matched for age, sex, and smoking habits with 12 normal controls zzso zzso percent ideal body zzso zzso After an overnight fast, a single zzso zzso zzso equivalent to zzso zzso of zzso was zzso Multiple plasma samples drawn zzso days zzso were analyzed for zzso by zzso zzso zzso subjects compared to controls had a prolonged zzso elimination zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso p less than zzso Assuming quantitative conversion of zzso to zzso and zzso systemic zzso volume of distribution zzso was greatly increased in the obese zzso zzso versus zzso zzso p less than zzso The value of zzso remained greater even after correction for body weight zzso zzso versus zzso zzso p less than zzso However, clearance of zzso was not different between groups zzso zzso in obese versus zzso zzso in zzso The percent ideal body weight was highly correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso as was total body weight zzso zzso zzso The value of zzso was correlated highly with zzso zzso zzso zzso but only zzso with clearance zzso zzso zzso zzso the large increase in the zzso zzso value seen in obese subjects is predominantly due to the disproportionate distribution of this zzso drug into body fat as opposed to lean zzso The contribution of clearance to zzso zzso was of much less importance than was zzso in this obese study zzso
