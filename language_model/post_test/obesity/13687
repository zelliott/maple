To determine effects of dietary fat content on vascular responses in different zzso arteries in zzso 

zzso responses to zzso oxygen species zzso radical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso II zzso zzso were determined in carotid and zzso arteries of zzso mice fed with diets varying in fat content zzso fat zzso zzso high fat zzso zzso and very high fat zzso zzso zzso from zzso for 15 weeks, beginning at 4 weeks of zzso 

In zzso rings of carotid and zzso artery, zzso a zzso transient zzso In the zzso but not in zzso artery, zzso zzso increased with increasing dietary fat intake zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso responses to zzso remained zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso were reversed into relaxations after both zzso and zzso diet zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso II induced strong zzso in the zzso artery that were unaffected by dietary fat zzso In contrast, in the carotid artery zzso zzso contraction was attenuated after zzso and zzso diets zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso was significantly increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Treatment with zzso diet enhanced zzso zzso relaxation only in the zzso artery zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These findings demonstrate that dietary fat content has regional and distinct effects on vascular function in different vascular zzso The data also suggest the possibility that in selected zzso arteries zzso zzso mechanisms become activated in response to increased dietary fat zzso
