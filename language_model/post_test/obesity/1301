The impact of weight reduction on zzso zzso and zzso variables was studied in 13 obese, zzso women with the zzso zzso syndrome zzso zzso sensitivity zzso insulin zzso insulin zzso and zzso tolerance zzso zzso tolerance zzso zzso sex steroid hormones, zzso and free fatty acids zzso skin folds and waist hip ratio zzso were evaluated before zzso and after zzso zzso weight reduction to a weight stable level zzso zzso diet duration zzso zzso zzso Mean weight loss was zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso a reduction from a body mass index zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso P zzso zzso The results were compared with those of two groups of weight stable (no zzso women, 21 with zzso zzso and 23 normal control subjects zzso who were matched to the zzso the diet group reached after weight zzso zzso sensitivity index zzso improved on average zzso zzso zzso and plasma zzso by zzso zzso zzso serum sex hormone binding zzso levels increased by zzso zzso zzso and the sum of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were reduced by zzso zzso zzso whereas the early insulin response to zzso zzso the levels of zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso fat did not change significantly with weight zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso and zzso fat reached levels similar to the controls, whereas zzso had lower zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels zzso zzso greater zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso fat zzso zzso than zzso Among women with normal zzso zzso the insulin zzso was higher in both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso than in zzso There was a strong correlation between zzso and sum of zzso zzso in all groups zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso The variation in zzso in zzso and zzso zzso was best explained by zzso and zzso fat zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, insulin resistance in obese women with zzso was reduced by weight loss to similar levels as zzso control subjects, suggesting that insulin resistance in zzso is not a feature of zzso per zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
