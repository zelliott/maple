The zzso of the zzso of obesity is zzso zzso is the body's main regulator of systemic iron zzso and has been reported to be elevated in obese zzso Thus, we aimed to assess zzso status and serum zzso levels and their relationship with body mass index zzso in obese Egyptian children and zzso 

Fifty obese children were compared to 50 zzso zzso and zzso zzso matched zzso All subjects were subjected to history and zzso assessment and measurement of serum Fe, total iron binding capacity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso soluble zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

Fe, zzso and zzso were lower, while zzso zzso and zzso were higher in obese patients than zzso zzso standard zzso score zzso correlated zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and positively with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso Higher zzso zzso and zzso were risk factors for iron zzso zzso 

zzso and elevated zzso are prevalent in obese children and correlated with zzso zzso The connection between zzso and inflammation could explain the association of ID with zzso
