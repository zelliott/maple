zzso zzso zzso represents a critical mechanism in regulating the chemical and functional zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The cholesterol zzso zzso zzso the zzso of cholesterol to zzso cholesterol zzso zzso In this study, we showed that the expression of zzso in the liver was induced in obese mice and during the transition from the zzso to the fed state, suggesting that the regulation of zzso is zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso by targeting the zzso factor zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso in both cell cultures and transgenic zzso Treatment of mice with zzso or transgenic zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the liver inhibited zzso zzso and alleviated zzso abnormalities both in mice with zzso obesity zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso by suppressing the expression of zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso leading to decreased zzso and nuclear exclusion of zzso Our results also suggested that zzso is a potential zzso of zzso in improving zzso zzso We conclude that zzso and its zzso zzso zzso are important zzso regulators that control zzso zzso suggesting zzso as a potential therapeutic agent and zzso as a potential therapeutic target for zzso zzso
