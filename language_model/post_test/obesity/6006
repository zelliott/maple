The increasing global prevalence of overweight and obesity has serious implications for the environment, as well as for zzso We estimate the impact on greenhouse gas emissions of increases in the population distribution of body mass index zzso 

We estimated the food energy required to maintain zzso zzso rate in two hypothetical adult populations using the zzso equations for males and zzso Additional greenhouse gas emissions due to higher fuel energy use for transporting a heavier population were zzso 

Compared with a normal population distribution of zzso a population with zzso obese requires zzso more food energy for its total energy zzso zzso gas emissions from food production and car travel due to increases in zzso in a population of 1 billion are estimated to be between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of carbon dioxide zzso per zzso 

The maintenance of a healthy zzso has important environmental benefits in terms of lower greenhouse gas zzso
