zzso tea has shown zzso effects but little is known about its effect on proliferation and differentiation of zzso This study investigated the effects of the zzso extracts of raw zzso tea and zzso zzso tea on proliferation and differentiation of zzso zzso zzso We examined dose and time effects of both zzso extracts on proliferation of zzso zzso The contents of zzso in zzso and the zzso expression of critical zzso factors involved in differentiation were zzso zzso and zzso rate of zzso by zzso tea extracts treatment were test for toxic and zzso zzso Both zzso extracts of zzso tea inhibited the proliferation of zzso zzso at the selected time zzso At lower concentration of raw zzso tea extracts (less than 300 zzso and zzso zzso tea extracts (less than 350 zzso no significant zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso tea was more effective with lower zzso than raw zzso zzso Both extracts suppressed the differentiation and zzso the gene expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso zzso these results indicate that both zzso extracts of zzso tea can inhibit proliferation and differentiation with zzso zzso tea more zzso zzso rich in both extracts may play a role in the zzso of proliferation and differentiation of zzso zzso
