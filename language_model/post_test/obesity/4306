zzso disease is the main cause of death in diabetic patients undergoing zzso zzso and hypertension increase left zzso zzso zzso a strong predictor of cardiovascular zzso This study evaluated left zzso structure and function in three groups of zzso type 2 diabetic patients with different zzso function, and assessed the factors associated with zzso in an Afro-Caribbean zzso 

Left zzso structure and function were measured by zzso Group 1 consisted of 150 patients with normal zzso function, group 2 included 183 patients with zzso dysfunction and the third group comprised 75 dialysis zzso 

Left zzso zzso increased from group 1 to groups 2 and 3 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso were zzso in group 1, zzso in group 2 and zzso in the dialysis patients zzso zzso was more concentric than eccentric in groups 2 and zzso The factors significantly associated with zzso were obesity in groups 1 and 2, and an increase of zzso in pulse pressure in groups 2 and 3, according to zzso zzso zzso 

Our study confirmed that, in a population of Afro-Caribbean zzso type 2 diabetic patients, zzso failure was associated to an increased left zzso zzso The data show that the variables associated with zzso differ according to zzso zzso This finding will be of value in the treatment and follow-up of these zzso
