zzso zzso in measured values of a risk factor can bias its association with zzso We investigated the extent of zzso dilution bias in calculated variables and its implications for comparing the zzso associations of risk zzso 

Using a zzso illustration and repeats from zzso individuals (12 zzso we estimated zzso dilution ratios zzso in calculated risk factors zzso index zzso zzso ratio zzso and zzso ratio zzso and in their components zzso weight, waist zzso and hip zzso assuming the long-term average exposure to be of zzso zzso hazard ratios zzso for risk of coronary heart disease zzso were compared across zzso measures per zzso zzso change in: zzso baseline and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso in calculated risk factors depend strongly on the zzso zzso and comparative zzso of the components of these risk zzso For measures of zzso the zzso was lower for zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso than for either of its components zzso zzso zzso zzso hip zzso zzso zzso or for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso predominantly because of the stronger correlation and more similar zzso observed between waist circumference and hip circumference than between height and weight or between waist circumference and zzso zzso zzso for zzso waist zzso zzso and zzso were respectively zzso zzso zzso and zzso per zzso change in baseline levels of these zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso per zzso change in zzso zzso 

The extent of zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso in calculated risk factors can be considerably larger (or zzso than in its zzso zzso associations of risk factors should be compared through the use of zzso zzso per zzso change in zzso levels of these risk zzso
