zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso occurring in skeletal muscles of obese animals is relatively zzso particularly with respect to zzso muscles and relationship to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso muscles of zzso mouse zzso weeks) were examined with respect to size zzso muscle zzso mass ratio, zzso area zzso zzso zzso protein content, zzso heavy chain zzso content, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Compared with zzso muscles from lean mice, all the three muscles from zzso mice were smaller in size (by zzso with zzso and zzso being the most zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso (the zzso zzso types in zzso and zzso zzso was markedly smaller (by approximately zzso in zzso mice, consistent with differences in muscle zzso Total protein content zzso to muscle zzso was significantly lower in zzso zzso and zzso zzso muscles of zzso mice, but there were no differences between zzso zzso and zzso muscles from the two animal groups with respect to zzso content (also zzso to muscle zzso zzso analyses of zzso composition in whole muscle zzso and single muscle zzso showed a shift towards slower zzso content, slower zzso containing zzso and a greater proportion of hybrid zzso in all the three muscles of zzso mice, with a shift towards a more zzso zzso also observed with respect to zzso zzso 

This study showed that zzso zzso and zzso muscles of zzso mice display size reductions to an extent that seems to be largely related to zzso type zzso and a shift in zzso type composition that may result from a process of structural zzso as suggested by the increased proportion of hybrid zzso in muscles of zzso zzso
