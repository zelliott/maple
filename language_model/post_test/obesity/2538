Under zzso conditions, arteries zzso in response to changes in blood flow to maintain local zzso zzso zzso factors and developing zzso may be associated with zzso zzso that produces relatively large arteries with low levels of zzso zzso Recent studies have shown that the zzso artery and other peripheral arteries are enlarged in patients with risk factors and cardiovascular disease, and we tested the hypothesis that this finding represents zzso zzso 

We measured zzso artery diameter and flow by ultrasound and calculated zzso stress in a diverse cohort of zzso subjects (age zzso years, zzso male, and 51% with coronary artery disease and/or peripheral zzso zzso In a zzso linear zzso model, age zzso gender zzso body mass index zzso hypertension zzso and zzso zzso were associated with larger zzso zzso Older age was associated with lower zzso stress zzso consistent with zzso zzso However, body mass index, hypertension, zzso and prevalent zzso were associated with zzso changes in blood flow and no difference in zzso stress compared to reference groups, suggesting zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that enlargement of the zzso artery in the setting of zzso hypertension, zzso and zzso reflects zzso zzso The results provide further support for the concept that zzso zzso is an important zzso response that is maintained despite the presence of risk factors and developing zzso
