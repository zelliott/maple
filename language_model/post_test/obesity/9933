Evidence is accumulating that total body mass and its relative composition influence the rate of fat zzso in zzso This effect can be explained by two factors operating in zzso zzso the effect of the size of the tissue mass and zzso the nature of the fuel mix zzso zzso the proportion of energy derived from fat zzso zzso In a zzso study of 307 women with increasing degrees of zzso we observed that the respiratory zzso zzso in zzso conditions became progressively lower with increased body zzso indicating a shift in zzso zzso However, the zzso is known to be also influenced by the diet commonly zzso by the zzso A short-term mixed diet zzso in lean and obese women has also demonstrated the high sensitivity of zzso to changes in energy zzso Following a one-day zzso zzso zzso in excess of the previous 24 h energy zzso the magnitude of increase in zzso was identical in lean and obese subjects and the net efficiency of zzso zzso and storage was not influenced by the state of zzso
