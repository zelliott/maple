To determine pulmonary function test zzso profile and respiratory muscle strength zzso of a group of obese individuals who did not have evidence of zzso airway disease or other underlying diseases affecting their respiratory zzso 

zzso zzso 

zzso laboratory, VA Medical zzso 

zzso consecutive obese zzso mass index greater than zzso zzso male subjects without overt zzso airway disease zzso ratio greater than zzso 

Standard zzso and maximum zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mouth pressures were zzso zzso was calculated from the following formula: zzso Two distinct groups were identified, those with normal maximum voluntary ventilation zzso zzso zzso zzso and those with low zzso Both zzso and zzso flow rates zzso zzso forced zzso flow at 50% vital capacity zzso maximum zzso flow rate zzso lung volumes zzso capacity zzso zzso capacity zzso zzso reserve zzso zzso and zzso were significantly lower, and residual zzso lung capacity zzso ratio was significantly higher in obese subjects with low zzso compared with those in whom zzso was zzso zzso correlated significantly with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the strongest correlation was with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso 

Standard zzso allow recognition of a zzso of obese subjects without overt zzso airway disease who have more severe lung dysfunction, the marker of which is a low zzso zzso airway abnormalities may be responsible for these zzso
