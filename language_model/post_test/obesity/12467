Studies have suggested that asthma in obese individuals differs from the classic asthma zzso presenting as a disease that is more difficult to zzso 

The objective of the present study was to determine whether zzso age or a combination of the two are associated with worse zzso parameters in patients with zzso 

This was an zzso zzso study involving patients over zzso of age who had been diagnosed with asthma zzso or zzso We evaluated the results of their zzso zzso The patients were classified in accordance with two criteria: body mass index zzso and zzso Based on their zzso the patients were divided into three groups: normal weight, overweight and zzso Patients were also separated into two categories by age: zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso 

We evaluated zzso patients with asthma and their zzso zzso In the present study, the pulmonary function parameters were zzso correlated with zzso and age zzso We found that there was a statistically significant correlation between zzso values and zzso among patients zzso of age zzso however, among patients over 60, we did not observe this negative zzso 

The zzso values decreased significantly in proportion to the increase of zzso and age in patients with zzso especially among young zzso There was no negative correlation between zzso and zzso in the group zzso of age, suggesting that perhaps the time of disease is a major factor in the loss of lung function than weight gain in the zzso
