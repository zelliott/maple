The current epidemic of obesity has caused a surge of interest in the study of the mechanisms regulating zzso tissue zzso It has been observed that zzso tissue contains a pool of adult stem cells with zzso properties, which provide for the zzso cell zzso and can be isolated and potentially zzso for tissue engineering and zzso medical zzso These zzso cells exhibit zzso zzso can be isolated from zzso tissue of adult subjects, zzso in zzso and induced to differentiate into zzso Different populations of zzso precursor cells can be isolated from human fat zzso Thus, zzso precursors cells are a zzso cells population, consisting of zzso zzso stem cells generally termed zzso stem cells zzso In this review, we discuss some aspects of zzso basic biology, the methodology involved in zzso isolation and culture, and some implications of zzso availability for the understanding of zzso diseases in zzso
