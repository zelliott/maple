zzso patients are at high risk of developing cardiovascular zzso Several studies suggest obesity as an independent risk zzso zzso tissue is now accepted as an zzso organ that produces and zzso a variety of zzso hormones and other zzso players involved in the zzso of zzso Among this versatile group of zzso and zzso of inflammation and zzso we have studied the expression of zzso zzso zzso tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All these zzso in their circulatory form, have been associated with cardiovascular zzso However, there is no much data available on their expression in zzso tissue in human subjects with and without cardiovascular zzso 

We successfully isolated zzso from subcutaneous fat zzso of 61 patients with or without cardiovascular zzso We then measured the zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso using relative zzso 

zzso not statistically zzso all inflammatory zzso - except zzso - were highly expressed in patients with cardiovascular disease zzso zzso zzso compared with those without zzso zzso zzso zzso the gene expression data, trying to capture the overall inflammatory activity in zzso tissue in a score system, we observed a highly significant association with zzso 

Trying to capture the overall inflammatory activity, in addition to the mass of zzso zzso could provide useful hints towards a zzso link between obesity and presence of cardiovascular zzso
