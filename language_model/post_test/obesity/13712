The relationship between obesity and hypertension has been investigated in a large number of zzso population studies and a smaller number of zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that in most zzso blood pressure increases zzso with increasing body weight or body mass zzso The relationship is present across all subgroups, although the magnitude of the association appears greater in whites than blacks and greater in younger than older zzso It is estimated that as much as one-third of all hypertension may be attributable to obesity in populations where hypertension and obesity are widely zzso Evidence from prospective studies and clinical trials suggests that hypertension in obese patients increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and that drug treatment of hypertension reduces the zzso However, it is uncertain whether the risks associated with hypertension and the benefits of treatment are as great in obese zzso as they are in lean zzso The effects of weight reduction on blood pressure have been investigated in a small number of randomized, controlled trials involving a total of about 600 zzso Overall, the results of the trials indicate that weight reduction lowers blood pressure over intervals of up to one zzso The magnitude of the blood pressure response appears to be directly zzso to the amount of weight loss zzso However, the latter is zzso related to the length of zzso zzso maintenance of weight loss remains a major problem for the zzso long-term trials of the effects of weight reduction on blood pressure and the cardiovascular complications of zzso
