The present study investigated the relationships between zzso oxygen species zzso zzso fibrosis, and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso in type 2 diabetic zzso mice and in zzso transgenic zzso mice zzso rat zzso zzso in their zzso zzso zzso 

Blood pressure, blood zzso and zzso were monitored for up to 5 zzso zzso were processed for zzso and zzso studies zzso zzso zzso zzso labeling or zzso for active zzso and zzso zzso quantitative zzso zzso were used to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso mice developed zzso zzso hypertension, and zzso In contrast, zzso zzso mice became obese and zzso but had normal blood pressure and attenuated zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso from zzso mice displayed progressive zzso zzso zzso zzso fibrosis, and zzso zzso and increased expression of collagen type IV, zzso and active zzso as well as increased zzso zzso These changes, except zzso zzso were markedly attenuated in zzso of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression was increased in zzso zzso zzso of zzso mice but not of zzso zzso zzso 

Our results indicate a crucial role for zzso zzso in the progression of hypertension, zzso zzso fibrosis, and zzso zzso in type 2 diabetes and demonstrate the beneficial effects of suppressing zzso zzso
