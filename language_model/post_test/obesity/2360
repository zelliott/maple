It is well established that zzso regulates energy balance largely through zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the brain and that zzso activates one subset of zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso the other zzso zzso However, the zzso released from zzso zzso that mediate zzso action in the brain are not well zzso Previous results demonstrate that zzso mainly acts on zzso acid zzso zzso to reduce body weight, and that zzso activates zzso zzso activity by reducing zzso release onto these zzso suggesting a body zzso role for zzso released from zzso zzso To directly examine the role of zzso release from zzso zzso in body weight regulation, mice with disruption of zzso release specifically from zzso zzso were generated by deletion of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Interestingly, these mice developed mild obesity on zzso diet and were sensitive to zzso zzso which were associated with higher food intake and lower energy zzso Moreover, these mice showed blunted responses in both food intake and body weight to acute zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso zzso In combination with the previous studies that zzso reduces zzso release onto zzso zzso through zzso zzso and that disruption of zzso release from zzso zzso protein zzso one subset of zzso zzso leads to a lean zzso our results suggest that, under our experimental conditions, zzso release from zzso zzso dominates over zzso zzso
