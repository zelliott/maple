The ability of insulin to promote zzso zzso zzso and to stimulate zzso zzso was examined in eight obese and ten normal weight control zzso zzso was infused at three rates to produced plasma insulin zzso of approximately 100, zzso and 19,000 zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso was diminished during the lowest dose insulin clamp study zzso zzso but could be zzso at zzso plasma insulin zzso These results indicate that obese subjects are resistant to the ability of insulin to stimulate zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso plasma insulin levels, with zzso at zzso insulin zzso is most consistent with a decrease in the number of insulin receptors on insulin target zzso
