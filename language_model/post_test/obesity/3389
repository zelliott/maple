It has not been clarified whether high mean blood pressure zzso of zzso and bilateral notching zzso on zzso artery zzso zzso affect the subsequent circulating levels of zzso growth factor zzso soluble zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and soluble zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso at zzso weeks and zzso weeks were measured in all women with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso eligible women, and 338 consecutive women with zzso were selected from the remaining 777 zzso Only data before the onset of zzso were zzso The zzso value of an abnormal decrease of zzso was set at the 5th zzso and those of an abnormal increase of zzso zzso and zzso were set at the 95th zzso The frequency of zzso in those with zzso was almost the same as that in those with zzso zzso zzso zzso In women with zzso zzso zzso and zzso the frequency of abnormal zzso ratio at zzso weeks was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the frequency of abnormal zzso ratio at zzso weeks in those with zzso was significantly increased than in zzso Similarly, in the four groups, the frequency of abnormal zzso at zzso weeks was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the frequency in those with zzso was significantly increased than in zzso In conclusion, high zzso levels and abnormal zzso artery zzso may be zzso implicated in circulating abnormalities of zzso zzso
