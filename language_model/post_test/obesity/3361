In male rats, genetic obesity and experimental diabetes are associated with altered activities of several of the zzso zzso zzso zzso concerned with steroid and zzso zzso The present study examined the roles of insulin and zzso in zzso these zzso In obese male zzso rats, zzso 6 zzso 16 zzso and 16 zzso activities zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly decreased to zzso zzso and zzso of lean zzso zzso was also associated with a significant decrease in the activities of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to about zzso A similar decrease in total zzso zzso was also zzso zzso 7 zzso activity zzso by zzso was unchanged in these zzso In zzso diabetic male zzso rats, zzso 7 zzso and 16 zzso activities were significantly elevated to zzso and zzso of control, zzso zzso increases in the rates of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were also noted in diabetic rat zzso In contrast, the activity of zzso was reduced to zzso of control and zzso 6 zzso was zzso Control of the diabetic state with insulin treatment reversed all the changes in zzso zzso zzso correlations were found between serum zzso of insulin and zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Positive correlations of the same magnitude were also found between these mixed function zzso activities and zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
