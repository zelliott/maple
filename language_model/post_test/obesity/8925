zzso zzso were studied in young zzso zzso zzso zzso rats zzso and a related control zzso zzso strain zzso zzso metabolism was characterized by minimal model analysis of intravenous zzso tolerance test zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were studied under zzso zzso Mean body weight and plasma zzso and insulin concentration were significantly greater zzso in zzso than in zzso whereas zzso values of mean zzso pressure zzso and heart rate zzso were not significantly zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by electrical stimulation of the zzso nerve zzso trains of 100 zzso zzso pulse zzso zzso to zzso pulse zzso were significantly higher zzso zzso in zzso at each level of stimulus zzso zzso analysis showed a linear increase in zzso and zzso with increasing zzso nerve stimulus zzso zzso responses to zzso after zzso blockade demonstrated that vascular zzso to zzso stimulation is not increased in zzso compared with zzso Thus this factor does not contribute to enhancement of zzso zzso observed in this zzso zzso sensitivity in zzso was zzso zzso that in zzso These results suggest that stronger sympathetic nervous zzso in zzso is associated with a severe zzso state before the onset of hypertension and support the hypothesis that zzso stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system is involved in the development of cardiovascular diseases related to zzso of zzso zzso
