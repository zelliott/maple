zzso can regulate several immune zzso However, the role of zzso on zzso function has not been recognized in zzso zzso we have investigated the effect of zzso on zzso immune dysfunction using zzso obese zzso To induce zzso zzso mice were fed a high-fat diet for 14 weeks and control mice were fed a standard diet for the same zzso The obese and control groups of mice were then starved for 48 zzso and received zzso injections of zzso zzso or zzso saline four times during zzso Other control mice in both diet groups were free fed without being zzso Although zzso of the control mice dramatically reduced the weights of the immune zzso zzso production and increased proliferation of cultured zzso these levels returned to those of the zzso groups with zzso zzso zzso However, these effects of zzso were not observed in obese zzso These findings provide some evidence that zzso can regulate the immune function in zzso It is also suggested that the action of zzso might not appear in zzso
