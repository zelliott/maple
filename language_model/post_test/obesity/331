The development of insulin resistance in the obese is associated with zzso zzso zzso We aimed to identify novel links between zzso insulin resistance and the inflammatory response by comparing zzso with type I zzso zzso knockout zzso mice, which are protected against zzso insulin zzso Mice were fed a high-fat diet for 16 zzso zzso sensitivity was measured and zzso analysis was performed on zzso zzso and skeletal muscle zzso Despite an equal weight gain, zzso mice had lower plasma zzso insulin and zzso zzso compared with controls, following dietary zzso The higher insulin sensitivity in zzso mice was associated with zzso of zzso proteins and zzso in zzso tissue and zzso soluble zzso zzso consistent with a compromised inflammatory response as well as increased zzso and decreased fatty acid zzso in their zzso Their lower zzso zzso zzso may reflect decreased flux of free fatty acids to the liver, decreased zzso fatty zzso protein expression and decreased zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso of classical zzso of zzso stress in their zzso zzso suggesting that disruption of the zzso inflammatory response may zzso cellular stress, which was associated with significant protection from zzso insulin resistance, independent of zzso
