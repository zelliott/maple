zzso is a major risk factor for lower back zzso zzso zzso branch block is a common diagnostic tool in these zzso Although approach to the facet joint guided by ultrasound has been demonstrated successfully in lean patients, its success in obese patients is zzso therefore evaluated the success rate of real-time ultrasound approach in obese patients in a clinical feasibility zzso 

We performed a total of 84 zzso branch blocks in 20 obese patients zzso mass zzso zzso using zzso We studied the success rate, measured depth to the facet joint, and assessed radiation dose and pain zzso 

Our success rate was zzso zzso blocks) when using ultrasound to guide needle zzso The average distance from skin to target point at the zzso process was 76 zzso zzso 15 zzso zzso depth was significantly different between zzso and zzso on both sides zzso zzso zzso The needle advancement could not be tracked to the zzso The verbal rating scale scores before, immediately after, and 24 zzso after the procedure were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The average radiation dose was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso branch blocks in obese patients cannot be performed by ultrasound guidance zzso
