zzso zzso airway size is determined by interaction between structural properties of the zzso airway and neural regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso seems to have two distinct mechanical influences on the zzso airway zzso First, obesity increases soft tissue surrounding the zzso airway within limited zzso zzso occupying and narrowing its space zzso anatomical zzso Second, zzso particularly central zzso increases visceral fat volume decreasing lung zzso zzso wall zzso is increased by the lung volume reduction, possibly through decreased zzso zzso traction zzso volume zzso zzso compensation for functioning structural abnormalities operating during zzso is lost during sleep, leading to zzso zzso zzso of the negative feedback of the respiratory system may accelerate cycling of zzso closure and zzso Improvement of the zzso anatomical imbalance and maintenance of lung volume are the keys for safe zzso airway managements of obese patients with zzso sleep zzso
