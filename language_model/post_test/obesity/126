In order to study the zzso effects of dietary zzso on zzso rats, young male fatty and lean rats were fed ad zzso or in meals (2 zzso for 4 zzso zzso contained zzso zzso as either zzso zzso sugar or cooked zzso A zzso effect zzso versus zzso occurred with the activities of liver and zzso tissue zzso zzso relative total fat pad size and soluble zzso tissue protein levels in both ad zzso and zzso rats, whereas a zzso effect occurred with food intake and relative liver size only in zzso rats and with body weight gain only in ad zzso zzso The significance of diet effects varied with zzso and feeding zzso The zzso effect zzso versus zzso occurred with food efficiency and body weight gain, activities of liver zzso and zzso zzso relative liver size, relative total fat pad size and soluble zzso tissue protein levels in both ad zzso and zzso rats, and with zzso zzso zzso activities in zzso zzso The zzso effect zzso versus zzso zzso occurred with the activities of liver zzso zzso relative total fat pad size and soluble zzso tissue protein levels in ad zzso rats and was greater in lean than in fatty zzso The data demonstrate that the zzso fatty and lean rat can be used as sensitive models to study differential effects of dietary zzso
