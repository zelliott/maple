We evaluated the effects of zzso and zzso obesity in the zzso on offspring growth, zzso and zzso zzso From 60 d before conception through zzso zzso zzso were fed zzso zzso zzso zzso 8) or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10) of zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso diet increased zzso by zzso from diet initiation to mating zzso zzso zzso and by zzso by d 135 of gestation zzso zzso zzso whereas control zzso increased zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso from diet initiation to d 135 of zzso zzso were weaned at 120 d of age and were maintained as a zzso At zzso zzso zzso zzso of age, offspring from control and zzso zzso were individually zzso and subjected to a zzso ad zzso feeding zzso At the beginning and end of the feeding challenge, dual zzso zzso was used to determine percentage of body fat, and a frequently sampled intravenous zzso tolerance test zzso with minimal model analysis was used to assess insulin and zzso zzso At the beginning of the feeding challenge, zzso and percentage of body fat were similar for control and zzso zzso averaging zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso At the initial zzso zzso effectiveness and insulin sensitivity were reduced zzso zzso in offspring from zzso compared with control zzso During the feeding challenge, plasma zzso of zzso were increased zzso zzso in offspring from zzso compared with control zzso zzso plasma zzso before the feeding challenge tended to be greater zzso zzso zzso in the zzso offspring compared with the control offspring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At the end of the feeding challenge, zzso plasma zzso and insulin were increased zzso zzso in the zzso offspring compared with the control offspring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso During the feeding challenge, offspring from zzso zzso consumed approximately zzso more feed zzso zzso and tended to have increased zzso gain zzso zzso P zzso zzso compared with offspring from control zzso At the final dual zzso zzso zzso percentage of body fat was greater zzso zzso for offspring from zzso zzso than for offspring from control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At the final zzso offspring from zzso zzso had a decreased zzso zzso zzso acute insulin response to zzso disposition index, and zzso effectiveness, and tended zzso zzso zzso to have a decreased insulin sensitivity compared with offspring from control zzso zzso obesity induced before and during gestation leads to zzso in zzso zzso and insulin regulation, and zzso of mature zzso
