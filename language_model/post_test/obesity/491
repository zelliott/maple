In the general population, zzso exhibits a zzso or zzso relationship with zzso however, in zzso states this relationship is often zzso zzso We have recently documented an zzso increase in zzso in the Pittsburgh zzso of Diabetes zzso Study zzso of type 1 diabetes zzso As intensified insulin therapy zzso may promote weight gain, the impact of weight gain in zzso is of zzso We therefore assessed the association of zzso with mortality in 655 zzso participants during 20 years of zzso 

zzso were zzso as zzso zzso mass index zzso normal zzso zzso zzso zzso overweight zzso zzso zzso zzso or obese zzso or zzso Cox models were constructed using zzso and zzso at zzso updated means during zzso time variation zzso most recent zzso and change during adulthood as zzso of zzso 

The prevalence of zzso zzso insulin shots daily and/or zzso increased from 7 to zzso zzso increased by zzso and obesity increased zzso There were 146 zzso In zzso models, zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso relationship with mortality zzso zzso zzso for zzso updated mean and zzso models, zzso However, only in the zzso model were the obese significantly different from the normal weight, whereas the baseline model showed no differences by zzso zzso In both the updated mean and zzso models, the zzso were at greater risk than were the normal weight zzso both zzso The zzso relationship of zzso with mortality remained after adjustment for diabetes complications and for biological or zzso risk factors, with the exception of baseline zzso risk factors, in which a linear association zzso Adjustment for waist circumference eliminated risk in the zzso Finally, weight gain during follow-up was zzso 

The relationship of zzso with mortality in zzso now seems to resemble that of the general population, albeit with a marked increased risk in those who are zzso
