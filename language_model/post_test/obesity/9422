Body mass index zzso has proven unreliable in predicting survival following zzso for zzso While measures of zzso fat correlate with medical and zzso complications of zzso the impact of zzso fat on pancreatic cancer survival is zzso We hypothesized that the quantity of zzso fat would predict survival following zzso of pancreatic zzso 

zzso CT imaging was used to measure zzso zzso Cox zzso analyses were used to identify independent zzso of zzso 

zzso patients from zzso underwent zzso for zzso pancreatic zzso After adjusting for age and zzso invasion status, zzso zzso did not predict overall survival zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso of zzso fat predicted zzso Relative to patients with the least zzso fat zzso zzso those with more zzso fat demonstrated worse overall survival, but in a zzso zzso zzso in the second zzso showed a fourfold increase in likelihood of death zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso relative to the lowest zzso Patients in the third zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso and fourth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso also showed greater risk of zzso 

zzso zzso fat identifies a subset of patients with worse prognosis in pancreatic zzso
