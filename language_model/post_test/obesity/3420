We hypothesized that genes within recently identified zzso associated with zzso ratio zzso exhibit fat zzso zzso zzso which zzso with zzso zzso 

zzso tissue zzso zzso expression of 6 genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso within these zzso showing zzso zzso quantitative trait zzso was measured in 222 paired samples of human visceral zzso and subcutaneous zzso zzso The relationship of zzso expression levels with zzso quantitative traits was assessed by zzso correlation zzso zzso linear relationships were assessed by generalized linear zzso zzso 

Whereas only zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression in zzso AT correlated zzso with zzso zzso adjusted for age and zzso zzso expression of all studied genes in at least one of the fat zzso correlated significantly with zzso and/or zzso fat area zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso adjusted for age and zzso zzso the transcript levels of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso associated with body mass index zzso zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso adjusted for age and zzso Moreover, independent of sex, obesity and diabetes status, differential expression between zzso and zzso AT was observed for all tested genes zzso Finally, the zzso zzso was zzso associated with increased zzso zzso zzso expression zzso after adjusting for age, sex and zzso 

Our data including the zzso zzso of zzso expression suggests that genes within the zzso zzso might be involved in the regulation of fat zzso
