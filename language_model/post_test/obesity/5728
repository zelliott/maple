Plasma levels of alpha 2 zzso inhibitor zzso 2 zzso were measured by both an zzso and a functional zzso and a good correlation zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso was found between the two zzso When compared to values recorded in 17 control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha 2 zzso zzso levels were found to be obviously decreased in the 10 patients with zzso zzso of the liver zzso zzso zzso zzso and slightly increased in the 13 zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the 23 zzso and obese patients zzso zzso zzso zzso In spite of similar plasma levels of alpha 2 zzso dilute blood zzso zzso was rather accelerated in patients with the zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso zzso and obviously delayed in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Apparently the rate of zzso zzso is mainly determined at an earlier stage of the zzso process, represented by the balance between tissue zzso zzso and its zzso Severe decrease of alpha 2 zzso may nevertheless contribute to accelerated zzso zzso as noted in a patient with familial zzso alpha 2 zzso zzso On the other hand increased level of factor zzso and alpha 2 zzso associated to an impaired zzso zzso would render the zzso network more resistant to zzso
