Growth hormone has been used zzso in two studies to treat individuals with type 2 diabetes, with both reporting beneficial effects on zzso zzso However, concerns over potential zzso actions of growth hormone complicate its anticipated use to treat type 2 zzso Thus, an animal model of type 2 diabetes could help evaluate the effects of growth hormone for treating this zzso 

Male zzso mice were placed on a high-fat diet to induce obesity and type 2 zzso Starting at 16 weeks of age, mice were treated once daily for 6 weeks with one of four different doses of growth zzso Body weight, body zzso zzso blood zzso insulin, zzso zzso liver zzso tissue weights and blood zzso were zzso 

Body composition zzso revealed a zzso decrease in fat and an increase in lean zzso Analysis of fat loss by depot revealed that subcutaneous and zzso fat was the most sensitive to growth hormone zzso In addition, growth hormone treatment resulted in improvement in zzso zzso with the highest dose zzso zzso zzso tolerance and liver zzso In contrast, insulin levels were not altered by the treatment, nor did organ weights zzso However, zzso plasma zzso and zzso were significantly decreased after growth hormone zzso 

Growth hormone therapy improves zzso metabolism in this mouse model of obesity and type 2 diabetes, providing a means to explore the molecular zzso of this zzso
