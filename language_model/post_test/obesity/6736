zzso is increasingly prevalent in the United zzso There are several reports of outcomes in obese patients after total knee or hip zzso The purpose of this study was to compare the functional outcomes and complications of obese patients undergoing shoulder zzso with those of overweight or zzso zzso 

zzso patients who underwent primary total shoulder zzso were grouped according to body mass zzso The groups were classified zzso normal, which was zzso by a body mass index of zzso zzso zzso zzso overweight, which was zzso by a body mass index of 25 to zzso zzso zzso zzso and obese, which was zzso by a body mass index of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demographics and zzso and zzso complications were zzso The American zzso and zzso Surgeons score, Short zzso and visual analog scale pain and fatigue scores were evaluated at baseline and at the two-year follow-up zzso 

In the normal group, the mean scores (and standard zzso improved for the American zzso and zzso Surgeons score from zzso zzso zzso points preoperatively to zzso zzso zzso points at two years zzso zzso zzso and for the Short zzso Physical zzso zzso score from zzso zzso zzso points preoperatively to zzso zzso zzso points at two years zzso zzso zzso the visual analog scale pain scores decreased from a mean score of 62 points preoperatively to 12 points at two years zzso zzso zzso In the overweight group, the mean scores (and standard zzso improved for the American zzso and zzso Surgeons score from zzso zzso zzso points preoperatively to zzso zzso zzso points at two years zzso zzso zzso and for the Short zzso Physical zzso zzso score from zzso zzso zzso points preoperatively to zzso zzso zzso points at two years zzso zzso zzso zzso the visual analog scale pain scores decreased from 68 points to 18 points zzso zzso In the obese group, the mean scores (and standard zzso improved for the American zzso and zzso Surgeons score from zzso zzso zzso points preoperatively to zzso zzso zzso points at two years zzso zzso zzso and for the Short zzso Physical zzso zzso score from zzso zzso zzso points preoperatively to zzso zzso zzso points at two years zzso zzso zzso zzso the visual analog scale pain scores decreased from 66 points preoperatively to 11 points at two years zzso zzso zzso There was one deep infection in the overweight group that required surgical irrigation and zzso Two revisions of the components were required in the normal zzso 

zzso did not have a zzso effect on the improvement of short-term shoulder zzso However, the overall physical function of obese and overweight patients does not significantly improve after total shoulder zzso In the normal body mass index group, patients did improve overall physical function after total shoulder zzso
