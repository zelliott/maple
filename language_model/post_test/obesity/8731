Several studies show a relationship between abdominal obesity and cardiovascular diseases, partially zzso through an altered metabolism of zzso The present study was aimed at testing the zzso of this association across three contrasted populations and at assessing the performances of abdominal obesity as a screening tool for zzso Data were drawn from three population health surveys recently conducted in two regions of a developed country zzso mostly of Caucasian origin, zzso zzso zzso and in a less developed country zzso Indian Ocean, mostly of black zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was defined as a ratio of total cholesterol to zzso zzso cholesterol zzso greater than zzso Two zzso circumference zzso zzso ratio zzso and waist circumference zzso were used to define abdominal obesity either as zzso zzso in men and zzso zzso in women or as zzso 94 zzso and zzso 80 zzso zzso A consistent direct association between abdominal obesity and zzso zzso ratios varying from zzso to zzso was found in the three zzso independently of zzso age, body mass index, blood pressure, and zzso This consistency across zzso and environments strengthens the hypothesis of a common zzso zzso The sensitivity for detecting zzso was generally higher for abdominal zzso based on either zzso or zzso than for criteria based on the other risk factors under zzso In addition, the sensitivity was higher in the study populations with a low prevalence of zzso zzso women and zzso of both zzso than in the zzso These findings support that zzso and zzso may be useful as simple and inexpensive screening tools to select individuals eligible for more sophisticated and costly serum zzso zzso especially in developing zzso
