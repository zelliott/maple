The objectives of this study were to identify potential zzso in gene expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso in mouse zzso under a chronic peripheral infusion of zzso or at early (8 weeks) and advanced (16 weeks) zzso of zzso zzso Control or zzso obesity mice (8 or 16 weeks of high-fat zzso were either treated or not treated with zzso zzso features were analyzed and expression of the genes of interest was measured by quantitative reverse zzso zzso and western zzso We reported that in control mice, but not in obese mice, zzso infusion induced an increase in zzso zzso level as well as in zzso zzso level suggesting that zzso could act directly and/or through zzso hormone zzso This hypothesis was reinforced after in zzso studies, using the mouse zzso zzso cell line, since both zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatments increased zzso zzso After 8 weeks of high-fat diet, zzso obese mice became resistant to the central action of zzso and their zzso content of zzso and zzso zzso were decreased without modification of zzso zzso zzso After 16 weeks of high-fat diet, mice exhibited more severe zzso disorders with type 2 zzso Moreover, zzso expression of zzso was highly zzso In conclusion, several zzso of the zzso system were found in obese mice that are probably consecutive to their central resistance to zzso Moreover, when the zzso status is highly zzso (with all characteristics of a type 2 zzso other regulatory mechanisms zzso of zzso can also take zzso
