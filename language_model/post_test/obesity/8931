zzso is a new zzso protein specifically expressed in zzso zzso In obese subjects, zzso or long-term calorie restriction diets were associated with a reduction in zzso gene zzso zzso zzso level was previously shown to be zzso correlated with zzso zzso plasma levels and associated with insulin sensitivity of zzso obese and non-obese zzso The purpose of the present work was to get more insight into the regulation of zzso gene expression by insulin and/or zzso using clamp studies and to examine its potential zzso in subjects with a deterioration of zzso zzso 

zzso gene expression was zzso by reverse zzso zzso in zzso zzso tissue of healthy lean subjects after an zzso zzso clamp zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression was also analyzed in patients with different levels of insulin zzso 

During zzso insulin infusion induced zzso gene expression zzso zzso zzso zzso Its expression was also induced by zzso infusion, although to a lesser extend zzso P zzso zzso zzso of both insulin and zzso zzso had an additive effect on the zzso expression zzso P zzso zzso In a pathological context, zzso gene was highly expressed in the zzso tissue of zzso diabetic patients with chronic zzso compared with healthy zzso zzso zzso gene expression was significantly reduced in zzso diabetics zzso zzso zzso but remained moderately regulated in these patients after the zzso clamp zzso zzso 

These results suggest a strong relationship between zzso zzso insulin sensitivity, and zzso metabolism in human zzso zzso
