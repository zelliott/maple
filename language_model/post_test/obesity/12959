Before men older than age 45 participate in vigorous exercise programs, the American Heart Association and the American College of Sports Medicine recommend they undergo a screening zzso exercise treadmill zzso We examined the zzso value for subsequent cardiac events of zzso silent zzso zzso zzso during the exercise treadmill test in healthy, zzso obese, middle-aged and older men recruited for research zzso 

A cohort study with 7 years of zzso 

zzso research at a zzso zzso 

170 healthy, zzso obese, middle-aged and older zzso zzso zzso men with no prior history of coronary artery disease zzso recruited for research zzso 

zzso risk factors, zzso zzso zzso segment depression on the zzso during a zzso exercise treadmill zzso zzso zzso capacity zzso and 7- year follow-up data on incident zzso 

At zzso 37 of the men zzso had zzso zzso on their treadmill zzso zzso follow-up data was obtained in zzso of the zzso In the zzso 31 men had cardiac zzso zzso cardiac death, zzso zzso zzso coronary artery bypass graft surgery, zzso and four had zzso zzso zzso of the 37 men zzso with zzso zzso on their baseline exercise tests had cardiac zzso compared with 14 of 133 zzso men with normal exercise tests zzso zzso Compared with the men with no cardiac zzso the men with subsequent cardiac zzso were older zzso zzso 1 vs 58 zzso 1 years, mean zzso zzso P zzso and had a lower zzso zzso capacity zzso (24 zzso 1 vs 29 zzso 1 zzso P zzso In Cox zzso hazards analysis, zzso zzso and a low zzso were independent zzso of subsequent cardiac zzso 

In a healthy population of obese, zzso middle-aged and older men, zzso zzso and low zzso were zzso of incident zzso This suggests that exercise treadmill testing is beneficial in assessing risk for future cardiac events in obese, sedentary zzso
