Recent studies indicated that dietary zzso zzso fatty acids zzso increase circulating zzso zzso in zzso 

We aimed to investigate whether a diet rich in zzso zzso increased plasma zzso of total or zzso zzso zzso in healthy zzso obese men and zzso 

Sixteen women and 10 men with a body mass index (in zzso between 28 and 33 were randomly assigned to consume a diet rich in zzso zzso zzso of energy zzso from both plant and marine sources or a control diet zzso of energy intake from zzso zzso For the first 2 zzso these diets were consumed under zzso zzso then followed a zzso period of ad zzso consumption that was associated with a moderate loss of approximately zzso of body weight in both zzso Total and zzso zzso plasma zzso were measured before and after each diet zzso 

Plasma zzso zzso zzso did not change during the zzso period, but they increased modestly ( approximately zzso during the ad zzso period when subjects lost weight zzso zzso zzso for time in zzso analysis of zzso and to a similar extent in subjects consuming the control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso diets zzso zzso zzso for time zzso treatment zzso Plasma zzso of zzso zzso did not change significantly during the zzso 

zzso zzso zzso consumed at levels of zzso of energy intake do not significantly increase plasma or zzso zzso zzso in zzso obese healthy men and women over the course of 14 zzso
