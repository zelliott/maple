Three DNA zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso B gene and their influence on zzso index, serum lipids and zzso levels were studied in 181 healthy Indians of both sexes zzso males and 60 zzso aged between 17 and 71 zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and Del zzso of the signal zzso region in Indians were found to be significantly lower zzso and zzso zzso compared to the zzso in Caucasians zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The frequency of zzso zzso was similar to that in Caucasians zzso vs zzso A highly significant linkage zzso was observed between the zzso site and zzso zzso of the zzso B gene in this sample zzso zzso zzso P zzso The simultaneous presence of Del and zzso zzso was significantly associated with higher body mass index zzso zzso zzso P zzso serum total cholesterol zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Mean values of adjusted zzso and serum zzso levels were found to be zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, in subjects with Del and zzso compared to zzso The multiple zzso tests showed that zzso and zzso of the total zzso of zzso is explained by zzso and zzso zzso respectively, in this sample zzso zzso zzso and zzso while zzso of serum zzso levels was explained by zzso zzso of the zzso B gene zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
