zzso growth factor zzso is a zzso factor with zzso and zzso effects and has been linked to vascular zzso It is elevated in obese zzso 

To investigate whether zzso levels are altered in obese adolescents and whether they correlate with zzso zzso of zzso 

zzso male adolescents were zzso Forty-eight percent were zzso Various parameters were recorded at one visit, including zzso and waist zzso and blood samples were zzso zzso was determined by zzso 

zzso adolescents have higher plasma levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels correlated with zzso and waist zzso zzso correlated closely with high sensitive zzso zzso 

We demonstrated elevated zzso levels in obese zzso We speculate that zzso is a possible link between obesity in early life and related zzso
