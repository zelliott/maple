zzso increased over zzso Although the cohort remained relatively lean zzso rank among the fattest children was zzso Girls were zzso than boys, reflecting adult obesity zzso Children identified as overweight by the zzso zzso zzso points are likely to have high body zzso However the zzso zzso points may not identify many children with high body zzso
