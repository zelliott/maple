zzso is regarded as a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and zzso zzso of these chronic zzso disorders starts in early life marked by increase in body mass index zzso We hypothesized that zzso in homocysteine metabolism in early life could be a link between childhood obesity and adult zzso zzso Thus here we investigated association of common zzso from homocysteine metabolism zzso genes with obesity in zzso urban Indian zzso 

We zzso 90 common zzso from 18 genes in zzso children zzso of zzso zzso zzso and 463 zzso zzso children in stage zzso The top signal obtained was zzso in an independent sample set of zzso children zzso zzso and zzso zzso in stage zzso Stage 1 association analysis revealed association between seven zzso and childhood obesity at zzso but association of only zzso in zzso zzso zzso remained significant after multiple testing zzso Association of zzso with childhood obesity was validated in stage 2 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also associated with quantitative measures of zzso and plasma zzso levels that was also zzso and zzso in combined zzso 

Our study provides first evidence for the association of zzso zzso with obesity and plasma zzso levels in zzso Further studies to confirm this association, its functional significance and mechanism of action need to be zzso
