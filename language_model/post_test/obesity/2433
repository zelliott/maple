We have previously reported that insulin binding is decreased in the zzso bulb of both zzso zzso and obese zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we measured insulin binding in zzso prepared from the zzso bulb, cerebral cortex, and zzso of control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso lean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding was decreased in all brain regions, as well as the liver of the obese zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, insulin binding was decreased in the liver and brain zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso As most of the zzso rats were probably carriers of one zzso zzso but the population was only slightly zzso we conclude zzso in the zzso zzso is the presence and expression of the zzso gene rather than zzso which results in the decreased insulin zzso Thus, regulation of the brain insulin zzso appears to be independent of plasma or zzso fluid insulin zzso
