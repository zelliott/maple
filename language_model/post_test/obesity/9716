The small diameter of the carotid artery is not compatible with the evaluation of clinically available zzso devices in the carotid zzso zzso zzso We developed an zzso zzso model in the rat descending zzso whose size is compatible with available zzso zzso We also tested the hypothesis that zzso formation is enhanced in the zzso of obese zzso rats zzso compared with lean zzso rats zzso Left external carotid zzso and zzso of the zzso and abdominal zzso were performed by using a balloon zzso zzso and zzso pathology were examined at 2, 4, and 10 zzso after zzso At 10 zzso after zzso the abdominal zzso in zzso had narrowed zzso zzso zzso relative to baseline compared with an expansion of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso the zzso zzso had expanded zzso zzso zzso in zzso compared with zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso thickness ratio revealed significantly increased zzso formation in the zzso descending zzso compared with that in zzso In conclusion, this minimally invasive zzso model involving the rat descending zzso is compatible with available zzso zzso The descending zzso of zzso demonstrates enhanced zzso formation and zzso vascular zzso after zzso
