To assess outcomes of robotic zzso radical zzso zzso in overweight and obese patients, defined as those with a body mass index zzso of 25 to 30 zzso and greater than 30 zzso zzso 

This was a zzso study evaluating all of our zzso zzso Patients were divided into three groups: zzso of 25 zzso or less zzso 1), zzso greater than 25 zzso and less than 30 zzso zzso zzso and zzso of 30 zzso or more zzso zzso Patients were evaluated zzso with the validated Rand zzso Health zzso zzso 2) and with the University of California, Los Angeles zzso Cancer Index zzso 

Between February 2003 and November 2004, 150 zzso were performed at our zzso Average follow-up was 8 zzso Groups 1, 2, and 3 had 39, 65, and 46 patients, zzso Average zzso for all three groups were statistically different zzso zzso When compared with group 1, open conversion rates, hospital stay, positive margin, and complication rates were not statistically different for groups 2 or zzso zzso time zzso zzso and estimated blood loss zzso zzso however, were statistically greater for group 3 compared with group zzso zzso rate was highest in group 2 zzso zzso zzso compared with group zzso zzso weights were also statistically greater in groups 2 zzso zzso zzso and 3 zzso zzso zzso compared with group zzso Overall, zzso did not increase zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso radical zzso is safe in overweight and obese patients and might be the surgical management of choice in this subset of zzso Further long-term follow-up with more patients is required to verify this initial zzso
