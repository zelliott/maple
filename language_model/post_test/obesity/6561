Two hundred and zzso women with zzso zzso zzso syndrome were studied of whom 91 zzso were obese zzso greater than 25 zzso zzso women with zzso had a greater prevalence of zzso zzso compared with zzso and zzso disorders than non-obese zzso Total testosterone and zzso zzso in serum were similar in the two zzso but zzso zzso were significantly lower, and free testosterone levels higher, in obese compared with lean zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso a marker of peripheral 5 zzso activity, were higher in obese than in non-obese women with zzso There were no significant correlations of either zzso or free testosterone with zzso zzso suggesting that obesity has independent effects on transport and on metabolism of zzso There were no significant differences between the zzso in either baseline zzso zzso or the zzso pattern of zzso and zzso zzso studied over an zzso zzso There was, however, an inverse correlation of zzso with zzso but only in the obese zzso In conclusion, the increased frequency of zzso in obese compared with lean women with zzso is associated with increased zzso of zzso to peripheral zzso and enhanced activity of 5 zzso in obese zzso The mechanism underlying the higher prevalence of zzso in obese women remains zzso
