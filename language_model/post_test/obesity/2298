Transition from obesity to zzso zzso promotes cardiovascular diseases, but the underlying cardiac zzso mechanisms are incompletely zzso We tested the hypothesis that development of insulin resistance and zzso is associated with impaired zzso cellular zzso 

zzso zzso pigs were zzso to 10 weeks of standard zzso zzso or to 10 zzso or 14 zzso weeks of zzso diet zzso zzso zzso structure, function, and zzso zzso were assessed by zzso zzso and Blood zzso zzso the zzso with zzso and injury mechanisms by zzso and zzso Both obese and zzso showed obesity and zzso whereas only zzso showed insulin zzso zzso output and zzso zzso increased only in zzso yet Blood zzso zzso showed zzso zzso zzso stress, zzso dysfunction, and zzso also increased in both obese and zzso but more zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso in zzso was decreased and accompanied by marked zzso 

Development of insulin resistance characterizing a transition from obesity to zzso is associated with progressive changes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dysfunction, and zzso zzso zzso cellular turnover may represent a novel therapeutic target for preserving zzso structure and function in obesity and zzso
