zzso measured as zzso skeletal muscle mass zzso and central obesity measured as visceral fat area zzso may act zzso to influence zzso syndrome and zzso However, several previous studies reported that zzso risk is higher in zzso obesity groups than in zzso obesity groups because of the close relationship between muscle mass and body zzso We investigated the association of the zzso to zzso ratio, which we have termed the zzso ratio zzso with zzso syndrome and zzso zzso 

This study was performed in 526 apparently healthy adults enrolled in the Korean zzso zzso zzso an ongoing prospective zzso cohort zzso zzso was evaluated with dual energy X-ray zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured using zzso pulse wave zzso zzso 

zzso was significantly associated with waist zzso blood pressure, zzso profiles, zzso and zzso By multiple zzso zzso analysis, the odds ratio for zzso syndrome was zzso zzso versus highest zzso of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso Multiple zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso was an independent zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso a new index of zzso zzso showed an independent negative association with zzso syndrome and zzso zzso
