A positive relationship between obesity and asthma has been well zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso reverses zzso insulin resistance zzso and zzso different types of inflammatory zzso This study aimed to evaluate the effects of zzso on the zzso of allergic zzso inflammation in obese zzso Male zzso mice were fed for 10 weeks with high-fat diet zzso to induce zzso The cell zzso and inflammatory markers in zzso zzso zzso fluid and lung tissue were evaluated at 48 h after zzso zzso zzso zzso obese mice displayed peripheral zzso that was fully reversed by zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso resulted in higher influx of total cell and zzso in lung tissue of obese mice compared with lean zzso As opposed, the cell number in zzso fluid of obese mice was reduced compared with lean zzso zzso significantly reduced the tissue zzso zzso and prevented the reduction of cell counts in zzso zzso In obese mice, greater levels of zzso zzso and zzso together with increased zzso protein expression were observed, all of which were zzso by zzso In addition, zzso nearly zzso the binding of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso promoter gene in lung tissue of obese zzso Lower levels of zzso zzso and its downstream target zzso zzso zzso zzso were found in lung tissue of obese mice, which were restored by zzso In separate experiments, the selective zzso inhibitor zzso (20 zzso 3 weeks) and the zzso zzso (2 zzso significantly attenuated the zzso of zzso inflammation in obese zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso the zzso inflammatory signaling and zzso zzso expression in lung tissue of obese zzso zzso may be a good pharmacological strategy to control the asthma zzso in obese zzso
