We investigated whether body mass index zzso can be used as a zzso zzso indicating patients who benefit from extended zzso inhibitor zzso zzso 

The zzso trial zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso patients from the zzso trial to receive either 3 additional years of zzso therapy using zzso vs zzso In this retrospective analysis, we investigated the zzso and zzso impact of zzso on disease outcome and zzso 

In all, zzso patients zzso normal weight, 307 overweight, and 150 zzso patients were included in this zzso zzso weight patients with additional 3 years of zzso zzso their risk of disease recurrence zzso survival zzso zzso zzso zzso and death zzso zzso zzso and had only a fifth of the risk of distant zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with normal weight patients without any further zzso In contrast, zzso patients derived no benefit from additional 3 years of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso distant recurrence-free survival zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The possible zzso impact of zzso on extended zzso treatment could be strengthened by a Cox zzso interaction model between zzso and treatment zzso 

Body mass index may be used to predict outcome benefit of extended zzso treatment in patients with zzso breast zzso
