To determine values of simple zzso zzso which are associated with the presence of type 2 diabetes zzso hypertension and zzso and to assess zzso zzso values for predicting the likelihood of these chronic conditions in a Mexican zzso 

The data were obtained from zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in General Hospital zzso surveys from 1994 to 2000 adjusted to the structure of the overall Mexican zzso 

A total of zzso men and zzso women aged zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The optimal sensitivity and specificity of using various zzso values of zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to predict type 2 diabetes zzso zzso hypertension zzso or zzso were examined by receiver operating characteristic curve zzso zzso The likelihood ratios for having diabetes, hypertension and zzso in subjects with various zzso values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Multiple zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to examine the independent relationship between the zzso indexes, age and smoking, and the odds ratio of having chronic zzso 

The zzso zzso to predict zzso zzso or zzso varied from zzso to zzso zzso in both men and zzso The optimal zzso zzso were 90 zzso in men and 85 zzso in zzso The zzso zzso was about zzso in men and zzso in women, and the optimal zzso zzso was zzso in men and varied from 53 to zzso in zzso The zzso levels for zzso zzso and zzso corresponded to the zzso points in the likelihood ratio zzso In the case of zzso likelihood ratio zzso we found a significant increase in the risk for chronic conditions from 22 to 23 zzso levels in both zzso zzso zzso analyses disclosed that only zzso and age were included in all the models as well as the influence of smoking in zzso and zzso in zzso 

Although these results may not be readily applied to the rest of the Mexican population or to other Hispanic zzso they point to the necessity of similar studies with large zzso samples to find the zzso levels for chronic conditions in different zzso
