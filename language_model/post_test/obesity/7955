We analyzed trends in height and zzso and their interaction in 6-year-old Chilean children over the last 15 zzso 

We calculated height for age zzso zzso zzso zzso prevalence of zzso zzso and zzso from zzso national zzso annual population surveys in 1987, 1990, 1993, 1996, 2000, and zzso Using mixed model analysis, we determined the risk of obesity according to height over time as odds ratios zzso and zzso confidence zzso and the potential influence of height and year of study on zzso zzso 

Over the study period, height increased by zzso zzso in boys and zzso zzso in girls, whereas zzso declined from zzso to zzso in zzso zzso increased by approximately zzso zzso zzso increased from zzso to zzso in boys and to zzso in girls, and zzso increased from zzso in boys and zzso in girls to 0 in zzso zzso declined from zzso to zzso whereas obesity rose from zzso to approximately zzso The probability of obesity among tall children was significantly greater than that for normal height children zzso zzso to zzso The lowest obesity risk was observed between zzso and zzso zzso The OR for obesity in the stunted relative to normal height children was zzso ranging from zzso to zzso whereas it was significant and consistently positive zzso to zzso for boys and girls when it was compared with the lowest obesity risk according to zzso 

zzso is significantly associated with increased obesity risk in children, while zzso is also zzso but to a lesser zzso
