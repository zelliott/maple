zzso in the zzso zzso zzso are associated with zzso The obesity syndrome observed in humans with zzso zzso is similar to that observed in zzso knockout mice, including increased zzso growth, zzso and zzso zzso For comparison with other commonly investigated models of obesity and insulin resistance, we have zzso zzso mice into the zzso zzso zzso Female obese zzso mice exhibit reduced energy expenditure and an attenuated increase in fatty acid zzso zzso after exposure to high-fat diets compared with obese zzso zzso The reduced energy expenditure and zzso zzso zzso with changes in zzso gene zzso The expression of genes involved in zzso zzso increased in obese zzso mice compared with zzso and obese zzso zzso In contrast, a key zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is increased in obese zzso mice compared with obese zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso appear to be secondary to obesity in B6 zzso zzso However, zzso mice in a mixed genetic background develop severe zzso zzso at an early zzso This might suggest an important role of the zzso in regulating liver zzso metabolism that is masked on the B6 zzso Interestingly, the zzso to zzso increase in liver zzso in the zzso strain of zzso mice is not always associated with zzso zzso or increased zzso zzso zzso This observation suggests that changes in liver secondary to zzso zzso lead to zzso and increased zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso
