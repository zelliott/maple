zzso zzso is increasingly being used after zzso section to prevent zzso zzso Although a variety of low molecular weight zzso zzso have been used no comparative study exists on their effects on the zzso system in this zzso Furthermore, their zzso effect may be zzso through effects other than their zzso effect on activated factor zzso We compared the plasma zzso zzso activity, plasma concentration of tissue factor zzso inhibitor zzso and the reduction in plasma zzso zzso complex concentration in 30 women zzso to receive either zzso 5,000 zzso zzso once daily zzso zzso 10), zzso 4,000 zzso zzso once daily zzso zzso 10) or zzso 50 zzso zzso zzso dose zzso zzso zzso once daily zzso zzso 10) following zzso zzso zzso occurred at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h relative to time of zzso All preparations produced an increase in mean zzso zzso zzso zzso a reduction in mean zzso zzso zzso and an increase in mean zzso concentration zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso revealed a significant difference between the zzso in terms of mean zzso zzso activity zzso zzso and reduction in plasma zzso concentration zzso zzso Post hoc analysis indicated that the zzso values of the groups receiving zzso and zzso were significantly higher than those of the group receiving zzso zzso zzso but not significantly different from each zzso Post hoc analysis of the reduction in plasma zzso concentration showed the reduction to be significantly less in the group receiving zzso compared to the zzso and zzso groups zzso zzso which did not differ significantly from each zzso There was no significant difference between treatment groups with regard to plasma concentration of zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso differ in their effects on zzso parameters including zzso generation as assessed by zzso The increase in zzso may be an additional zzso of zzso zzso zzso Although these findings demonstrate that zzso differ in their zzso effects, this does not necessarily zzso a clinical difference between these zzso
