We assessed differences in food reinforced behavior between obese and lean zzso rats with a progressive ratio schedule 3 zzso in which a subject zzso three additional zzso each time a zzso was zzso The number of responses required for a zzso eventually exceeded its value, termed the zzso zzso a sensitive measure of food motivated zzso Break points were higher in obese rats than lean controls for grain zzso zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso but not for sweet zzso zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso We determined if zzso zzso zzso zzso which reduces free food intake in obese zzso rats, affects food motivated behavior in obese zzso and lean zzso zzso reduced break points in both obese and lean rats to a similar extent when working for either grain zzso or sweet zzso Under zzso feeding conditions, zzso again decreased zzso intake similarly in the obese and lean zzso zzso zzso appeared to decrease zzso zzso consumption to a greater extent than break point in both zzso These results show that zzso obese rats exhibit higher levels of performance for food than lean rats only when working for the less valued grain zzso zzso zzso reduces both break points and zzso zzso consumption independent of zzso and zzso zzso appears to decrease food more effectively in rats given free access to food than in rats working for zzso
