The new growth charts in the zzso the zzso charts, comprise prescriptive data from the WHO standard between two weeks and four years of zzso Little is known about the development of obesity risk in normal UK zzso who are necessarily not fed according to the WHO recommendations and do not live in zzso environments (the selection criteria of the WHO standard source zzso using the new zzso Here, we investigated infant growth zzso and traits indicative of childhood obesity using the zzso charts, with the aim to clearly document the implications of adopting the new charts on UK growth monitoring zzso 

Mixed effects models were applied to serial weight and length data from zzso infants zzso zzso zzso zzso in the Born in Bradford birth cohort study to produce zzso from 10 days to 15 months of zzso Individual monthly estimates were converted to zzso and were plotted by sex and ethnic zzso The relative risks zzso of traits indicative of childhood zzso including high zzso and rapid weight gain, using the zzso charts compared to the previously used zzso reference were calculated for all infants together and for White and Pakistani infants zzso 

Both ethnic groups demonstrated patterns of growth similar to the zzso charts in length but not in zzso The resulting pattern for zzso was zzso with an average gain of zzso zzso between two and 12 months of zzso The zzso charts were significantly zzso zzso more likely than the zzso reference to zzso zzso above the 91st zzso after age six months zzso zzso and weight and zzso gain between birth (one month for zzso and 12 months of age greater than two zzso bands zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The change to the zzso charts means that normal UK infants risk being diagnosed as being on a trajectory toward childhood zzso National estimates of obesity will have to be zzso for previous years to allow zzso zzso The new charts do not allow a focused prevention effort for targeting zzso at infants most at risk of becoming obese, because the use of the 91st or 98th zzso on the zzso charts will identify many more infants as being at risk than the same zzso on the zzso zzso Now more than ever, research is needed to develop a large scale childhood obesity prevention zzso which could zzso be integrated with routine infant growth monitoring zzso
