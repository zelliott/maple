To determine whether zzso inhibitor other than zzso improves insulin sensitivity in patients with essential hypertension, we measured insulin sensitivity to zzso zzso using zzso method in 10 lean zzso subjects before and after chronic zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results were compared with those obtained in 10 healthy control zzso zzso obtained by insulin sensitivity test was significantly higher in zzso subjects, indicating a lower insulin sensitivity than in zzso After zzso treatment, zzso reduced significantly to the level which was statistically not different from control zzso zzso diminished after treatment, while no significant change of blood zzso was observed during oral zzso tolerance test in zzso zzso Plasma HDL cholesterol increased by zzso zzso zzso treatment has beneficial effect in the reversal of insulin resistance in patients with essential zzso
