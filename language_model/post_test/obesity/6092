The lung age of smokers is greater than their real zzso We have had the clinical impression that the lung age of zzso might be older than their real age and that obese subjects with decreased VC and zzso would also have an increased lung zzso This zzso study investigated the relationships between lung age and smoking status, and lung age and zzso 

zzso comprised zzso men who consulted our institute for health zzso 819 subjects were zzso In smokers and zzso lung age estimated by the zzso equation based on height and zzso was compared with zzso zzso To investigate the relationship between lung age and zzso in zzso subjects were zzso into four groups based on zzso of zzso and the lung age of the four groups zzso Multiple linear zzso was used to determine the relative contribution of zzso and smoking status to lung zzso 

The zzso equation used to estimate lung age significantly overestimated the zzso age of study zzso In zzso higher zzso was significantly associated with higher lung zzso zzso duration of smoking and number of cigarettes per day were significantly associated with increased lung zzso 

Lung age could be used to motivate lifestyle change in obese zzso
