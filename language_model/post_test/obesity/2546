zzso insulin zzso from pancreatic zzso involves zzso membrane zzso and zzso zzso zzso The electrical events in zzso zzso sensing have been studied intensely using mouse zzso of zzso but data from other species, including models of type 2 diabetes zzso zzso are zzso In this work, we made zzso recordings of electrical activity from cells within zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso sand zzso a model of zzso zzso Most zzso cells from lean, zzso sand rats displayed zzso zzso zzso zzso electrical activity that was similar to the classic zzso pattern of mouse zzso However, the zzso were slower in sand rat zzso and the zzso curve of electrical activity versus zzso concentration was zzso Of the zzso cells, some produced action zzso zzso while others displayed electrical activity that was largely independent of zzso The latter activity consisted of continuous or intermittent action potential zzso and persisted for long periods in the absence of zzso The zzso activity was suppressed by zzso indicating that the cells expressed zzso zzso Sand rat zzso produced zzso zzso zzso reminiscent of the zzso electrical pattern observed in most cells, albeit with a longer zzso Finally, we found that the zzso dependence of insulin zzso from sand rat zzso closely paralleled that of the bursting electrical zzso We conclude that while zzso of zzso cells in sand rat zzso display zzso electrical responses to zzso insulin zzso most closely follows the zzso zzso The ease of recording membrane potential from sand rat zzso makes this a useful model for studies of zzso electrical signaling during the development of zzso
