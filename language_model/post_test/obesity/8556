To assess the independent associations of a broad range of early life risk factors and adult obesity with adult insulin zzso 

This was a zzso study of 1,394 women, aged zzso years, from 23 British zzso 

There was a strong zzso of zzso factors, other early life factors, and adult zzso zzso inverse association between birth weight and insulin resistance in women in the highest third of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso log zzso model assessment zzso score per 1 zzso birth weight, but no association between birth weight and insulin resistance in women in the two lowest thirds of zzso zzso for interaction zzso zzso zzso birth weight, own leg zzso and childhood manual social class did not interact with adult obesity and were all independently zzso associated with insulin zzso zzso zzso to zzso log zzso score per 1 zzso offspring birth weight, zzso zzso to zzso log zzso score per 1 zzso leg zzso and a zzso zzso to zzso difference in log zzso score between manual and zzso childhood social zzso Childhood manual social class and shorter leg length were both independently associated with adverse zzso zzso zzso and zzso ratio were independently positively associated with insulin resistance and with all other components of the insulin resistance zzso 

zzso resistance is an important risk factor for type 2 diabetes and coronary heart zzso Our results suggest that genetic factors, zzso environment, early childhood, and adult environmental factors are all relevant in determining adult insulin zzso
