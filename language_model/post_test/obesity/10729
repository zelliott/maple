One hundred zzso consecutive newborns from a zzso private practice were enrolled in a comprehensive nutritional program in an attempt to lower the zzso of zzso in the zzso The program emphasized an individualized approach in which the feeding instructions given to parents varied with the growth pattern of their zzso Whereas specific zzso of zzso such as breast zzso bottle and early zzso late addition of baby foods, appeared not to modify growth, the group as a whole exhibited a trend to lower zzso index zzso and less zzso than in previous published zzso We propose that the individualized nutritional program may have resulted in this improvement, and that such attention to detail will likely be more rewarding than an approach which emphasizes only general nutritional information to the group as a zzso
