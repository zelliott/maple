zzso and type 2 diabetes zzso are the major zzso public health problem of the 21st zzso The best strategy to tackle this problem is to develop strategies to zzso zzso However, it is becoming clear that despite successful research identifying weight regulatory zzso the development of the obesity epidemic is outpacing scientific zzso The lack of success controlling the obesity epidemic in an aging population will result in another subsequent uncontrolled epidemic of zzso Our research focuses on the mechanisms causing zzso aiming to identify suitable strategies to prevent or at least zzso the development of the zzso zzso Previous work using transgenic and knockout mouse models has shown an interplay between white zzso tissue and skeletal muscle linking fatty acid zzso synthesis with zzso effects on zzso zzso Work from our lab and others suggests that defective zzso tissue is a key link between zzso insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes zzso by promoting the development of zzso in peripheral zzso We propose a series of models to describe the process by which the zzso tissue could react to an zzso environment and responds depending on genetic and zzso factors, zzso on the functions of other peripheral zzso We suggest that by examining hypotheses that zzso multiple zzso and the zzso of energy between these zzso a suitable strategy can be devised for the treatment of chronic zzso
