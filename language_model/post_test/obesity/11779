zzso is the most common cause of human essential hypertension in most zzso zzso Although the precise mechanisms of obesity hypertension are not fully zzso considerable evidence suggests that excess zzso sodium zzso and a zzso shift of pressure zzso play a major zzso zzso zzso appears to mediate at least part of the zzso sodium retention and hypertension since zzso blockade or zzso zzso markedly zzso these zzso Recent observations suggest that zzso and its multiple interactions with zzso in the zzso may link excess weight gain with increased sympathetic zzso zzso is produced mainly in zzso and is believed to regulate energy balance by acting on the zzso to reduce food intake and to increase energy expenditure via sympathetic zzso zzso administration of zzso into the cerebral zzso increases zzso sympathetic activity, and long-term zzso infusion at rates that mimic plasma zzso found in obesity raises zzso pressure and heart rate via zzso zzso in non-obese zzso zzso mice zzso zzso also develop zzso Acute studies suggest that the zzso sympathetic effects of zzso may depend on interactions with other zzso pathways in the zzso including the zzso zzso zzso However, the role of this zzso in zzso the long-term effects of zzso on blood pressure is zzso Also, it is uncertain whether there is resistance to the chronic zzso sympathetic and blood pressure effects of zzso in obese zzso In addition, zzso also has other cardiovascular and zzso actions, such as stimulation of zzso oxide formation and improvement of insulin sensitivity, which may tend to reduce blood pressure in some zzso Although the role of these mechanisms in human obesity has not been zzso this remains a fruitful area for further investigation, especially in view of the current zzso of obesity in most zzso zzso
