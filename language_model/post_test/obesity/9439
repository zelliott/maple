The study examines whether the differences in both average zzso values and the prevalence of the zzso overweight and obesity between girls with early, average and late age at zzso depend on the zzso zzso 

The data were obtained from zzso female students aged 15-18 zzso Height and weight were measured and used to calculate zzso The girls were divided into three groups in terms of their zzso zzso Each girl was also classified as early, on time or late maturing based on the age at zzso 

The inverse correlation between zzso values and age at zzso was zzso In groups of the same zzso status the highest zzso value was always observed in girls with early age at zzso and the lowest in those with late age at zzso The maturation rate had also statistically significant effect on the prevalence of zzso overweight and zzso The early maturing girls presented a lower prevalence of zzso and higher prevalence of overweight and obesity than average and late maturing zzso This relationship was evident for both the entire sample material and in zzso zzso 

The relationship between zzso and age at zzso occurs regardless of zzso zzso
