zzso respond to a chronic high-fat diet zzso in two ways: some readily become obese zzso zzso zzso and others do not zzso zzso zzso Although several hypotheses have been proposed, the mechanisms underlying the zzso zzso to zzso obesity remain to be fully zzso In the present study, two-dimensional gel zzso zzso combined with zzso laser zzso zzso zzso zzso was carried out for identification of zzso expressed liver proteins in zzso and OR rats fed a zzso in an attempt to discover marker proteins involved in zzso and/or resistance to obesity in rat zzso The zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso spots from 380 zzso spots were zzso regulated between the zzso Among these zzso spots, twelve were zzso expressed proteins between zzso and OR rats, reaching statistical zzso Of these, five proteins have already been linked to zzso however, seven proteins involved in obesity zzso or resistance were identified for the first time in the present zzso In order to validate the zzso results and gain insight into the zzso changes between the zzso and OR groups, we further confirmed the expression pattern of some proteins of interest by Western zzso zzso Combined results of zzso analysis with Western zzso analysis revealed that reduced zzso and increased fat zzso were achieved in the zzso of OR zzso In conclusion, the present zzso study is an important advance over the previous steps required for identification of zzso and OR rats, and should prove valuable in the search for the zzso of obesity in zzso
