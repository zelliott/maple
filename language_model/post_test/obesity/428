In order to better understand the link between obesity and type 2 diabetes, zzso and its zzso regulation was investigated in various zzso zzso of obese adult females zzso zzso zzso insulin, zzso free fatty acids zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso were isolated from subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso fat zzso Total cell number and size, zzso zzso or zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso were measured in each zzso zzso rats were zzso and zzso suggesting high insulin zzso They presented a marked zzso zzso by increased serum zzso and zzso zzso High serum zzso levels also suggest a strong zzso zzso zzso rats showed an excessive development of all fat pads although a more pronounced effect was observed in the SC zzso The zzso of this depot was increased 8 fold when compared to lean rats, but these fat cells were only zzso to zzso zzso SC zzso showed a marked increase in their zzso zzso activity but a lack of change in responsiveness to zzso or zzso zzso The association between high zzso zzso and increased zzso yields to a marked zzso cell zzso rate, especially from the SC zzso zzso rats were characterized by a zzso type of obesity with an excessive development of the SC zzso The zzso zzso by an altered serum zzso profile could be attributed to excessive zzso that contributes to increased zzso levels, and to early development of insulin resistance through a zzso zzso
