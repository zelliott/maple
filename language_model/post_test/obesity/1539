To investigate the therapeutic effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso on high-fat diet zzso insulin resistance and zzso fatty liver disease zzso and to zzso the underlying zzso 

Forty male zzso rats were included in the zzso Ten rats were fed on normal diet as normal control, and thirty rats were fed on zzso for 8 weeks to induce zzso followed with low dose zzso zzso or high dose zzso zzso of zzso or vehicle for 8 weeks with 10 animals for each zzso zzso metabolism and insulin sensitivity were evaluated by oral zzso tolerance test and insulin tolerance zzso zzso zzso was measured by zzso Liver zzso zzso genes were analyzed by quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction, while zzso protein zzso zzso expression was examined by Western zzso 

zzso fed on zzso developed abdominal zzso insulin resistance and zzso zzso treatment reduced visceral fat zzso and zzso zzso improved zzso zzso and attenuated zzso zzso The expressions of the key zzso regulating zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso or zzso while the expressions of zzso genes such as zzso regulatory zzso protein zzso zzso fatty acid zzso zzso and liver fatty zzso protein zzso were zzso zzso or zzso In addition, zzso activated zzso and promoted zzso zzso zzso in the zzso 

zzso improves insulin resistance and reverse zzso zzso in the rat model of zzso obesity through promotion of zzso and reduction of zzso which involves the zzso signaling pathway, thus representing a new therapeutic intervention for obesity related insulin resistance and zzso
