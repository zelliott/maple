To assess the influences that obesity and zzso have on insulin action in black zzso zzso 

Thirty-nine subjects were studied who had normal zzso levels and/or zzso less than zzso zzso and who had not taken pharmacological agents for zzso zzso before the zzso zzso action was studied using the zzso insulin clamp with a zzso zzso Degree of obesity was assessed with zzso During carefully monitored zzso 9 patients relapsed into a zzso state, and insulin action was zzso after acute zzso of their plasma zzso 

zzso action was related to the degree of obesity at the extremes of zzso 7 of 8 patients zzso with a zzso less than zzso zzso were insulin sensitive, and 8 of 9 patients zzso with a zzso greater than zzso zzso were insulin zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso patients were equally likely to be insulin resistant or insulin zzso A plot of frequency versus zzso disposal in those patients was compatible with a zzso distribution zzso less than zzso 12 of 22 patients were normally insulin sensitive zzso disposal zzso zzso and 10 were insulin resistant zzso disposal zzso zzso Analysis of this zzso zzso group showed that in the zzso group, an inverse relationship existed between zzso and zzso disposal zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso whereas no such relationship was found in the zzso zzso The clinical characteristics of the zzso zzso group indicated that zzso plasma insulin, total cholesterol, and zzso were zzso whereas zzso age, and zzso were not different in the zzso compared with the zzso zzso With the development of zzso insulin action in the zzso zzso With the development of zzso insulin action in the zzso group was zzso independent of zzso whereas it was unchanged in the zzso zzso 

zzso resistance exists in only approximately 50% of black zzso zzso The relationship between obesity and insulin resistance is not a simple zzso The data can be explained by one of two zzso 1) insulin resistance in black zzso patients is an acquired zzso related to the development of obesity and is modulated by zzso or 2) zzso exists as two zzso one with primary insulin resistance and one with normal insulin sensitivity, and that insulin resistance causes central and/or generalized zzso
