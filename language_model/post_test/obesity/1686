Small zzso and liver greatly contribute to whole body zzso cholesterol and zzso metabolism but to which extent cholesterol and zzso handling in these zzso is affected by high fat Western-style zzso diets remains to be zzso 

We therefore measured cholesterol and zzso concentration in zzso and liver and zzso zzso neutral zzso and zzso acid zzso in zzso N mice fed for 12 weeks either a zzso high zzso control diet or a high fat Western diet containing zzso zzso zzso To identify the underlying mechanisms of dietary adaptations in zzso and liver, changes in gene expression were assessed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Mice on Western diet showed increased plasma cholesterol levels, associated with the higher dietary cholesterol supply, yet, significantly reduced cholesterol levels were found in zzso and zzso zzso profiling revealed evidence that expression of numerous genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and zzso via LDL, but also in zzso zzso underwent zzso regulations in both zzso zzso in zzso metabolism were confirmed at the zzso level by zzso profiling via mass zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso and liver react to a high dietary fat intake by an zzso of de zzso cholesterol synthesis and other zzso mechanisms, as well as with major changes in zzso zzso to accommodate to the fat zzso
