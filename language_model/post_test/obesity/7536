Although zzso zzso zzso zzso may represent a separate and important zzso for zzso cancer zzso little is known about the risk factors for these zzso zzso abnormalities such as zzso have been observed in zzso and zzso Our hypothesis is that smoking may be associated with these zzso 

All patients diagnosed with an zzso from January 2007 to September 2010 were identified zzso based on a pathology database zzso There were 2 sets of zzso One group had no zzso whereas another group had zzso zzso These groups were randomly identified from 2007 to zzso Data collected included age, sex, ethnicity, zzso weight, family history of zzso diabetes zzso use of zzso zzso and zzso and serum zzso and zzso We defined smokers as those patients who smoked at least 20 zzso 

We identified 90 patients with an zzso of any size, 90 patients with zzso zzso and 200 controls with no zzso Of the 90 zzso 42 were 6 zzso or larger and 19 of them were zzso zzso Most of the zzso was flat zzso zzso After zzso zzso smokers with at least 20 zzso exposure were found to have an increased risk zzso odds ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso of having any zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso We also observed this relationship when comparing patients with zzso to those with zzso zzso 

Our data suggest that smoking at least 20 zzso is strongly associated with any and large zzso In addition, diabetes zzso and obesity seem to be associated with zzso as zzso Our data has implications for zzso zzso
