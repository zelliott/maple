Current guidelines contain no advice on how to manage obesity and zzso in patients with peripheral vascular disease zzso 

The aim of this study was to assess the association of zzso overweight and obesity with mortality in patients with zzso 

We recruited zzso patients with a broad range of presentations of zzso zzso overweight and obesity were defined by body mass index zzso and associated with mortality using Kaplan zzso and Cox zzso hazard zzso 

Survival at 3 years was zzso zzso zzso and zzso for patients that were zzso normal weight, overweight and obese at zzso respectively, zzso Patients that were zzso had approximately twice the risk of dying zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while patients that were overweight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had approximately half the risk of dying, after adjustment for other risk factors and using normal weight subjects as the reference zzso zzso patients had waist circumference measured at zzso Patients with waist circumference in the top zzso had half the risk of dying zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In 267 patients we assessed the relationship between zzso and abdominal fat volumes using zzso zzso zzso was highly correlated with both zzso and subcutaneous fat zzso 

zzso whether assessed by zzso or central fat deposition is associated with reduced risk of dying in patients with established zzso zzso is highly zzso of early mortality in patients with zzso
