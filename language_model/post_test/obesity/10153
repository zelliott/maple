zzso syndrome is characterized by infantile zzso feeding difficulties, zzso small hands and feet, mental zzso behavioral problems, and zzso leading to obesity in early zzso To date there have been no studies examining the associated risk of cardiovascular disease related to obesity in zzso syndrome, nor of circulating zzso such as zzso protein known to be zzso of cardiovascular zzso zzso we have measured the levels of zzso protein in a descriptive study of a cohort of zzso syndrome and comparison zzso 

An zzso was used to zzso zzso protein in plasma samples from subjects with zzso syndrome and obesity and compared to zzso and body composition zzso 

The mean circulating zzso protein concentration for 28 subjects with zzso syndrome (13 zzso 15 zzso mean age zzso zzso zzso years; mean body mass index zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso protein concentration for 22 zzso obese subjects (16 zzso 6 zzso mean age zzso zzso zzso years; mean body mass index zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso The reported mean value for zzso protein was zzso zzso zzso zzso from 100 healthy zzso 

The mean zzso protein values were similar between the subjects with zzso syndrome and obesity but significantly higher in zzso syndrome and obese subjects relative to zzso zzso Increased levels of zzso protein zzso zzso are associated with cardiovascular disease suggesting subjects with zzso syndrome as well as obese subjects are at a similar increased zzso
