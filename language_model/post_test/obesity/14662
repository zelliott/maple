The purpose of this study was to compare body composition measures in zzso of women who were zzso zzso mass zzso or zzso 25 zzso versus women who were zzso zzso mass index, zzso zzso all of whom had normal zzso tolerance zzso 

zzso zzso zzso female and 42 zzso of singleton zzso of zzso zzso women and 144 zzso zzso female and 77 zzso of zzso women were assessed with zzso measures and total body electrical zzso evaluation of body composition at zzso 

There was a borderline increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso g vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not lean body mass zzso zzso 410 g vs 2950 zzso 400 zzso P zzso zzso in the zzso versus zzso weight zzso However, there were significant increases in percent body fat zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and fat mass zzso zzso 220 g vs 380 zzso 170 zzso P zzso zzso in zzso of zzso women versus zzso weight zzso 

zzso women with normal zzso tolerance levels have zzso who are heavier than zzso weight women because of increased zzso We speculate that this increased obesity in offspring of obese women with normal zzso tolerance levels is a significant risk for adolescent obesity and components of the zzso zzso
