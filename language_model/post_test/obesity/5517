zzso the zzso specifically zzso from zzso is a hormone zzso to insulin action and, thus, may serve as a link between human obesity due to zzso and insulin resistance associated with type 2 zzso To test this hypothesis, we studied the gene expression of zzso in zzso isolated from rats fed with a zzso diet which induced insulin zzso Compared to the control rats zzso on a normal zzso diet, the zzso rats zzso developed zzso zzso zzso zzso and hypertension, a profile reminiscent of the syndrome X of patients with zzso diabetes zzso zzso The F rats had significantly elevated plasma free fatty acids zzso enlarged zzso fat zzso and increased zzso size compared with the C zzso We examined the zzso transport and the relative quantity of zzso zzso produced in the zzso of these two groups of zzso Compared to the C rats, the F rats had a clearly reduced zzso zzso zzso The gene expression of zzso and other zzso peptides was measured on the zzso by zzso zzso the zzso of this technique was established in advance with a zzso and then zzso zzso The F rats showed a decreased expression of the zzso zzso whereas gene expression of zzso and zzso in contrast zzso Free fatty acids were found to suppress the expression of zzso gene in normal rat zzso These results demonstrate that an zzso instance in the zzso diet rat model exists with the decreased gene expression of zzso
