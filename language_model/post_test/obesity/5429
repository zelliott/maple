The objective is to investigate the effect of obesity and zzso on the zzso zzso pattern of the zzso zzso zzso and duplex zzso zzso of the liver and the right zzso vein was performed in 102 obese subjects and 84 healthy zzso The severity of fatty zzso was graded as mild, moderate and zzso The flow pattern of the right zzso vein was classified as zzso zzso and zzso The zzso flow pattern in the right zzso vein was zzso in 56 zzso zzso in 27 zzso and zzso in 19 zzso obese patients, whereas it was zzso in 83 zzso and zzso in 1 zzso control subject, achieving a statistical significance zzso zzso zzso There was an inverse correlation between the zzso grade of the zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso flow zzso zzso The zzso vein zzso is significantly dampened in obese patients zzso with the grade of zzso The body zzso itself does not have an independent effect on zzso zzso zzso The zzso in zzso vein zzso flow pattern in an obese population may suggest reduced vascular compliance in the liver because of fatty zzso
