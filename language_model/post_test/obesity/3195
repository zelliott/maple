A zzso of zzso status zzso to zzso research is essential to studying the relationship between free zzso and chronic disease zzso Gas zzso with zzso detection zzso is the gold standard for measurement of urinary zzso zzso a zzso marker of zzso zzso However, this method is zzso and costly, which prohibits its use in large zzso zzso 

We compared zzso zzso with an inexpensive quick zzso zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso an abundant zzso zzso of zzso We measured zzso in urine of 52 participants of the zzso Resistance zzso Study by both zzso 

The zzso zzso showed approximately zzso greater mean and median zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso than the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We found low linear correlation zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and weak agreement in ranking subjects by zzso (weighted Kappa statistic zzso between a zzso and zzso 

We conclude that the current zzso method is not a valid substitute for the zzso zzso
