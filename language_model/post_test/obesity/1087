A sample of 103 girls, 8 to 17 years of age, zzso 20 minutes on a cycle zzso at zzso of their predetermined peak zzso in a zzso chamber (90 degrees zzso 50% relative zzso Ratings of perceived exertion were obtained every 4 zzso Exercise zzso was assessed before and after the exercise zzso 

Controlling for peak zzso and percent body fat, zzso efficacy exerted an independent effect on perception of exertion during exercise with girls high on zzso zzso reporting lower perceived exertion during exercise, than girls low on zzso Both zzso efficacy and perceived exertion explained zzso zzso Exercise zzso increased significantly from zzso to zzso 

zzso efficacy is an important factor influencing girls' perceptions of exertion during exercise and their zzso zzso Increased exercise zzso of girls following successful completion of an exercise challenge suggests possible strategies to increase physical zzso
