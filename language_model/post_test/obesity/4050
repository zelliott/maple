We examined the relationship among zzso zzso efficiency of weight gain, and zzso of brown zzso tissue zzso in rats zzso zzso 362 zzso 1 zzso made zzso and obese by feeding on a highly palatable zzso zzso diet for zzso zzso As compared with zzso controls, zzso feeding resulted in a zzso increase in caloric intake zzso less than zzso a zzso increase in weight gain zzso less than zzso and zzso zzso disposal rate zzso on intravenous zzso tolerance test zzso was greater than or equal to zzso in all zzso rats, but fell to less than or equal to zzso in 10 of 23 zzso zzso As compared with the zzso controls, rats with normal zzso tolerance demonstrated a zzso decline in efficiency of weight gain zzso zzso of food zzso in response to zzso feeding zzso less than zzso In marked contrast, in rats with impaired zzso zzso efficiency of weight gain failed to decline in response to zzso and was zzso higher than in the overfed group with normal zzso tolerance zzso less than zzso Although zzso feeding increased the mass of zzso BAT by zzso in rats with normal as well as impaired zzso zzso DNA content of BAT rose only in the zzso zzso rats zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso in zzso controls and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
