To investigate the zzso in insulin zzso induced by aging, 2-month-old, zzso and 12-month old lean rats zzso to a caloric restriction during the last month that causes a weight loss of approximately zzso were zzso As expected, zzso intolerance and increased insulin response were observed during zzso in zzso zzso These effects were, however, reversed by weight zzso zzso zzso was investigated in isolated zzso both during zzso incubation and zzso In zzso rats insulin zzso and zzso zzso were lower only in the second phase of the hormonal zzso suggesting an involvement of zzso calcium channels in these zzso Considering that in zzso and in zzso zzso were reversed after weight loss, it is possible to conclude that obesity is probably a major cause of impaired insulin zzso in zzso zzso zzso Since zzso metabolism was not changed in zzso from aged rats, the effect of obesity on insulin zzso is not due to altered zzso metabolism in pancreatic zzso
