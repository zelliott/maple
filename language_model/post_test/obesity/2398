zzso levels and trends of cardiovascular disease risk factors in childhood have been well documented by numerous zzso zzso zzso levels of blood pressure, lipids and zzso and body size can be determined by the child's physician using zzso and zzso zzso These zzso allow for the identification and follow-up of children with high-risk zzso Evidence of increased left zzso mass and vascular changes in zzso arteries in association with childhood blood pressure level along with zzso fatty streak and zzso plaque development in the zzso and coronary arteries shows that children with elevated risk factors are at risk for early target organ zzso These data demonstrate the potential importance of early intervention on the natural history of cardiovascular zzso Based on our own data from the zzso population, as well as evidence from other zzso investigations in children, the following recommendations can be made, regardless of the risk factor variable under zzso zzso disease risk factor variables should be measured carefully and in a serial manner to zzso a child as zzso zzso zzso serve to reduce the effect of zzso to the mean and increase the zzso value of the zzso The zzso of normal children into the high-risk category can be avoided by serial and replicate zzso zzso that have attendant side effects (for example, zzso therapy for high blood zzso have to be measured against the effectiveness of diet, exercise, and other aspects of primary zzso zzso factor levels consistently greater than the zzso zzso deserve medical zzso Care should be taken prior to using specific zzso of normal levels of cardiovascular disease risk factors in zzso The measurement techniques employed on individuals should be similar to those used by the zzso study to generate the zzso in a reference zzso The zzso should become part of the child's permanent medical record, as they provide a rapid visual assessment of the cardiovascular disease risk profile over zzso zzso zzso may require more intensive follow-up and will allow for early intervention and an assessment of the efficacy of the intervention zzso In conclusion, cardiovascular disease risk factor screening in childhood is zzso effective, and zzso The potential payoff in prevention of adult cardiovascular disease is enormous and allows the physician to provide more comprehensive care to a pediatric zzso
