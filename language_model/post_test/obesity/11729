To estimate zzso fatty acids zzso in patients with Type II zzso diabetes zzso and obese subjects in the zzso state and during zzso using zzso zzso zzso 

We evaluated the effect of zzso zzso clamp with insulin infused at 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 150 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (3 zzso on zzso fatty acid zzso traced with zzso using zzso zzso conditions in non-obese and obese healthy subjects and Type II diabetic patients (10 per zzso zzso zzso were applied for total zzso fatty acid zzso which was assumed to be composed of total zzso plasma zzso fatty acid rate of appearance zzso the rate of zzso and tissue zzso of zzso fatty acids derived from zzso zzso zzso A model was developed to calculate the rate of escape of zzso fatty acids from tissue zzso and the net rate of tissue zzso 

Total zzso plasma zzso fatty acid rate of appearance was lower in non-obese healthy subjects than in the other groups at low insulin infusion zzso zzso and in obese Type II diabetic patients at high insulin infusion zzso zzso Plasma zzso were also lowest in non-obese healthy subjects during zzso zzso zzso from other zzso The rate of escape from tissue zzso decreased during zzso zzso zzso for each zzso but remained higher in obese Type II diabetic patients zzso zzso from non-obese healthy zzso In contrast, net rate of tissue zzso was not different between the groups at baseline and its decline during zzso zzso zzso for each zzso was similar in all zzso 

This study challenges the view that the zzso effect of insulin is impaired in Type II diabetes and zzso We suggest that a high plasma zzso concentration causes a higher escape of zzso fatty acids from tissue zzso leading to an impaired suppression of total zzso plasma rate of appearance during a low degree of zzso in obese subjects and Type II diabetic patients and during a high degree of zzso in obese Type II diabetic zzso
