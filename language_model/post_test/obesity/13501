zzso analysis of the heart rate zzso during zzso from sleep, with and without zzso zzso coming from five obese healthy subjects was zzso Additionally, a comparative analysis of three zzso zzso smooth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso distribution zzso is presented in this zzso zzso showed higher capacity for eliminating the cross terms independently of the zzso After applying zzso transformation to real signals zzso and zzso lost some important zzso properties as zzso on the contrary zzso remains zzso zzso showed results comparable with zzso During zzso episodes, analogous energy distribution and spectral indexes were obtained by the three zzso zzso zzso with chin activity presented stronger changes in zzso intervals and zzso zzso to sympathetic zzso zzso being statistically different with respect to zzso without chin activity, only around the period of maximum change in beta activity on the zzso These results suggest a more evident stress for the heart when an zzso is related to external muscular zzso
