An zzso evidence shows that smoking, high total cholesterol, hypertension, overweight, and a low level of physical activity are significant risk factors for coronary heart disease zzso zzso by turning these risk factors in a healthier direction, presumably a substantial proportion of the deaths would be zzso 

The zzso proportion of coronary heart disease deaths associated with smoking, a high level of total cholesterol, zzso hypertension, overweight, and a low level of zzso physical activity was assessed with the use of the population attributable risks for initially zzso to zzso Finnish men (six studies with zzso subjects) who were followed up from 7 to 30 zzso 

The theoretical estimates of population at zzso risks derived from published studies were as zzso smoking 10 to zzso high total cholesterol 9 to zzso hypertension 6 to zzso overweight 3 to zzso and low level of zzso physical activity 22 to zzso 

These zzso based on observed mortality rates and risk factor zzso suggest that, even if modest estimates are used, the burden from coronary heart disease deaths can be substantially reduced by converting the risk factors to more healthful zzso The results also suggest that efforts to increase physical activity deserve as much consideration as those aimed at influencing more traditional risk zzso
