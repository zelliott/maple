We conducted this investigation in order to examine the zzso and zzso effects of zzso zzso seed ethanol extract zzso in zzso and in zzso 

To study the zzso effect of zzso in zzso and in zzso human zzso were treated with zzso and male zzso rats were fed with a normal diet and a high-fat diet with or without zzso zzso 

In zzso treatment with zzso resulted in zzso of zzso zzso and decreased expression of zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso and zzso in cultured human zzso indicating that it inhibited the differentiation of zzso into zzso Administration of zzso resulted in significantly reduced body weight gain and zzso tissue weights in zzso zzso zzso and zzso level of the high-fat diet + zzso group was significantly lower, compared to the high-fat zzso 

These results demonstrate an zzso effect of zzso on zzso In addition, zzso had a beneficial effect, reducing zzso tissue zzso zzso blood zzso profile, and modulating serum zzso level in rats fed a high-fat zzso zzso we suggest that zzso seed has a potential to be developed as an effective agent against zzso zzso
