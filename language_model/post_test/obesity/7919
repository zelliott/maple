Among the putative candidate genes for insulin resistance, the zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of zzso and zzso regulating a wide range of processes involved in energy production and zzso such as zzso liver zzso zzso zzso in zzso In population studies a zzso substitution in zzso has been reported to be associated with increased risk of type diabetes 2 and insulin zzso In the present study we have zzso the association between the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene and insulin sensitivity and zzso tolerance in a population of obese zzso zzso The zzso zzso was detected by zzso in a cohort of zzso Caucasian obese subjects zzso with normal zzso tolerance zzso and 125 with impaired zzso tolerance zzso We observed a significant association zzso zzso between carriers of the zzso zzso of the zzso gene and insulin resistance measured by zzso zzso analysis confirmed that the zzso zzso was a significant zzso zzso zzso of decreased insulin sensitivity, independently from other well-known zzso of insulin zzso In conclusion, we have found significant association between the zzso zzso of the zzso gene and reduced insulin sensitivity in obese zzso This association resulted independent from all other known zzso of insulin resistance, and suggests a primary role for the zzso gene on the genetic zzso to insulin resistance in zzso
