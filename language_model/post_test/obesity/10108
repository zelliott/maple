During zzso zzso mass zzso and fat mass zzso change quickly and these changes are influenced by sex and zzso Since it is not completely known how these changes affect resting zzso rate zzso the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of body zzso age, sex and zzso development of zzso zzso in zzso to zzso year-old obese and non-obese zzso zzso zzso was measured in a sample of 371 zzso and zzso children zzso 193 males zzso non-obese and 77 zzso and 178 females zzso non-obese and 59 zzso zzso was assessed by indirect zzso using a zzso hood system for 45 zzso after an overnight zzso Body composition zzso and zzso was estimated from zzso zzso The mean zzso zzso zzso was significantly zzso zzso lower in non-obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than in obese zzso zzso zzso 1220 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This difference became zzso when zzso was adjusted for body composition zzso However, the difference between the genders still remained significant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso control female: zzso zzso zzso P zzso obese zzso zzso zzso zzso obese female: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso The main zzso of zzso was zzso In the whole zzso zzso explained zzso of the variation in zzso followed by age, gender and zzso adding further zzso zzso and zzso to the predictability of zzso zzso No significant contribution for study group zzso zzso zzso stage, or fat distribution was found in the zzso for zzso The adjusted value of zzso (for zzso and zzso slightly, but significantly zzso zzso decreased between the age of zzso years, demonstrating the important effect of age on zzso 

The resting zzso rate of obese and control children is not different when adjusted for body zzso The main zzso of zzso is the zzso mass, however, age, gender and fat mass are also significant zzso zzso development and fat distribution do not influence zzso independently from the changes in body zzso
