The zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso release through a zzso zzso zzso and it has been widely prescribed for the treatment of zzso Previous studies have identified that zzso receptors have important roles in zzso side effects, that is, pulmonary hypertension, plasma zzso level regulation, and zzso We thus investigated a putative contribution of zzso receptors in zzso feeding behavior in zzso Interestingly, the zzso response to zzso zzso zzso observed in zzso mice zzso zzso was eliminated in mice lacking zzso receptors zzso These findings were further validated by the lack of zzso response to zzso in zzso mice treated with zzso a highly selective and potent zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso we observed that in zzso awake mice, the zzso zzso peak of zzso release (1 zzso was strongly reduced zzso compared with wild zzso Moreover, using zzso zzso we established the zzso zzso autonomous properties of this effect: a strong zzso release was observed upon zzso stimulation of zzso preparation from wild type but not from mice lacking active zzso zzso These findings strongly suggest that zzso of zzso zzso receptors is a limiting step in the zzso zzso zzso effect of zzso whereas other zzso receptors act downstream with respect to feeding zzso
