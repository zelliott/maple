A zzso zzso for completing truncated zzso zzso zzso projection data (so that reconstruction methods suitable for complete projection data can be zzso is zzso zzso The study is motivated primarily by the problem of patients who are too obese to fit into the fan beam of a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by dose reduction zzso Four sets of patient data collected by a zzso scanner are used, and the reconstructions from the complete and truncated projection data are zzso It is illustrated that the zzso zzso leads to zzso good images, since local variations are nearly identical in the reconstruction from the complete and from the truncated zzso zzso the results are less zzso the exact values of CT numbers differ in the two reconstructions by a significant (although slowly zzso amount across the two reconstructed zzso
