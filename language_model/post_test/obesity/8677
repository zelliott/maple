zzso and obesity serve as risk factors for the development of zzso cardiovascular zzso zzso is sometimes recommended for treating these zzso This study was undertaken to try to resolve conflicting results reported in the zzso 

To study the effect of zzso zzso zzso with free intake of zzso for 3-5 days on plasma concentration of zzso cholesterol and zzso zzso 

zzso about to begin a hunger strike, were divided into four groups: zzso non-obese men zzso 1), two moderately obese men and two men with type IV zzso zzso zzso healthy non-obese women zzso zzso and healthy non-obese women on oral zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso was monitored daily by detailed interviews, loss of weight, drop in plasma zzso presence of zzso progressive rise in serum zzso and zzso acid, and decrease in plasma zzso We monitored their serum zzso zzso liver function, zzso zzso and zzso B on days 0, 3, and zzso 

Physicians who zzso to complete zzso lost more than zzso of their body weight after 3 days of zzso zzso zzso zzso and more than zzso at 5 days zzso zzso zzso All non-obese zzso males and females zzso 1 and 3) showed an increase in plasma zzso (by zzso and very low density zzso cholesterol (by zzso after 3 days of zzso The obese and zzso men zzso 2) showed a decrease of zzso in their zzso cholesterol, and the women on oral zzso zzso 4) showed a zzso decrease in their plasma zzso on day zzso Low density zzso cholesterol increased by zzso in group 2, decreased by zzso in group 4, and remained unchanged in group 1 and zzso zzso B level correlated well with LDL cholesterol in all zzso High density zzso cholesterol changes were zzso 

These results help to explain and reconcile previous published zzso The zzso background of the individual together with the amount of energy consumed affect the behavior of plasma lipids and zzso levels during zzso
