zzso diet can induce zzso However, it is not known if the neural activity of the zzso is altered under high-fat zzso The aim of the present study is to search for the altered zzso zzso activity in zzso mice fed a high-fat diet for 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and serum zzso were measured after mice were fed a high-fat diet for 15 zzso Our results demonstrate that increased body weight and serum zzso are accompanied by an elevated zzso zzso zzso in the lateral zzso the lateral part of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso obese zzso zzso increases zzso zzso in the zzso zzso nucleus and decreases zzso zzso in the lateral zzso area and zzso zzso nucleus of both zzso obese and lean zzso The current data suggest that constantly activated status of these zzso in the zzso may be responsible for differences in body weight and serum zzso between obese and lean zzso
