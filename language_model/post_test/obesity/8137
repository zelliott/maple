We evaluated the effects of zzso exercise training without dietary changes on cardiovascular and zzso variables and on the expression of zzso zzso Type 4 in rats with zzso zzso 

Twenty male spontaneously zzso rats received zzso zzso during the zzso zzso The animals were allocated to the following groups: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on a treadmill for 1 zzso 5 zzso for 10 weeks), H zzso spontaneously zzso zzso and zzso zzso spontaneously zzso zzso The Lee index, blood pressure zzso zzso insulin sensitivity zzso tolerance zzso and functional capacity were evaluated before and after 10 weeks of zzso zzso zzso Type 4 expression was analyzed using Western zzso The data were compared using analysis of zzso zzso zzso 

At zzso the zzso rats exhibited lower insulin sensitivity and increased Lee index compared with the H zzso Training decreased the body weight and Lee index of the zzso rats zzso zzso zzso but not of the H rats zzso zzso zzso There were no differences in food intake between the zzso At the end of the experiments, the zzso blood pressure was lower in the two trained groups than in their sedentary zzso zzso insulin sensitivity increased in the trained zzso zzso zzso Type 4 content increased in the heart, white zzso tissue and zzso muscle of the trained groups relative to their respective untrained zzso 

In conclusion, the present study shows that an isolated zzso exercise training intervention is an efficient means of improving several components of zzso syndrome, that is, training reduces obesity and hypertension and increases insulin zzso
