Recent studies have shown that zzso proteins have a zzso role in zzso and zzso of these substances could be used as a marker for future vascular zzso The objective of this study was to determine gender differences in highly sensitive zzso protein zzso in individuals with zzso risk factors and apparently healthy zzso We have presently matched 469 females and 469 males having the same age and body mass index zzso Of these, 210 men and 210 women had no zzso risk zzso In this group the zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso in women and zzso zzso zzso in men zzso These values were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, in the entire cohort zzso which included also individuals with zzso risk zzso We conclude that significant gender differences exist in zzso zzso despite perfect matching for age and zzso These differences should be reflected in guidelines that suggest zzso zzso points for the zzso of vascular zzso
