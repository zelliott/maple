We evaluated the benefit of using combined genetic risk score zzso of known single zzso zzso zzso for body mass index zzso and zzso ratio zzso in the prediction of weight loss and weight regain after obesity zzso 

A total of zzso consecutive zzso obese individuals undergoing zzso gastric bypass zzso or sleeve zzso zzso in a single zzso center in Finland were zzso zzso blood samples were drawn after 12 h of zzso before and 1 year after zzso zzso Data for weight regain and medication were collected with a questionnaire after zzso zzso zzso years zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was diagnosed with liver zzso Twenty zzso and 13 zzso zzso were zzso Linear zzso was used to identify factors predicting weight loss and weight zzso 

Lower baseline zzso predicted greater decline in zzso zzso zzso zzso and excess weight loss zzso zzso zzso zzso In the multiple linear zzso analysis age and zzso explained the zzso of zzso during the first year while zzso sex, zzso plasma zzso serum insulin and NASH diagnosis did not have any zzso None of the baseline clinical variables explained zzso zzso The combined zzso did not associate with weight or zzso at zzso with zzso changes or with weight regain between 1 year and an average of zzso years zzso 

In our study, we found that the zzso risk score does not predict weight loss after obesity surgery while lower baseline zzso predicted the greater weight zzso
