To test the hypothesis that obese individuals may either zzso or zzso the lung when zzso In both cases zzso is an inescapable zzso 

zzso zzso zzso lung volume and zzso lung volume, and zzso score zzso zzso were studied in 20 class zzso obese subjects and 14 healthy controls during incremental zzso cycle zzso 

zzso increased with increasing work rate, in obese and in control zzso most obese subjects had to increase zzso lung volume to escape from flow zzso in contrast, like controls, a few subjects zzso the lung on zzso zzso zzso was equal in degree at zzso threshold and peak exercise in obese as in control subjects, and in obese who zzso as in those who zzso the zzso In particular, zzso lung volume at baseline zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso was zzso correlated with changes in zzso score in obese who did not zzso the lower the former the higher the zzso On the other hand, tidal volume zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and decrease in zzso reserve volume zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso were positively correlated with the zzso score in obese subjects who zzso No other independent variable correlated with the zzso zzso 

We conclude that not all obese subjects had to increase zzso lung volume on zzso zzso Changes in zzso for unit changes in ventilation were similar in obese who did zzso as well as in those who did not, suggesting that the increase in respiratory neural drive, associated with an increase in zzso is an important source of zzso in obese as well as in control zzso
