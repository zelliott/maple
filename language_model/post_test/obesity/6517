To zzso zzso of abnormal left zzso functional responses to exercise in zzso zzso 

One hundred zzso patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension were studied by rest and exercise zzso zzso and by zzso at zzso 

The 24 patients with zzso left zzso ejection fraction at peak exercise (less than zzso were similar in age and rest and exercise blood pressures to the 103 with normal exercise ejection zzso but were more obese zzso less than zzso and had greater left zzso mass zzso less than zzso and internal dimensions zzso less than zzso The parallel increase in left zzso chamber size and mass zzso zzso in the group of patients with exercise dysfunction was associated with higher resting zzso wall stress zzso less than zzso and abnormal increases of zzso left zzso volume from rest to peak exercise zzso less than zzso zzso analysis revealed that exercise left zzso dysfunction was independently associated with higher left zzso mass zzso less than zzso zzso wall stress zzso less than zzso dietary sodium intake zzso less than zzso and body mass index zzso less than zzso 

Among patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension, abnormal functional responses to exercise are strongly associated with eccentric zzso zzso zzso and high sodium zzso
