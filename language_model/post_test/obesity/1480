An obese zzso gene product, expressed specifically in zzso zzso regulates energy zzso Here we report zzso in zzso tissue actually express zzso zzso and that a synthetic zzso zzso regulates expression of the zzso zzso zzso of 100 zzso zzso to isolated rat zzso rapidly induced a zzso fold increase in zzso zzso This increase in zzso zzso level was apparent within 1 zzso and reached a maximum at about 7 h after zzso The zzso increase of zzso zzso was only partially blocked by protein synthesis zzso zzso (20 zzso or zzso zzso zzso This suggests that new protein synthesis is not necessarily required for the observed zzso increase in zzso zzso
