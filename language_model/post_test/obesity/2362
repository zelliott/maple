To analyze potential interactions of zzso and zzso protein 4 zzso levels with body mass, zzso and hormonal status in normal weight and obese women with zzso 

Body composition was determined by zzso in 83 women (44 zzso diagnosed with zzso and in 67 women zzso zzso without zzso In addition, serum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin, zzso and zzso were measured in a zzso state and the free zzso index zzso was zzso as was insulin resistance using the zzso zzso 

Plasma zzso levels were significantly higher in women of normal weight compared to obese subjects when both were diagnosed with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while in zzso subjects the opposite was found zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Plasma zzso levels were similar in zzso and zzso zzso In zzso subjects, positive correlations between zzso level and zzso parameters were zzso In zzso zzso levels zzso correlated with serum insulin levels and zzso zzso No correlation was found between plasma zzso levels and zzso parameters in all study zzso Similarly, no correlation was found in zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, there was an inverse correlation between zzso and zzso zzso and zzso ratio in all study zzso 

Plasma zzso level is not a useful zzso of insulin resistance and zzso zzso level reflects visceral body fat content in zzso zzso zzso zzso release along with increasing insulin resistance and hormonal disturbances may be a zzso mechanism preventing deterioration in obese zzso
