We assess the existence, zzso and functions of zzso zzso efficiency of zzso zzso zzso and its potential as a target for future zzso zzso zzso efficiency is the proportion of oxygen consumption used to make zzso zzso zzso and do useful zzso High zzso efficiency may lead to fat zzso low zzso efficiency to a decrease in fat zzso We review obligatory and zzso energy expenditure and the role of a futile cycle of zzso pumping and zzso leak across the zzso inner membrane in dissipating zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso primarily by the zzso zzso zzso but can be zzso by chemical zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by specific zzso zzso We discuss the opportunities and pitfalls of targeting these processes as a treatment for obesity by decreasing zzso efficiency and increasing energy zzso either directly or through central mechanisms of energy zzso
