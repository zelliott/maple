This study examined the zzso effect and mechanism of action of blueberry peel extracts zzso in zzso cells and high-fat diet zzso obese zzso The levels of zzso zzso were measured, along with the changes in the expression of genes and proteins associated with zzso differentiation in zzso zzso zzso by zzso O zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso at zzso of 0, 50, and 200 zzso zzso decreased the expression of the key zzso differentiation regulator zzso as well as the zzso and zzso zzso during the differentiation of zzso into zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso genes such as zzso and zzso compared with control zzso The specific mechanism zzso the effects of zzso revealed that zzso zzso of zzso was strongly zzso and its downstream zzso zzso was zzso by zzso treatment in zzso zzso Together, these data indicated that zzso exerted zzso activity by zzso the expression of zzso and zzso and the zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso Next, we investigated whether zzso extracts attenuated zzso obesity in zzso zzso administration of zzso reduced zzso body weight gain significantly without affecting food zzso The zzso or zzso zzso tissue weights were lower in rats on an zzso plus zzso compared with the tissue weights of zzso obese zzso Total cholesterol and zzso levels in the rats fed zzso were modestly reduced, and the zzso level was significantly increased in zzso plus zzso rats compared with those of zzso zzso Taken together, these results demonstrated an zzso effect of zzso on zzso through the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and the reduction of the zzso zzso factor in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso reduced body weight gain and inhibited fat zzso in an zzso animal model of zzso
