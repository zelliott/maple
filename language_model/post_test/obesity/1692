zzso zzso zzso zzso evaluates the zzso zzso is a reliable marker of zzso zzso dysfunction and is related to coronary artery zzso zzso fat predicts an zzso cardiovascular and zzso risk profile in humans and zzso assessment of zzso fat zzso is a reliable marker of visceral zzso We measured the zzso and zzso thickness in 77 subjects, 38 without idiopathic deep vein zzso zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso and 39 with idiopathic zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this work is to investigate the presence of statistical association between zzso and zzso and between zzso thickness and zzso Furthermore, to account for possible zzso risk factor zzso comparison between zzso and zzso (and between zzso and zzso was assessed using a zzso zzso zzso model which included the following zzso zzso zzso age, sex, smoking and the presence of zzso zzso without zzso showed significant lower values of zzso thickness zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso greater values of zzso zzso zzso zzso percent vs zzso zzso zzso percent, zzso as compared to those with zzso In conclusion, the data presented indicate that subjects affected by spontaneous deep vein zzso may have an impaired zzso zzso a marker of zzso zzso dysfunction related to coronary artery disease, and an increased zzso zzso zzso a marker of zzso zzso
