zzso zzso is rapidly increasing in zzso Body mass index zzso is a risk factor, but its distribution does not reflect the demographic distribution of the cancer (which is highest among White zzso zzso obesity patterns may explain this zzso but no studies exist to zzso 

zzso zzso study within zzso members of the Kaiser zzso zzso health checkup zzso subjects received detailed zzso a standardized examination including zzso and zzso zzso and follow-up of zzso and zzso zzso using registry zzso 

101 incident zzso zzso 105 zzso zzso and 144 zzso zzso cell zzso were detected zzso data available for all zzso abdominal zzso for a zzso zzso abdominal diameter was strongly associated with an increased risk of zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso abdominal zzso or zzso versus zzso zzso Adjustment for zzso did not diminish this association zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The association was also not diminished by adjustment for zzso zzso symptoms, although zzso symptoms were separately associated with both abdominal diameter and cancer zzso zzso diameter was not associated with the risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso versus zzso zzso or zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso abdominal diameter was associated with an increased risk of zzso zzso independent of zzso Cancer risk was not substantially zzso through zzso zzso symptoms, although symptoms may zzso measure zzso zzso Given abdominal obesity is more common among zzso these findings suggest that increases in obesity may disproportionately increase the risk of zzso zzso in zzso
