zzso stress in zzso tissue plays an zzso role in a variety of zzso zzso zzso We previously reported that increased zzso tissue zzso zzso contents contributed to zzso plasma zzso decline in zzso In the present study, we investigated the effects of zzso zzso zzso on zzso response in zzso zzso and underlying zzso In both zzso zzso and primary zzso a zzso zzso exposure elevated zzso reaction in a zzso manner at both zzso and zzso conditions, evidenced by significantly increased zzso and fatty acids zzso This conclusion was zzso by the comparable observations when the minced human visceral zzso zzso were zzso zzso investigations revealed that zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso exposure quickly increased zzso zzso zzso zzso level, which was zzso with increased zzso of protein zzso A zzso and its direct downstream target, hormone sensitive zzso zzso zzso with zzso a potent zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso release, suggesting that enhanced zzso action in response to zzso increase is zzso mainly by zzso signal zzso in zzso In addition to zzso zzso pathway, zzso exposure also suppresses zzso protein zzso zzso a zzso zzso for zzso measured by both Western zzso for zzso form of zzso and zzso for zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso a pharmacological zzso zzso alleviated zzso zzso suggesting that zzso suppression also contributes to zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, our findings indicate that increased zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso contributes to zzso zzso zzso
