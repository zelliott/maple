A zzso in the promoter region of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso shows functionally important zzso zzso zzso long zzso and short zzso We have previously found that the S zzso is a genetic risk factor for obesity in zzso 

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the zzso zzso of the zzso gene is associated with zzso as a continuous trait and also with obesity in a large sample of adult men of European ancestry included in a zzso zzso zzso 

The study group was composed of individuals who were randomly recruited from a factory in the zzso Aires metropolitan area and who underwent an annual health zzso 

We observed that among zzso unrelated subjects, aged zzso zzso zzso years, zzso zzso values zzso as mean zzso zzso for each zzso showed statistically significant differences across zzso groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso In addition, association tests showed that the zzso distribution was significantly different between zzso lean zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso and zzso obese zzso or zzso 27 zzso zzso We found a zzso odds ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso for obesity in SS carriers in comparison with zzso carriers, P zzso zzso 

In conclusion, our findings indicate that zzso zzso may be linked with zzso and also with obesity and/or overweight in adult male population, reinforcing the role of the zzso zzso as a risk factor for the obesity zzso and suggesting potential new avenues for its pharmacological zzso
