To examine the relationship between hypertension, overweight and zzso of insulin resistance in Vietnamese zzso 

One hundred and eight zzso subjects zzso men and 57 zzso over 40 y of age were compared with 36 control subjects over 40 y of zzso 

Blood zzso and plasma insulin were measured at zzso and 2 h after 75 g zzso taken zzso 

zzso subjects had significantly higher body mass index zzso zzso zzso waist and hip zzso and zzso zzso zzso at zzso and after zzso were similar in the two zzso zzso at zzso and after zzso were significantly higher in the zzso zzso In the whole series of zzso subjects, plasma insulin and zzso ratio at zzso and after zzso correlated significantly with zzso zzso zzso and waist and hip zzso After exclusion of the subjects with zzso 22 zzso compared with the controls, plasma insulin and zzso ratio were significantly higher in the whole zzso group and separately in zzso men and zzso The zzso zzso analyses have shown that plasma insulin and zzso ratio at zzso and after zzso were significantly associated with hypertension, independently of zzso zzso and waist zzso 

This study shows that in Vietnamese people, essential hypertension is associated with a significant increase in zzso which however remains far lower than the definition threshold of zzso obesity and with a state of insulin resistance found despite very slight or no excess zzso
