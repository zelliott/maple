zzso syndrome is a zzso multiple anomaly syndrome inherited in an zzso zzso zzso It is now known that this disorder has locus zzso with zzso zzso identified in as many as 14 zzso The aim of this study was to derive zzso recurrence risk estimates for family members of a zzso affected with zzso zzso 

zzso data from zzso zzso affected with zzso syndrome were zzso The authors counted the relative proportion of families with zzso at each of 10 zzso and estimated zzso carrier rates for zzso using zzso principles and an zzso population frequency of zzso for the zzso zzso recurrence risks were calculated for relatives of an affected zzso 

zzso carrier zzso range from zzso to zzso and the risks for an offspring of the sibling of an affected individual range from zzso to zzso The estimate of this risk derived under a locus zzso model is zzso 

Variation of recurrence risks of this magnitude may have implications for genetic counseling of families with affected individuals, in particular about prenatal testing and other zzso zzso Similar analyses to determine zzso carrier zzso for other zzso with significant locus zzso may yield similarly relevant zzso
