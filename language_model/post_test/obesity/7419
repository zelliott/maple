zzso hormone zzso which is a zzso expressed in the zzso of the brain, is involved in regulating feeding behavior and energy zzso via the zzso zzso in zzso It is widely considered that zzso zzso zzso are worthy of development for medical treatment of zzso Here we report on the development of an ex zzso zzso occupancy zzso using a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso inhibited the binding of zzso D to brain slices in a zzso zzso The result showed a good correlation between the zzso occupancy levels and plasma or brain levels of the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the ex zzso zzso binding zzso using this zzso is zzso zzso analysis in zzso obese mice showed that the efficacy of body weight reduction correlated with the zzso occupancy levels at zzso Furthermore, more than zzso occupancy levels of zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso are required for potent efficacy on body weight zzso The present occupancy zzso could be a useful zzso marker to zzso estimate zzso zzso and would accelerate the development of zzso zzso zzso for treatment of zzso
