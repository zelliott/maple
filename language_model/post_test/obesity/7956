To assess whether changes in the birth weight distribution or changes in the association of birth weight with the later risk of childhood overweight have contributed to the development of the obesity zzso 

A Danish zzso cohort study of zzso girls and zzso boys zzso 6 to 13 zzso born between 1936 and 1983, were zzso Birth weight and annual zzso of height and weight were obtained from school health zzso zzso was defined by zzso in relation to internationally accepted zzso The relative risk of being overweight by birth weight was calculated separately for each age, sex, and time zzso 

The birth weight distribution remained relatively stable over zzso Compared with children with a birth weight of zzso to zzso zzso the risk of overweight increased consistently with each increase in birth weight category among girls and boys and at all ages between 6 and 13 zzso Furthermore, the association between birth weight and increased risk of overweight in childhood remained stable across a zzso zzso 

The increase in the prevalence of overweight could not be explained by time trends in the distribution of birth weight or by changes in the association between birth weight and the later risk of overweight over zzso This implies that, unless the prenatal environment influences the later risk of overweight without increasing birth weight, the environmental influences contributing to the obesity epidemic in children of school age operate in the early zzso zzso
