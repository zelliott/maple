To assess the risk of death from coronary disease, and all causes associated with body mass index and weight gain from age 20 to middle zzso 

In this study, zzso men aged 47 to 55 years at baseline and free of a history of zzso zzso were followed with respect to mortality from coronary disease and from all causes over an average follow-up of zzso years, and with respect to zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso High body mass index predicted death from coronary disease, but only at levels above zzso zzso Men with stable weight zzso as zzso zzso change from age zzso had the lowest death rate from coronary disease and the lowest risk of zzso zzso zzso Relative risk of coronary death increased with increasing weight gain, from zzso zzso (after adjustment for age, physical activity, and zzso in the group who gained 4 to zzso to zzso zzso in men with a weight gain of more than zzso zzso for trend zzso compared to men who remained zzso After further adjustment for serum cholesterol, zzso blood pressure, and diabetes, relative risks were reduced but still significantly elevated in all weight gain groups zzso for trend zzso Data concerning zzso zzso zzso were available for the first zzso years and showed a relative risk of zzso zzso after adjustment for age, physical activity, and smoking in men with a weight gain of more than zzso 

Weight gain from age 20, even a very moderate increase, is strongly associated with an increased risk of coronary death and zzso zzso zzso
