zzso is one of the most important risk factors for the development of zzso diabetes zzso zzso However, in obese women, it is difficult to zzso the genetic and environmental zzso The aim of this study was to investigate whether zzso obesity results in zzso in rats with the same genetic zzso 

Female zzso rats were fed a zzso diet zzso or the standard control zzso diet from 70 days of age zzso After 4 weeks on the zzso zzso of zzso and C rats were zzso In virgin and zzso zzso and C rats, we determined body weight, body composition by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tolerance by intravenous zzso tolerance test zzso and insulin sensitivity by zzso zzso clamp in zzso zzso Plasma zzso zzso were also zzso 

Body weight increased after 4 weeks in virgin zzso rats zzso and exceeded that of C rats throughout zzso This resulted exclusively from increased fat mass, as determined by zzso and was associated with a rise in plasma zzso zzso in zzso and pregnant (both zzso zzso zzso During the zzso zzso zzso rats showed normal zzso levels but increased insulin levels compared with C rats zzso for the area under the curve for zzso zzso In pregnant zzso animals, zzso tolerance was clearly impaired zzso zzso with insulin also raised zzso zzso On day 22, fetal weight was comparable between C and zzso rats, but litter weight was higher in zzso rats zzso zzso to an increase in litter zzso zzso clamp studies revealed unequivocal insulin resistance in zzso zzso rats, which was aggravated by pregnancy, the zzso effect of obesity being higher than that of zzso 

zzso obesity in rats is associated with zzso intolerance during pregnancy but not in the zzso zzso This is likely to result from the additive effects of obesity and pregnancy on insulin zzso This obese rat model is an attractive model to study further the zzso and molecular abnormalities in zzso
