The primary objective of this study was to determine whether having the zzso cell trait is independently associated with zzso We performed a retrospective cohort study of 1998 pregnant patients who either did or did not have the zzso cell zzso All patients were screened for the zzso trait using the zzso zzso Data on zzso and maternal outcome, including zzso and potential zzso variables were zzso from medical zzso zzso zzso and multiple zzso zzso analyses were used to identify zzso and zzso between multiple variables and the association between zzso cell trait and zzso With an anticipated zzso rate of zzso and alpha zzso zzso this cohort study has zzso power to detect a relative risk zzso of zzso for zzso zzso analysis revealed that the two zzso were similar with regard to zzso maternal age, chronic diseases, birth weight, and zzso age at delivery, but the zzso cell trait cohort was more likely to have zzso diabetes and had a higher mean body mass index zzso In the zzso analysis, the zzso cell trait cohort was not at increased risk for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After controlling for potential zzso variables with zzso zzso analysis, zzso trait was not independently associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to prior work, these data suggest that the zzso cell trait is not an independent risk factor for zzso or zzso zzso In fact, the data are more consistent with the zzso trait being protective for developing zzso
