zzso zzso zzso zzso catalyze the zzso of fatty zzso to form free fatty acids plus zzso but their zzso functions remain zzso zzso zzso member 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso and brown fat zzso zzso is a zzso fatty zzso zzso that is highly expressed in brown zzso tissue and is regulated by both ambient temperature and food zzso Here we show that zzso mice were resistant to zzso obesity despite greater food zzso zzso mice exhibited increased zzso consumption and heat production, which were accompanied by increased rates of fatty acid zzso in brown zzso tissue and zzso of genes that promote energy zzso zzso mice were also protected against zzso inflammation in white zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso and demonstrated improved zzso zzso The absence of zzso expression in zzso and in cell culture led to markedly attenuated zzso or chemically induced zzso zzso stress responses, providing a mechanism by which zzso zzso protects against insulin resistance and zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso functions to decrease energy consumption and conserve zzso In the setting of nutritional zzso the overproduction of free fatty acids by zzso provokes insulin resistance that is associated with inflammation and zzso zzso zzso
