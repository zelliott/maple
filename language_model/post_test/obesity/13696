Studies suggest that zzso adverse impact on cardiovascular mortality may be reduced in African Americans relative to white zzso We examined whether zzso association with novel cardiovascular risk factors such as zzso protein zzso also varies by race and zzso 

We analyzed data from zzso white, African-American, and zzso participants of the zzso National Health and Nutrition zzso Survey, who were aged 20 years and older, with a zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We fit zzso multivariable models of the association of zzso or waist circumference with log zzso levels and tested for interactions of zzso or waist circumference with zzso 

Higher zzso was significantly associated with higher zzso in all zzso groups for both men and women zzso zzso for zzso zzso before and after adjustment for age, education, and health zzso zzso waist circumference was also associated with higher zzso levels in all zzso groups before and after zzso among women, the relationship was strongest for Mexican Hispanics zzso zzso for waist zzso zzso zzso were similar after additional adjustment for medications that might affect zzso zzso 

The association between obesity and zzso is at least as strong in African Americans and Hispanic Americans as in white zzso zzso differences in the relationship between obesity and cardiovascular mortality are unlikely to be due to racial differences in zzso impact on zzso
