In a previous study performed in adult obese and zzso male subjects, we found that suppression of insulin levels by zzso reduced testosterone and increased sex zzso zzso zzso blood zzso These and other data suggested that insulin may have a regulatory capacity in testosterone zzso and/or metabolism in men, similar to what has already been demonstrated in zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of acute zzso on major zzso levels, including testosterone, in two groups of zzso in zzso zzso and obese zzso zzso 9) zzso Acute zzso was obtained by the zzso clamp zzso zzso between the degree of insulin resistance zzso total zzso disposal zzso zzso and testosterone levels were also zzso zzso testosterone levels in obese subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly lower than in zzso controls zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso whereas no difference was present in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso During the clamp study, testosterone was significantly increased in the obese group zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso but not in the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The other two zzso did not significantly change in either the obese or control zzso There was a highly significant correlation between baseline testosterone zzso with M values suggesting a relationship between impaired peripheral insulin sensitivity and reduced plasma testosterone zzso It should be pointed out that there was a certain zzso in the testosterone variations, particularly in the control group, in which two thirds of the subjects had no change or some decrease in testosterone levels, whereas in the remainder testosterone increased over the values of the zzso variation zzso These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that insulin may regulate testosterone blood levels also in male zzso Whether these effects are primarily due to increased hormone zzso or reduced clearance needs to be zzso
