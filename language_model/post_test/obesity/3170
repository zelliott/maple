zzso patients are recognized as being at high risk for adverse outcomes after coronary artery bypass zzso We evaluated our outcomes in diabetic patients to compare the effect of zzso with zzso coronary zzso 

Between April 1997 and September 2002, zzso consecutive diabetic patients underwent isolated coronary artery bypass zzso A total of 186 zzso of these patients had zzso coronary zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to assess the effect of zzso coronary procedures on adverse zzso zzso while adjusting for patient and disease characteristics by constructing a propensity score from core patient zzso The propensity score was the probability of receiving zzso coronary operation, with a zzso of zzso and was included along with the comparison variable in a multivariable analysis of zzso All analysis was performed zzso 

zzso patients were more likely to be obese zzso zzso zzso have left main stem zzso zzso zzso zzso and have undergone prior cardiac operation zzso zzso zzso The zzso group had fewer patients with zzso disease compared with the zzso zzso After risk adjusting with propensity score, zzso patients had a significantly lower zzso of stroke zzso odds ratio zzso p zzso zzso and zzso failure zzso odds ratio zzso p zzso zzso zzso patients also required less blood zzso zzso zzso and had shorter lengths of stay zzso zzso 

zzso coronary operation in diabetic patients significantly reduced zzso morbidity and length of stay compared with zzso coronary operation, although no zzso survival difference was noted between the two zzso
