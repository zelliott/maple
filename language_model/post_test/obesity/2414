To determine the number and function of genes which are responsible for spontaneous zzso zzso zzso in the obese strain zzso of chickens we crossed birds of this strain zzso with those of the zzso CB line zzso The progeny was analyzed for zzso to zzso zzso and for zzso changes in the zzso zzso In F1 zzso X zzso hybrids only those animals which derived from CB mothers had circulating zzso the progeny from the reverse combination female zzso X male CB was zzso Since the disease is not inherited by zzso males only, we conclude that maternal zzso which are transferred from the egg zzso to the zzso might prevent the immune system of the F1 chickens from zzso formation via blocking or eliminating the respective zzso Those F1 hybrids which have high zzso levels in the serum show only little or no zzso Together with other zzso these data lead to the conclusion that the zzso zzso of the F1 hybrids is not susceptible to zzso This supports previous findings that a genetically determined zzso zzso is a prerequisite for the full development of zzso The low degree of SAT in zzso zzso X zzso animals and zzso hybrids suggests that several genes are involved in the zzso zzso typing of these generations revealed that the B zzso affects the time of SAT zzso
