A previous expression profiling of zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was less expressed in severely obese men with zzso compared with without zzso the zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are associated with zzso gene expression in zzso and with zzso zzso Following validation of lower zzso expression zzso in zzso of severely obese men and women with zzso compared with without zzso the zzso a detailed genetic investigation was performed at the zzso locus by sequencing its promoter, zzso and zzso zzso boundaries using DNA of 25 severely obese zzso Five tagging zzso were zzso in the 130 subjects from the expression analysis to test whether these zzso contributed to zzso expression zzso zzso and then zzso in two independent samples of severely obese men zzso zzso and women zzso zzso In a zzso zzso experimental design, zzso were performed to test whether tagging zzso were associated with zzso components treated as continuous zzso We observed that the zzso zzso zzso was associated with zzso zzso abundance zzso as well as with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in men when adjusting for age, waist zzso smoking and medication treating zzso These novel observations suggest that zzso expression in zzso may partly explain the zzso zzso for zzso zzso in the presence of obesity and that specific zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso may influence zzso gene expression as well as zzso in obese zzso
