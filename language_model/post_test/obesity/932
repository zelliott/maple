The present studies were designed to clarify the contribution of the liver to the development of zzso in zzso fatty zzso The zzso activities of zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were higher in fatty rats than in lean rats at 4 and 8 weeks of age because of the higher insulin levels in the zzso zzso the zzso activities of fatty rats decreased slightly in spite of severe zzso and did not differ from those of lean zzso In addition, fatty rats had higher levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings indicate that the zzso zzso of fatty rats are resistant to zzso This zzso was supported by the fact that the zzso zzso activities of fatty rats showed a lower response to changes in plasma insulin levels produced by zzso and zzso The zzso ratio, which indicates net zzso handling in the liver, increased in fatty rats and decreased in lean rats with advancing age, suggesting that zzso zzso production in fatty rats becomes dominant with advancing zzso The changes in zzso zzso zzso supported this zzso the zzso steps both from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso in fatty rats were accelerated at 5 weeks of age, but suppressed at 12 weeks of zzso These results indicate that insulin resistance in the zzso zzso regulation may contribute to the development of zzso in zzso fatty zzso
