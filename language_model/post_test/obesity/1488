zzso has been associated with compromised tissue zzso and reduced organ zzso The brain is critically dependent on oxygen delivery, and reduced brain tissue oxygen tension zzso may result in poor outcome after brain zzso We tested the hypothesis that obesity is associated with compromised zzso after severe brain zzso 

Patients with severe brain injury zzso score zzso 8) who underwent continuous zzso monitoring were zzso identified from a prospective zzso zzso zzso were classified by body mass index zzso zzso weight zzso and were included if they were obese zzso zzso 30) or non-obese zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Mean daily zzso was zzso zzso zzso for the 28 obese and zzso zzso zzso for the 41 non-obese patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mean daily maximum zzso zzso also were significantly lower in obese patients than in non-obese zzso zzso zzso of compromised zzso zzso as minutes zzso zzso zzso included elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso presence of zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso maximum zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso and mean zzso zzso zzso In multivariable analysis, zzso was significantly associated with compromised zzso zzso zzso zzso Sex, age, and mean zzso were also identified as significant zzso of compromised zzso zzso and zzso ratio were zzso 

In patients with severe brain injury, obesity was found to be an independent predictor of compromised zzso This effect may be zzso through zzso pulmonary dysfunction and inadequate zzso zzso
