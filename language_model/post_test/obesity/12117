Since obesity and essential hypertension frequently zzso a study was designed to analyze some of their cardiovascular zzso zzso obese patients, half of whom were zzso and half with established hypertension, were matched for mean zzso pressure with 28 corresponding lean zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso volume, plasma zzso activity, and circulating zzso levels were zzso zzso patients had increased cardiac output zzso less than zzso stroke volume zzso less than zzso central blood volume zzso less than zzso plasma and total blood volume zzso less than zzso and decreased total peripheral resistance zzso less than zzso In contrast, cardiac zzso central blood volume, and stroke volume of zzso patients were normal, but they had increased total peripheral zzso less than zzso and zzso vascular resistance zzso less than zzso and a contracted zzso zzso Left zzso stroke work was elevated to a similar level in obesity zzso less than zzso and hypertension zzso less than zzso but the increase was caused by an expanded stroke volume in the former and by an increase in zzso pressure in the zzso It is concluded that the disparate effects of obesity and hypertension on total peripheral resistance and zzso volume counteract and may even offset each zzso Thus, obesity may mitigate the effects of chronically elevated total peripheral resistance (and therefore zzso zzso in essential zzso Since both entities affect the heart through different mechanisms, their presence in the same patient results in a double burden to the left zzso thereby gently enhancing the long-term risk of zzso zzso
