zzso sleep zzso zzso is caused by an obstruction of the upper zzso zzso sensitivity to CO2 in the respiratory zzso is known to be a critical factor for adequate tone in the upper airway zzso The hypothesis of this study is, therefore, that the zzso response to CO2 is reduced in patients with zzso Twenty-six patients who suffered from zzso 19 zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso and 33 zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso were zzso The control group consisted of 25 subjects from a random sample with no history of zzso or daytime zzso Tests of the zzso and hypoxic zzso response to CO2 were performed, as well as zzso and dynamic zzso zzso in the zzso group displayed a higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and hypoxic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso response to CO2 than patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Multiple zzso analysis reveals that neck zzso zzso index, oxygen zzso index, zzso and sex zzso zzso are correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso Multiple zzso analysis also reveals that zzso zzso reserve zzso and sex zzso zzso are correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso Arguing against the hypothesis, patients with zzso displayed an increased zzso and hypoxic zzso response to zzso zzso zzso frequency and the obesity factor in zzso may have contributed to these zzso
