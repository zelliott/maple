To investigate whether old age frailty is predicted by zzso zzso and cardiovascular disease zzso zzso 

zzso zzso study (the Helsinki zzso zzso 

In their zzso in 1974, zzso initially healthy men zzso age 47 zzso were clinically investigated, zzso their weight status zzso weight zzso overweight 25 zzso body mass index zzso and obese zzso zzso zzso risk factors and a composite risk score zzso of coronary artery disease zzso were zzso After a zzso follow-up in 2000, when 425 men had died, the frailty status of survivors zzso zzso mean age 73 zzso was assessed using a postal questionnaire including the zzso zzso zzso criteria were used to define zzso and according to these criteria, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were classified as not frail, zzso and frail, zzso zzso are presented as odds ratios zzso with zzso confidence intervals zzso 

Compared with normal weight, the development of frailty was significantly higher among those men who were overweight or obese in zzso with fully adjusted zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Even the development of zzso was significantly increased with zzso overweight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and obesity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso composite zzso score in zzso predicted similarly zzso total mortality zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and development of frailty zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and higher zzso risk in zzso were associated with frailty 26 years zzso Preventing old age frailty should be recognized as an important goal of obesity and zzso risk zzso
