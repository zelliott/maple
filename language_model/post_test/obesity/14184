The relationships between weight and waist on vascular risk are well zzso but the long-term impact of these parameters is less clearly zzso particularly in Chinese zzso 

Ten thousand four hundred and ten older subjects zzso zzso were recruited and blood pressure, zzso and zzso vascular risk factors zzso zzso and demographic data, including zzso weight and waist gain since 18 zzso The association of weight and waist gain with these vascular risk factors was zzso 

zzso and particularly waist gain were associated with a more adverse vascular risk factor profile, with the most adverse profile associated with gains in both weight and zzso zzso gains were associated with increased risk even in non-obese subjects zzso Even after adjustment for a range of demographic and socioeconomic factors, waist gain was associated with additional risk of having the zzso syndrome and its components and zzso vascular disease in those centrally obese subjects zzso for zzso 

Increased weight and waist increased the level of vascular risk factors and zzso disease in both non-obese and obese zzso The high prevalence of vascular risk factors in this population zzso of a major developing health burden in the rapidly zzso zzso billion Chinese zzso
