zzso zzso has been suggested to be zzso linked with inflammation and systemic insulin zzso The aim of the study was to determine whether increased zzso size is associated with increased liver fat content due to zzso fatty liver disease zzso in humans independent of zzso fat distribution and genetic variation in the zzso zzso zzso 3 gene zzso zzso at zzso 

One hundred zzso zzso subjects in a zzso study with a median age of 39 years, mean zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso subcutaneous zzso zzso size, liver fat zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and abdominal SC zzso tissue volumes zzso resonance imaging zzso and the zzso zzso at zzso were zzso zzso and multiple linear zzso analysis were used to identify independent zzso of liver fat zzso 

In multiple linear zzso analysis, age, zzso zzso the zzso ratio, and zzso zzso explained zzso of variation in liver fat zzso zzso of zzso size zzso zzso to the model increased the percent of explanation to zzso Thus, zzso of known variation in liver fat could be explained by zzso size zzso 

Increased zzso size highly significantly contributes to liver fat zzso independent of other zzso
