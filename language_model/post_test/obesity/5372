zzso is frequently associated with eating disorders, and evidence indicates that both conditions are influenced by genetic zzso However, little is known about the genes influencing eating zzso 

The objective was to identify genes associated with eating zzso 

Three eating behaviors were assessed in zzso adults from the Quebec Family Study with the use of the zzso Eating zzso A zzso scan was conducted with a total of zzso genetic markers spanning the 22 zzso to identify quantitative trait zzso for eating zzso Body composition and zzso and energy zzso were also zzso 

Four quantitative trait zzso were identified for zzso and zzso to zzso Of these, the best evidence of linkage was found between a locus on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso to hunger zzso zzso After zzso the peak linkage was found between markers zzso and zzso surrounding the zzso beta zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso located within the zzso gene showed significant associations with eating behaviors and obesity zzso The zzso zzso were 2 times as likely to exhibit high levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to hunger zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as were the zzso zzso zzso zzso follow-up data showed that the amount of body fat gain over time in zzso subjects zzso times that than in zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso P zzso 

The results suggest that zzso is a very strong candidate gene of eating behaviors and predisposition to zzso
