Progress in understanding the zzso of obesity has moved rapidly in the past few zzso The genes for all of the single gene defects that produce obesity in experimental animals have now been zzso The new insights from these models are one spur for the examination of possible links to human zzso In thinking about the biology of obesity produced by single gene zzso it must be kept in mind that zzso can prevent the zzso expression in all of the single gene models of zzso Thus, zzso components can play a major role in regulating even single gene models of zzso zzso mice have also expanded our understanding of zzso zzso models that both increase and decrease body fat have been zzso Of particular interest from the perspective of the zzso control of obesity is the destruction of the zzso protein in brown zzso zzso which is followed by zzso and zzso suggesting that the sympathetic nervous system is involved in both zzso of food intake and energy zzso Gene mapping using quantitative trait zzso and studies of candidate genes have been applied to experimental models of animals with differing zzso to dietary fat and have been applied to the human zzso in more zzso
