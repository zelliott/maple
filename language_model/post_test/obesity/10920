To investigate the extent of carotid artery zzso in obese subjects and to examine the possible effects of weight loss on zzso zzso 

Controlled 4 y intervention zzso 

20 obese patients treated with zzso zzso 19 obese patients treated with dietary recommendations and 35 lean zzso 

Body weight, blood pressure, blood zzso zzso and insulin were zzso A zzso ultrasound was recorded to determine the zzso thickness zzso and zzso diameter zzso of the carotid zzso Study groups were investigated at baseline and zzso after 3 to 4 y of zzso 

At zzso obese patients had higher blood pressure, serum total cholesterol, zzso zzso and insulin compared with lean zzso they also had a larger zzso in the carotid artery bulb zzso and a larger zzso in the common carotid artery zzso After 4 y of zzso obese patients treated with surgery displayed a mean weight loss of 22 zzso zzso while the average weight in the obese control group remained unchanged zzso The weight loss group showed improvements in blood pressure, zzso zzso and insulin compared with the obese control group zzso The progression rate of carotid bulb zzso in the weight loss group was similar to that observed in the lean control group zzso vs zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso progression rate was almost three times higher in the obese control group zzso zzso zzso compared with lean zzso 

zzso people have an zzso risk factor profile and signs of premature carotid artery zzso Weight loss is followed by an improvement in several risk factors and may reduce the progression rate of zzso changes in the carotid artery zzso
