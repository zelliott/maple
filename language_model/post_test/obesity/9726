To evaluate a universal obesity prevention intervention, which commenced at infant age 4-6 months, using outcome data assessed 6 months after completion of the first of two intervention zzso and 9 months from zzso 

zzso controlled trial of a community-based early feeding zzso 

Six hundred and zzso first-time mothers zzso age zzso zzso with healthy term infants zzso zzso aged zzso months at zzso Mothers and infants were randomly allocated to zzso access to usual care or to attend two group education zzso each delivered over 3 months, that provided anticipatory guidance on early feeding zzso zzso data reported here were assessed at infant age zzso zzso zzso were expressed as zzso zzso zzso Rapid weight gain was defined as change in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso feeding practices were assessed via self-administered zzso 

There were no differences according to group allocation on key maternal and infant zzso At follow-up zzso zzso the control group infants had higher zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso and were more likely to show rapid weight gain from baseline to follow-up zzso ratio zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso Mothers in the control group were more likely to report using zzso feeding practices that fail to respond to infant zzso cues such as encouraging eating by using food as a reward zzso vs zzso zzso or using games zzso vs zzso zzso 

These results provide early evidence that anticipatory guidance targeting the zzso what and zzso of solid feeding can be effective in changing maternal feeding practices and, at least in the short term, reducing zzso indicators of childhood obesity zzso zzso of outcomes at later ages are required to determine if these promising effects can be zzso
