zzso tissue grows by two zzso zzso zzso number zzso and zzso zzso size zzso zzso and diet affect the relative contributions of these two mechanisms to the growth of zzso tissue in zzso In this study, the size zzso of zzso zzso cells from two mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were measured after 2, 4, and 12 weeks under regular and high-fat feeding zzso The total cell number in the zzso fat pad was estimated from the fat pad mass and the zzso zzso zzso The cell number and zzso mean cell size increase as a function of fat pad zzso To address zzso tissue growth precisely, we developed a mathematical model describing the evolution of the zzso zzso zzso as a function of the increasing fat pad mass, instead of the increasing zzso zzso Our model describes the recruitment of new zzso cells and their subsequent development in different zzso and with different diet regimens, with common mechanisms, but with zzso and zzso model zzso Compared to the zzso strain, the zzso strain has greater recruitment of small zzso zzso zzso is enhanced by high-fat diet in a zzso way, suggesting a synergistic interaction between zzso and zzso Moreover, high-fat feeding increases the rate of zzso cell size growth, independent of strain, reflecting the increase in calories requiring zzso Additionally, high-fat diet leads to a dramatic spreading of the size distribution of zzso cells in both zzso this implies an increase in size fluctuations of zzso cells through zzso zzso
