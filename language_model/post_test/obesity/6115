Prior to the development of type 2 diabetes, zzso levels increase into the zzso states of isolated impaired zzso zzso zzso isolated impaired zzso tolerance zzso or combined zzso A better understanding of the zzso and zzso of the zzso states might give a basis for the development of zzso prevention and treatment strategies for type 2 zzso Several studies have examined mechanisms and potential zzso factors leading to the development of the different zzso zzso The zzso of zzso seems to include the following key zzso reduced zzso insulin sensitivity, stationary beta cell dysfunction and/or chronic low beta cell mass, altered zzso zzso zzso and inappropriately elevated zzso zzso zzso the zzso state zzso is zzso by reduced peripheral insulin sensitivity, zzso zzso insulin sensitivity, progressive loss of beta cell function, reduced zzso of zzso zzso zzso and inappropriately elevated zzso zzso zzso developing combined zzso exhibit severe defects in both peripheral and zzso insulin sensitivity as well as a progressive loss of beta cell zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso also seem to zzso with zzso being predominantly related to genetic factors, smoking and male sex, while zzso is predominantly related to physical zzso zzso diet and short zzso Since the transition from the zzso states to overt type 2 diabetes is zzso by a zzso vicious cycle that includes severe deleterious effects on zzso zzso there are good reasons to use the well-established zzso and zzso differences in zzso zzso and zzso to design zzso preventive zzso
