zzso individuals have higher hip zzso and more robust zzso zzso but it is unclear whether values vary in proportion with body weight in zzso We studied the variation of hip zzso and geometry across categories of body mass index zzso in a subset of zzso zzso whites zzso from the Women's Health Initiative zzso zzso zzso The implications on fracture zzso were studied among zzso in the entire zzso zzso zzso scans of hip and total body from zzso zzso women were divided into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso healthy weight zzso overweight zzso and mild zzso moderate zzso and extreme obesity zzso zzso zzso and zzso of bone zzso zzso area zzso and zzso strength zzso zzso zzso were extracted from zzso scans using the hip structure analysis zzso method and compared among zzso categories after adjustment for zzso age, hormone use, diabetes, activity level, zzso zzso angle, and neck zzso The association between zzso and incident fracture was studied in zzso zzso from the entire zzso over zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was compared among zzso categories for hip alone, central body zzso zzso spine, ribs, and shoulder zzso upper zzso zzso and zzso and lower zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were larger in women with higher zzso but values scaled in proportion to lean and not to fat or total body zzso Women with highest zzso reported more falls in the 12 zzso before enrollment, more prevalent fractures, and had lower measures of physical activity and zzso zzso of hip fractures and all central body fractures declined with zzso Lower zzso fractures zzso to the hip zzso upward, and upper zzso zzso was independent of zzso zzso zzso and zzso vary in proportion to total body lean mass, supporting the view that bones adapt to prevalent muscle zzso Because lean mass is a progressively smaller fraction of total mass in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso decline relative to body weight in higher zzso zzso zzso forces increase with body weight, but fracture rates at the hip and central body were less frequent with increasing zzso possibly because of greater soft tissue zzso There was no evident protective effect in fracture rates at less padded zzso zzso zzso Upper zzso fractures showed no variation with zzso and lower zzso fracture rates were higher only in the overweight zzso zzso zzso zzso
