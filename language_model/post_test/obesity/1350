The aim of our study was to investigate the effects on baseline and exercise zzso function and zzso parameters of an acute zzso weeks) loss of at least zzso of initial weight in severely obese zzso Eight obese patients, 3 males and 5 zzso mean age zzso zzso 42 zzso 6 zzso body mass index zzso 35 zzso underwent two zzso function tests separated by 3 weeks of very low calorie zzso diet zzso zzso and a weight loss of zzso of initial weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Eight normal subjects, matched for sex and age with the obese patients, served as zzso In the obese subjects, zzso workload zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso oxygen consumption zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly increased after weight zzso Interestingly, exercise capacity at zzso threshold was not significantly different in obese subjects after weight loss with respect to normal zzso Our results show that an acute but significant weight loss obtained with a very low calorie diet in obese patients is able to significantly improve zzso zzso zzso and zzso CO2 at zzso zzso Moreover, this acute weight loss is able to partially reverse all of the zzso zzso seen in obese patients both at baseline and during zzso
