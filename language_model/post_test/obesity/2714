The impact of various clinical variables on long-term survival of patients with acutely zzso zzso heart failure zzso compared to zzso heart failure zzso has not been sufficiently zzso 

zzso laboratory, zzso and zzso data were collected and analyzed for zzso mortality in zzso zzso patients zzso years, hospitalized for acutely zzso zzso 

zzso heart failure patients zzso zzso zzso were more likely to be older, female, zzso obese, with shorter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lower New York Heart Association zzso class, lower maintenance zzso zzso and to receive calcium zzso The zzso group zzso zzso demonstrated prevailing coronary artery disease, nitrate or zzso treatment, and zzso zzso disturbances zzso zzso zzso in all zzso On median zzso zzso the respective one-, three- and five-year survival rates were zzso zzso and zzso in zzso versus zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Higher zzso daily dosage at discharge zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso increasing age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso peripheral zzso disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and a history of stroke zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso were most significantly associated with shorter survival in zzso zzso in turn, demonstrated higher zzso class zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso history of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso predicted better zzso 

zzso with acutely zzso zzso differ from similar zzso subjects with respect to zzso significance of a number of clinical zzso This observation might carry practical zzso
