zzso muscle function and standard nutritional assessment parameters were measured in six obese zzso zzso zzso were made on a zzso diet, and further zzso after 2 zzso of a zzso diet, followed by 2 zzso of zzso and then after 2 zzso of zzso The function of the zzso zzso muscle was assessed by electrical stimulation of the zzso zzso The objective parameters of muscle function measured were: 1) force of contraction expressed as a percentage of the zzso force obtained with electrical stimulation at 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100 zzso 2) zzso relaxation rate expressed as percentage force zzso zzso 3) Endurance expressed as percentage force zzso zzso Standard nutritional assessment parameters zzso zzso and zzso zzso height index, zzso and total body nitrogen and zzso were also zzso There was a significant increase in the force of contraction at 10 zzso from a zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after 2 zzso of a zzso diet zzso less than zzso These was a significant slowing of the zzso relaxation rate from a zzso of zzso zzso zzso force zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso force zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso less than zzso after 2 zzso of a zzso zzso After a further 2 zzso of zzso these abnormalities in muscle function zzso There was a significant increase in muscle force loss from a zzso of zzso zzso zzso force zzso s to zzso zzso zzso force zzso s zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso less than zzso After 2 zzso of zzso all aspects of muscle function measured were zzso During the study the standard nutritional assessment parameters did not change zzso
