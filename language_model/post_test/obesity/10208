To observe the roles of zzso zzso type 1 zzso in in zzso zzso differentiation and in rats with zzso obesity zzso 

zzso expression of zzso in the process of zzso cell differentiation and in various zzso of the rats were detected by Western zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and other marker genes of zzso differentiation were detected by using real-time zzso 

zzso droplets in zzso cells accumulated and increased after zzso A dramatically elevated protein level of zzso especially in the late stages of zzso cell zzso was zzso The relative zzso levels of zzso zzso and cell differentiation markers zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso was zzso during the zzso In zzso rats, zzso visceral zzso mass index and the protein expression of zzso increased, especially in zzso zzso brain and zzso zzso insulin, zzso total cholesterol and zzso zzso cholesterol were found to be increased in zzso rats, but without any obvious changes in blood zzso or tumor necrosis zzso zzso 

zzso may promote zzso zzso and may be involved in the development of zzso
