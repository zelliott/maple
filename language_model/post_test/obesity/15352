zzso of red cell mass with isotope dilution remains an important diagnostic test in the evaluation of patients with suspected zzso zzso zzso zzso and reference ranges are typically expressed in units zzso for body weight zzso zzso is common in zzso patients, and it is important to know how the various published zzso ranges compare across a wide range of body zzso 

We zzso reviewed 51 consecutive patients referred for red cell mass determination with zzso red blood cell zzso zzso were expressed in zzso per zzso zzso by using the actual patient weight and after zzso adjustments using ideal body weight, body mass index zzso and combinations of zzso including body surface zzso zzso were classified as normal, elevated or zzso 

There was a high prevalence of obesity in our population zzso zzso with zzso 27 zzso zzso range zzso zzso The method used to compensate for obesity had a dramatic effect on the derived red cell mass, the fraction of patients with elevated zzso and the fraction of patients meeting criteria for zzso zzso for categorization as normal, elevated or zzso by all methods was only zzso 

zzso is a common zzso factor in the interpretation of red cell mass zzso Currently published reference ranges generate inconsistent results when zzso to obese zzso Further zzso data on obese subjects are needed to determine which method (if zzso is zzso
