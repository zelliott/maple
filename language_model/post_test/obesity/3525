Liver X receptors zzso are zzso factors known for their role in zzso cholesterol and zzso zzso Though highly expressed in fat, the role of zzso in this tissue is not well zzso We generated zzso tissue zzso knockout zzso mice and showed that these mice gain more weight and fat mass on a high-fat diet compared with zzso zzso White zzso tissue zzso zzso in zzso mice results from both a decrease in zzso zzso and zzso zzso This was demonstrated by decreased expression of the zzso and zzso zzso reduced level of zzso zzso zzso and lower oxygen consumption rates zzso in zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso led to decreased zzso size in zzso and increased zzso release from primary zzso respectively, with a zzso increase in zzso in both zzso Our findings show that absence of zzso in zzso tissue results in elevated zzso through a decrease in zzso zzso secondary to attenuated zzso zzso
