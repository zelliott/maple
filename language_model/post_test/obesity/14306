The aim of the present study was to investigate the zzso and long-term effects of a high-fat Western diet zzso on zzso storage, zzso and zzso loss of energy as well as effects on locomotor activity and zzso zzso for only 24 h resulted in a marked zzso shift in energy zzso including increased body weight gain, body fat, and energy expenditure zzso but an acutely lowered locomotor zzso The acute reduction in locomotor activity was observed after only 3-5 h on zzso The energy intake and energy zzso were increased during the first 24 zzso lower after 72 zzso and zzso between 7 and 14 days on zzso compared with mice given zzso zzso Core body temperature and zzso was increased between 48 and 72 h but zzso after 21 days on zzso These changes paralleled plasma zzso levels and zzso zzso expression in brown zzso zzso After 21 days of zzso energy intake and zzso zzso and body temperature were zzso In contrast, the locomotor activity was reduced and body weight gain was increased over the entire zzso study period on zzso zzso based on the correlation between locomotor activity and zzso in zzso intervals at days zzso indicated that a large portion of the higher body weight gain in the zzso group could be attributed to the reduced locomotor zzso In zzso an acute and zzso decrease in locomotor activity is most important for the effect of zzso on body weight gain and obesity in zzso
