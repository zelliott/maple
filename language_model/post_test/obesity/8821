To investigate the impact of visceral obesity on cholesterol metabolism in zzso offspring of patients with type 2 zzso 

The proportion of zzso fat zzso was measured by abdominal computer zzso and serum cholesterol synthesis and zzso markers were determined by zzso zzso in 109 zzso offspring of patients with type 2 zzso zzso action was measured with the zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) was screened with the zzso zzso zzso analysis and direct zzso 

zzso synthesis markers correlated positively with zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the rates of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso zzso However, serum zzso the first measured precursor of cholesterol zzso showed a positive correlation with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso without any association with subcutaneous fat or insulin zzso Variation in the zzso zzso 1 gene did not explain elevated serum zzso levels in viscerally obese zzso From the cholesterol zzso zzso zzso was associated zzso with zzso and positively with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

High serum zzso levels are associated with visceral obesity but not with subcutaneous zzso Whether this finding is zzso connected to visceral obesity remains to be zzso
