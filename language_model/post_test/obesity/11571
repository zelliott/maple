Under resting conditions obese zzso patients have been described as having a greater cardiac output and lower total peripheral resistance than lean zzso zzso To evaluate the zzso patterns under stress conditions, we determined the zzso response to mental stress zzso zzso and during zzso exercise zzso zzso in zzso patients with a body mass zzso 27 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The cohort exposed to mental stress comprised 54 white male patients (30 were lean, 24 were zzso with zzso stage I or II essential hypertension according to the World Health zzso zzso subjects responded with a higher increase in total peripheral resistance zzso zzso and lower increases in heart rate zzso zzso cardiac output zzso zzso and stroke volume zzso zzso when compared with their lean zzso This was independent of any differences in chemical or baseline zzso characteristics at zzso The cohort exposed to zzso stress consisted of 57 patients (30 were lean, 27 were zzso with World Health Organization stage I or II essential zzso zzso subjects responded with exaggerated increases in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso pressures, and heart rate zzso zzso when compared with lean zzso Body mass index emerged as an independent zzso of the increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso pressure as well as of heart rate zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that obese zzso patients respond to zzso mental stress with zzso instead of the expected zzso and to zzso zzso stress with an exaggerated increase in zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
