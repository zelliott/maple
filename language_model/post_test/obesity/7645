Secondary analysis, zzso zzso 

To zzso compare differences in individual zzso rates among patients with zzso zzso and zzso pain complaints and zzso compare rates based on total number and severity in these same patient zzso 

zzso can impact recovery, zzso and potentially hinder participation in zzso Few studies have compared zzso rates among patients with different anatomical region of pain, to determine whether specific screening is warranted in physical therapy zzso 

Included in the analyses were zzso patients who reported complete zzso clinical, and zzso information using Patient zzso zzso zzso data were collected from the zzso zzso Index (18 zzso and 6 additional zzso to assess the presence of medical disease across multiple body zzso zzso were further classified as zzso or zzso based on inclusion in the zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses investigated differences in the rates of total number and severe zzso zzso ratios zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso were calculated on rates with statistically significant differences zzso using the zzso spine as the reference zzso 

Of the 24 zzso conditions included in this analysis, 3 zzso medical conditions zzso disc disease, zzso and zzso had different rates among anatomical zzso A lower rate for degenerative disc disease was associated with the zzso conditions zzso zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Higher rate of headache zzso zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and lower rate of obesity zzso zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were associated with cervical zzso There were no differences among the 3 anatomical regions for total number or severe zzso 

zzso screening for degenerative disc disease, zzso and headache may be zzso However, the same strategy was not supported for total number or severe zzso at least when considering comparative rates from this zzso Physical therapists should consider the potential influence of total number and severe zzso equally for all anatomical regions of musculoskeletal zzso
