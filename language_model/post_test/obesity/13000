There is incongruity between the sugar consumption guidelines set in different European zzso A number have adopted maximum limits ranging from zzso energy, while others have no quantitative recommendations at zzso This raises the question whether or not there should be a common European zzso for sugar zzso 

This paper examines if such a goal for sugar is merited and reviews the published literature on associations between sugar consumption and dental zzso obesity and zzso zzso 

Evidence showed that higher zzso of sugar were related to zzso not zzso and had no zzso effects on zzso zzso in most zzso In the case of dental zzso there was a relationship between frequency of sugar intake and the zzso of zzso However, in populations where zzso use was adequate, associations between sugar intake and zzso rarely reached statistical zzso 

The available evidence does not justify a common quantitative recommendation for zzso It is suggested that dental zzso merits a more integrated public health approach where advice on the frequency of foods containing zzso is placed in context alongside oral zzso
