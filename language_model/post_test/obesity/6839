Research suggests that people with mental illness frequently have worse physical health than the general zzso Our study sought to investigate the health zzso of mental health consumers in New Zealand, as we hoped that by clearly describing this group more targeted zzso could be zzso 

We surveyed zzso adult mental health consumers about zzso height and weight, fruit and vegetable zzso exercise activity, smoking, alcohol and drug zzso 

We found that mental health consumers zzso from alcohol more often than those from the general population zzso However, we also found increased zzso poorer eating habits, less physical activity, and a higher proportion of smokers among mental health zzso We also found that those who did drink alcohol did so more heavily than drinkers from the general population zzso Finally, there were a number of interesting demographic variations among mental health consumers in terms of their health zzso For example, those in the zzso ethnic group more often consumed an alcoholic drink at least 3 or 4 times a week than those in other ethnic groups, and those in the Pacific group did this less zzso 

Mental health consumers cannot be stereotyped as a single homogeneous group in relation to their health zzso 

Health professionals should strongly encourage engagement from mental health populations to identify their physical health zzso Individual differences in health zzso should not be ignored just because a mental illness is zzso
