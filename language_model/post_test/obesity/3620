zzso is the process that leads to new zzso vessels formation from zzso blood vessels in the presence of appropriate inducing signals, which in zzso conditions such as cancer, may contribute to tumor cells zzso The aim of the present study was to study the role of zzso zzso and insulin in tumor zzso For that, we have zzso the zzso vessels in prostate tumors through their zzso zzso by zzso in zzso prostate tumors induced in different obese mice models zzso zzso and diet induced obese zzso and in normal weight zzso mice zzso zzso vessels density was determined by zzso zzso of prostate zzso while the percentage of the zzso stained area and zzso vessels number were obtained using a zzso computerized zzso zzso zzso and zzso mice presented prostate tumors that were significantly larger zzso than controls, while tumors of zzso mice were significantly smaller zzso zzso expression was significantly higher in prostate tumors of zzso mice compared to tumors of zzso mice zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso correlated with the percentage of the zzso fat and body weight zzso No significantly correlations were found between zzso expression and tumor weight and zzso or insulin plasma zzso Our results suggest that obesity may have a protective effect against prostate cancer dissemination by zzso zzso through a still unidentified mechanism that appears not to involve zzso or zzso
