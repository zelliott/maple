zzso studies have found whole-grain intake to be zzso associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes and heart zzso 

We tested the hypothesis that whole-grain consumption improves insulin sensitivity in overweight and obese zzso 

This controlled experiment compared insulin sensitivity between diets zzso zzso zzso zzso including 6-10 zzso of breakfast cereal, bread, rice, zzso zzso cookies, and snacks of either whole or refined zzso Total energy needs were estimated to maintain body zzso Eleven overweight or obese zzso mass index (in zzso zzso zzso adults aged zzso y participated in a zzso crossover zzso At the end of each zzso diet period, the subjects consumed zzso zzso (12 zzso of a liquid mixed zzso and blood samples were taken over 2 zzso The next day a zzso zzso clamp test was zzso 

zzso insulin was zzso lower during consumption of the whole-grain than during consumption of the zzso diet zzso difference: zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso After the whole-grain diet, the area under the zzso insulin curve tended to be lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than after the zzso zzso The rate of zzso infusion during the final 30 zzso of the clamp test was higher after the whole-grain diet zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso sensitivity may be an important mechanism zzso whole-grain foods reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and heart zzso
