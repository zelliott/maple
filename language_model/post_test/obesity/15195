This study aimed to assess the impact of zzso body mass index zzso on zzso zzso zzso survival zzso and overall survival zzso in patients operated for zzso cell zzso zzso 

The study included zzso patients with zzso values, who underwent surgery for zzso between 1 January 1997 and 31 December zzso zzso patients zzso 30 zzso were compared to non-obese patients zzso zzso zzso in regard to zzso and zzso A Cox zzso hazard model was used for the zzso survival zzso The mean age of the patients was zzso zzso There were 259 males zzso and 325 patients zzso were zzso Mean zzso was 26 zzso 

In the total material, zzso was zzso for obese patients and zzso for non-obese patients zzso zzso zzso The obese group had significantly better zzso in zzso analysis for presumed radically treated disease zzso zzso was a significant protective zzso factor in zzso zzso An accelerating protective effect for zzso was found with increasing levels of zzso In regard to zzso no difference was found between the two zzso zzso patients had a significantly lower age, and a higher rate of diabetes zzso hypertension and incidental zzso zzso patients had a significantly higher total zzso of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso 

In this material, increasing zzso was associated with improved zzso for presumed radically treated zzso However, obese patients had a higher total rate of zzso zzso
