Women who are overweight or obese before pregnancy zzso for shorter zzso than do zzso zzso These shorter zzso may place infants of overweight and obese women at risk of not receiving the benefits of zzso which may include a reduced risk of overweight later in zzso 

We examined how maternal zzso body mass index zzso in zzso and infant feeding pattern are associated with infant weight zzso 

In this zzso zzso study, we used multiple zzso analyses adjusted for potential zzso factors to examine these associations among zzso zzso zzso from the Danish National Birth zzso 

In multiple zzso zzso increasing maternal zzso zzso decreasing zzso of zzso and earlier complementary food introduction were associated with increased infant weight zzso An interaction was identified for short zzso of zzso zzso zzso Earlier complementary food introduction zzso zzso was associated with greater infant weight zzso however, the timing of complementary food introduction did not increase infant weight gain at longer zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso In this sample, zzso obesity zzso or zzso zzso short zzso of zzso and earlier introduction of complementary food were associated with zzso zzso of additional weight gain during zzso 

zzso weight gain is associated with maternal zzso zzso and with an interaction between the duration of zzso and the timing of complementary food zzso Future investigations of the effects of zzso on infant weight gain should account for all of these zzso
