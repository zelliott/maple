The purpose of this work was to determine if CT measurement of the distribution of abdominal zzso tissue is zzso between observers and is associated with patient risk of significant coronary artery zzso 

We compared 11 male patients having abdominal CT who had a history of significant coronary artery disease and 9 male patients having abdominal CT without a history of coronary artery zzso Two observers, at the level of the zzso independently measured the ratio of visceral zzso tissue zzso to total abdominal zzso tissue zzso zzso is equal to the sum total of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso equals the sum total of visceral and subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso were made using a standard software zzso 

The mean ratio of zzso to zzso was significantly different zzso zzso between patients with a history of coronary artery disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso range zzso zzso and without a history of coronary artery disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso range zzso zzso zzso in zzso between observers was excellent zzso difference zzso zzso range zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso 

The measurement of the zzso ratio is highly zzso between observers, and a high ratio is associated with patient risk of significant coronary artery zzso
