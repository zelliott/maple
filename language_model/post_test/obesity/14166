Development of zzso insulin resistance and diabetes zzso type 2 has been linked to zzso of zzso pathways in the liver, leading to impaired insulin signal zzso To further define the role of zzso zzso zzso in this process, we have analyzed zzso metabolism in mice with zzso zzso of the zzso essential zzso gene zzso zzso exposed to a high-fat diet zzso These animals are protected from the development of zzso insulin resistance, highlighting the importance of zzso zzso zzso in this zzso However, zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso in the development of liver zzso as a consequence of decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso interacts with increased zzso causing elevated zzso in the zzso of these mice under zzso These changes result in liver zzso of zzso mice under normal diet, a process that is largely aggravated when these mice are exposed to zzso These data directly demonstrate the interaction of zzso zzso dietary zzso and metabolism in the development of liver zzso
