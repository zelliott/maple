zzso U zzso is an zzso zzso whose role in the regulation of feeding and energy zzso is well zzso Two zzso receptors have been zzso zzso expressed primarily in the zzso and zzso expressed predominantly in the zzso We recently demonstrated that acute peripheral administration of zzso exerts potent but acute zzso activity and can improve zzso zzso with both actions zzso by zzso Here, we describe the development of a metabolically stable analog of zzso based on zzso of the native zzso with high molecular weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso size, site of attachment, and zzso chemistry were zzso to yield an analog which displays robust and long-lasting zzso activity and significant zzso activity in zzso Studies in zzso zzso mice showed that zzso displays an expanded pharmacological profile, with the ability to engage zzso in addition to zzso In light of these data, zzso derivatives of zzso represent promising candidates for the treatment of obesity and zzso
