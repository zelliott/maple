zzso sleeve zzso zzso is a popular zzso procedure for treating zzso zzso This study aimed to investigate the relation between zzso and zzso metabolism in an obese diabetic rat zzso 

zzso male zzso diabetic fatty zzso rats were divided into three groups: zzso zzso control, gastric zzso zzso and zzso Six weeks after surgery, zzso zzso including plasma zzso level, small zzso transit, zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the liver, skeletal muscle and white zzso zzso and that of zzso in white zzso zzso and zzso zzso contents in the liver and skeletal muscle were zzso 

zzso parameters in the zzso and zzso groups were significantly improved compared with those in the SO zzso However, plasma total cholesterol zzso and free fatty acid zzso zzso were significantly lower while the plasma zzso level was significantly higher in the zzso group than in the zzso and SO zzso In addition, small zzso transit time was significantly shorter in the zzso group than in the other two zzso Furthermore, in the zzso group, zzso expression of zzso in the liver and skeletal muscle and that of zzso and zzso in white zzso tissue were significantly higher, while zzso in the liver and skeletal muscle were significantly lower, compared with those in the other two zzso 

These results suggest that zzso improves zzso metabolism compared with zzso although there were no significant differences in the effect on weight loss between the two zzso
