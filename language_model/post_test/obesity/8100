The fat mass and obesity associated zzso gene is related to zzso but the regulation of zzso expression in zzso tissue is not fully zzso We investigated zzso expression in paired subcutaneous and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from healthy women undergoing zzso zzso and its relation with zzso and insulin zzso 

zzso expression in SAT of type 2 diabetic patients treated or not with zzso was also zzso 

Both the zzso and protein levels of zzso were higher in zzso from women than in zzso Only zzso zzso protein levels zzso correlated with zzso and body fat mass, whereas SAT zzso zzso levels were zzso correlated with subcutaneous fat zzso In addition, SAT zzso zzso and protein levels were increased in insulin resistant women zzso zzso compared to insulin sensitive women zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso expression was not different between these two zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso levels were increased in SAT of type 2 diabetic patients, and treatment of diabetics with zzso improved insulin sensitivity and reduced SAT zzso zzso zzso Lastly, zzso expression was zzso increased in the early phase of zzso cell zzso which zzso with the induction of zzso zzso However, partial reduction of zzso did not impact zzso expression and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso gene expression is higher in zzso than in SAT in lean to moderately obese zzso zzso zzso expression is associated with zzso whereas SAT zzso expression is associated with insulin zzso These associations are independent of an effect of zzso on zzso zzso
