zzso 3 zzso is a member of the zzso family, which includes zzso zzso and zzso Recently, zzso was shown to prevent the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso To test the role of zzso in zzso and related traits, 2 independent lines of human zzso transgenic zzso mice on the zzso zzso background were zzso Human zzso zzso was detected in various zzso including liver, zzso zzso brain, zzso and zzso of both lines of zzso zzso The human zzso zzso levels in the zzso of zzso zzso mice were zzso to zzso higher as compared with the zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso Human zzso protein and activity were detected in the zzso of zzso mice as zzso No significant differences in plasma total, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cholesterol and zzso and zzso levels were observed between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso areas were significantly smaller in both lines of male zzso zzso mice as compared with the male zzso zzso on B6 background fed an zzso zzso When bred onto the zzso zzso zzso knockout mouse background, the male zzso zzso mice also exhibited decreased zzso zzso areas and decreased expression of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso as compared with the male zzso zzso In addition, decreased zzso and lower circulating zzso levels were observed in both lines of male zzso zzso mice as compared with the male zzso zzso In an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels zzso correlated with zzso and related zzso Our study demonstrates that elevated zzso expression significantly decreases zzso zzso formation and zzso in male zzso zzso may play an important role in protection against obesity and zzso
