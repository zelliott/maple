Physical activity is associated with better health, but many individuals are insufficiently zzso zzso the built environment may be an approach capable of influencing zzso levels of physical activity, but few data exist from zzso studies that can minimize bias from active people choosing zzso zzso 

This study aims to examine zzso and zzso associations between the built environment and physical activity on a large zzso 

This study examined zzso associations between urban sprawl zzso addresses to corresponding zzso and physical activity zzso among men throughout the zzso in 1993 and in 1988, and zzso associations between changes in exposure to urban sprawl for movers and physical activity, zzso Included were zzso men zzso age, 70 zzso in the 1993 zzso study; zzso men in the 1988 zzso study; and zzso men in the zzso study, zzso Data were collected zzso in 1988 and 1993, and analyses were performed in zzso 

In zzso zzso less sprawl was significantly associated with more walking zzso comparing least with most sprawling areas, for meeting physical activity recommendations by zzso zzso zzso zzso in 1993 and zzso zzso zzso in zzso Less sprawl also was associated with lower prevalence of overweight zzso zzso zzso zzso in 1993 and zzso zzso zzso in zzso However, zzso analyses assessing change did not show that decreasing sprawl was associated with increased physical activity or decreased zzso 

These findings suggest that the zzso results may reflect zzso rather than indicating that the built zzso measured by urban zzso physical zzso However, the zzso findings were limited by small numbers of men changing residence and associated sprawl zzso
