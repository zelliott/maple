The zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso has increased rapidly in the zzso particularly among African zzso Despite a well-established link between obesity and zzso the mechanism through which obesity increases cancer risk has yet to be zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso may link obesity and cancer, with different quantitative effects by zzso 

We evaluated the association between zzso and zzso zzso and zzso risk among Caucasians zzso cases, zzso zzso and African Americans zzso cases, zzso zzso in a zzso study conducted in Detroit and zzso zzso ratios zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso were estimated using unconditional zzso zzso 

Among controls, Caucasians had higher median zzso than African Americans zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and lower median zzso than African Americans zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso Among zzso the zzso for zzso comparing the highest zzso to the lowest zzso zzso zzso of zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso for males and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso was not significantly associated with zzso among African American males zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or females zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Higher zzso was associated with zzso risk among African American males zzso zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso and females zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not significantly among Caucasian males zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and females zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We observed an association between both zzso and zzso zzso and risk of zzso which may differ by zzso Confirmation in further investigations is zzso
