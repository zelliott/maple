In Korea, zzso zzso leaves have been traditionally administered as natural therapeutic agent for the alleviating zzso and zzso 

The present study was performed to evaluate zzso hormone zzso zzso 1 zzso antagonism of the ethanol extract of zzso zzso leaves zzso and its zzso effect in zzso obese zzso zzso 

The binding affinity of zzso for the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso the function of zzso zzso receptors expressed in zzso cells, and the zzso effects in zzso mice were zzso 

zzso zzso binding studies zzso zzso exhibited a potent zzso activity with zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also inhibited the zzso calcium zzso with the zzso zzso receptors expressed in zzso zzso In an zzso study with zzso mice, zzso oral administrations of zzso for 32 consecutive days produced a zzso decrease in body weight and zzso zzso zzso 

These results suggest that chronic treatment with zzso exerts an zzso effect in zzso mice, and its direct zzso zzso antagonism may contribute to decrease body zzso
