The level of insulin after an overnight fast zzso in 37 obese and zzso male subjects with normal and abnormal zzso tolerance was directly related to the increase in insulin concentration during a 3 zzso 100 g oral zzso tolerance zzso zzso but not diabetes, was associated with an zzso of this zzso insulin zzso Thus obesity predicted with the magnitude of the insulin response to zzso zzso When the individual insulin values were expressed as per cent change from the zzso level, this effect of obesity was zzso The insulin levels of all subjects with normal zzso tolerance promptly rose zzso and reached peak values 1 zzso after oral zzso In contrast, the diabetic response (as per cent zzso was markedly reduced during the 1st zzso and zzso (but still zzso insulin levels were not attained until 2 zzso In all subjects the insulin response zzso by calculation of the area circumscribed by a plot of the per cent change in insulin with zzso showed a significant inverse correlation with the zzso zzso Thus increasing degrees of zzso intolerance were associated with decreasing insulin zzso zzso levels of insulin, in both the zzso state and in response to zzso were related to zzso
