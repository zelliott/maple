To investigate the relationship between pediatric zzso media with zzso and zzso as determined by body mass index zzso zzso as weight in zzso divided by height in meters zzso and serum zzso zzso and total cholesterol zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso 

The experimental group comprised 155 children aged 2 to 7 years, who received unilateral or bilateral ventilation tube zzso for the treatment of zzso media with zzso The control group comprised 118 children with no history of zzso media with zzso who underwent operations for conditions other than ear zzso Based on zzso and serum zzso and zzso zzso we divided the experimental group into 2 subgroups, those who were and were not zzso 

We determined the difference between the experimental and control groups in zzso and serum zzso and zzso zzso and the difference between the obese and zzso zzso in frequency of ventilation tube zzso 

Mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mean zzso zzso zzso level zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not mean serum zzso level zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control zzso zzso of ventilation tube zzso however, did not differ significantly between the obese and zzso subgroups, whether divided by zzso zzso zzso zzso or serum zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Childhood obesity may be associated with the occurrence of zzso media with zzso
