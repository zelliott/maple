zzso of zzso stem cells into terminally differentiated zzso zzso zzso through regulated zzso zzso While it is clear that the late zzso of zzso maturation are governed by the nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso less is known about the zzso control of the initial stages of zzso To identify early regulators, we performed a small interfering zzso zzso screen of zzso genes in zzso and show here for the first time that the winged zzso factor zzso promotes zzso differentiation by cooperating with zzso and zzso to zzso induce zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that mice with genetic zzso of zzso have a selective decrease in zzso fat depot and a zzso zzso to induce zzso specifically in their visceral zzso In obese subjects, zzso is zzso expressed in visceral and subcutaneous zzso zzso Overall, our study implicates zzso in the regulation of zzso differentiation and zzso zzso tissue zzso
