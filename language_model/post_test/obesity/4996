Plasma zzso zzso are largely determined by zzso tissue zzso zzso suppression of zzso is commonly impaired with insulin resistance and improves with zzso treatment of type 2 zzso The present studies were designed to assess the effects of zzso on zzso zzso metabolism that are independent of improved zzso zzso 

We measured plasma zzso concentration and flux zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso before and after zzso (30 zzso for approximately 20 weeks) in 20 zzso adults with upper body zzso To assess the effects of improved insulin sensitivity per zzso we performed the same zzso in a matched group of volunteers treated with zzso Half of the two groups underwent these zzso during a zzso zzso and the other half had their zzso taken during a zzso saline infusion before and after the zzso 

Both interventions increased zzso zzso disposal and reduced plasma zzso zzso during the insulin zzso After zzso zzso flux decreased zzso during the insulin clamp and zzso clearance remained unchanged zzso whereas in the zzso group, zzso flux during the clamp was unchanged zzso and zzso clearance increased zzso zzso clearance in the saline control condition was increased in the zzso group compared with the zzso group zzso 

In zzso zzso adults, zzso increases zzso clearance during zzso zzso whereas improved insulin sensitivity achieved by zzso does not alter zzso clearance but enhances insulin suppression of zzso zzso This action of zzso may contribute to improved zzso metabolism in type 2 zzso
