Evidence from animals models of zzso zzso the zzso zzso and from studies in man are consistent with the zzso regulation of brown tissue being one of the principal pathways involved in the normal zzso regulation of energy zzso Studies in man on other components of the sympathetic nervous system do not suggest generalized zzso abnormalities in obese zzso Patients placed on a reduced zzso intake show a fall in zzso rate, a reduction in cardiovascular zzso of sympathetic activity and a fall in zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect is accompanied by a precipitous fall in zzso acid zzso These changes are not nearly so evident in those obese patients who are also zzso so there may be altered control of zzso metabolism in obese zzso zzso
