Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that zzso in the function of the zzso nervous system play an important role in the development of zzso zzso zzso below the zzso reverses the zzso In diabetic rats cured of their diabetes with transplants of fetal pancreatic tissue beneath the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso do not produce the characteristic rise in food intake nor do they significantly increase serum zzso These observations indicate that the zzso following zzso zzso is the result of neural connections rather than from a circulating zzso factor released following zzso zzso The smaller zzso zzso reduced level of zzso and impaired zzso of fatty acids during stress in zzso zzso rats point to reduced activity of the sympathetic nervous zzso The impaired zzso of fat from zzso zzso in zzso zzso rats during zzso is similar to the effect of sympathetic zzso of the zzso fat zzso Similarly, unilateral zzso caused an increased weight gain in rats almost as much as unilateral zzso zzso but significantly less than in zzso zzso zzso These studies with zzso and feeding zzso the zzso in the control of the sympathetic nervous zzso When zzso and zzso were given to zzso zzso rats, there was a significant depression in zzso and zzso levels of zzso Finally when zzso zzso were placed after lateral zzso zzso the effect of the zzso zzso did not seem to be reduced, suggesting that the two effects are zzso A model dealing with the effects of zzso zzso is presented in an attempt to integrate these zzso
