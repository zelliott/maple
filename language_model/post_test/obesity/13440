Factor analysis is a zzso correlation technique that is frequently employed to zzso the zzso of zzso zzso which zzso the zzso syndrome in zzso of individuals with different zzso To our knowledge, it has never been used to identify the components of this syndrome in obese zzso The purpose of this study was to use factor analysis to investigate the zzso of features, which zzso the zzso syndrome, in a cohort of zzso obese women aged zzso years zzso body mass zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Principal component analysis reduced ten correlated zzso zzso to four zzso factors that explained zzso of the zzso in the original zzso These factors were interpreted zzso zzso an insulin resistance factor, with positive loading of zzso serum insulin and zzso model assessment of insulin zzso zzso a zzso zzso factor, with positive loading of zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso ratio, and inverse loading of high density zzso zzso zzso a body mass factor, with positive loading of body mass and waist zzso and zzso a blood pressure factor, with positive loading of zzso and zzso blood zzso 

The identification of four independent factors is consistent with previous findings among samples of different populations and may also support, in obese women, the hypothesis that multiple zzso zzso are responsible for the abnormalities underlying the zzso zzso Nonetheless, findings in this cohort of obese women suggest that the absolute degree of zzso is not correlated with any tested component of the zzso syndrome, but that the relative fat distribution is highly correlated with the development of zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, insulin resistance appears to be a major factor in obese individuals, independent of other zzso and zzso zzso
