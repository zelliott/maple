The relationship between excess abdominal zzso zzso zzso and cardiovascular health risk has zzso interest in the efficacy of physical activity in specifically zzso this zzso zzso The evolution of imaging techniques has enabled more direct measurement of changes in abdominal and visceral zzso The purpose of this summary was to systematically review the relationship between physical activity and abdominal zzso 

Database searches were performed on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from 1985 to 2005 with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso controlled trials zzso and eight zzso controlled trials were zzso In zzso using imaging techniques to measure change in abdominal fat in overweight or obese subjects, seven out of 10 studies (including three trials with type 2 zzso reported significant reductions compared with zzso zzso in visceral and total abdominal fat may occur in the absence of changes in body mass and waist zzso zzso ratio is not a sensitive measure of change in regional zzso in exercise zzso No studies zzso the Consolidated zzso of Reporting Trials zzso zzso criteria for the highest quality of zzso zzso however, many studies were in progress or published before the opportunity to comply with these zzso zzso limited evidence from a number of studies suggests a beneficial influence of physical activity on reduction in abdominal and visceral fat in overweight and obese subjects when imaging techniques are used to zzso changes in abdominal zzso More rigorous studies are needed to confirm these zzso
