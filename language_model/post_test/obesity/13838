zzso zzso Y zzso profoundly enhances feeding when injected zzso or directly into zzso zzso such as the zzso nucleus zzso Paradoxically, zzso has a reduced action on feeding in obese zzso rats relative to lean zzso rats, although the obese rats have much higher levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are sensitive to zzso Here, we tested the hypothesis that the blunted eating response to zzso observed in obese zzso rats will be reflected in a reduced zzso action at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recordings made from zzso zzso in acute brain slices of lean and obese zzso rats revealed zzso zzso zzso currents zzso responses which were inhibited by zzso While the maximum response in the obese zzso rats was significantly less than in lean zzso or zzso rats, there was no difference in the zzso zzso zzso using blocking zzso of zzso or zzso zzso revealed no differences between lean and obese zzso rats in the contributions of either of these receptors to the total zzso response in zzso zzso zzso is less effective at the zzso zzso zzso in obese than in lean zzso zzso This is not associated with a change in the proportion of zzso or zzso receptors zzso the zzso response, and is consistent with the zzso of zzso receptors or a reduction in zzso zzso and with the reduced sensitivity of obese rats to zzso
