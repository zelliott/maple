We have demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso however, whether zzso zzso affect zzso metabolism in obesity is still zzso The present study aimed to determine the effects of zzso zzso on zzso risk in obese zzso 

A total of zzso subjects with zzso and zzso with normal zzso zzso were zzso by body mass index zzso into normal weight, overweight or obesity zzso After zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 7 were determined in the zzso zzso lipids and zzso as well as zzso body weight and waist circumference were zzso The zzso and zzso characteristics of the zzso subjects were re-evaluated 3 years zzso 

There were no zzso or zzso distribution differences for the zzso or zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso and G zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group were higher than the zzso group zzso After stratification, in obese subjects, the zzso zzso distribution of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group was significantly higher than in the zzso group zzso and showed an increased risk of zzso at baseline zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso was associated with increased risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso subjects revealed significantly increased serum zzso levels in obese zzso versus zzso carriers zzso 

These results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso is associated with increased risk of zzso especially in obese Chinese, and may be a potential genetic predictor of diseases related to zzso
