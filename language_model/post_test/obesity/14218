Physical activity zzso begins to decline in adolescence with a zzso increase in zzso We hypothesized that a vicious circle may arise between decreasing PA and weight gain from adolescence to early zzso 

PA and zzso physical fitness assessed in adolescents zzso years of zzso were used to predict the development of obesity zzso or zzso zzso and abdominal obesity zzso zzso in females zzso or zzso zzso in zzso at age 25 in zzso twin individuals zzso of twins born in Finland, zzso Ten 25-year-old zzso zzso twin pairs who were zzso for obesity (with a 16 zzso weight zzso were then carefully evaluated for current PA zzso a zzso zzso total energy expenditure zzso assessed by means of the doubly labeled water zzso zzso and zzso zzso rate zzso assessed by indirect zzso 

Physical zzso in adolescence strongly predicted the risk for obesity zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and abdominal obesity zzso zzso at age 25, even after adjusting for baseline and current zzso Poor physical fitness in adolescence also increased the risk for overall obesity zzso zzso and abdominal obesity zzso zzso in zzso Physical zzso was both zzso and secondary to the development of obesity zzso in the zzso zzso zzso did not differ between the zzso zzso PA was lower whereas zzso was higher in the obese zzso 

Physical zzso in adolescence strongly and independently predicts total (and zzso abdominal obesity in young adulthood, favoring the development of a zzso vicious circle of obesity and physical zzso Physical activity should therefore be seriously recommended for obesity prevention in the zzso
