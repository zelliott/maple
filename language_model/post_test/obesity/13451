Whether dietary fat influences the interaction between liver fat, visceral zzso tissue zzso and zzso risk is zzso Thus, we sought to determine the independent associations between 1 and 10 d dietary fat zzso liver fat, and zzso on insulin sensitivity using a zzso zzso Liver fat score zzso was assessed by zzso zzso and zzso by magnetic resonance imaging in 42 zzso obese older zzso zzso sensitivity was measured by the zzso clamp zzso Diet composition was determined from zzso diet records for 1 and 10 d preceding the assessment of zzso zzso was positively associated with the 10 d average fat and alcohol zzso but not with any 1 d average dietary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were both zzso correlated with insulin sensitivity zzso zzso When zzso and zzso were entered in the same model, only zzso was an independent predictor of insulin sensitivity zzso zzso Control for the average 10 d alcohol consumption and fat intake improved the association between insulin sensitivity and zzso (from r zzso zzso zzso zzso to r zzso zzso p zzso but not zzso In fact, after control for the 10 d dietary zzso both zzso and zzso were independent zzso of insulin sensitivity zzso zzso This was not true for any of the 1 d dietary intake zzso In conclusion, liver fat is associated with dietary fat intake and alcohol consumption over 10 zzso but not 1 zzso Furthermore, dietary habits may influence the relationship between liver fat and insulin zzso
