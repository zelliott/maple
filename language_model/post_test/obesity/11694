We determined the in zzso effects of zzso on insulin resistance induced by zzso zzso as well as that observed in zzso fatty zzso rats, using zzso clamp technique to measure zzso zzso zzso and percent suppression of zzso zzso output zzso to evaluate insulin zzso Male zzso rats were treated with zzso zzso zzso for 7 zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso was zzso orally for the same period at 10 and 200 zzso zzso zzso 5 and 20 zzso of insulin infusion rates zzso were zzso The Gu levels at clamp zzso at zzso in rats treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly lower than those in control rats zzso zzso zzso The Gu levels at the same zzso in rats zzso with P zzso zzso zzso and T zzso zzso zzso were slightly but significantly higher than that in rat treated with zzso zzso at zzso in control rats zzso zzso zzso was decreased by zzso treatment zzso zzso This decrease was slightly but significantly ameliorated by addition of T zzso zzso zzso The Gu levels at zzso in zzso rats zzso zzso zzso were decreased significantly from that in lean zzso of zzso zzso rats zzso zzso zzso This zzso of Gu increase was completely ameliorated with administration of P zzso or T zzso The zzso at zzso in zzso rats zzso zzso zzso was significantly decreased from that in zzso zzso Administration of P or T ameliorated this decrease zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso insulin resistance by mechanisms different from those in zzso zzso hence zzso administration can be only partially useful to treat insulin resistance induced by zzso
