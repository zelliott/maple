zzso is an independent risk factor for a variety of diseases, including zzso morbidity and zzso zzso is associated with a zzso state that could affect the zzso inflammatory response and increase risk of organ zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between obesity and zzso multiple organ failure zzso 

A prospective zzso study of patients at risk for zzso zzso zzso criteria were age older than 15 years, zzso zzso zzso 15, zzso admission within 24 hours of injury, and survival longer than 48 hours after zzso zzso head injuries were zzso zzso dysfunction was assessed using the Denver multiple organ failure zzso 

Data were collected on zzso severely injured patients, zzso were men and zzso were victims of blunt zzso There was no relationship between body mass index and injury severity or the amount of blood zzso within 12 hours of zzso zzso zzso was observed in 123 of zzso zzso zzso patients and 56 of 152 zzso obese zzso zzso was independently associated with zzso zzso ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso after adjusting for patient age, injury severity, and amount of blood zzso during zzso In this study population, obesity was also associated with increased length of zzso and hospital stay but not zzso 

zzso patients are at increased risk of zzso zzso Study of the zzso inflammatory profile could provide additional insight into the zzso of organ dysfunction and identify therapeutic targets for both obese and zzso zzso Increased morbidity and length of stay in obese trauma patients implies greater resource allocation for this zzso
