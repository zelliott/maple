zzso is a zzso zzso predominantly produced by the zzso There are several studies that suggest the importance of zzso in zzso However, the pancreatic zzso response to zzso in obesity is unclear at zzso The aim of this study was to clarify whether zzso administration influences zzso and insulin levels in obese zzso 

Six obese female patients zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Three tests were done: zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso and growth zzso hormone zzso 1 zzso zzso plus zzso (1 zzso zzso Blood samples were taken at appropriate intervals for determination of zzso and zzso zzso analyses were performed by zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso peak, zzso level after zzso administration was zzso zzso zzso zzso level after the administration of zzso was zzso zzso zzso not significantly different from the response after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso level after the administration of zzso plus zzso was zzso zzso zzso not significantly different from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso peak, zzso level after zzso administration was zzso zzso zzso zzso level after the administration of zzso was zzso zzso zzso not significantly different from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso level after the administration of zzso plus zzso was zzso zzso zzso not significantly different from the response after zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In female obese patients, we did not find significant differences in zzso or insulin levels following zzso or zzso plus zzso zzso
