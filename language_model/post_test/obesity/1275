zzso visceral fat zzso is considered a risk factor for diabetes, zzso zzso profiles and zzso However, little is known about the genetic contribution to zzso as compared to total body zzso 

zzso was assessed by computerized zzso and total body fat zzso zzso was assessed by underwater weighing in 86 families participating in the Heritage Family zzso All family members were sedentary at baseline zzso The familial factors underlying the zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso fat mass, were assessed using a familial correlation zzso 

The zzso zzso (including genetic and familial environmental zzso for zzso was comparable before zzso and after zzso adjusting for fat mass, and was zzso for fat mass itself in these sedentary zzso zzso correlations were significant for fat mass and for zzso prior to, but not after, adjustment for fat zzso 

These results confirm the only previous study which investigated the familial zzso of zzso (both in pattern and zzso suggesting that the factors underlying zzso in these sedentary families may be similar to those in the population at zzso Although both genetic and familial environmental factors probably influence each of fat mass and zzso there appears to be a predominantly genetic zzso for the visceral component which is independent of total body zzso These findings imply that some individuals are more at risk then others because of an inherited tendency to store abdominal fat viscerally rather than zzso
