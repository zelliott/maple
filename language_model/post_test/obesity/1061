zzso zzso zzso content of liver and skeletal muscle contributes to insulin resistance, and a significant correlation exists between zzso content and the development of insulin zzso Because zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso for liver fatty acid zzso and a key regulator of muscle fatty acid zzso we examined whether zzso plays a role in the zzso of zzso zzso We also determined the potential role of zzso protein zzso zzso in this process, since it can zzso and inhibit zzso activity in both liver and zzso zzso content, zzso and zzso were examined in the liver and skeletal muscle of zzso zzso rats during the time frame when insulin resistance zzso At 12 weeks of age, there was a zzso zzso in liver zzso content and a zzso zzso in skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was significantly elevated in zzso zzso rats compared with lean zzso controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively), even though zzso activity was also zzso The observed increase in zzso zzso activity was accompanied by a zzso increase in zzso protein zzso There were no significant differences in zzso activity, zzso protein zzso or zzso activity in the skeletal muscle of the zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso zzso rats with zzso 16 (an zzso zzso zzso resulted in a decrease in zzso zzso and zzso activities, but had no effect on skeletal muscle zzso and zzso Our data suggest that zzso in zzso or zzso activity in muscle do not contribute to the development of insulin zzso However, increased liver zzso activity in the zzso rat appears to contribute to the development of zzso zzso although this increase does not appear to occur secondary to a decrease in zzso zzso
