zzso women convert circulatory zzso steroids to zzso In order to study the possible role of such zzso in zzso cancer, the determination of the fractional conversion of circulation zzso to zzso was zzso However, in the course of this work it became apparent that the mathematical model upon which this determination is based does not adequately represent the true zzso zzso The reasons for the zzso of the model are not apparent, although they seem to bear some relationship to zzso The direction and magnitude of the zzso of the values; determined from the true values are zzso The values for the apparent fractional conversion of zzso to zzso in 9 zzso women with zzso cancer are strongly correlated with values zzso of zzso These values also correlate well with values for the apparent rate of production of zzso in our 9 patients and also in 5 zzso patients with zzso bleeding reported in the literature, but no such correlation is evident for zzso women without zzso zzso reported in the zzso The range of values for both the apparent fractional conversion and the apparent rate of production of zzso are similar to those reported by other workers using the same zzso However, the data suggest that women with zzso cancer may produce zzso by a zzso not involving circulating zzso
