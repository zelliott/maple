This report analyzes two kinds of studies of human energy zzso direct and indirect zzso for 24-hr zzso and complete zzso of food zzso waste, and tissue storage for 3 weeks and zzso zzso of energy balance are written to show that the daily quantity of zzso energy, zzso is coupled with an unidentified quantity of zzso energy, zzso in order to make the equation zzso The equations challenge the assumed zzso of direct and indirect zzso The analysis takes the form of employing experimental data to calculate values for the arguable zzso zzso Studies employing 24-hr direct zzso 202 complete days, show that when food intake nearly matches zzso values for zzso are small and probably zzso but when there is a large food deficit, large positive values for zzso zzso zzso are also made from studies of zzso balance during prolonged zzso and zzso and in nearly all cases there were large negative values for zzso In 52 sets of data from studies lasting 3 weeks or longer, where all the terms in the balance equation except zzso were either directly measured or could be readily estimated, the average value for zzso amounts to zzso zzso or zzso of zzso A discussion of the nature of zzso considers error and the zzso of small quantities like the energy of zzso zzso which are not thought to be sufficient to explain zzso It might represent the cost of zzso stored fuel, or of storing excess fuel, or it might represent a change in internal energy other than fuel stores, but none of these is thought to be zzso Finally, it is emphasized that zzso exchange in man as an open zzso system is not presently included in the equations of energy balance, and perhaps it must be, even though it is not directly zzso The significance of zzso energy is considered in light of the poor control of zzso of the inability to predict weight change during prolonged diet restriction or intentional zzso and of the zzso of tissue gain in growth and loss in zzso It is not even well established how much food man requires to maintain constant zzso New studies as they are undertaken should try to account completely for all the possible terms of energy zzso
