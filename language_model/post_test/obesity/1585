The prevalence of obesity has increased dramatically over the past zzso Gene copy number zzso zzso have been recognized as a zzso source of zzso in human complex diseases including zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso helper integration site 1 zzso gene has a significant contribution in the zzso regulation in mouse models of zzso A study was therefore carried out to investigate whether zzso in zzso gene contribute to human zzso 

We analyzed samples from 70 Chinese overweight adults and 74 healthy controls for DNA copy number change using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso of zzso was achieved by real-time zzso using the zzso zzso 

Copy number gain analysis revealed significant gains zzso of zzso gene copy number in 17 of 70 zzso samples but only four of 74 zzso controls zzso Then we studied the frequency distribution of zzso in zzso gene according to body mass index zzso zzso Five out of 28 zzso zzso obese, six out of 26 zzso moderate obese, and six out of 17 zzso severe obese subjects studied showed increased zzso gene copy zzso 

The result suggested that there was a significant linear trend for increasing zzso gene copy number zzso with increasing zzso
