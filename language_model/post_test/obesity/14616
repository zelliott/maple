The aim of this study was to investigate effect of loss weight on P wave zzso in obese zzso 

After a zzso weight loss program zzso and medical zzso a total of 30 (24 women and six zzso obese subjects who had lost at least zzso of their original weight were included in the present zzso All subjects underwent a routine standard zzso surface zzso zzso were transferred to a personal computer by a scanner and then magnified 400 times by zzso zzso software zzso Systems, Mountain View, zzso P wave zzso which is also defined as the difference between the maximum P wave duration and the minimum P wave zzso was also zzso 

After a zzso weight loss program, zzso zzso zzso maximum P wave duration zzso zzso and P wave zzso zzso zzso significantly zzso The mean percentage of weight loss was zzso zzso to zzso The decrease in the level of P wave zzso (21 zzso 10 and 7 zzso 12 zzso p zzso was more prominent in Group II zzso loss of their original zzso than Group I zzso loss of their original zzso after the weight loss zzso A statistically significant correlation between decrease in the level of P wave zzso and percentage of weight loss was found zzso zzso zzso p zzso 

zzso weight loss in obese subjects is associated with a decrease of P wave duration and zzso zzso these observations suggest that substantial weight loss is associated with improvement in zzso zzso abnormalities in obese zzso
