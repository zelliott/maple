zzso lifestyle and a western diet promote zzso zzso zzso and subsequently zzso The aim of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of the zzso drug zzso to improve zzso by reducing systemic inflammation in obese adults at risk for the development of type 2 zzso 

In a zzso zzso controlled trial, we evaluated 20 obese zzso adults at baseline and after 1 month of zzso or zzso 

Compared with zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso response after an oral zzso challenge zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although insulin levels were zzso zzso and oral zzso tolerance test zzso levels decreased in the zzso subjects compared with zzso zzso zzso consistent with improved insulin sensitivity and a known effect of zzso to inhibit insulin zzso zzso increased 57% after zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso Additionally, within the group of zzso subjects, circulating levels of zzso protein were reduced by zzso zzso zzso 

This zzso study demonstrates that zzso reduces zzso and may improve inflammatory cardiovascular risk indexes in overweight zzso These data support the hypothesis that zzso inflammation contributes to the zzso of zzso zzso and that targeting inflammation may provide a therapeutic route for diabetes zzso
