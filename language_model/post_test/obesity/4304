zzso zzso zzso is a long-standing disease with zzso and often zzso formation, predominantly in the zzso and zzso The disease is difficult to treat and has a severe impact on quality of zzso A clinically relevant system for scoring disease severity is lacking in zzso 

To evaluate the modified zzso zzso zzso zzso and to study the impact of body mass index zzso and smoking habits on disease zzso 

Two hundred and zzso consecutive patients with HS referred to a clinic with special interest in the disease were included, of whom 115 were zzso Points were given for regions involved, types of zzso zzso zzso total area involved and whether zzso were separated by normal zzso zzso characteristics included zzso and smoking zzso Two hundred and zzso patients completed the zzso Life Quality Index zzso 

The median zzso range, zzso zzso for all patients was 38 zzso women 38 zzso and men 37 zzso Median zzso zzso for smokers was 41 zzso former smokers 27 zzso and nonsmokers 22 zzso Median zzso zzso for patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso was 32 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 44 zzso and zzso or zzso 30 zzso zzso 50 zzso Mean zzso zzso zzso for the whole group of patients was zzso zzso zzso median 9, and showed no significant differences between the groups zzso There was a significant positive correlation of fair degree between zzso and zzso There were significant differences in zzso between nonsmokers and smokers as well as between women of normal weight compared with obese zzso 

The modified zzso is simple and practical and it extracts important clinical zzso A connection between disease severity and zzso as well as smoking habits in patients with HS is zzso The results suggest that the zzso may be a relevant outcome measure in future therapeutic trials in zzso
