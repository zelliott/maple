The aim of present study was to investigate the zzso effect of zzso zzso extract and its molecular mechanism in rats rendered obese by a high-fat diet zzso zzso zzso extract supplementation significantly lowered body weight, visceral zzso zzso blood and zzso zzso zzso insulin, and zzso levels of rats administered zzso Feeding zzso zzso extract reversed the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso tissue genes implicated in zzso or zzso such as zzso zzso activated zzso zzso zzso fatty acid binding zzso zzso zzso fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 2, and zzso protein zzso zzso supplementation with zzso zzso extract protected rats from the zzso decreases in the zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein ratio related to fatty acid zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The present study reports that the zzso zzso extract can have a protective effect against a zzso obesity in rats through an enhanced expression of zzso proteins and elevated zzso zzso in the visceral zzso zzso
