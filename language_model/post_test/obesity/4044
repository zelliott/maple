The present studies have examined the zzso rhythm of zzso in genetically obese mice and in mice made obese by treatment with gold zzso The values of zzso were significantly higher in the zzso mice than in lean mice at each of the four time points zzso The zzso pattern for zzso in zzso mice, however, was similar to that in lean mice at both 6 and 12 weeks of age and had a zzso at zzso h and a zenith at zzso zzso In mice with gold zzso zzso on the other hand, the zzso values were the same in the obese and lean control mice 6 weeks after treatment with gold zzso By 12 weeks after gold zzso treatment, the obese animals had higher zzso levels in the morning than lean animals, but the peak values at zzso h were not zzso zzso of body weight gain by allowing obese and lean mice food for only 4 h daily altered the pattern of zzso but the values in the zzso mice remained higher than those in the lean zzso The zzso values of zzso mice housed at 24 C were significantly higher at zzso and zzso h than those in lean mice, and the zzso rhythm was present, but smaller, in the zzso zzso In zzso and lean mice housed at an ambient temperature of 33 C, the zzso zzso increased to the same values, and the zzso rhythm was blunted in zzso At the higher ambient temperature, the zzso mice gained weight more slowly, whereas the lean mice showed no weight zzso
