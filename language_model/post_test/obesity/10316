zzso zzso zzso zzso was recently described to predominantly perform the initial step in zzso zzso and therefore seems to play a pivotal role in the zzso zzso of stored fat in zzso zzso In the first study investigating genetic variations within the zzso gene in humans, 12 zzso identified via sequencing and database search were studied in 2,434 individuals of European ancestry from zzso These zzso and their zzso were analyzed in subjects not taking diabetes medication for association with plasma free fatty acids zzso as primary analysis, as well as zzso and zzso as a secondary analysis zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Furthermore, type 2 diabetes zzso zzso zzso of zzso was analyzed as an zzso zzso zzso were significantly associated with several single zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso values from zzso to zzso consistent with additive zzso The pattern was similar when considering zzso zzso Furthermore, two zzso showed associations with zzso levels zzso zzso and risk of type 2 diabetes zzso zzso zzso analysis supported and extended the shown zzso association zzso These results complement previous findings of functional studies in zzso and zzso a potential role of zzso in pathways involved in components of the zzso zzso
