The prevalence of diabetes worldwide is increasing rapidly in association with the increase in zzso zzso are a major fear of patients with zzso zzso of diabetes affect many zzso and zzso causing zzso zzso zzso cardiovascular diseases, peripheral vascular diseases, stroke, and zzso zzso zzso abnormalities are associated with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetic zzso T cell abnormalities are believed to be the major cause of zzso disease in type 1 diabetes, leading to the destruction of pancreatic zzso In type 2 diabetes, inflammation and zzso of zzso are zzso to be important for enhancing insulin resistance and may contribute to the loss of insulin zzso function by zzso zzso Many factors can enhance insulin resistance, including zzso a sedentary lifestyle, zzso and other conditions, such as chronic inflammation or zzso zzso in zzso such as zzso of zzso and increased levels of inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso were reported in zzso states without zzso One possible mechanism is that abnormal levels of zzso such as zzso fatty zzso and various zzso from the zzso zzso activate zzso and increase the zzso of inflammatory zzso enhancing insulin zzso According to this model, obesity activates zzso and enhances insulin resistance, increasing the risk for type 2 zzso zzso in innate immunity might also participate in the development of diabetic zzso In general, zzso is the main zzso of diabetic zzso zzso and zzso and it zzso in the development of diabetic cardiovascular zzso Although the precise role of inflammation in the development of diabetic zzso diseases is still zzso it is likely that inflammation induced by diabetes and insulin resistance can accelerate zzso in patients with zzso Also, it was shown that conditions with an inflammatory basis, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, can contribute to zzso disease, suggesting that zzso abnormalities may be partly influenced by inflammatory zzso Further research is required to confirm the role of inflammation and the onset of diabetes, zzso diseases, and zzso zzso
