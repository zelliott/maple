The zzso zzso fatty zzso rat zzso is the prominent model for the research of zzso one of the most well-known risk factor of zzso zzso zzso But the usage as a zzso zzso zzso model is considered to be restricted due to the zzso of zzso zzso In the present study, to find the zzso of zzso zzso zzso lean zzso rats as a new zzso zzso zzso model, we examined whether the number of terminal end buds of zzso zzso the serum zzso zzso concentration in serum and zzso tissue are changed in zzso female zzso zzso and zzso rats, and whether these changes and zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression in zzso tissue of zzso and zzso rats are influenced by zzso corn oil diet for 5 zzso We confirmed that mild zzso was more pronounced in zzso zzso as compared with wild type zzso and zzso of zzso zzso characterized by fewer numbers of terminal end buds in zzso was not observed in zzso With zzso corn oil diet, zzso zzso expression in zzso tissue showed increasing tendency both in zzso and zzso Comparing with zzso zzso tissue in zzso treated with zzso corn oil diet was found to be significantly increased in the concentration of zzso protein and tended to be elevated expression of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso with zzso corn oil diet may be a useful model for investigation of the participation of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso
