zzso zzso of zzso tissue has been associated with a significant decrease in the number of zzso II zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of zzso II receptors in zzso zzso tissue in animal obesity model using rats zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso II is known to induce zzso in several zzso of the cardiovascular system and might do the same in fat zzso The expression and binding properties of zzso II zzso receptors in zzso fat tissue of adult rats were studied using zzso zzso and zzso The amount of zzso zzso zzso did not differ significantly between obese and control zzso Despite that zzso rats displayed approximately zzso more zzso zzso zzso protein content in fat tissue cell zzso than the controls zzso In contrast, binding experiments showed a significant zzso zzso zzso zzso decrease of zzso zzso to fat tissue cell zzso in obese rats compared to zzso In conclusion, the present study provides evidence for the low binding properties associated with an zzso of zzso zzso protein in cell zzso of the fat tissue of rats with zzso zzso zzso among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels indicate a possible zzso in the zzso zzso which remains to be zzso The results obtained support a role of zzso II and zzso receptors in the zzso of zzso
