30 obese nonsmokers, 30 obese smokers, 30 zzso smokers, and 30 healthy volunteers (the zzso were zzso In all subjects, assessments of zzso zzso and insulin were zzso zzso resistance was evaluated according to the zzso model zzso resistance zzso zzso 

zzso zzso as well as insulin resistance levels, in obese patients significantly exceeded those observed in the zzso Compared to the control, obese patients presented significantly lower zzso zzso In the group of obese patients who actively smoked zzso further increases in zzso and insulin resistance, as well as decreases in zzso level, were zzso zzso concentration and insulin resistance levels were significantly higher, while zzso was lower in zzso smoking subjects, compared to the zzso A positive correlation between zzso and zzso was found in the overall zzso 

zzso may evoke inflammatory zzso zzso stress, and insulin resistance, all of which are aggravated by cigarette zzso zzso should be considered in the complex zzso of insulin resistance in obese patients who actively zzso
