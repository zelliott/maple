To investigate serum zzso level and its relationship with bone mineral density in obese children from zzso zzso 

One hundred and zzso obese children and 103 normal children aged 7 to 12 years from five primary schools of zzso City were zzso zzso was assessed based on the body mass index zzso zzso energy X-ray zzso zzso was used to determine bone mineral density zzso and body zzso zzso zzso level was measured using zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The obesity group had higher zzso weight, zzso waist circumference and waist to hip ratio zzso compared with the normal group zzso zzso bone mineral content zzso lean mass zzso fat mass zzso percentage of body fat zzso and zzso concentration in the obesity group were significantly higher than those in the normal group zzso zzso zzso level was positively correlated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Multiple zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso and zzso were independent influencing factors for serum zzso zzso 

zzso children have higher serum zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration is significantly correlated with zzso and body zzso zzso and zzso are independent influencing factors for serum zzso level in zzso
