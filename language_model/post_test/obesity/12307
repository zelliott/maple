It is well established that genetic factors play an important role in the development of both type 2 diabetes zzso zzso and zzso and that genetically susceptible subjects can develop these zzso diseases after being exposed to environmental risk zzso zzso great efforts have been made to identify genes associated with zzso and/or zzso zzso protein 1 zzso is mainly expressed in brown zzso zzso and acts in zzso regulation of energy zzso and protection against zzso zzso All these mechanisms are associated with the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a candidate gene for the development of these zzso Indeed, several studies have reported that zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the promoter region, zzso in zzso 2 and zzso in zzso 5 of zzso gene are possibly associated with obesity and/or zzso However, results are still controversial in different zzso Thus, the aim of this study was to review the role of zzso in the development of these zzso zzso
