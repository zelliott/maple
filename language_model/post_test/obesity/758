The goal of the study was to analyze the impact of overweight on zzso and zzso zzso and B zzso zzso profiles in the women's blood zzso 

Seventy-five women without any symptoms of coronary heart disease were zzso Women were divided into two groups: those with normal weight and the body mass index zzso less than 25 zzso zzso zzso mean age zzso zzso and overweight women zzso zzso zzso mean age zzso Weight and height were measured and blood serum zzso of total cholesterol, zzso zzso cholesterol, and zzso were determined after an overnight zzso In the same serum samples the levels of zzso and B were measured using zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso Sant zzso De zzso zzso by the zzso zzso The serum samples were kept frozen at zzso degrees C until zzso 

Total cholesterol and zzso levels were similar in the healthy and the overweight women groups zzso vs zzso zzso zzso and zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso cholesterol and zzso were significantly higher in the normal weight women compared to the overweight women zzso vs zzso zzso zzso and zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso The level of zzso was significantly higher in the overweight female group compared to normal weight women zzso vs zzso zzso zzso The zzso ratio was significantly lower in the normal weight group than in the overweight group zzso vs zzso zzso zzso to strong correlations between zzso and zzso zzso cholesterol zzso were found in both groups zzso zzso in the control female group and zzso zzso in the overweight group, zzso A similar level of correlation between zzso and total cholesterol was established in both groups zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso in middle-aged women is associated with a significant decrease in serum zzso zzso cholesterol and zzso levels, a significant increase in zzso and zzso ratio, even if serum total cholesterol and zzso zzso are zzso Changes of the zzso profile in obese women are indicative of a higher risk of coronary heart zzso
