zzso proteins were discovered in the zzso where they regulate zzso storage and zzso Animal knockout models provided initial evidence of the critical role of zzso 1, the most abundant of the zzso zzso in energy and zzso zzso During a decade of study, genetic variation in zzso 1 has been consistently but not invariably associated with body weight and zzso zzso Related zzso such as zzso zzso metabolism and zzso fitness are also modulated by zzso 1 zzso consistent with earlier zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso together with gene expression studies, have yielded increased understanding, but important questions about zzso zzso and mechanisms zzso The newest work examines zzso 4, an zzso regulator of zzso synthesis and zzso The novel discovery that a zzso 4 zzso creates a binding site for regulation of the zzso gene zzso by zzso suggests intriguing new possibilities for additional zzso investigations of other zzso zzso
