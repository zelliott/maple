It has been suggested that the prevalence of zzso obesity has increased recently in parallel with the prevalence of obesity in the human zzso We had previously determined the prevalence of obesity in an urban New Zealand population of cats in zzso This study was conducted to determine the prevalence and risk factors of obesity in the same population base, one generation (15 zzso zzso It was also designed to test the hypothesis that the increase in feeding of energy dense zzso dry foods to cats in the region was associated with any change in obesity zzso A zzso survey, conducted within the city limits of zzso North, obtained data on the environment, diet, health and zzso of 200 zzso The zzso used a validated scoring system to assess the body condition score zzso of each cat and this was used as the outcome variable of zzso zzso were grouped into four zzso groupings for zzso zzso regression, namely cat zzso feeding zzso owner's perception of their cat, and household zzso Using the same definition for overweight and obese as that used in the 1993 study zzso the prevalence of obesity was zzso compared with zzso in zzso In this study, zzso of cats had a zzso of zzso or zzso zzso that were identified as significant from each model zzso zzso zzso were included in a combined zzso In this model, only three variables were zzso owner zzso of the body condition of the cat, the zzso leg zzso and its zzso Thus, we found no evidence to support the hypothesis that the prevalence of obesity in this population has increased, or that changes in feeding practices have affected obesity zzso The lack of any feeding variables in the combined model is zzso From a population health perspective, the association between obesity and owner's perception of their zzso body condition suggests that more attention should be directed towards zzso the public's view of what a zzso normal body condition is, rather than placing the educational emphasis on changing zzso feeding patterns or food zzso
