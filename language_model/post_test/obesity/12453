The zzso Renal zzso zzso Implementation Study zzso is a prospective zzso study in a predominantly white population in Greater zzso From the zzso database, we assessed rate of progression of zzso in zzso adults attending the zzso zzso zzso including zzso were obtained and estimated zzso zzso rate zzso was zzso The rate of deterioration of zzso was derived over time, defined as zzso zzso zzso and assessed using zzso analysis of zzso 

In the groups as a whole, no relationship between zzso and zzso was zzso zzso the subjects into obese zzso and non-obese zzso groups and further breakdown into zzso stages 3, 4 and 5, also showed no relationship between zzso and zzso zzso analysis of zzso was zzso
