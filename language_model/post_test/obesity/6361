This study investigated shift pattern zzso shifts versus zzso zzso and its interactions with age, and with years of zzso exposure, as zzso of body mass index zzso 

zzso data were collected from offshore personnel working day shifts zzso or zzso shifts zzso information was obtained about shift pattern and years of zzso exposure, zzso weight, demographic factors, and smoking zzso zzso multiple zzso was used to test a model in which zzso was predicted by additive and interactive effects of shift pattern, age, and exposure years with control for zzso zzso 

In a zzso analysis zzso for job type, education and zzso zzso was predicted by the main effects of age and years of zzso zzso Shift pattern was not significant as a main effect, but it zzso significantly with the zzso age term and with the linear and zzso components of zzso zzso In the day shift group, age but not exposure predicted zzso the opposite was true of the zzso shift zzso The increase in zzso with an increase in age and exposure years was steeper for the zzso shift group than for the day shift zzso 

The significant interaction effects found in this study were consistent with the view that continued exposure to zzso shift work gives rise to increases in zzso over and above the zzso effects of zzso on zzso shown by zzso zzso
