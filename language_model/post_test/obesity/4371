zzso syndrome is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and zzso zzso Playing a central role in the development of zzso syndrome and in its clinical consequences is visceral zzso zzso tissue is now considered to be an active zzso organ that zzso various zzso factors zzso and its shift to production of zzso zzso in obesity likely contributes to the low-level systemic inflammation that is seen in zzso zzso chronic zzso such as zzso Recent studies have shown that obesity zzso chronic local inflammation in zzso zzso and that cells of the innate immune system, particularly zzso are zzso involved in zzso inflammation and systemic zzso zzso Moreover, we and others recently revealed that T cells are key regulators of zzso zzso and that the zzso immune system is also zzso zzso In mouse models zzso of T cell function ameliorated not only zzso inflammation but also systemic insulin resistance induced by zzso Thus clarification of the inflammatory processes ongoing in obese zzso tissue would seem essential for the understanding of zzso syndrome and for developing novel therapeutic strategies to treat zzso
