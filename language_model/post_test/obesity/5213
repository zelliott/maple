In 45 physically active men zzso zzso zzso who underwent zzso weighing to determine body zzso multiple zzso equations were developed for the prediction of body density zzso lean body weight zzso fat body weight zzso and % fat using selected zzso zzso The prediction accuracy for these parameters using several previously generated zzso zzso equations was also zzso With equations developed from the present data a substantially higher correlation was obtained between measured and predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso than between measured and predicted D zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or % fat zzso zzso zzso When previously developed equations were applied to the present sample, correlations between measured and predicted values were considerably lower zzso than in the original zzso this reduction was least in the case of zzso Analysis of previous data indicated that in selected populations total body weight can account for a relatively large fraction of the zzso in zzso zzso may be estimated quite accurately zzso greater than or equal to zzso in physically active men with one of several zzso equations which include total body weight as an independent zzso
