To zzso the relationship between body mass index zzso and zzso displacement in patients undergoing prostate cancer zzso zzso 

An analysis was carried out on 151 prostate cancer patients treated with radical dose zzso between January 2007 and March zzso Patients had their zzso weight and daily zzso prostate displacement data collected zzso during zzso marker zzso zzso with zzso zzso For each of zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso linear zzso analysis was carried out with the individual patient standard zzso of shift as the response variable and zzso as a continuous explanatory zzso 

zzso zzso were recorded from zzso zzso and zzso image zzso Patients were grouped according to zzso as normal weight zzso overweight zzso obese zzso severely obese zzso or zzso obese zzso For zzso zzso a one unit increase in zzso affected the standard zzso of shift zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso 

Our data indicate that patients with a higher zzso have less zzso displacement of the prostate in the zzso dimension compared with patients with a lower zzso This has implications for zzso treatment margins for future prostate cancer patients undergoing zzso zzso Further study is zzso
