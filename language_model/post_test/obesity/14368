Twelve zzso drugs, currently in clinical use, were screened for zzso properties on the basis of their ability to stimulate the activity of the sympathetic nervous system via an zzso effect on zzso zzso into the sympathetic zzso Drug screening was carried out on mice made obese by zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso experiments, based on changes in body weight and food intake in response to increased doses of the drugs, indicate that most of the twelve zzso possess zzso zzso In particular, zzso zzso and zzso were most effective in causing marked losses in body weight without altering the food intake of the zzso The potent zzso zzso properties of these three zzso were confirmed during a zzso energy balance study involving zzso of energy expenditure over the entire period by the comparative carcass method, as well as by measurement of 24 h oxygen zzso These studies indicate that the methodology employed in the preliminary screening is valid for identifying drugs with zzso potential, and demonstrate that many zzso currently in clinical use have marked zzso properties, and could therefore influence the nutritional status of patients under drug zzso
