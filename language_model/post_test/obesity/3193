Gene zzso is one of the pivotal factors that influence zzso zzso It is zzso factor that plays a crucial role in the regulation of genes involved in zzso zzso and storage as well as insulin zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate whether zzso zzso and zzso zzso are connected with obesity and its zzso zzso 

we investigated 93 zzso 72 women zzso non-obese and 35 zzso and 21 men (8 non-obese and 13 zzso We performed zzso examination: zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the whole zzso zzso zzso was studied using zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso was present in 57 subjects (32 obese and 25 zzso 45 women zzso obese and 19 zzso and 12 men (6 obese and 6 zzso zzso zzso was observed in 20 subjects (8 obese and 12 zzso 15 women (4 obese and 11 zzso and 5 men (4 zzso zzso zzso was discovered in 16 subjects (8 obese and 8 zzso 12 women (5 obese and 7 zzso and 4 men (3 zzso zzso zzso was not found in any of the studied zzso 

The frequency Ala zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso in the whole group and zzso in the obese zzso However the zzso zzso is quite common, it does not seem to be directly connected with onset of zzso But it is interesting that the Ala zzso is more frequent in non-obese women comparing to obese women zzso vs zzso zzso tendency was seen in zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso is twice more frequent in obese subjects comparing to non-obese ones zzso vs zzso
