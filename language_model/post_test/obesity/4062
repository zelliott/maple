We have developed a new method of measuring fat volume of the human body, using zzso zzso scanning zzso zzso - no ideal or direct method has been available for this zzso In our study a human body is divided into 11 zzso shapes, zzso a head, a chest, an abdomen, both sides of zzso upper arms, zzso and calves to be subjected to the zzso Eleven zzso zzso sections were examined at the middle point of each segment to obtain the areas of fat zzso Volume of each zzso segment was calculated by zzso a zzso area of fat tissue by the height of each zzso Then the volume of fat tissue of the whole body was determined by the sum of fat tissue volume of zzso parts (as zzso By this method, nine massive obese subjects with zzso percent of ideal body weight were found to possess fat tissue occupying zzso percent of total body zzso We also found female obese patients had a significantly higher percentage of fat tissue than male obese patients when they had same degree of zzso In addition to the study above, we examined 18 control and 19 obese subjects and measured subcutaneous fat, muscle plus bone and visceral fat separately by CT scan at the zzso zzso In obese subjects, increased abdominal fatty mass was mainly due to the zzso of subcutaneous fat, although substantial increase of visceral fatty mass was demonstrated in a few zzso
