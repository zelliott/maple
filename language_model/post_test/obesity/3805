To determine the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso on blood pressure, plasma zzso profile, zzso zzso together with serum zzso and zzso zzso in volunteer participants with hypertension, because all these variables have been shown to influence vascular zzso 

A total of 50 zzso zzso age of 58 zzso zzso years; 12 were zzso with zzso hypertension zzso blood pressure zzso 140 zzso zzso zzso blood pressure zzso 90 zzso zzso and 25 zzso zzso age of 48 zzso zzso years; 11 zzso selected for this zzso Plasma zzso profile, zzso zzso serum zzso and zzso zzso were measured at baseline and after zzso consumption by the patient with hypertension for 45 zzso 

zzso and zzso gradually decreased and pulse rate zzso The total cholesterol, zzso zzso cholesterol and zzso and zzso levels decreased significantly and zzso zzso cholesterol and serum zzso levels increased after tea consumption in patients with zzso We also observed significant body weight loss and reduction in zzso zzso There was no significant difference in plasma level of zzso 

Thus, zzso zzso zzso consumption gradually decreased zzso and showed beneficial effects on blood zzso profile, zzso zzso and body mass index in patients with zzso
