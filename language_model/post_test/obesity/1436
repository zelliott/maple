To determine whether the product of the recently cloned zzso gene functions as an zzso zzso factor, zzso zzso zzso protein was administered zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso protein given as single morning injections to groups of three animals at seven doses ranging from 5 to 100 zzso reduced zzso zzso consumption in a zzso manner from values of 81 zzso zzso of control zzso dose, P zzso zzso to 29 zzso zzso of control zzso dose, P zzso Daily injections of 80 zzso of zzso protein into six zzso mice for 2 zzso led to an 11 zzso zzso decrease in body weight zzso zzso zzso and suppressed feeding to 26 zzso zzso of baseline zzso zzso with significant reduction of serum insulin and zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso protein on feeding was not zzso by zzso zzso by zzso zzso nor did exposure of zzso tissue to zzso protein affect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso modification of zzso protein was not required for zzso however, addition of a zzso tag to the zzso zzso of the mature zzso protein resulted in prolonged suppression of feeding after injection into zzso zzso These results demonstrate a direct effect of the zzso protein to suppress feeding in the zzso mouse and suggest that this zzso plays a critical role in regulating total body fat zzso
