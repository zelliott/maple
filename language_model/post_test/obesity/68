A study was undertaken to demonstrate the usefulness of the recently developed zzso zzso analysis zzso technique for in zzso body composition zzso zzso can be used for direct measurement of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were made on rats fed diets of zzso zzso or zzso protein for 6 1/2 zzso and significant changes in body composition were zzso In addition, rats of different ages, zzso nutritional states, and degrees of obesity were included in a comparison of zzso results in zzso with results from chemical analysis after sacrifice of the zzso High positive correlations were found between zzso zzso of carbon and chemical analysis zzso of fat and between zzso zzso of oxygen and chemical analysis zzso of zzso zzso A low positive correlation was found between zzso zzso of nitrogen and chemical analysis zzso of zzso
