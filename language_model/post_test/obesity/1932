zzso specific to the long zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were used in reverse zzso zzso chain reactions zzso to investigate the expression of this zzso in the zzso and zzso of human and zzso For both regions, we observed zzso zzso as well as restriction zzso zzso fragments of expected zzso Additionally, in zzso zzso of human zzso using two independent zzso zzso complementary to the zzso zzso sequence revealed a prominent zzso signal within the zzso zzso Overall, our findings demonstrate the expression of zzso zzso in the zzso and suggest that in such a location, zzso receptors may mediate a function presumably not linked to body weight zzso
