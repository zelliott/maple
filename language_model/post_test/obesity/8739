The obese zzso rat zzso is a model of zzso and zzso failure in the setting of zzso zzso and zzso Our prior work in zzso has shown that zzso zzso zzso while added zzso worsens zzso To investigate the mechanism of zzso effects on zzso disease in this model, we evaluated the effects of zzso and zzso supplementation on seven-week zzso zzso At this time point, rats exhibit no overt zzso zzso disease, but are just beginning to show elevated urinary zzso zzso 

Female zzso fed ad zzso were zzso at four weeks, with or without zzso supplementation to raise zzso levels to just below those of zzso adults zzso zzso zzso zzso controls were zzso 

zzso zzso zzso lowered total and very zzso zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso supplementation worsened zzso and raised zzso zzso zzso zzso and total zzso zzso rats exhibited enhanced zzso deposition of zzso zzso and zzso B, increased zzso expression of zzso and type IV zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso 

zzso may be zzso for the early development of zzso disease in zzso and may act by increasing zzso zzso which then bind to zzso cells and initiate or accelerate zzso
