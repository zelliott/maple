This study was conducted to evaluate the mechanisms in weight zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso in particular, on the contributions of sympathetic nervous system activity, zzso plasma insulin, and zzso to zzso zzso The study design was zzso with a cohort of zzso zzso zzso pulse rate, body mass index zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso insulin, and zzso were measured at 6 and 12 months in those zzso lean zzso 79 obese zzso 64 lean zzso zzso and 38 obese zzso zzso men whose zzso zzso during the first 6 zzso At entry, levels of zzso pulse rate, plasma NE, insulin, and zzso in obese subjects, regardless of zzso status, were significantly greater than those in lean zzso The levels of plasma NE, insulin, and zzso increased with weight gain in the 4 study zzso In the subjects with zzso zzso the increase in pulse rate and plasma zzso was significantly greater than that in the subjects without zzso zzso at both 6 and 12 months for each of the 4 study groups, although the increase in zzso was similar between the subjects with and without zzso zzso In obese but not lean subjects, whether zzso or zzso the increases in plasma insulin and plasma zzso with weight gain were greater in the subjects with accompanying zzso zzso compared with the subjects without zzso zzso On the other hand, at 6 months in lean subjects, the increase in plasma insulin with weight gain in the subjects with zzso zzso was actually lower than that in the subjects without zzso zzso These results suggest that weight zzso sympathetic zzso is more tightly linked to weight zzso zzso zzso than the changes in plasma insulin and zzso that also accompany weight zzso It is probable that sympathetic nervous zzso with weight gain is a major mechanism of blood pressure zzso zzso and zzso may be ancillary factors that contribute to sympathetic nervous stimulation with weight zzso
