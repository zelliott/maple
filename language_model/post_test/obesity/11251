At zzso after zzso patients had lost zzso zzso while zzso had improved from zzso to zzso zzso Both zzso zzso levels and the zzso zzso response were decreased at zzso after zzso and remained decreased at zzso zzso zzso week 1 zzso week zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso In zzso the zzso response decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso response increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso response was decreased at week 24 zzso zzso week zzso zzso zzso levels did not change zzso zzso control was still improved zzso after zzso 

The data indicate zzso to be a promising treatment for obesity and type 2 diabetes, causing rapid improvement of zzso control paralleled by changes in gut zzso
