zzso and zzso (also known as zzso are newly discovered zzso peptides that stimulate food zzso Using separate zzso for these rat zzso we determined their zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso which have zzso of zzso zzso High zzso contents zzso between 250 and 350 zzso protein and zzso between 650 and 900 zzso zzso were present in the lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso central gray and locus zzso zzso zzso contents zzso between 100 and 250 zzso protein and zzso between 300 and 500 zzso zzso were found in the median zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the nucleus of the solitary zzso zzso zzso and zzso peptides were the major zzso zzso molecules in these zzso The zzso and zzso contents in the brains of obese zzso rats that have disrupted zzso zzso were significantly higher than in their lean zzso but in zzso zzso zzso zzso rats that have disrupted zzso zzso zzso the contents were similar to those of the zzso The widespread zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso and zzso suggest that zzso serve as zzso zzso or both, in a wide variety of neural networks that regulate the zzso and neuroendocrine zzso
