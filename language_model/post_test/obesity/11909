zzso sensitivity is impaired in zzso and insulin resistance is the primary risk factor for type 2 zzso Here we show that zzso zzso a zzso zzso member, is a novel insulin zzso zzso was zzso by multiple cell zzso zzso zzso was markedly reduced in mice with obesity and type 2 zzso Three distinct approaches were used to increase zzso zzso zzso transgenic mice, zzso zzso infection, and zzso zzso zzso Restoration of zzso significantly ameliorated zzso insulin resistance, and zzso intolerance in mice with zzso zzso enhanced insulin signaling not only in animals but also in cultured zzso zzso zzso increased the ability of insulin to stimulate zzso zzso in zzso and to suppress zzso zzso production zzso in primary zzso zzso Additionally, zzso alone was able to suppress zzso whereas zzso of zzso increased zzso in primary zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso regulates zzso metabolism by both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso molecules may be used to treat insulin resistance and type 2 zzso
