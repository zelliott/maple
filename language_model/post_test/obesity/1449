The study was carried out using a new rat model of naturally occurring obese, zzso diabetes, zzso zzso zzso zzso rat zzso et zzso Diabetes zzso zzso zzso which closely resembles obese zzso diabetes in zzso At the age of zzso zzso body weight, zzso tolerance and plasma insulin level after zzso load were normal in zzso zzso zzso zzso rats, indicating the animals are at zzso zzso zzso At this age, however, zzso insulin release by pancreatic zzso in zzso was zzso exaggerated whereas the zzso insulin content and zzso metabolism by the zzso cells were zzso Administration of zzso zzso in zzso an inhibitor of insulin zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso rats from the age of 4 to 12 zzso completely prevented the development of obesity and insulin resistance, which was accompanied by marked improvement of zzso tolerance and disappearance of exaggerated B cell response to zzso in zzso This is the first report of successful pharmacological prevention of genetically determined obese zzso
