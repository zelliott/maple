The aim of our study was to estimate the effect of zzso and physical exercise on a treadmill on plasma zzso zzso in high-fat fed zzso Male zzso rats were injected a low dose of zzso zzso or buffer at 2 days of age and later fed a standard or high-fat diet zzso Plasma zzso was measured by zzso method in all the groups studied in zzso conditions, after zzso zzso a single bout of exhaustive exercise, and 4 weeks of exercise zzso Plasma zzso zzso were markedly elevated in the zzso and zzso groups compared to the control zzso The significant correlation between plasma zzso and body weight was zzso zzso and exercise training decreased plasma zzso in similar percentage in all the groups zzso The observed decrease was greater than expected from changes in body zzso We conclude that high-fat feeding results in an increase in plasma zzso levels in rats independently of plasma insulin or daily calorie zzso zzso fed rats have maintained zzso response to zzso and exercise zzso The reduction in plasma zzso after exercise training is partly independent on changes in body weight or plasma zzso
