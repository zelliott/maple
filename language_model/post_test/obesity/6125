To determine whether the zzso zzso of inflammation response genes in isolated zzso and in cultured zzso are related to zzso size and in zzso insulin action in obese zzso 

zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso Indians with normal zzso zzso 

zzso diameter (by microscope zzso zzso expression of candidate genes (by quantitative real-time zzso in freshly isolated zzso zzso zzso protein zzso 1 and zzso zzso inflammatory protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso migration zzso factor zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso 6 and zzso zzso and cultured zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2; zzso from subcutaneous abdominal zzso tissue (by aspiration zzso zzso body fat by zzso X-ray zzso zzso tolerance by 75 g oral zzso tolerance test and insulin action by zzso clamp zzso infusion rate 40 zzso zzso zzso (all zzso 

zzso was the only gene whose expression in both freshly isolated zzso and cultured zzso was positively associated with zzso diameter and zzso associated with peripheral and zzso insulin action (all zzso In zzso analysis, the association between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso diameter was independent of the percentage of body fat zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso diameter, independently predicted peripheral insulin zzso The zzso expression zzso of the zzso gene in zzso were not associated with plasma zzso of zzso but were zzso associated with plasma zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not plasma zzso zzso zzso remained a significant predictor of insulin zzso 

Increased expression of zzso gene in zzso cells may be an important link between obesity characterized by enlarged zzso and insulin resistance in normal zzso tolerant zzso
