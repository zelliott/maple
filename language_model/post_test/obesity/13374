The public discussion and the discussion among zzso about the possible increased risk to develop zzso of the zzso following post zzso treatment with zzso has lead to insecurity and restricted attitudes in the prescriptions of zzso In a statistic comparison of matched pairs of 130 cases of zzso of the zzso with an equal number of selected control cases the following findings were zzso zzso Any zzso preparations do not increase the relative risk for the development of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso oral zzso and various other zzso compounds showed a similar zzso zzso zzso compounds and zzso compounds did not increase the relative risk for zzso zzso zzso The relative risk does not increase by prolonged zzso of zzso preparations in general and not for zzso zzso zzso zzso In the presence of other risk factors such as zzso hypertension, obesity the relative risk for the development of zzso of the zzso is significantly decreased when zzso were taken, especially when the coincidental risk factor to zzso zzso was zzso The above results suggest that the restraint in the prescription of zzso for fear of zzso zzso is not zzso 

A matched pairs analysis of 130 cases of zzso cancer was undertaken to determine the relationship between zzso zzso treatment and zzso zzso zzso of the cases were in zzso stage I, zzso stage II, and zzso stage zzso The matching took place according to a wide range of criteria, zzso age at menopause, age at diagnosis, zzso of zzso weight, zzso within certain zzso After the matching was finished, the information on zzso use was zzso and the relative risk zzso for various zzso preparations was calculated according to the length of zzso zzso The number of zzso users was smaller among the women with zzso cancer than among the control group zzso zzso the zzso of zzso cancer does not increase with zzso use zzso The same held true when zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were considered separately zzso p zzso zzso The zzso of zzso cancer does not increase with the length of zzso zzso It was also observed that the zzso of zzso cancer was significantly lower zzso zzso among women with zzso factors such as hypertension, zzso and zzso This suggests that the risk of zzso cancer is not increased by zzso zzso
