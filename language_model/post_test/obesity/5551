To construct a simple zzso model of zzso zzso based on measures of body size and zzso which is suitable for investigating the influence of genetic and other influences on circulating zzso levels in zzso 

Consideration of the zzso of the zzso and clearance of zzso led to a predicted linear relationship between zzso zzso zzso and a function of zzso body zzso zzso obtained from this model were compared with those from two published empirical models based on adjustment for fat mass alone or for body mass zzso Overnight zzso zzso levels, body composition data zzso X-ray zzso and questionnaire responses were obtained from zzso twin pairs zzso zzso 400 zzso 37 male (age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 489 female (age zzso zzso zzso drawn from the St zzso UK Adult Twin zzso 

In a partial correlation analysis zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were independent zzso of zzso in females but zzso zzso was not zzso A zzso model incorporating zzso zzso zzso and a second order zzso in age provided an adequate fit of the zzso data in females zzso zzso values adjusted for body size and composition using the model were not significantly zzso zzso were significantly related to gender zzso and to zzso zzso but not to zzso status zzso hormone replacement therapy zzso past or current smoking zzso or percentage trunk fat zzso Both empirical models found significant zzso zzso overestimated the effect of gender in the data zzso and produced significant relationships between adjusted zzso and percentage trunk fat zzso 

We conclude that our zzso based model provides an adequate description of the relationship between zzso and body composition and provides a more reliable framework than current empirical approaches for the investigation of other influences on circulating zzso zzso zzso variations in the control of zzso zzso are unlikely to contribute significantly to variations in zzso levels at the population zzso
