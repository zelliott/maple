In order to investigate the possible causes and effects of obesity in zzso zzso syndrome resting energy zzso zzso zzso and insulin resistance were measured in 14 zzso zzso syndrome subjects and in 14 zzso 

A zzso study of a selected group of patients was zzso 

Seven of the zzso subjects were obese and seven zzso zzso were individually matched for age, race, weight, body mass index zzso lean body mass and percentage zzso The obese, but not lean, zzso zzso syndrome subjects had a greater zzso ratio than controls zzso zzso obese zzso zzso zzso vs obese control zzso zzso P less than zzso 

zzso rate was measured by continuous indirect zzso and insulin sensitivity was assessed by a short insulin tolerance zzso 

The resting energy expenditure zzso was similar in zzso subjects and controls zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso and the control group zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso zzso zzso was reduced in zzso zzso syndrome zzso median zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso less than zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso less than zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso and zzso incremental insulin rise zzso zzso 31 vs 116 zzso 15 zzso P less than zzso were higher in zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity was reduced in zzso zzso syndrome zzso median 136 zzso zzso vs 173 zzso zzso zzso less than zzso zzso 161 zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso less than zzso The reduction in insulin sensitivity correlated with the reduced zzso zzso in the zzso zzso syndrome group zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso 

These results confirm previous reports of zzso and insulin resistance in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso syndrome subjects have a reduced zzso zzso which is related statistically to the reduced insulin zzso The decreased zzso zzso may zzso women with zzso zzso syndrome to weight zzso
