The cardiovascular risk factors which comprise the zzso syndrome are associated with increased zzso axis zzso activity in some Caucasian zzso South Asians have high rates of cardiovascular disease and its risk zzso We have investigated the relationships between zzso activity, zzso and the zzso syndrome in a South Asian zzso 

zzso cohort zzso 

A total of zzso men and women born at the zzso Memorial Hospital, zzso South India between 1934 and 1954 and still living in the zzso 

zzso zzso h cortisol and zzso zzso The cohort had previously been investigated for features of the zzso zzso 

At zzso zzso cortisol concentration was strongly associated with zzso and zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso P zzso insulin resistance zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso P zzso In general, higher cortisol zzso added to the effect of zzso in increasing cardiovascular risk factors, but there was evidence of an interaction between cortisol and zzso in determining zzso zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso and insulin resistance zzso zzso zzso 

zzso between zzso h cortisol concentration and cardiovascular risk factors in this South Asian cohort were stronger than those previously shown in Caucasian zzso despite similar mean cortisol zzso and were amplified by zzso This suggests that increased zzso action may contribute to ethnic differences in the prevalence of the zzso syndrome, particularly among men and women with a higher body mass zzso
