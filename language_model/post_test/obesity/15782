zzso zzso growth zzso which in an zzso form induce zzso and zzso acid zzso circulate bound to zzso zzso zzso which zzso their zzso and zzso The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of a standard meal zzso zzso zzso zzso on the serum levels of zzso in obese patients with zzso zzso 2 diabetes zzso non-obese patients with zzso zzso 1 diabetes zzso and healthy controls, using the artificial zzso zzso to obtain a normal zzso response to the zzso zzso levels decreased by 50% over 2 h following the meal at a similar clearance in both the healthy controls and patients with zzso but no significant decline was seen in the patients with zzso despite a zzso increase in insulin zzso The patients with zzso were also studied during zzso zzso infusion to decrease the inappropriate zzso of zzso during the zzso During the 210 zzso of zzso infusion, the zzso response was suppressed and zzso levels were increased zzso with the peak in insulin levels, without any significant decrease after the zzso In conclusion, the impaired zzso response to zzso zzso in obese patients with zzso suggests a decreased availability of active IGF-1, leading to a decrease in zzso zzso during and after a meal in these zzso The zzso meal response to zzso which contributes to zzso zzso could not explain the increase in serum zzso in these obese patients with zzso
