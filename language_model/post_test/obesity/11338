This study was performed to examine whether changes in subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso metabolism zzso after weight loss were related to the magnitude of weight zzso Nine men and ten zzso women whose body mass index ranged from 30 to 42 zzso zzso years old, were studied before and after a zzso weight loss program, as well as at a zzso follow-up zzso Although body composition was evaluated at all study zzso abdominal and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activities, and zzso and zzso zzso were measured before and after weight loss, zzso Although the zzso activity did not change after weight loss in men, it tended to decrease in the zzso depot of women zzso zzso zzso zzso activity remained unchanged after weight reduction in men, while the zzso loss zzso activity tended to be higher in both regions of women zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso loss number of zzso was higher irrespective of the fat depot zzso zzso zzso the number of zzso was increased in the zzso zzso zzso but not in the abdominal zzso zzso zzso zzso after weight reduction, in zzso Neither the zzso nor the zzso density changed after weight reduction, in zzso zzso zzso activity after weight reduction was zzso related to weight regain zzso in women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso loss abdominal zzso zzso density and the zzso balance were positively associated with weight regain zzso in men zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that selected zzso metabolism zzso could predict failure to weight loss zzso in both zzso
