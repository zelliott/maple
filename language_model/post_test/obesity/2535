The zzso and epidemiology of heart failure in young adults are poorly zzso 

We zzso assessed the zzso of heart failure over a 20-year period among zzso blacks and whites of both sexes who were 18 to 30 years of age at zzso Using Cox models, we examined zzso of hospitalization or death from heart zzso 

Over the course of 20 years, heart failure developed in 27 participants zzso zzso age at zzso zzso zzso all but 1 of whom were zzso The cumulative zzso of heart failure before the age of 50 years was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso in black women, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso in black men, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso in white women, and zzso zzso zzso 0 to zzso in white men zzso for the comparison of black participants and white zzso Among blacks, independent zzso at 18 to 30 years of age of heart failure occurring 15 years, on average, later included higher zzso blood pressure zzso ratio per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso higher zzso index (the weight in zzso divided by the square of the height in zzso zzso ratio per zzso units, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso lower zzso zzso cholesterol zzso ratio per zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and kidney disease zzso ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso Three quarters of those in whom heart failure subsequently developed had hypertension by the time they were 40 years of zzso zzso zzso function, as assessed on a study zzso when the participants were 23 to 35 years of age, was independently associated with the development of heart failure 10 years, on average, later zzso ratio for abnormal zzso function, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso hazard ratio for borderline zzso function, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso drug use, and alcohol use were not associated with the risk of heart zzso 

zzso heart failure before 50 years of age is substantially more common among blacks than among zzso zzso zzso and zzso dysfunction that are present before a person is 35 years of age are important zzso that may be targets for the prevention of heart zzso zzso number, zzso
