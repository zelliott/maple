Both gallbladder zzso and cardiovascular disease are very common diagnoses that carry substantial economic zzso Prior studies suggest that personal history of zzso heart disease zzso could determine the occurrence of zzso zzso zzso the use of zzso zzso may also be a risk factor for this zzso We aimed to evaluate different cardiovascular conditions and related drugs that could be associated with zzso zzso 

We identified all incident cases of gallbladder disease occurring during 1996 among patients aged zzso years old registered in the General zzso Research zzso We performed a zzso case control analysis using zzso cases and 10,000 controls frequency matched to the cases by age and zzso 

After adjusting for potential zzso zzso was associated with a small increased risk of zzso disease zzso zzso When only cases requiring zzso were considered in the analysis, the resulting estimate was zzso zzso Users of zzso zzso presented an OR of zzso zzso Other zzso drugs were not associated with zzso zzso 

Our results confirm the small increased risk of zzso disease associated with zzso zzso On the other hand, our data do not support a major association between zzso and zzso zzso
