Both insulin resistance and decreased insulin zzso have been hypothesized to be precursors of zzso zzso An elevated zzso concentration reflects abnormal zzso processing and could indicate abnormal insulin zzso We examined zzso insulin zzso by a zzso that does not zzso with zzso as a marker of insulin resistance, and zzso and the zzso zzso ratio, as markers of impaired zzso processing, in zzso zzso zzso from the San Antonio Heart zzso zzso insulin, zzso and the zzso zzso ratio were higher in subjects with a parental history of diabetes than in subjects without such a zzso These differences remained statistically significant after adjustment for zzso body fat distribution, and zzso zzso A parental history of diabetes in zzso zzso is associated with an increase in zzso specific insulin and a disproportionate increase in zzso relative to zzso These data suggest that both increased insulin resistance and abnormal processing of zzso are present in offspring of parents with zzso
