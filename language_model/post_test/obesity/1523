zzso zzso many proteins that regulate zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein and is known to be expressed abundantly in the zzso However, using gene expression profiles data we observed high expression of zzso in zzso zzso The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that zzso is strongly expressed in human zzso and zzso zzso and is related to obesity and clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso expression was analyzed with DNA zzso and real-time zzso and its association with clinical variables was zzso zzso protein expression was analyzed using western zzso zzso zzso expression was abundant in human zzso zzso zzso and zzso and higher in subcutaneous zzso compared to zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein expression in zzso zzso tissue were higher in obese compared to lean subjects zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was reduced after zzso weight loss zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was associated with zzso and clinical zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso is highly expressed in zzso zzso zzso increased in zzso down regulated after weight loss, and associated with measures of body size and zzso Together, this indicates that zzso merits further investigation as a regulator of human zzso
