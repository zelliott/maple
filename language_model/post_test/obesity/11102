We previously mapped a locus on zzso zzso 2 associated with protection from zzso zzso Here, we generated the corresponding zzso mouse strain by zzso of a segment of zzso zzso 2 to the zzso background to confirm the zzso zzso We found that the zzso zzso decreased fat mass expansion by limiting zzso zzso and zzso zzso This was zzso to an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso breakdown and zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso on zzso 2 exerted a zzso role in restraining the zzso potential of zzso Within a zzso critical zzso we identified a zzso coding single zzso zzso in the gene coding for the zzso zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso and showed that the zzso zzso of zzso is a zzso leading to the lack of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, altered zzso potential caused by zzso zzso is likely critically involved in zzso obesity resistance by zzso zzso and reducing zzso zzso Overall, we have identified a zzso zzso in zzso that contributes to the zzso 2 obesity quantitative trait zzso
