It has been previously reported that maximum zzso zzso transport and zzso were both zzso while zzso zzso was increased in zzso from obese subjects with zzso diabetes zzso zzso To determine whether these values can be returned towards those obtained in equally obese subjects with normal zzso zzso these measures of zzso metabolism were zzso in 10 zzso subjects before and after control of zzso with zzso The results demonstrate that maximum zzso zzso transport zzso less than zzso and zzso incorporation into zzso zzso less than zzso and CO2 zzso less than zzso (at zzso zzso zzso increased and zzso zzso decreased zzso less than zzso after 4 zzso of insulin zzso In contrast, zzso incorporation into zzso and other zzso zzso (at zzso zzso zzso and sensitivity of zzso transport to insulin, did not improve with insulin zzso The latter occurred despite an increase in insulin binding zzso less than zzso Finally, the improvement in zzso zzso zzso transport correlated with the fall in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso These findings demonstrate that several of the abnormalities of zzso and zzso metabolism recently noted to be present in zzso from patients with zzso can be shown to significantly improve with insulin zzso
