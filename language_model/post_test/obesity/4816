zzso zzso zzso may be a valid and practical technique to assess body composition in a clinical zzso 

This study aimed to assess zzso changes in body composition using zzso and to compare it with the zzso dilution zzso 

The study was a zzso dietary intervention, consisting of four zzso The first month, subjects were fed in energy balance zzso zzso This was followed by 1 month with an energy intake of zzso of energy requirements zzso zzso followed by 2 months at zzso of energy requirements zzso zzso and 2 months of ad zzso intake zzso zzso Body composition was assessed using zzso zzso zzso and zzso dilution at baseline and at the end of each zzso The baseline analysis included 111 subjects zzso zzso zzso subjects zzso zzso completed all zzso and were included in the zzso zzso 

At zzso the fat mass zzso as assessed with the zzso Pod was on average zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso higher than that assessed with zzso zzso The difference in zzso between techniques increased significantly with increasing zzso zzso zzso Both techniques showed significant changes in zzso over time zzso On average, zzso as assessed with the zzso Pod was zzso zzso higher than with zzso dilution zzso During phase II, there was a significant interaction between time and method, meaning that the zzso Pod showed a larger decrease in zzso than zzso zzso 

The zzso Pod was able to detect all changes in the body zzso but consistently measured a higher zzso than zzso zzso
