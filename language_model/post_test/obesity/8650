An increased plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso level is a risk factor for zzso zzso particularly when associated with visceral zzso Although the link between zzso and obesity is well zzso little is known about the zzso relevance of zzso production by zzso zzso zzso we have compared zzso tissue development and insulin resistance plasma parameters in zzso mice zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a model of nutritionally induced zzso After 17 weeks of consuming a high-fat diet zzso zzso mice showed marked zzso with a zzso increase in body weight compared with mice that were kept on a standard fat diet zzso This weight gain was accompanied by zzso zzso and an increase in the number of zzso cells in the zzso fat pad, expressed as zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso In zzso the zzso induced a marked increase in zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso whereas plasma zzso levels were not zzso When we compared zzso and zzso mice on the zzso zzso mice gained weight faster than did zzso mice, with a significant difference in body weight between 3 and 8 weeks of the diet zzso versus zzso g at 6 zzso zzso After 17 weeks of the zzso its effect on weight gain and the number and size of zzso was similar in zzso and zzso zzso By contrast, the increase in the number of zzso cells presented by zzso mice was not observed in zzso zzso In obese zzso mice, zzso PA activity and zzso levels in the zzso fat pad were significantly higher than in obese zzso mice zzso versus zzso arbitrary zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso respectively), whereas zzso PA activity and zzso levels were similar in both zzso In zzso zzso zzso mice displayed zzso higher insulin levels zzso than did zzso zzso zzso zzso mice displayed zzso higher zzso levels zzso and zzso lower zzso levels zzso than did zzso zzso These data support an effect of zzso on weight gain and zzso tissue zzso in the induction of obesity in zzso Moreover, zzso influences zzso zzso The elevated expression of zzso observed in human obesity could be involved in mechanisms that control zzso tissue zzso
