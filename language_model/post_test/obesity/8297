zzso is a growing health problem and is associated with adverse outcomes in coronary artery disease zzso However, recent studies have shown better survival in cardiovascular patients with overweight or zzso which has been referred to as the zzso zzso As there is no clear understanding of the phenomenon, we examined the association between body mass index zzso and zzso mortality in patients treated with zzso coronary intervention zzso at zzso zzso and the potential role of health status in explaining the obesity zzso 

zzso zzso patients zzso zzso mean age zzso zzso zzso years, range zzso from the zzso zzso zzso at Rotterdam zzso Hospital zzso registry completed the zzso zzso health survey zzso to assess health status at zzso Patients were classified into a normal weight, overweight or obesity zzso 

The prevalence of normal weight was zzso zzso overweight was seen in zzso zzso of patients, and zzso zzso was zzso After a median follow-up of zzso zzso zzso years, zzso deaths zzso from any cause were zzso zzso hazard functions differed significantly for the obese and overweight group when compared to the normal weight group zzso zzso zzso In multivariable analysis, overweight, but not zzso remained associated with a lower risk for zzso mortality zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, after adding the 8 health status zzso zzso to the zzso model, the association between overweight and mortality remained zzso 

In our study population overweight, but not zzso was associated with a lower risk for zzso mortality in zzso zzso Health status as measured with the zzso did not seem to play a role in explaining the obesity zzso
