The purpose of this study was to determine whether improvements in insulin sensitivity with weight loss are zzso by changes in inflammation in obese, zzso zzso 

We studied 58 zzso overweight, and obese zzso 33 zzso 1 zzso means zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso women at baseline and 37 women who completed 6 months of weight loss induced by diet and zzso The women underwent zzso zzso zzso (40 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to determine zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity was determined as zzso the amount of zzso zzso per unit of plasma insulin zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso and plasma zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso as well as their soluble zzso were zzso 

At zzso zzso concentration was a predictor of both zzso zzso and insulin sensitivity, independent of zzso race, and zzso fitness zzso partial r zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso partial r zzso zzso P zzso zzso Weight loss resulted in significant reductions in body weight, fat mass, zzso and zzso zzso and insulin levels zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and insulin sensitivity increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso but zzso of zzso zzso and soluble zzso zzso zzso did not zzso In zzso zzso models to predict changes in zzso zzso changes in zzso and zzso independently predicted changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cumulative r zzso zzso P zzso while changes in zzso and zzso were both independent zzso of changes in insulin sensitivity zzso zzso zzso and cumulative r zzso zzso P zzso 

zzso in zzso metabolism with weight loss programs are independently associated with decreases in zzso zzso suggesting that a reduction in inflammation is a potential mechanism that mediates improvements in insulin zzso
