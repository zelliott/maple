zzso zzso is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and decreased zzso zzso The objective of our study was to determine the effects of zzso on body composition and cardiovascular risk markers in zzso obese zzso 

In this randomized, zzso zzso study, 79 obese zzso women received zzso vs zzso for 6 zzso zzso zzso were zzso total abdominal zzso abdominal zzso zzso zzso fat by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso risk zzso Body composition was assessed by CT, zzso X-ray zzso and zzso MR zzso zzso cardiovascular risk zzso carotid zzso zzso and zzso function were zzso 

Mean zzso zzso dose was zzso zzso resulting in a mean zzso zzso increase from zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso administration decreased zzso and zzso compared with zzso In addition, it increased thigh muscle mass and lean body mass and decreased subcutaneous abdominal and trunk fat, tissue zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso decreased and zzso zzso increased within the zzso zzso zzso change in zzso levels was zzso associated with zzso decrease in zzso and zzso One subject had a 2 h zzso zzso at 3 zzso four subjects, three of whom were zzso to zzso had 2 h zzso zzso zzso at the end of the zzso 

zzso administration in zzso obese zzso women exerts beneficial effects on body composition and cardiovascular risk markers but is associated with a decrease in zzso tolerance in a minority of zzso
