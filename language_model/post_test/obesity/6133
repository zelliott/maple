zzso cassette zzso zzso zzso and scavenger zzso class B type I zzso are the three most important cellular cholesterol zzso in regulating cholesterol zzso We have investigated whether the expression of these zzso is altered in overweight and obese patients, and the potential association with the circulating zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in two groups of healthy controls, overweight and obese zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso was zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was also zzso 

zzso zzso was zzso whereas zzso and zzso were increased in overweight and obese patients compared with healthy zzso zzso expression was significantly decreased in overweight and obese patients zzso whereas the levels of zzso and zzso were comparable between the two zzso zzso was correlated with zzso zzso zzso but not with zzso and zzso No associations between zzso zzso and the expression of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso or to zzso serum was significantly impaired in overweight and obese patients, which were correlated with zzso expression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The expression of zzso in zzso is reduced in overweight and obese patients, and the reduction in zzso is associated with the impairment of cholesterol zzso from zzso zzso
