zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein that can diminish the zzso membrane zzso zzso of muscle zzso zzso are increased by zzso hormone and zzso zzso has been proposed to influence zzso efficiency and is a candidate obesity zzso We have produced a zzso knockout mouse to test these zzso The zzso zzso mice had no zzso zzso zzso by Western zzso In zzso from the knockout mice, zzso leak was greatly reduced in muscle, minimally reduced in brown fat, and not reduced at all in zzso These data suggest that zzso accounts for much of the zzso leak in skeletal zzso Despite the lack of zzso no consistent zzso zzso was zzso The knockout mice were not obese and had normal serum insulin, zzso and zzso levels, with a tendency toward reduced free fatty acids and zzso zzso mice showed a normal zzso rhythm in body temperature and motor activity and had normal body temperature responses to zzso stress, zzso hormone, and cold zzso The zzso zzso rate and respiratory exchange ratio were the same in knockout and control mice, as were the effects of zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso hormone on these zzso The zzso of zzso double knockout mice was indistinguishable from zzso single knockout zzso These data suggest that zzso is not a major zzso of zzso rate but, rather, has other zzso
