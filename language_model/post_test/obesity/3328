To investigate the influence of nocturnal oxygen zzso on the zzso rhythm of testosterone zzso zzso was performed on 2 consecutive nights in 24 male subjects who complained of loud zzso and/or zzso During the first night, we collected blood samples every 4 h via a zzso and measured serum zzso We arbitrarily defined severe oxygen zzso as that exceeding the baseline zzso by zzso during 80 zzso of total sleep zzso The subjects were divided into 2 groups from the data of the second night; one was the severe zzso group as mentioned above, and those who suffered less zzso were classified as the free to mild oxygen zzso zzso We found that in the latter group peak testosterone levels appeared at 6 zzso On the other hand, the severe zzso group exhibited delayed peak testosterone levels, zzso at 10 zzso We calculated the ratio of the testosterone level at 10 zzso to that at 6 zzso and found a significant correlation between this ratio and total zzso time zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso These data suggest that severe oxygen zzso may alter the zzso rhythm of testosterone zzso
