zzso zzso of 8 zzso was induced for 28 days in normal zzso rats by zzso a zzso zzso containing the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso rats exhibited a zzso reduction in food intake and gained only 22 g over the experimental period versus zzso g in control animals that received saline infusions or a zzso virus containing the zzso gene zzso zzso Body fat was absent in zzso rats, whereas control rats zzso to the zzso rats retained approximately 50% body zzso Further, plasma zzso and insulin levels were significantly lower in zzso versus zzso controls, while fatty acid and zzso levels were similar in the two groups, suggestive of enhanced insulin sensitivity in the zzso zzso Thus, despite equivalent reductions in food intake and weight gain in zzso and zzso animals, identifiable fat tissue was completely zzso only in the former group, raising the possibility of a specific zzso activity for zzso
