To determine whether whole body insulin sensitivity differs between a rat strain that does not zzso zzso and a strain that does zzso zzso become obese when eating a high-fat diet, we performed zzso clamp studies in animals from each strain during low- and high-fat zzso zzso were performed after 2 days zzso zzso and 9 days zzso zzso on each zzso Plasma zzso and insulin levels during the final 60 zzso of initial and final zzso were similar in S zzso and zzso rats regardless of zzso zzso sensitivity, measured as the zzso clearance rate during the final 60 zzso of the zzso averaged 35 zzso 3 zzso in S zzso rats after 2 days on a low-fat zzso This did not change significantly during an additional 7 days on the low-fat zzso The high-fat diet was associated with a zzso reduction in insulin sensitivity after 2 days and a zzso reduction after 9 days in S zzso zzso zzso rats exhibited similar patterns of insulin sensitivity during low- and high-fat zzso albeit at lower insulin sensitivity overall zzso zzso zzso S zzso Mean zzso clearance after 2 days on the low-fat diet was 27 zzso 2 zzso and did not change significantly during seven more days of low-fat zzso The high-fat diet was associated with a zzso reduction in zzso clearance after 2 days and a 38% reduction after 9 days in zzso zzso The magnitude of reduction in insulin sensitivity during high-fat diets did not differ significantly between zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
