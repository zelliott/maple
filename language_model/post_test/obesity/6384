The primary objective was to examine whether the combination of diet and zzso exercise zzso or diet and resistance exercise zzso is associated with greater improvements in zzso risk factors by comparison to diet only zzso in obese zzso A second objective considered whether reductions in zzso risk factors are related to concurrent changes in abdominal and/or zzso fat zzso 

A total of 38 zzso obese women were randomly assigned to one of three zzso zzso DO zzso zzso zzso or DR zzso Plasma zzso insulin, and zzso levels were measured in a zzso state and after a zzso oral zzso challenge zzso zzso tolerance test zzso zzso abdominal zzso zzso and zzso fat were measured by magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso reductions zzso zzso in body weight zzso 10 zzso or zzso and in total, abdominal zzso zzso and zzso fat were observed within each zzso zzso and zzso insulin, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and zzso B also decreased within each group zzso zzso zzso zzso The changes in the body fat and zzso variables were not different across treatment zzso zzso zzso fat alone was related to the zzso risk factors both before and after the zzso 

Weight loss was associated with reductions in zzso risk factors in obese zzso The improvement in the zzso profile was not enhanced by the addition of zzso or resistance zzso The findings reinforce the importance of diminished visceral fat in the treatment of insulin zzso
