The relationship between obesity and osteoporosis has been widely zzso and zzso evidence shows that obesity is correlated with increased bone zzso Previous zzso however, did not control for the mechanical loading effects of total body weight on bone mass and may have generated a zzso or even biased relationship between obesity and zzso 

The objective of this study was to zzso the relationship between obesity and osteoporosis by accounting for the mechanical loading effects of total body weight on bone zzso 

We measured whole body fat mass, lean mass, percentage fat mass, body mass index, and bone mass in two large samples of different zzso 1988 unrelated Chinese subjects and zzso Caucasian subjects from 512 zzso We first evaluated the zzso correlations among different zzso We then dissected the zzso correlations into genetic and environmental components with bone mass zzso or adjusted for body zzso This allowed us to compare the results with and without controlling for mechanical loading effects of body weight on bone zzso 

In both Chinese and Caucasian subjects, when the mechanical loading effect of body weight on bone mass was adjusted for, the zzso correlation (including its genetic and environmental zzso between fat mass (or percentage fat zzso and bone mass was zzso Further zzso analyses in subjects zzso by body weight confirmed the inverse relationship between bone mass and fat mass, after mechanical loading effects due to total body weight were zzso 

zzso fat mass may not have a beneficial effect on bone zzso
