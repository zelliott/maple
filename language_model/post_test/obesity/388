The aim was to examine the role of zzso zzso inflammation in the development of obese linked insulin resistance and fatty zzso The rats were fed separately regular diet zzso high-fat diet zzso ad zzso or energy zzso for 12 zzso zzso fed zzso ad zzso were further divided into three zzso zzso with vehicle zzso or a selective zzso inhibitor zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso clamp zzso experiment was performed at the end of zzso Another set of rats with similar grouping was further divided into those with a 4, 8, or zzso intervention period for zzso zzso Body weight was increased significantly and similarly in zzso zzso and zzso zzso increases in plasma insulin, zzso zzso zzso levels, zzso model assessment of insulin resistance zzso and zzso zzso contents shown in zzso were significantly reversed in zzso and zzso During zzso period, the reduction in stimulation of whole body zzso zzso suppression of zzso zzso production and zzso clearance rate of insulin shown in zzso were significantly reversed in zzso and zzso The enhanced zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso but attenuated zzso and zzso zzso expressions in zzso fat shown in zzso were significantly reversed in zzso and zzso The increases in average cell size of zzso and zzso positive cells shown in zzso were also significantly reversed in zzso and zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso in fat inflammation is important in the development of insulin resistance and fatty liver in high fat induced obese zzso
