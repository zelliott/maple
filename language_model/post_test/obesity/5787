To assess whether the insulin zzso zzso gene contributes to genetic zzso to zzso zzso syndrome zzso in a Japanese zzso 

We zzso the frequency of the His zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso found in zzso 17 of the zzso gene in 61 Japanese zzso patients and 99 Japanese healthy zzso In addition, we analyzed the association between the zzso of this zzso and the clinical zzso 

The frequency of the zzso zzso was not significantly different between all zzso patients zzso and controls zzso However, among the lean cases zzso mass index zzso zzso 20 zzso the frequency of the zzso zzso was significantly increased zzso zzso in zzso patients zzso as compared with controls zzso 

We concluded that the His zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso domain of the zzso gene had a relationship to the zzso of lean zzso patients in a Japanese zzso
