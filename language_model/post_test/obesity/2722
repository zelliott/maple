zzso and ecological zzso suggest a positive association of overweight and obesity with the risk of zzso germ cell cancer zzso Previous controlled trials reported conflicting zzso The present study aimed to zzso the putative association of overweight with zzso risk in a large patient sample and to zzso previous zzso 

A total of zzso zzso patients were enrolled in a nationwide zzso case control zzso zzso body dimensions were recorded for calculation of the body mass index zzso zzso For comparison, zzso zzso male zzso of the latest German National Health zzso zzso were zzso Patients and controls were zzso according to age as zzso zzso zzso and zzso years, respectively, and according to zzso as zzso zzso zzso to zzso 25 to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the three age groups were tabulated and compared zzso The literature was searched for previous controlled trials regarding zzso and zzso zzso 

The median zzso of all zzso patients is zzso zzso zzso comparison of zzso of zzso categories of cases and controls did not reveal any significant zzso However, in young men zzso zzso zzso categories 25 to zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly more frequent in zzso patients than in controls zzso zzso zzso previous studies were identified in the literature, one of which being clearly in accordance with the present hypothesis, one being antithetical while the remaining studies were zzso in various zzso 

The results of this zzso study lend support to two hypotheses regarding the zzso of zzso First, as zzso nutrition is the most important reason for increased zzso it appears conceivable that nutritional factors are involved in the zzso of zzso Second, as zzso is the most prevalent zzso zzso among younger patients, the association of increased zzso with zzso of zzso in this particular zzso may point to divergent zzso pathways of zzso and zzso zzso
