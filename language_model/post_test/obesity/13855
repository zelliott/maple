To examine the relationship of coronary zzso zzso zzso expression with zzso zzso and central fat zzso in zzso zzso 

A total of 52 female forensic autopsy cases aged between 18 and 49 zzso 

zzso body weight and waist and hip zzso were measured and body mass index zzso and zzso ratio zzso were zzso zzso thickness or zzso thickness of the plaque were measured from samples taken from the left anterior descending artery zzso zzso zzso and smooth muscle cells were localized by zzso zzso was detected zzso and by Western zzso analysis, and the zzso zzso area in the zzso was zzso 

zzso zzso was observed in the zzso in zzso of the samples, and it was most intense in the advanced plaques near the zzso core next to the zzso intensity of zzso zzso The zzso zzso area had a significant positive correlation with zzso zzso zzso which in turn was significantly correlated with waist circumference and zzso when adjusted for age and zzso 

zzso women with the central type of fat zzso have advanced coronary plaques in which zzso expression is localized near the zzso and zzso zzso The higher expression of zzso in the zzso plaques may represent a zzso mechanism against zzso
