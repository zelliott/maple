A fraction of human zzso extract containing low molecular weight zzso was found to impair zzso tolerance in obese yellow zzso zzso X zzso zzso hybrid female zzso In these mice, zzso human zzso was not zzso zzso tolerance of zzso yellow mice was somewhat less impaired than that of zzso zzso mice, and zzso with zzso was not required to elicit impairment of zzso zzso The lean zzso zzso zzso of the yellow mice did not respond to the zzso zzso suggesting that an zzso animal is required for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Plasma insulin levels of the obese yellow mice treated with the zzso zzso were significantly decreased compared to those of zzso zzso No decrease in plasma insulin was observed in the similarly treated lean zzso zzso The study demonstrated that the yellow zzso zzso X zzso zzso hybrid mouse is a suitable animal for investigation of the zzso mechanism of action of the zzso zzso zzso
