The relationship was evaluated between early nutritional experiences, the zzso zzso and the small zzso functions in the mechanism of predisposition to obesity zzso Male zzso rats were used in which the quantity of nutrition was manipulated from birth to weaning zzso 30) by adjusting the number of zzso in the nest to 4 small litters zzso and 10 normal litters zzso and fed a standard diet from days 30 to 40 of zzso After 40 zzso the zzso overfed zzso zzso became zzso displayed significantly enhanced zzso body mass gain and food intake as well as a significantly higher zzso alkaline zzso and zzso activity than in rats nursed in NL zzso The effect of different early nutrition was also accompanied by the appearance of significantly decreased zzso and significantly increased zzso and zzso of obese rats than in lean NL zzso The amounts of zzso were zzso correlated with fat pad mass, body mass, zzso gain and food intake whereas zzso and zzso were correlated positively with the same zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso nutritional experience may represent a zzso factor influencing zzso of small zzso function and development of zzso microbial zzso The acquired changes and associated zzso in food zzso could be a component of regulatory mechanisms contributing to the development of obesity and its maintenance in later zzso
