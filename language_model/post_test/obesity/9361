zzso zzso 1 zzso mediates zzso zzso of dietary and zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso function, is widely used to treat zzso in zzso Interestingly, zzso treatment appears to zzso zzso zzso in zzso and humans without a defined zzso zzso of a high-fat diet zzso represents a major cause of zzso disorders including fatty zzso To determine whether and how zzso zzso prevents zzso zzso zzso in this study, we fed zzso knockout zzso mice and their zzso zzso controls an zzso and found that 24 weeks of zzso feeding causes no fatty liver in zzso zzso zzso fatty acid synthesis and levels of zzso for zzso genes are substantially reduced but zzso zzso production, fatty acid zzso and zzso zzso remain zzso in zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso mice are completely protected against zzso zzso under both fed and zzso states and during zzso zzso Despite similar zzso zzso zzso relative zzso mice are more insulin sensitive and in the zzso state display significantly lower plasma zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso in mice prevents zzso fatty liver by reducing zzso zzso at least in part, through attenuating zzso insulin resistance, a state known to drive zzso zzso through elevated circulating insulin zzso
