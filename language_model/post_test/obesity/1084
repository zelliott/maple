This study was designed to compare the effects of dietary supplementation with zzso zzso differing in zzso by zzso bacteria, on zzso zzso in growing obese zzso zzso Male zzso zzso rats were divided into three groups: a control group that received the zzso diet, a zzso group that received 10 g highly fermented zzso zzso g diet and a cellulose group that received 10 g poorly fermented zzso zzso zzso g zzso zzso consuming zzso had a lower energy zzso a lower body weight and less zzso zzso in the liver as assessed in zzso by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso and ex zzso by zzso and zzso analysis compared with the control and/or cellulose zzso The high zzso of zzso compared with cellulose was reflected by greater zzso contents and by a twofold greater zzso concentration in the portal vein of rats fed zzso compared with those fed zzso By measuring the capacity of zzso isolated from liver of zzso rats to zzso zzso or total lipids from different zzso we showed that zzso at the zzso measured in the portal vein of rats treated with zzso selectively decreased the incorporation of zzso into total zzso a phenomenon that could zzso along with the lower energy zzso to less zzso zzso in the liver of obese zzso rats fed dietary zzso
