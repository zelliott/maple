High serum zzso acid levels lead to zzso and have been reported to be associated with an increased risk of hypertension, zzso zzso syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular zzso Recently, the putative zzso zzso zzso was reported to influence zzso acid zzso The aim of the present study was to examine the association of four single zzso zzso within this gene with zzso acid levels and to determine whether this association is modified by zzso 

Four single zzso zzso within zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in the zzso prospective zzso Study zzso zzso zzso and in a zzso study from Utah including zzso subjects recruited for severe obesity and zzso control zzso 

We observed highly significant associations between all four zzso and zzso acid levels in all study zzso Each copy of the minor zzso decreased zzso and zzso zzso acid levels by zzso zzso on average, which translates to a relative decrease of zzso with P values ranging from zzso to zzso in the combined zzso An extended adjustment for zzso zzso zzso medication, and alcohol intake improved P values to a range of zzso to zzso The association was more pronounced in women and the zzso zzso Study and was significantly modified by zzso with stronger effect sizes in individuals with high zzso 

zzso zzso within zzso have significant effects on zzso acid levels and are modified by sex and zzso
