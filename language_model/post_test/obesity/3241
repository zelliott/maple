zzso adjustments occur with weight loss that may contribute to a high rate of weight zzso We have previously observed in zzso obese rats that weight reduction is accompanied by a suppression in resting zzso rate beyond what would be predicted for the change in zzso zzso In the present study, we examine if this adjustment in zzso efficiency is affected by the length of time in weight maintenance and if it contributes to the propensity to regain after weight zzso zzso zzso and resting energy expenditure zzso were obtained by indirect zzso and zzso to zzso mass estimated by zzso X-ray zzso A zzso loss in body weight in zzso rats was accompanied by a zzso suppression in adjusted zzso This enhancement in zzso efficiency was not altered with either 8 or 16 zzso of weight zzso but it did resolve when the forced control of intake was removed and the weight was zzso The rate of weight regain increased with the time in weight maintenance and was exceptionally high early during the zzso zzso During this high rate of weight gain, the suppression in zzso persists while consumption increases to a level that is higher than when they were zzso In zzso an enhanced zzso efficiency and an elevated appetite both contribute zzso and zzso zzso to a large potential energy imbalance that, when the zzso control of energy intake is zzso becomes zzso and results in an exceptionally high rate of weight zzso
