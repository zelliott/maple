Male and female zzso rats were made zzso and obese with bilateral zzso heat zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso rats were maintained at 28 degrees C, their brown zzso tissue zzso DNA, zzso and zzso zzso contents were normal although more stored zzso was present, as judged from a zzso increase in wet zzso zzso activity of BAT zzso was normal in male zzso rats, as judged from the unchanged level of zzso zzso zzso binding zzso to be a sensitive index of the functional activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and reduced in female zzso zzso When rats with zzso zzso were exposed to cold (4 degrees C for 24 zzso the visible zzso of their BAT and normal large increase in zzso zzso binding indicated normal zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso of the zzso and associated zzso or zzso nerve tracts do not represent an essential central nervous system link for zzso zzso zzso of BAT zzso It is possible, however, that zzso zzso zzso of BAT function and growth might require an intact zzso region because no enhancement of BAT zzso function normally associated with zzso was detected in these zzso zzso zzso
