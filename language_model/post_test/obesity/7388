zzso is a potent risk factor in knee zzso zzso It has been suggested that zzso zzso by zzso tissue zzso and largely found in the zzso fluid of zzso patients, derive in part from the zzso fat pad zzso also known as Hoffa's fat zzso The goal of this study was to characterize zzso tissue in obese zzso patients and to compare its features with thigh subcutaneous AT to determine whether the zzso contributes to local inflammation in knee zzso via production of specific zzso 

zzso and subcutaneous AT samples were obtained from 11 obese women zzso mass zzso or zzso zzso with knee zzso zzso Gene expression was measured by real-time quantitative zzso chain zzso zzso zzso in plasma and in zzso media of cultured AT zzso were determined by zzso zzso zzso or by zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso tissue versus subcutaneous zzso there was a decrease in the expression of genes for key zzso implicated in zzso zzso zzso whereas the expression levels of genes for AT markers remained zzso A zzso increase in the expression of the gene for zzso zzso a zzso increase in the release of zzso and a zzso increase in the release of soluble zzso zzso zzso were observed in zzso samples, compared with subcutaneous zzso but the rates of zzso of other zzso in zzso samples were similar to the rates in subcutaneous zzso In addition, zzso zzso was decreased by zzso whereas zzso zzso was increased by zzso in zzso samples versus subcutaneous zzso 

Our results indicate that the zzso zzso profile typically found in zzso patients could play a role in zzso inflammation via the local production of zzso and that such a profile might contribute to damage in adjacent zzso
