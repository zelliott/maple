The zzso sleep zzso syndrome zzso is associated with increased visceral zzso tissue zzso in adults; however, few studies have evaluated zzso in relation to upper airway function in zzso We hypothesized that increased neck circumference zzso and zzso would be associated with increased upper airway zzso 

zzso (24 obese patients with zzso 22 obese control patients, and 29 lean control zzso underwent abdominal magnetic resonance imaging, and measurement of upper airway zzso relationships in the activated and zzso upper airway zzso 

Patients with zzso had a greater activated slope of the zzso relationship zzso than control groups zzso zzso whereas zzso SPF was greater in both obese groups compared with lean control patients zzso zzso zzso NC and zzso were greater in obese control patients and those with zzso than in lean control patients zzso zzso but did not differ between obese patients with zzso and obese control zzso In lean control patients and those with zzso increased NC was associated with increased activated zzso whereas in obese control patients it was associated with decreased activated SPF zzso zzso zzso In contrast, increased NC was associated with increased zzso SPF in all groups zzso zzso There was no significant effect of zzso on either activated or zzso SPF for any of the three zzso 

Increased neck circumference was associated with increased upper airway zzso in adolescents in the zzso but not activated zzso These data suggest that obese adolescents without zzso despite a narrowed upper airway from zzso zzso are protected from developing zzso by upper airway zzso zzso Neither neck circumference nor visceral zzso tissue is useful in predicting upper airway zzso in obese zzso
