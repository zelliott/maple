This study was carried out to investigate the pattern of zzso zzso that occur in the obese zzso zzso rat during food zzso The functional zzso of zzso was estimated in lean and obese zzso rats either fed ad zzso or zzso for 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours by assessing the expression of the immediate early gene zzso To identify the zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso axis in zzso obese rats, the retrograde zzso zzso toxin B zzso was injected in the zzso division of the zzso zzso nucleus of obese rats and zzso with zzso zzso during food zzso The expression of zzso was barely zzso in zzso lean rats as well as in lean and obese animals fed ad zzso However, 3 hours of food deprivation were sufficient to significantly induce zzso in the zzso zzso nucleus of obese zzso In addition, 6 and 12 hours of food deprivation resulted in the zzso of regions that are similarly zzso in zzso zzso These regions include the zzso division of the zzso zzso nucleus, the lateral zzso the zzso amygdala, and some areas of the zzso The highest number of zzso projecting to the zzso division of the zzso zzso nucleus and revealing zzso zzso was, however, located in the zzso zzso zzso In zzso the present results demonstrate in the obese zzso zzso rats, that food deprivation leads to brain zzso which are in large part, similar to those induced by a zzso stress and that the zzso zzso nucleus is involved in this zzso These changes could contribute to the development of zzso and zzso
