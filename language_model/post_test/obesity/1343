The zzso environment may be a critical period for the development of zzso zzso most of the zzso of relative weight from birth to adulthood may be genetic in zzso This study tested whether birth weight zzso into adulthood, independent of genetic zzso 

zzso twin zzso Birth weights and zzso ages from birth records of zzso twins from the Minnesota Twin zzso including zzso zzso zzso male pairs, zzso zzso zzso male pairs, zzso zzso female pairs, 880 zzso female pairs, and zzso opposite sex zzso pairs ages zzso 28 to 52 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared to zzso adult height and zzso 

The correlation of birth weight with adult height was zzso with adult weight zzso and with adult body mass index zzso (all zzso zzso To test if this tracking was independent of genetic zzso we analyzed zzso differences for zzso zzso If differences in birth weight between members of a zzso twin pair correlate with adult relative weight, this association cannot be attributed to genetic zzso The correlation of zzso differences in birth weight with zzso differences in adult height was zzso zzso zzso with adult weight zzso zzso zzso and with adult zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were unchanged when zzso zzso modeling was zzso 

These data suggest that the zzso environmental influences on birth weight have an enduring impact on adult height but not on adult relative zzso This suggests that the zzso period is a critical period for the development of height but not for zzso
