To evaluate the association between zzso zzso and headaches among zzso 

zzso analysis of 11 zzso identified after searching for all large publicly available zzso cohort study zzso containing relevant zzso zzso included National Health zzso zzso zzso zzso the first National Health zzso and Nutrition Survey, zzso County Health Study zzso zzso Community Health Study zzso and Women's Health Initiative zzso The women zzso in total) were aged 18 years or older and had reported their headache or migraine zzso 

Using zzso zzso techniques and models adjusted for age, race, and smoking, we found that increased zzso was generally associated with increased likelihood of headache or severe headache among zzso A zzso of approximately 20 was associated with the lowest risk of zzso Relative to a zzso of 20, mild obesity zzso of 30) was associated with roughly a zzso increase in the odds for experiencing headache whereas severe obesity zzso of 40) was associated with roughly an zzso increase in zzso zzso were essentially unchanged when models were further adjusted for socioeconomic zzso alcohol consumption, and zzso Being diagnosed with migraine showed no association with zzso 

Among US women, a zzso of approximately 20 (about the 5th zzso was associated with the lowest likelihood of zzso zzso across studies, obese women had significantly increased risk for zzso By contrast, the risk for diagnosed migraine headache per zzso was not obviously related to zzso The direction of causation and mechanisms of action remain to be zzso
