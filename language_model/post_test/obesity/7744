To evaluate the effect of pomegranate juice on insulin zzso and sensitivity in patients with zzso 

A randomized, zzso zzso clinical trial was carried out in 20 obese, adult volunteer zzso After random allocation of the intervention, 10 patients received 120 zzso of pomegranate juice or zzso while in a zzso state for 1 zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso profile, and insulin were measured at zzso and zzso and insulin were also measured at 30, 60, 90, and 120 zzso The area under the curve of zzso and insulin, total insulin zzso and insulin sensitivity was zzso 

There was a significant increase in weight, body mass index, and fat mass in the zzso group after the zzso zzso zzso and insulin sensitivity were not modified with administration of pomegranate zzso There was a significant difference in changes from baseline in fat mass between groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso and pomegranate groups, zzso 

zzso juice administration for 1 month did not modify insulin zzso and sensitivity in patients with zzso however, the natural evolution to increased weight and zzso was zzso
