zzso and type 2 diabetes zzso associate with increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been suggested to be one of the zzso zzso in zzso responsible for the zzso zzso Our aim was to investigate the associations between plasma zzso zzso to zzso inflammatory zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso to zzso were measured in a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the Finnish Health 2000 zzso The associations between zzso levels, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso 

zzso to zzso associated positively with zzso plasma zzso zzso to zzso were higher among subjects with zzso zzso zzso compared to subjects with normal zzso zzso zzso to zzso associated with zzso but was not independently zzso zzso zzso not significant after correction for multiple zzso associated with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso all associated with markers of zzso zzso 

zzso subjects had increased zzso to zzso compared to subjects with normal zzso zzso The data suggest that the associations between zzso to zzso and markers of zzso metabolism were independent of zzso but dependent on components of the zzso zzso
