To compare the zzso and zzso activity of three drug zzso zzso plus zzso zzso and zzso against two organisms frequently isolated in zzso infection, zzso coli and zzso zzso 

zzso three-way crossover zzso 

Hartford Hospital Clinical Research zzso 

Nine healthy zzso 

zzso received the following zzso zzso a single zzso intravenous dose of zzso plus a single zzso oral dose of zzso zzso two intravenous doses of zzso 2 g each dose given every 6 hours; and zzso two intravenous doses of zzso 3 g each dose given every 6 zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and drug zzso were measured over a 12-hour zzso The zzso regimen showed superior activity against zzso coli compared with zzso and zzso The mean areas under the zzso activity curve zzso for the three regimens were zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso There was no significant difference in zzso among the three regimens for zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso remained above the minimum zzso concentration zzso for zzso coli significantly longer than did zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso were still at 9 times the zzso for zzso zzso at the end of the 12-hour dosing zzso for zzso and zzso zzso remained above the zzso for one-half and less than zzso respectively, of the dosing zzso zzso zzso The ratio of zzso was also favorable for zzso zzso compared with zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso 

The combination of zzso even at the relatively low doses used in this study, provides coverage against zzso and zzso pathogens that is at least as effective as that of zzso and zzso In addition, its cost is considerably less expensive than that of the other zzso
