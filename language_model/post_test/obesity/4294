zzso data and results from animal studies indicate that imbalances in maternal nutrition impact the expression of zzso disorders in the zzso We tested the hypothesis that consumption of excess saturated fats during pregnancy and zzso contributes to adult zzso dysfunction and that these disturbances can be further influenced by the zzso zzso Adult male offspring from zzso zzso were compared with males from zzso fed a diet high in saturated fat zzso zzso zzso before zzso pregnancy, and zzso zzso were weaned to a standard zzso diet or high fat zzso Animals were killed at 120 days after a zzso zzso Body weight, energy zzso fat deposition, serum zzso and insulin were significantly higher in offspring from control or high-fat zzso if fed a high-fat diet from weaning to zzso Only zzso offspring from zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Y zzso were also significantly increased in offspring exposed to excess saturated fat during gestation and into adulthood, whereas zzso zzso was zzso Signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso level was significantly higher in offspring from zzso zzso compared with zzso however, no change was detected in cocaine and zzso transcript or zzso of zzso signaling zzso An increase in zzso protein expression did not reach zzso A significant reduction in zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso coupled to an zzso of protein zzso B was observed in offspring from zzso zzso zzso to zzso food, whereas zzso expression was significantly increased in high-fat offspring weaned to the high-fat zzso These data support the hypothesis that early life exposure to excess fat is associated with changes in zzso regulation of body weight and energy zzso and that zzso diet influences development of zzso dysfunction and zzso
