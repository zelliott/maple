To examine the maternal and zzso factors associated with offspring zzso and the role of birth and zzso weight as potential zzso in such zzso 

The zzso zzso Health zzso was a prospective cohort study conducted between 1988 and 1995 in Australia to investigate the cause of zzso zzso Death zzso This large infant cohort provides measurement of zzso on zzso mothers and their zzso 

Participants included zzso born zzso weeks gestation who were at high risk of sudden infant death syndrome identified through a composite score that included birth weight, maternal age, zzso zzso season of birth, duration of second-stage labor and intention to zzso 

Neonatal zzso was assessed from zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso folds zzso taken at zzso zzso zzso body mass index zzso was calculated from zzso height and zzso Neonatal data were extracted from birth zzso Data relating to other environmental zzso were obtained from questionnaires administered when zzso were zzso zzso 

In multivariable models, higher maternal zzso increasing maternal age, gestation age, delivery by zzso section and female gender were associated with larger zzso independent of zzso and birth weight zzso zzso age and delivery by zzso section were significantly associated with larger zzso whereas zzso age and male gender were associated with thinner zzso independent of zzso and birth zzso Higher zzso zzso maternal weight gain, maternal age, parity and zzso age were significantly associated with larger zzso and birth zzso Smoking during pregnancy was associated with smaller birth weight but not with zzso zzso 

In addition to birth weight, maternal zzso and zzso weight were important additional factors associated with zzso zzso
