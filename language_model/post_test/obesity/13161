Acute or chronic zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso increases insulin zzso zzso reduced expression and/or function of zzso might play a role in insulin resistance in type 2 zzso Thus protein expression of the seven zzso zzso of zzso and activities and/or zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was measured in skeletal muscle from obese type 2 diabetic and zzso control subjects during zzso zzso zzso expression of all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in muscle of obese type 2 diabetic subjects was similar to that of control zzso In addition, zzso and zzso activities of zzso zzso of zzso zzso at zzso and zzso of zzso at zzso showed no difference between the two groups and were not regulated by zzso zzso of zzso These data suggest that impaired insulin action on zzso synthesis and zzso zzso in skeletal muscle of obese type 2 diabetic subjects is unlikely to involve changes in zzso expression and zzso
