Heart rate recovery zzso is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease zzso and zzso but whether it is modifiable and can improve with weight loss is zzso We sought to determine the effects of weight loss on zzso and its association with traditional zzso risk zzso 

Heart rate recovery zzso as the decrease in heart rate from peak heart rate to that measured 1 minute after a standardized graded treadmill zzso and a range of established cardiovascular risk factors were measured in 42 overweight and obese men zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso mean age zzso zzso zzso zzso who had no symptoms of zzso but had components of the zzso syndrome before and after 12 weeks of weight zzso 

There was a zzso weight reduction zzso zzso with losses of zzso zzso zzso zzso of fat mass zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso mass zzso zzso There were significant reductions in waist zzso blood pressure, plasma zzso total cholesterol, zzso zzso cholesterol, zzso zzso ratio, zzso zzso plasma insulin, zzso and insulin resistance zzso zzso Although peak heart rate remained zzso zzso at 1 minute improved from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after weight zzso There was no change in zzso fitness zzso zzso zzso neither was there any change in physical activity levels zzso zzso zzso The improvement in zzso was significantly correlated with decreases in body weight, body mass index, waist zzso plasma zzso serum zzso and zzso zzso zzso however, it was only independently associated with changes in weight and plasma zzso zzso 

In addition to improving a range of zzso cardiovascular and zzso risk factors, weight loss also improves zzso after exercise, a less recognized risk zzso
