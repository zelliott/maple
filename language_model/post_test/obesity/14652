The International zzso zzso has determined the linkage zzso zzso patterns of four major human zzso The aim of our investigation was to compare the zzso patterns of the zzso zzso zzso zzso du zzso zzso samples with a zzso cohort of similar ancestry to determine its usefulness as a reference population for disease association zzso We examined four zzso regions on zzso zzso zzso and zzso totaling zzso zzso initially identified in our linkage study of obesity and the zzso zzso Near identical patterns of zzso were detected in both zzso Furthermore, zzso selected based on the zzso zzso cohort data capture over zzso of the zzso at an zzso zzso in the disease zzso This confirms the usefulness of the zzso cohort of the zzso as a reference sample for further investigations into the zzso variation of populations of Northern European zzso
