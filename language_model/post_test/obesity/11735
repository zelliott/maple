Our purpose was to evaluate women without zzso diabetes zzso in an index pregnancy for the likelihood that zzso diabetes would develop and for risk factors for zzso intolerance in a subsequent zzso 

A retrospective review of medical records at a teaching hospital universally screening for zzso diabetes identified zzso women who had been delivered twice between 1994 and 1997 and who, in the first zzso pregnancy, had had a normal result on a screening test with 50 g of zzso used in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In this population with normal zzso screening values in the index pregnancy, 352 zzso of zzso women had at least one risk factor for zzso zzso However, none of the zzso women had zzso diabetes in the subsequent pregnancy zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso including 45 zzso zzso who had an abnormal result on the zzso zzso screening zzso zzso analysis showed this test result in the index pregnancy zzso zzso to be the only studied variable significantly associated with the zzso zzso value in the subsequent zzso 

Despite a high rate of risk factors for zzso diabetes, women in our population with a normal zzso value in an index pregnancy have a minimal risk zzso that zzso diabetes will develop in a subsequent singleton pregnancy within 4 zzso This factor may be included in determining whether women should undergo screening for zzso zzso
