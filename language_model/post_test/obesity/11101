Decades of research in zzso models has shown that early zzso zzso zzso excess zzso and other components of zzso syndrome that persist into zzso The specific zzso mechanisms explaining the persistence of these effects, however, remain zzso On zzso day 1 zzso mice were fostered in control zzso or small litters zzso zzso mice had increased body weight and zzso at weaning zzso which persisted to adulthood zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that female adult zzso mice have decreased physical activity and energy expenditure but not increased food zzso zzso DNA zzso profiling identified extensive changes in zzso DNA zzso during the zzso period, suggesting that it is a critical period for zzso zzso in the mouse zzso Indeed, zzso mice exhibited subtle and zzso changes in zzso DNA zzso that persisted from early life to adulthood, providing a potential zzso basis for the sustained zzso zzso zzso profiling in adult zzso likewise provided evidence of widespread zzso zzso in gene zzso Together, our data indicate that early zzso zzso leads to a reduction in spontaneous physical activity and energy expenditure in females and suggest that early zzso life is a critical period during which nutrition can affect zzso zzso zzso
