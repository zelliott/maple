The prevalence of zzso hypertension, and type 2 diabetes zzso is increasing in the United zzso In this setting, it is important to understand the effects of zzso on zzso zzso We therefore examined the association between body mass index zzso zzso and zzso blood zzso zzso in subjects in whom zzso zzso therapy had been zzso 

A retrospective zzso study was carried out on individuals with hypertension who had been started on zzso zzso The subjects' age, zzso dose, zzso serum zzso zzso new onset of diabetes zzso and concurrent use of other zzso were included in the zzso zzso of change in zzso were analyzed using multiple linear zzso analysis, while zzso of zzso diabetes zzso were determined using multiple zzso zzso 

A total of zzso individuals who had been started on zzso therapy for hypertension were divided into zzso of increasing zzso zzso was found to be associated with baseline zzso and, after zzso zzso there was a zzso increase in the magnitude of change in zzso with increasing zzso zzso zzso for zzso Analysis using multiple linear zzso found that zzso and baseline zzso predicted the magnitude of zzso change in subjects initiated on zzso treatment zzso zzso for zzso Analysis with zzso zzso found that, after zzso zzso zzso serum zzso baseline zzso zzso for zzso and baseline zzso zzso zzso predicted the development of diabetes zzso 

There is an overall increase in zzso in individuals who are started on treatment with zzso for zzso The magnitude of change in zzso and the development of zzso diabetes zzso after zzso initiation were associated with increases in zzso and baseline zzso American Journal of zzso zzso zzso Journal of zzso zzso 21 zzso zzso zzso
