zzso trends over the past several decades suggest an environmental influence on body mass index zzso However, twin models that incorporate a zzso correlation and gene zzso environment interaction have not been applied to zzso specific environmental factors that affect the zzso of zzso 

Our aim was to determine whether one putative environmental predictor of zzso vigorous exercise, shows evidence of a zzso correlation or gene zzso environment interaction with zzso among zzso 

Twin structural equation modeling was used to examine a zzso correlation and a gene zzso environment interaction of vigorous exercise with zzso among zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso twin pairs from the Vietnam Era Twin zzso -- a national registry of twin pairs who served in the military during the Vietnam War zzso 

zzso exercise significantly modified the additive genetic component of zzso which indicated a gene zzso environment interaction zzso zzso zzso showed the greatest genetic influence among those who did not report vigorous exercise, with diminished genetic influence among those who zzso Furthermore, vigorous exercise had a small but significant environmental effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso -- a finding confirmed among zzso zzso zzso for vigorous zzso 

zzso influences on zzso are lower among those who report vigorous zzso zzso with an emerging literature, this suggests that vigorous exercise may mitigate some of the genetic influence on zzso zzso genetic studies of obesity should consider incorporating measures of behavioral and demographic factors to maximize the identification of novel obesity zzso
