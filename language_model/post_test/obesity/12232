zzso is often associated with high cardiovascular disease risk zzso zzso is common in African American zzso We investigated the characteristics of metabolically healthy and metabolically zzso zzso African American women based on the presence of insulin zzso 

We studied 196 apparently healthy zzso African American women with family history of type 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin, zzso lipids and zzso and zzso and zzso blood pressure were obtained in each zzso In addition, insulin sensitivity was calculated using zzso zzso Model zzso We defined zzso metabolically healthy African American women as individuals with insulin sensitivity greater than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and insulin zzso metabolically zzso as insulin sensitivity less than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso percent of our subjects were metabolically healthy African American women, while zzso were metabolically zzso African American zzso The metabolically healthy subjects were significantly younger and less obese than the metabolically zzso zzso Mean zzso serum zzso insulin, and zzso were significantly lower zzso zzso zzso in the metabolically healthy than in metabolically zzso zzso However, the mean blood pressures were within normal in both zzso Mean serum cholesterol zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels were significantly lower, whereas zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso was significantly higher in the metabolically healthy than in the metabolically zzso zzso We found zzso of our subjects had zzso syndrome zzso metabolically zzso and zzso metabolically zzso 

We concluded that: zzso despite zzso metabolically healthy African American women appear to be less prone to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease and zzso in view of the higher prevalence of zzso syndrome, metabolically zzso African American women should be targeted for primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular zzso
