The obesity epidemic has prompted remarkable changes in the proportion of obese children who are referred for habitual zzso However, the contribution of obesity to zzso zzso remains zzso 

In our study, 206 zzso habitually zzso children with zzso diagnosed zzso sleep zzso zzso were matched for age, zzso ethnicity, and zzso zzso index zzso to 206 obese zzso zzso estimates of zzso and zzso and zzso class scores were zzso and allowed for the assessment of potential relationships between zzso factors and obesity in pediatric zzso 

The mean zzso for the two groups was approximately zzso zzso total sleep zzso There was a modest association between zzso size and zzso in zzso children zzso zzso zzso p zzso but not in obese zzso The mean zzso zzso zzso size was larger in zzso children zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso and zzso zzso class scores were significantly higher in obese children zzso zzso 

The magnitude of zzso zzso required for any given magnitude of zzso is more likely to be smaller in obese children compared to zzso zzso Increased zzso scores in obese children suggest that zzso changes and potentially fat deposition in the upper airway may play a significant role in the global differences in zzso and zzso size among obese and zzso children with zzso
