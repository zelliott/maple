The relationships between fat mass and bone tissue are complex and not fully zzso A zzso diet has been shown to induce harmful effects on bone zzso architecture and bone zzso of zzso When such diet leads to zzso it may induce an improvement of zzso bone parameters in zzso we examined the impact of a zzso diet on the body composition and its resulting effects on bone density and structure in male zzso Forty three zzso rats aged 7 months were split into 3 groups: 1 sacrificed before diet zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 subjected to 16 weeks of zzso diet zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 subjected to standard diet zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso circumference and insulin sensitivity were measured and visceral fat mass was zzso The bone mineral density zzso was analyzed at the whole body and zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis were performed at zzso zzso and zzso to study the zzso and cortical bone structures and the bone cell zzso zzso and zzso levels were performed to assess the relative balance of the bone formation and zzso zzso between groups have been tested with an zzso with subsequent zzso zzso zzso An zzso with global mass and global fat as zzso was used to determine the potential implication of the resulting mechanical loading on zzso 

The zzso group had higher body mass, fat masses and abdominal circumference and developed an impaired zzso tolerance zzso Whole body bone mass zzso and zzso zzso were higher in zzso group zzso Control zzso The zzso thickness at zzso and the cortical zzso of zzso were improved zzso in zzso zzso Bone formation was zzso in zzso group while an zzso bone favoring bone zzso was observed in the zzso The zzso and Control groups had higher total and abdominal fat masses and altered bone parameters zzso BD zzso 

The zzso diet had induced obesity and impaired zzso zzso These changes resulted in an improvement of zzso qualitative and zzso bone zzso The fat mass increase partly explained these zzso
