zzso mice were fed a zzso zzso diet zzso for 9 zzso zzso 50% of the mice became obese and diabetic zzso approximately zzso lean and diabetic zzso approximately zzso lean and zzso zzso and approximately zzso displayed intermediate zzso All of the zzso mice were insulin zzso In the zzso state, whole body zzso clearance was reduced in zzso mice, unchanged in the zzso mice, and increased in the zzso mice compared with the zzso zzso Because zzso zzso mice were zzso and the lean mice slightly zzso there was no correlation between insulin levels and increased zzso zzso In zzso tissue zzso zzso assessed by zzso zzso was reduced in most muscles in the zzso mice but increased in the zzso mice compared with the values of the control zzso In the zzso mice, the zzso zzso rates were reduced in zzso zzso zzso zzso and total zzso but increased in zzso zzso and zzso When assessed in zzso zzso zzso rates in the absence and presence of insulin were similar in zzso zzso and zzso muscles isolated from all groups of zzso Thus, in genetically zzso mice, zzso feeding lead to different zzso zzso Whereas all of the mice became insulin zzso this was zzso in obese mice, with decreased zzso clearance and zzso and, in lean mice, with increased zzso clearance in the presence of mild zzso zzso increased zzso clearance in lean mice could not be explained by increased insulin level, indicating that other in zzso mechanisms are triggered to control muscle zzso zzso These zzso mechanisms could participate in the protection against development of zzso
