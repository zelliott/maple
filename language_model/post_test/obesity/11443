Recently, we identified a zzso status interaction with serum zzso levels in a sample of Mexican zzso However, it is unknown whether this phenomenon occurs in other populations as zzso 

The goal of this study was to examine the genetic architecture of the response to smoking in zzso levels using data from Midwestern Caucasian subjects participating in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso Genes zzso 

We employed a zzso decomposition analysis using maximum likelihood methods to model zzso interactions for zzso levels and examined the impact of the exclusion of smokers in a subsequent linkage zzso 

We found significant evidence zzso for a zzso status interaction for serum zzso zzso In the subsequent linkage analysis with smokers zzso we obtained a maximum zzso score of zzso zzso near zzso 

These results suggest that a zzso on zzso 8 may have a differential effect on the expression of zzso in smokers vs nonsmokers, as first identified in Mexican zzso
