zzso is a risk factor for cardiovascular zzso zzso levels are increased in obesity and zzso exhibits cardiovascular actions that may contribute to increased cardiovascular zzso We review the sympathetic, zzso and vascular actions of zzso and their relevance to cardiovascular zzso 

zzso possesses zzso actions potentially contributing to zzso hypertension including generalized zzso However, given that zzso resistance occurs in zzso it has been difficult to link zzso with zzso One possibility is that zzso resistance is confined to the zzso effects of zzso with preservation of its zzso zzso Other mechanisms may contribute to the zzso effects of zzso For instance, zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso the zzso effect of zzso zzso interactions between zzso II and insulin with zzso could have deleterious cardiovascular effects in zzso Additionally, zzso appears to stimulate vascular zzso zzso stress and zzso These actions may contribute to the zzso of hypertension, zzso and left zzso zzso 

The potential actions of zzso in the zzso of cardiovascular complications of obesity are diverse, despite evidence of zzso resistance to its zzso zzso However, most information about cardiovascular actions of zzso derives from zzso and animal zzso Future research in humans is widely zzso
