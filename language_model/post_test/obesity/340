Present researchers studied the relation between insulin with free and total zzso in type 2 diabetic zzso Thirty non insulin dependent diabetic obese patients zzso 50 zzso 12 year and zzso zzso zzso and thirty non insulin dependent diabetic non obese patients zzso 49 zzso 25 year and zzso zzso zzso were zzso Free zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso and the zzso were collected and then their free zzso was measured by a high sensitive zzso zzso Circulation total zzso and insulin were measured by zzso Circulation free and total zzso were significantly correlated to insulin zzso zzso Free zzso zzso were higher in women than in men zzso zzso zzso of free zzso to total in obese subjects is more than non-obese subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso of free to total zzso showed a positive correlations with insulin zzso zzso zzso p zzso insulin resistance zzso zzso 31, p zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso The majority of zzso which zzso in obese individuals was free zzso Presumably it is zzso portion of hormone and thus obese subjects are resistant to free zzso These observations are consistent with the view that free zzso levels in diabetes patients attributed to changes in serum insulin level and insulin zzso
