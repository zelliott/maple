Little is known about zzso of zzso liver disease in zzso Data on the relationship among zzso zzso zzso and liver disease in obese children are zzso 

Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate immune zzso and zzso serum levels in obese children with and without zzso liver zzso 

The study was performed in two groups of consecutive obese children: the first formed by children with zzso liver disease, diagnosed in the presence of chronic zzso liver zzso at zzso and absence of known zzso the second composed of children with isolated zzso In all patients serum zzso zzso peripheral zzso B, and natural killer zzso cells were zzso 

zzso children in the first group and 16 children in the second were considered zzso zzso zzso was increased in both groups but without any significant zzso No significant correlation was found between zzso and zzso zzso serum levels, and all tested zzso zzso Patients with zzso liver disease showed significantly higher peripheral zzso and B cell counts and zzso levels than children with isolated zzso Furthermore, no correlation was found between severity of liver disease and zzso zzso 

In our study, zzso did not correlate with zzso zzso zzso and serum zzso Children with zzso liver disease showed significantly higher peripheral zzso and B cells and zzso zzso Additional studies are required to define the zzso role of these zzso zzso
