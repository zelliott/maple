The overweight and obese groups showed significantly higher resting zzso and lower zzso than the zzso group (both P zzso even after adjusting for zzso A further analysis of subjects without any zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso remained significantly lower in the obese compared with zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso of known markers of vascular inflammation zzso zzso protein and zzso and zzso zzso cholesterol levels correlated with declining zzso 

These findings provide a zzso link between obesity and coronary heart disease in this zzso
