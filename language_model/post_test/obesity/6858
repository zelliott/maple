We reviewed emerging evidence linking serum levels and zzso tissue expression of zzso and zzso in women with zzso zzso syndrome zzso Previous data obtained by our group from a sample of zzso zzso women and a control sample of normal weight controls, both zzso by zzso were zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso were determined by commercially available zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue total zzso was zzso into complementary DNA samples, which were used as templates for quantitative real-time zzso zzso Positive correlations were found between serum and zzso levels for both zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso serum levels could serve as an indirect method to assess zzso production, since zzso and zzso are predominantly produced by subcutaneous zzso in zzso
