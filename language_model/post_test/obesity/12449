We evaluated the outcome of 88 zzso performed in highly obese patients during the last 5 zzso The data were compared with the results of 88 consecutive zzso performed in normal weight zzso 

The success rate in the study group was of zzso by comparison with zzso in the normal weight zzso The use of flexible zzso was imposed in zzso of the obese group zzso zzso in the control zzso The complications rate (all zzso was of zzso in the obese group zzso zzso in the normal weight zzso The differences between the two groups, although present, were not statistically zzso However, in two cases with zzso the weight of the patients was too high for the operating table, imposing supplementary sustaining zzso 

zzso treatment of stones in obese patients is an acceptable treatment zzso with success rates similar to non-obese zzso Sometimes it may require some zzso measures in the operating zzso
