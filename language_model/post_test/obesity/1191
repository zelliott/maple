We evaluated the influence of family history of hypertension on insulin sensitivity in lean and obese zzso subjects zzso 40 lean zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso H with zzso parents zzso 50 lean H with one or two parents zzso zzso 30 obese zzso zzso or zzso 30 zzso zzso and 35 obese zzso The four groups were comparable in terms of age, sex and ambulatory blood pressure zzso We evaluated zzso insulin and zzso before and 30, 60, 90 and 120 zzso after an oral zzso load, insulin sensitivity index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso and during test, and zzso were similar among the four zzso insulin and zzso zzso and zzso were significantly higher and zzso lower in obese H than in lean zzso at similar zzso insulin and zzso were significantly higher in zzso than in zzso zzso directly correlated with zzso blood pressure only in lean zzso The correlation between insulin and zzso was significantly closer in zzso in zzso In conclusion, family history of hypertension appears to play a relevant role in insulin sensitivity in zzso subjects also in the presence of zzso
