zzso regimen has been shown to reduce zzso complications in gastrointestinal zzso 

We investigated the zzso and type of zzso complications and associated risk factors after benign abdominal zzso undertaken in a zzso zzso 

A prospective zzso cohort zzso In five Swedish hospitals, a cohort of 162 women, zzso zzso undergoing abdominal zzso in a zzso program was zzso zzso Surgery was performed under spinal or general zzso The zzso concept was zzso with discharge criteria and a restricted intravenous fluid zzso zzso were systematically registered during the five-week follow-up zzso zzso factors for complications were zzso using multiple zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso developed zzso zzso mainly infection and wound healing zzso The majority of the complications developed after discharge and were treated in the zzso zzso Four women zzso were readmitted to zzso zzso risk factors for zzso complications were obesity zzso zzso prior zzso zzso zzso and relative increase in body weight on the first zzso day zzso zzso 

Minor infection and wound healing complications seem to be common in healthy women undergoing abdominal zzso in a zzso zzso zzso is an important risk factor also in zzso abdominal zzso A modest increase in zzso relative weight gain during the first zzso day seemed to increase the risk of zzso zzso This factor merits further zzso zzso studies are necessary to determine the impact of zzso program and zzso fluid regimens on zzso zzso
