zzso zzso injury plays an important role in the development of diabetic zzso zzso factor zzso is a zzso that is produced in diabetic zzso and promotes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acts exclusively through the zzso zzso which is only expressed on cells of the zzso zzso zzso we used zzso blockade as a strategy to selectively target zzso injury during the progression of diabetic zzso 

zzso type 2 diabetic zzso zzso mice with established zzso were treated with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso matched control zzso from 12 to 18 weeks of age and examined for zzso zzso 

Treatment with zzso did not affect zzso zzso circulating zzso levels or established zzso in zzso zzso However, zzso did prevent zzso zzso and suppressed variables of inflammation in the diabetic zzso including kidney zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso motif zzso 2 levels zzso and urine zzso kidney zzso of zzso pathways zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor 2) and zzso (also known as zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso decreased the tissue damage caused by zzso including zzso injury zzso and zzso zzso damage zzso proliferation and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso known as zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso can suppress the progression of established diabetic zzso in zzso mice by targeting zzso zzso
