zzso a sibling of zzso derived from zzso opposes zzso effects on food zzso Plasma zzso profiles in relation to zzso have not been fully investigated in human zzso 

We zzso that obesity might present with imbalance of circulating zzso and zzso zzso 

Sixteen obese zzso men, aged zzso zzso zzso zzso eight women, aged zzso zzso zzso zzso and 14 zzso individuals zzso men, aged zzso zzso zzso zzso seven women, aged zzso zzso zzso zzso were evaluated at the in-patient department of zzso Hospital, Shanghai, zzso 

Total plasma zzso and zzso levels, 1 h before and 2 h after breakfast, were measured by zzso 

Both zzso plasma zzso levels zzso zzso and zzso levels zzso zzso were lower in the obese compared with zzso zzso However, unexpectedly, the ratio of zzso zzso to zzso was higher in obese compared with zzso controls zzso zzso even after adjustment for gender and age zzso zzso The ratio of zzso zzso to zzso was decreased both in obese zzso zzso and controls zzso zzso compared with their zzso zzso There were no significant differences in the ratio of zzso zzso to zzso between obese and zzso zzso Body mass index was positively correlated with and was a significantly independent zzso of the zzso zzso to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso to zzso ratio is elevated in human zzso We suggest that high zzso zzso to zzso ratio may be involved in the zzso and zzso of zzso
