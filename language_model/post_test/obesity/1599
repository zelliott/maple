zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of age, zzso obesity and zzso on zzso zzso rate zzso and zzso fluid volume zzso in healthy zzso 

This is a retrospective zzso study of 1878 healthy prospective kidney transplant donors zzso zzso from 15 zzso Age and body mass index zzso were not significantly different between men and zzso zzso zzso was measured zzso zzso in 14 zzso zzso in one) and scaled to body surface area zzso and lean body mass zzso both estimated from height and zzso zzso was also expressed as the slope rate constant, with zzso correction zzso zzso was measured as the ratio, zzso to zzso 

zzso was age independent but zzso declined with age, at a significantly faster rate in women than zzso zzso was higher in men but zzso and zzso were higher in zzso Young women zzso zzso had higher zzso than young men but the reverse was recorded in the elderly zzso zzso There was no difference in zzso between obese zzso zzso and non-obese zzso zzso women, however, had lower zzso than non-obese women and negative correlations were observed between zzso and both zzso and zzso The decline in zzso with age was no faster in obese versus non-obese zzso zzso was higher in men but zzso was higher in zzso zzso was almost gender independent, suggesting that zzso mass in women contains more zzso zzso zzso is therefore a misleading zzso zzso 

There are several significant differences in zzso and zzso between healthy men and zzso
