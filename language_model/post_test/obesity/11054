To examine the effects of different coffee amounts on blood zzso and insulin zzso of healthy volunteers, and to assess potential effect modification by sex and body mass index zzso 

zzso volunteers zzso zzso zzso 16 zzso and 17 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso took part in this randomized, crossover zzso zzso the morning of each experimental day volunteers received a standardized meal along with 200 zzso of water or instant coffee containing either 3 or 6 zzso of zzso body zzso Blood samples were obtained and analyzed for zzso and insulin zzso in the zzso state, immediately after zzso consumption and at standard time points for the next zzso zzso 

Coffee delayed the rise of insulin in response to the standardized meal and the fall of zzso zzso from its maximum levels in the entire study zzso zzso incremental area under the curve zzso was significantly different between interventions zzso with both coffee amounts inducing a greater area compared to zzso zzso zzso analysis at the nominal level showed that this might be more evident among females zzso and zzso participants zzso Furthermore, coffee, mainly the 6 zzso dose, could be lowering insulin zzso the first 30 zzso after its consumption compared to water in men and zzso zzso 

Coffee exerts an acute effect on zzso zzso and insulin zzso This effect may be modified by sex and zzso zzso Future research is necessary to zzso underlying zzso
