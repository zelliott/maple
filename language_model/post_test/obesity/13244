The aim of the present study was to gain insight into the zzso of obesity by comparing the pattern of gene expression of zzso zzso tissue of obese and lean volunteers using DNA zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso were obtained by zzso surgery from six male patients zzso zzso zzso was extracted and pooled for the obese zzso zzso zzso and lean zzso zzso zzso zzso From the total number of genes analyzed zzso zzso human zzso zzso were expressed at sufficient levels in human zzso tissue for detection in the zzso experiments, finding that 89 genes were zzso while 64 were zzso at least twofold in the zzso zzso tissue obtained from obese zzso We found a general tendency to blunt zzso zzso genes and a global zzso of genes zzso growth zzso Moreover, an zzso in the expression of several zzso protein zzso zzso was zzso The zzso of genes involved in zzso zzso may be involved in the zzso of zzso In addition, zzso of growth factors and the zzso of zzso may indicate an attempt to restrain zzso proliferation and zzso Furthermore, obesity is accompanied by an altered expression in zzso zzso tissue of genes involved not only in energy zzso but also in quite diverse biological functions, such as immune zzso The zzso approach zzso the importance of zzso tissue beyond energy zzso
