This study aims to investigate the role of changes in zzso and beta zzso zzso levels in weight loss following zzso zzso application in obesity zzso zzso was applied to 20 females who were zzso zzso zzso years old and had a body mass index of zzso zzso zzso and a diet program was applied to 20 females who were zzso zzso zzso years old and had a body mass index of zzso zzso zzso There was a zzso weight reduction in the patients with zzso application, whereas patients on diet restriction had a zzso weight zzso A decrease of loss of body weight was observed in the zzso group zzso zzso when compared against the diet restricted zzso A decrease of serum zzso levels zzso zzso and an increase in the serum BE zzso zzso levels were observed in the zzso group compared to the diet restricted zzso In this study, reduced serum zzso levels zzso to weight loss were observed in the zzso zzso Furthermore, it is thought that in the zzso applied group, increasing serum BE level probably enhanced the zzso activity which may have caused weight loss in obese people by zzso energy zzso It may be considered that the zzso application with diet restriction in obesity treatment is more effective than the diet restriction zzso
