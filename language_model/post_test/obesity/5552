To investigate the effect of short term energy restriction combined with physical activity on serum zzso of zzso zzso in obese children and zzso 

zzso intervention study of zzso zzso daily with zzso 

zzso white obese children and adolescents zzso girls, age zzso zzso 18 boys, age zzso zzso 

Indexes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure, heart rate at baseline and after 3 zzso 

All determined parameters decreased significantly during the 3 week program zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso Body mass index zzso fat mass, percentage fat mass zzso of zzso and zzso were not related to zzso before the zzso In contrast, zzso zzso correlated significantly with indexes of obesity and zzso after weight zzso zzso zzso did not correlate with zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure, and heart zzso Changes in zzso zzso correlated significantly with changes in zzso zzso zzso 

An improved body composition induced by restriction of energy intake and increase in physical activity is associated with more favorable serum zzso of zzso in obese children and zzso
