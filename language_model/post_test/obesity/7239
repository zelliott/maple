The objective of this exploratory study was to evaluate the role of the zzso growth factor I zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Using quantitative zzso we studied zzso zzso expression in 52 zzso surgically zzso zzso and matched zzso normal zzso zzso and examined zzso expression levels in relation to zzso zzso body mass index zzso and the common zzso zzso zzso recently proposed to modify risk of obesity for zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso were not significantly different between zzso and matched zzso normal zzso zzso Although no significant associations were found between zzso expression and zzso tumor zzso stage or survival, when zzso by zzso patients with the zzso A zzso had significantly higher zzso expression in zzso zzso compared with matched normal zzso These findings suggest that zzso most likely zzso zzso function, possibly by influencing gene zzso or zzso stability, and represents a plausible zzso link underlying the association between obesity and zzso zzso
