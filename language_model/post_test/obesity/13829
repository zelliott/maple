Body weight is controlled by the zzso of signal zzso pathways in both the brain and peripheral zzso Interestingly, although many zzso zzso and receptors have been implicated in the regulation of body weight, the zzso and zzso mechanisms through which these genes are expressed in response to changes in energy balance remain zzso Our laboratory studies a mouse in which targeted deletion of the zzso basic zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso zzso 2 protein zzso results in zzso zzso The aim of this work was to use the zzso of the zzso knockout mouse and the expression pattern of zzso to identify genes that are regulated by this zzso zzso In this article, we show that zzso is expressed throughout the adult zzso Using zzso in zzso zzso we demonstrate that, in the zzso nucleus of the adult zzso zzso zzso expression can be found in zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas in the zzso nucleus zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso In addition, we find that zzso zzso zzso in the ARC and zzso in the zzso are regulated zzso via zzso control of zzso zzso I and II zzso zzso This is the first report in which regulation of body weight is linked to the action of a zzso zzso zzso factor on zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, this work supports a direct role for zzso control of zzso processing zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso
