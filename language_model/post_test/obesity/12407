We evaluated zzso subjects zzso zzso women zzso response zzso zzso prevalence zzso of risk factors in men and women respectively was smoking 95 zzso and 12 zzso low physical activity zzso zzso and 147 zzso high fat zzso or zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso low fruits and vegetables intake zzso zzso zzso zzso and 165 zzso zzso 205 zzso and 142 zzso high waist size 58 zzso and 76 zzso high zzso 143 zzso and 154 zzso hypertension 177 zzso and 71 zzso high total zzso or zzso 200 zzso zzso 148 zzso and 93 zzso low HDL cholesterol zzso zzso 113 zzso and 157 zzso diabetes 62 zzso and 25 zzso and zzso syndrome 109 zzso and 61 zzso zzso increase was observed in body mass index, waist size, waist zzso zzso blood pressure and zzso and total cholesterol, zzso cholesterol and zzso in women zzso zzso Age related increase was also observed in prevalence of zzso zzso zzso hypertension, diabetes and zzso syndrome zzso zzso On zzso analysis significant zzso of risk factors were low educational and socioeconomic status for smoking, high fat diet for obesity and hypertension, low fruits and vegetables intake for zzso syndrome, and low physical activity or obesity but on zzso zzso zzso analysis only association was high fat diet with obesity and hypertension zzso zzso analysis p zzso Compared to studies performed at similar locations in years zzso and zzso there was increasing trend in prevalence of high zzso cholesterol and zzso zzso zzso while other risk factors did not change zzso
