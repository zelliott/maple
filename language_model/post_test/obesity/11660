To measure activity related energy expenditure in zzso syndrome zzso corrected for body zzso 

17 zzso subjects (10 zzso seven zzso age zzso zzso and 17 obese controls, matched for gender and bone zzso zzso zzso zzso rate zzso was measured by zzso hood and average daily zzso rate zzso was measured with doubly zzso zzso zzso induced energy expenditure zzso was calculated as zzso zzso zzso related energy expenditure was corrected for body size using the following zzso zzso per zzso body weight zzso zzso zzso and the residual of the zzso of zzso on zzso zzso Group differences were analyzed by analysis of zzso adjusting for bone age, fat mass zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso and PAL were lower zzso zzso in the zzso group compared with the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and PAL was significantly explained by gender and zzso while zzso was additionally explained by zzso The zzso of zzso was explained by zzso and not by zzso or zzso 

zzso related energy expenditure is decreased in zzso compared with controls adjusted for bone age, zzso and zzso
