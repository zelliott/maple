Secondary analyses of data from 2 studies were used to assess the effects of protein intake and sex on zzso changes in body zzso The primary hypothesis was that the changes of body composition via energy restriction zzso lean body mass zzso fat mass zzso and zzso would be sex and diet zzso For 12 weeks, 43 male zzso 1) and 45 female zzso 2) overweight and obese adults consumed an zzso diet zzso zzso less than energy zzso containing either zzso zzso protein zzso 21 men and 23 zzso or zzso g zzso zzso protein zzso 22 men and 22 zzso Body composition zzso were performed at zzso and zzso Over time, all research participants lost weight, zzso and zzso Independent of protein zzso the men lost more zzso in the trunk zzso vs zzso zzso and less in the legs zzso vs zzso zzso compared with the women zzso zzso Independent of sex, the zzso group lost less zzso in the trunk and legs than the zzso zzso These sex and protein intake responses resulted in the zzso men losing the most zzso in the legs and the zzso women losing the most zzso in the zzso Over time, men lost more zzso zzso vs zzso zzso from the trunk and less from legs zzso vs zzso zzso than women zzso zzso which resulted in a greater decrease of the zzso fat ratio for the zzso zzso intake did not influence these zzso responses or have any independent effects on changes in zzso In addition, protein intake did not influence bone mineral density responses over time; bone mineral density was reduced in women, but not in zzso These findings indicate that higher protein intake during weight loss promotes the retention of zzso in both the trunk and legs despite the zzso changes in these body zzso
