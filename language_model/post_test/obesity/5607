To investigate whether zzso variation is a factor in the generally reported poor tracking of central body fat distribution zzso during development and whether two zzso of zzso during each measurement occasion would improve the estimate of tracking over zzso 

A zzso study compared the results of two zzso of body fat zzso and zzso during each measurement occasion to the results of one measurement of zzso and zzso during each occasion every 4 months over 1-3 zzso A total of 345 boys and zzso girls in three age zzso of 8, 11 and 14 y at baseline were zzso zzso variables were: body mass index zzso fat mass and percentage body fat from zzso zzso two zzso zzso and abdominal zzso zzso variables were: zzso and zzso zzso zzso and log zzso zzso zzso 

zzso tracking of zzso varied from zzso to zzso for one- and from zzso to zzso for zzso zzso showing no apparent zzso or zzso zzso tracking of zzso was lower than that of zzso zzso but improved significantly with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso variation is a significant factor in reported low tracking of zzso in zzso Estimates of tracking currently in the literature may underestimate the zzso value of zzso possibly because this research has used zzso zzso The increased use of zzso measurement should significantly improve the tracking of zzso during development and provide a more realistic understanding of its zzso zzso
