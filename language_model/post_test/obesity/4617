Little is known about the influence of location of food consumption and preparation upon daily energy intake of zzso 

To examine trends in daily energy intake by children for foods eaten at home or away from home, by source of preparation, and for combined categories of eating location and food zzso 

The analysis uses data from zzso children aged 2 to 18 years from the zzso zzso Food zzso Survey, zzso and zzso Continuing zzso of Food zzso by zzso and zzso National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso 

zzso representative weighted percentages and means of daily energy intake by eating location were analyzed for trends from 1977 to zzso Comparisons by food source were examined from 1994 to zzso zzso were repeated for three age groups: 2 to 6 years, 7 to 12 years, and 13 to 18 zzso zzso testing was conducted using a zzso zzso 

Increased energy intake zzso zzso by children from zzso was associated with a major increase in energy eaten away from home zzso zzso The percentage of daily energy eaten away from home increased from zzso to zzso from zzso No further increase was observed from zzso but the sources of energy zzso The percentage of energy from fast food increased to surpass intake from schools and become the largest contributor to foods prepared away from home for all age zzso For foods eaten away from home, the percentage of daily energy from stores increased to become the largest source of energy eaten away from zzso Fast food eaten at home and store-bought food eaten away from home increased zzso 

Eating location and food source significantly influence daily energy intake for zzso Foods prepared away from home, including fast food eaten at home and zzso food eaten away from home, are fueling the increase in total energy zzso However, further research using alternative data sources is necessary to verify that store-bought foods eaten away from home are increasingly zzso
