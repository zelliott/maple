zzso frequently leads to changes in fatty acid metabolism with subsequent fatty zzso in the zzso 

In this study, zzso profile of the zzso and blood from lean and obese zzso rats was established based on quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso on liver zzso extracts indicated significantly increased zzso of total fatty acids and zzso zzso zzso on liver extracts revealed that obese zzso have a compromised energy balance zzso zzso with decreased zzso zzso zzso increased zzso activity was zzso The most pronounced differences were highly increased zzso and decreased zzso zzso in obese zzso This suggests a significant zzso in zzso zzso which may be in part responsible for the development of zzso induction of zzso dysfunction, and increased vulnerability of fatty zzso to zzso zzso A trend towards decreased zzso zzso zzso as well as a reduced zzso ratio were present in the obese group, indicating increased zzso stress and zzso zzso 

In conclusion, zzso analysis on blood and liver tissue from obese zzso rats reveals specific zzso abnormalities in zzso function and zzso zzso which result in a decreased zzso energy zzso
