zzso obesity and insulin resistance are zzso constituents of the zzso syndrome and are major risk factors for zzso The objective of this study was to determine whether hypertension specifically affects the plasma zzso independently and differently from the effects induced by obesity and insulin zzso 

We screened the plasma zzso of 19 men with hypertension and 51 zzso male controls by zzso shotgun profiling on a zzso zzso hybrid mass zzso The analysis zzso 95 zzso species of 10 major zzso zzso zzso resulted in generally higher zzso load in blood zzso while the content of zzso and zzso increased zzso zzso resistance, defined by zzso and controlled for zzso had little effect on the plasma zzso zzso we observed that in blood plasma of zzso individuals the overall content of zzso lipids zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that comprise zzso zzso and zzso zzso fatty acid zzso were specifically zzso The content of free cholesterol also zzso although conventional clinical zzso zzso zzso remained zzso 

zzso shotgun zzso demonstrated that hypertension is accompanied by specific reduction of the content of zzso lipids and free cholesterol that occurred independently of zzso zzso induced by obesity and insulin zzso These results may form the basis for novel preventive and dietary strategies alleviating the severity of zzso
