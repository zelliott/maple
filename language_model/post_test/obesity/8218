zzso and zzso are major regulators of zzso metabolism in the liver, and their deregulation has been linked to the development of zzso diseases such as obesity and zzso zzso However, the biological importance of these zzso has been defined using genetic zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the levels of zzso and zzso in rat liver correlate with zzso in nutritional zzso For this purpose, we analyzed the levels of zzso and zzso in the zzso of zzso cafeteria zzso rats and of cafeteria zzso rats supplemented with zzso and/or zzso zzso because these two dietary components are well-known to counteract zzso The results showed that the zzso induced in rats that were fed a cafeteria diet resulted in the zzso of zzso and zzso in the liver, whereas the presence of zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso the increase of these two zzso However, zzso the host gene of zzso was significantly zzso by zzso zzso but not by zzso Liver zzso levels of the zzso and zzso target zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso respectively, were consistent with the expression of these two zzso under each zzso Moreover, the zzso and zzso levels were also analyzed in zzso Interestingly, the zzso levels evaluated in zzso under each condition were similar to the liver levels but zzso This demonstrates that zzso is expressed in zzso and that these cells can be used as a zzso way to reflect the expression of this zzso in the zzso These findings cast new light on the regulation of zzso and zzso in a zzso model of obese rats and the way these zzso are modulated by dietary components in the liver and in zzso
