Previous studies have shown that zzso and zzso factors are involved in the acute zzso induced by a variety of laboratory zzso Whether a chronic condition of sympathetic zzso such as that characterizing human zzso is also dependent on these factors has never been zzso In 40 zzso obese subjects zzso age, zzso zzso we measured blood pressure zzso heart rate zzso and zzso muscle sympathetic nerve activity zzso zzso In 20 subjects zzso were zzso according to a zzso zzso zzso after a midnight oral dose of zzso (1 zzso zzso or zzso zzso while in the remaining subjects they were performed again after 1 week of a daily evening oral administration of 1 zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso The same protocol was performed in 16 zzso lean zzso In both groups acute zzso administration markedly reduced plasma cortisol zzso without affecting zzso and neural zzso In contrast to the acute administration, in obese subjects prolonged zzso administration, although not affecting blood pressure and heart rate, significantly reduced both plasma cortisol (from zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso (from zzso to zzso bursts per 100 zzso zzso zzso This was not the case in lean subjects, in which the zzso reduction in plasma cortisol was associated with a slight and zzso zzso zzso In both lean and obese subjects, zzso administration caused no change in any zzso Thus, prolonged zzso administration exerts in obese subjects marked zzso effects that are not zzso in lean zzso This suggests that zzso and zzso factors substantially contribute to the zzso of zzso
