zzso is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease zzso and promotes zzso risk zzso zzso surgery has gained much favor because it ameliorates zzso This review examines the current evidence for the mechanism behind this, which is currently thought to occur in part by reduction of zzso or dysfunctional zzso zzso through zzso of zzso zzso 

Increased visceral fat in obesity leads to zzso due to the chronic inflammation present in this zzso zzso surgery causes weight loss as well as reduction in insulin resistance, hypertension, zzso cardiac zzso and zzso It also causes changes in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not in tumor necrosis zzso These changes contribute to improved zzso risk, possibly through decrease of chronic zzso 

The zzso in zzso zzso that occur after zzso surgery are involved with reduction in zzso risk factors, zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of the known zzso effects of zzso and the zzso effects of zzso and zzso reduction in chronic inflammation associated with less visceral fat after surgery may contribute to the reduction in zzso This may promote improvement of zzso dysfunction and insulin zzso Further work is necessary to explore these zzso
