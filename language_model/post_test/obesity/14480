As obesity continues to run rampant in our society, an understanding of its adverse effect after traumatic injury is starting to zzso We zzso that obesity zzso impacts zzso patients, and the current study intends to compare obese and lean patients with traumatic brain injury zzso 

This is a retrospective study evaluating all blunt trauma patients with zzso admitted to the intensive care unit zzso in our urban, Level I trauma center from 1998 until zzso Body mass index zzso was used to categorize patients as either lean zzso zzso zzso or obese zzso or zzso zzso Admission zzso type and severity of head injury, and associated injuries were recorded for each zzso zzso outcome was zzso while secondary outcomes were cause of death, zzso and for survivors, days of mechanical zzso zzso length of stay, and hospital length of zzso zzso and lean patients were compared using zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, a zzso analysis of patients with isolated head injury was zzso 

There were zzso patients with zzso admitted to the zzso during the study period, with 129 zzso obese patients zzso zzso 34 zzso 5 zzso and zzso zzso lean patients zzso zzso 24 zzso 4 zzso The two groups were similar with the exceptions that obese patients were older zzso zzso 20 years versus 39 zzso years, p zzso had lower admission zzso blood pressure zzso zzso 38 zzso zzso versus zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso p zzso zzso and more often sustained an associated chest injury zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso zzso patients with zzso had a trend toward more complications zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso and a higher mortality zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso failed to identify obesity as an independent risk factor for either morbidity or zzso In addition, obese patients with isolated head injury had no increase in complications or zzso 

Although obese patients suffer more complications and higher mortality than lean patients after zzso this adverse effect seems to be due to age, lower admission blood pressure, and more associated chest injury, rather than a direct result of the obese zzso
