To study the prevalence of fatty liver, blood zzso and related factors in simple obese zzso 

Their liver was scanned with zzso ultrasound and zzso blood zzso (with a zzso zzso as well as other related zzso and functional zzso were measured in 62 children aged 8 to 11 years, including 32 obese ones and 30 control zzso 

zzso of fatty liver in obese and control groups was zzso and zzso respectively, with very statistically significant difference zzso zzso Blood zzso level in obese and control groups was zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, with statistically significant difference zzso zzso zzso of children with normal cardiac function was zzso and zzso respectively, in obese and control groups, with significant difference zzso zzso The prevalence of fatty liver correlated positively with zzso zzso waist to hip ratio zzso and body mass index zzso with zzso of correlation of zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso Blood zzso correlated with zzso thickness and zzso zzso with zzso of correlation of zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso thickness and zzso were major risk factor for fatty liver and zzso thickness was major risk factor for high blood zzso 

zzso obesity could cause damage to the liver, zzso metabolism and cardiac function in children, forming the potential risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and zzso of zzso metabolism in zzso
