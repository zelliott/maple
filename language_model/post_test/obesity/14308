The aim of the present study was to assess obesity as a risk of adverse outcomes following cardiac zzso 

The data of 324 consecutive patients who underwent zzso procedures requiring zzso bypass in a single cardiac center in zzso zzso were zzso zzso There were 250 males and 74 zzso Median age was zzso years zzso 17 to 90 zzso A body mass index zzso or zzso zzso was defined as zzso zzso outcomes analyzed included zzso zzso chest tube zzso zzso zzso support, zzso deep zzso wound infection, superficial surgical site infection and hospital stay zzso Multiple zzso zzso analysis was performed to assess the relationship of obesity with clinical outcomes after cardiac zzso zzso considered in the zzso model included age, zzso pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease, smoking, hypertension, and zzso 

Fourteen percent of patients zzso were obese and this ratio is quite smaller than reported for zzso zzso The results of multiple zzso analysis demonstrated that obesity was a risk factor only for superficial zzso or harvesting site infection zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was associated with increased risk of superficial surgical wound infections following cardiac zzso In comparison with zzso countries, obesity may account for fewer adverse events in patients undergoing zzso surgical procedures in zzso zzso a developing country zzso
