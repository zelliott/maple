The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the association and zzso value of body mass index zzso at the time of initial diagnosis in patients with locally advanced breast cancer zzso The analysis includes the zzso of inflammatory zzso and zzso zzso zzso breast zzso 

We identified zzso patients who had zzso treated on prospective clinical zzso zzso was divided into three groups: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso product limit method was used to estimate survival zzso Cox zzso hazards were used to determine associations between survival and zzso and to test for an interaction between zzso and breast cancer zzso 

zzso percent had zzso zzso and zzso had zzso zzso patients tended to have a higher zzso of zzso compared with overweight and zzso groups zzso zzso zzso Median follow up was 6 years for all zzso Median overall survival zzso and recurrence-free survival zzso were zzso and zzso years, zzso Patients with zzso who were obese or overweight had a significantly worse zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and a higher zzso of visceral recurrence compared with zzso zzso In a multivariable model, zzso remained significantly associated with both zzso and zzso for the entire zzso The interactions between zzso and zzso zzso and between zzso and zzso status were not statistically zzso 

Patients with zzso and high zzso have a worse zzso zzso of the biological factors associated with this observation can provide tools for additional therapeutic zzso
