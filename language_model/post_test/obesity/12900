zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso one of the zzso zzso gene by zzso zzso fatty acid zzso and zzso has been investigated in zzso and zzso of obese zzso fatty rats and their lean zzso The sequence spanning zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso which is responsive to zzso stimulation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was linked to a reporter gene and zzso into rat zzso or zzso The zzso zzso zzso activities in the presence of zzso alone were similar in primary cultured cells from both obese and lean zzso In the presence of zzso however, the zzso activities were markedly increased in the zzso of lean rats, but were not significantly increased in those of obese zzso The stimulation by zzso was reduced in zzso cells of lean zzso The stimulation was also reduced in zzso cells or zzso gene expression zzso zzso However, zzso or zzso cells from obese rats did not show a significant reduction in insulin zzso The same effects were observed at the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Similar results were seen in zzso although the stimulation and suppression levels were much smaller than in zzso The expression of zzso insulin zzso in zzso and zzso was reduced in the presence of zzso or zzso We previously found that zzso capacities are also reduced in the presence of zzso or zzso and are very low in obese rats in comparison with zzso Moreover, gel mobility shift zzso using zzso zzso revealed that nuclear zzso including zzso bind specifically to the zzso and zzso complex formation is reduced in the obese zzso Thus, the reductions in the zzso zzso zzso may be ascribed in part to reductions in insulin binding to receptors and zzso complex zzso
