zzso zzso has been reported to have potential zzso effects in a few studies, but the zzso properties of CO and its related mechanisms in models of dietary obesity remain zzso We investigated the effect of CO on body weight gain, size of zzso zzso and zzso profiles in high-fat zzso zzso obese mice and on the gene expression in zzso tissue using a complementary DNA zzso approach to test the hypothesis that CO supplementation would alleviate zzso zzso obesity by the zzso of zzso zzso gene zzso Male zzso mice were fed a normal diet zzso zzso diet, or zzso zzso diet zzso or zzso for 5 zzso Compared with the zzso diet mice, mice fed the zzso zzso diet gained zzso less weight but did not display any change in food and energy zzso zzso supplementation markedly improved serum and zzso zzso zzso zzso examination showed that zzso zzso size was smaller in mice fed the zzso + zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that dietary CO supplementation modulated zzso genes such as zzso zzso 3, 12, 13, and zzso tissue inhibitor of zzso 1; and zzso k in the zzso zzso Twenty-five percent of the zzso genes identified are involved in immune responses including the inflammatory response and zzso zzso These results suggest that CO supplementation may help zzso zzso zzso weight gain and improve serum and liver zzso profile zzso which are zzso at least in part, with altered zzso tissue gene expression involved in zzso and zzso
