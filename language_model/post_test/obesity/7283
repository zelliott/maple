zzso inflammation plays a critical role in promoting zzso disorders, such as fatty liver zzso The inflammatory cells that mediate these effects remain zzso This study investigated the zzso of immature zzso cells in the liver and their role in liver zzso We found that the zzso of immature zzso cells, zzso zzso cells, in the liver of B6 mice fed a high-fat diet contribute to liver zzso zzso transfer of zzso cells isolated from the liver of obese B6 mice, but not from lean B6 mice, resulted in liver damage that was evident by an increase in the activity of liver zzso in zzso zzso cells isolated from the liver of obese mice are more easily activated by way of zzso zzso zzso stimulation resulting in zzso 12 and other inflammatory zzso expression in an zzso zzso zzso zzso cells also enhance liver natural killer T cell zzso death in an zzso zzso zzso using mice depleted of zzso immature zzso cells demonstrated the important role of zzso in liver zzso zzso injection of zzso particles causes zzso cell zzso and subsequent zzso to and zzso of the cells in the zzso 

zzso of a high-fat diet by B6 mice triggers an zzso of immature zzso cells in the zzso The immature zzso cells release zzso zzso and induce zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso further promotes excessive production of zzso zzso This zzso zzso of immature zzso cells may contribute to zzso liver zzso
