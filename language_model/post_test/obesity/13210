The prevalence of overweight zzso among children in the United States has increased during the last three decades, but prevalence measures fail to reveal the extent to which zzso children exceed the zzso zzso 

To measure the amount by which zzso children exceed the zzso zzso To examine the trend in this measure over the last three decades using data with measured weights and zzso 

Data used for analysis are from the National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso zzso for persons between 2 and 19 y of age from 1971 to zzso zzso measures were obtained by trained health zzso and the sample sizes range from zzso in zzso to zzso in zzso 

The extent of zzso is measured as the average amount by which each child's body mass index zzso exceeds their age and zzso zzso zzso This measure is examined by sex, age group and zzso The zzso threshold for those aged zzso y is defined as at or above the 95th zzso of the zzso zzso for age growth zzso 

The extent of child zzso has been increasing faster than the prevalence of child zzso for all zzso considered in this paper, including the analysis by age, sex, race and zzso The prevalence of zzso for children aged zzso y increased by zzso between zzso and zzso while the extent of zzso increased by zzso over the same time zzso 

Unlike prevalence measures, the measure of the extent of child zzso is sensitive to changes in the zzso distribution of the zzso This analysis reveals that not only have more children become zzso in the last three decades, but zzso children have been getting zzso
