zzso kidney disease occurs as a result of complex interactions between zzso and zzso zzso Changes in zzso zzso may play a major role in kidney zzso however, these changes are difficult to assess in zzso Here, we used zzso ultrasound imaging to evaluate cortical blood flow in a mouse model of high-fat zzso kidney zzso zzso mice were zzso to a standard diet zzso or a high-fat diet zzso for 30 zzso and then treated either with zzso or a zzso for an additional 6 zzso zzso ultrasound zzso imaging of the kidney was performed during infusion of a zzso contrast zzso Blood flow within the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso was derived from imaging zzso An increase in the time required to achieve full cortical zzso was observed for zzso mice relative to zzso This was reversed following treatment with zzso These data were concurrent with an increased zzso zzso rate in zzso mice compared with zzso or zzso zzso zzso treatment also zzso zzso disease, assessed by markers at the protein and zzso zzso Finally, a reduction in zzso density was found in zzso mice, and this was reversed upon zzso zzso This suggests that zzso in vascular density may be responsible for the elevated zzso time observed by zzso These data demonstrate that ultrasound contrast imaging is a robust and sensitive method for evaluating changes in zzso zzso zzso and that cortical zzso time may be a useful zzso for evaluating zzso zzso zzso
