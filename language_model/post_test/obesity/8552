zzso obesity is known to cause peripheral insulin resistance in zzso We have recently found that feeding cod protein to zzso rats prevents the development of insulin resistance in skeletal zzso In the present study, we have further explored the cellular mechanisms behind this beneficial effect of cod protein on skeletal muscle insulin zzso zzso were fed a standard zzso diet or a high-fat diet in which the protein source was either zzso zzso or cod proteins for 4 zzso zzso and muscle zzso disposal were reduced by approximately 50% in rats fed high-fat diets with zzso or soy zzso but these zzso were not observed in animals fed cod zzso zzso zzso zzso of the insulin zzso and insulin zzso zzso zzso proteins were similar in muscle of zzso and zzso rats regardless of the dietary protein zzso However, zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was severely impaired zzso in muscle of zzso rats consuming zzso or soy zzso In marked contrast, feeding rats with cod protein completely prevented the deleterious effect of fat feeding on zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the downstream zzso zzso by insulin, assessed by in zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were also impaired in muscle of zzso rats consuming zzso or soy zzso but these defects were also fully prevented by dietary cod zzso However, no effect of cod protein was observed on zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by insulin in rats fed high-fat diets with cod protein was associated with improved zzso of zzso to the zzso but not to the plasma zzso Taken together, these results show that dietary cod protein is a natural zzso agent that appears to prevent zzso muscle insulin resistance by zzso insulin zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and by selectively improving zzso zzso to the zzso
