To examine if intake of soft drinks is more closely associated with weight gain than other energy sources and if these associations are zzso through differences in energy intake or insulin zzso 

Data derived from the Danish part of the European Youth Heart Study zzso zzso zzso zzso weight, and waist circumference zzso were measured in zzso and again in zzso 

zzso of liquid zzso was associated with changes in waist circumference zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso attenuated slightly after adjusting for energy zzso but were substantially reduced when adjusting for zzso Adjustment for both insulin and energy intake attenuated the effect of soft drinks intake on zzso but not on zzso 

zzso zzso seemed more clearly associated with zzso and zzso than other energy zzso For zzso the association seemed to be based on decreases in insulin sensitivity rather than increases in energy zzso whereas for zzso the association seemed to be based on both increases in energy intake and decreases in insulin zzso
