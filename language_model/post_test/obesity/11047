Needles of pine species are rich in zzso which may exert beneficial effects on human zzso The present study was conducted to evaluate the in zzso and in zzso zzso effects of zzso zzso needle water extracts zzso zzso cells were zzso with various zzso of zzso (from zzso to 1 zzso and zzso stress was induced by zzso zzso zzso In the animal model, male zzso mice were fed a high-fat diet for 6 weeks to induce zzso and then mice were continually fed a high-fat diet with or without orally administered zzso zzso zzso body zzso for 5 zzso zzso with zzso prevented significant increases in zzso and zzso activity induced by zzso in zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso protein expression levels elevated by zzso were zzso in cells zzso with zzso In mice fed a high-fat diet, zzso significantly increased zzso activities of zzso and zzso zzso and lower zzso zzso levels were observed in the liver and kidney of mice with zzso zzso The present study demonstrates that zzso protects against zzso stress in zzso cells treated with zzso and in mice fed a high-fat zzso
