zzso is associated with left zzso zzso and dysfunction, but little is known about the structural zzso of zzso zzso and nerve fibers in this zzso We hypothesized that all three compartments should show quantitative structural zzso 

Ten zzso mice were randomly assigned to a control or obesity zzso zzso mice received standard zzso whereas obese mice received a high-fat Western zzso After 28 weeks, the mice were sacrificed, and the hearts were prepared for zzso zzso using light and electron zzso 

Body mass and left zzso mass were significantly elevated in obese zzso control zzso The left zzso zzso was accompanied by a significant increase in zzso zzso droplets and total zzso zzso The volume zzso of zzso free zzso and zzso did not differ between the zzso The total length of zzso was significantly enhanced in obese zzso control mice, whereas the total length of zzso zzso between zzso was not zzso 

zzso is associated with significant structural zzso in zzso and zzso whereas no structural changes in the zzso zzso were zzso The structural characteristics in obese mice do not provide a clear basis for functional changes observed in zzso cardiac zzso
