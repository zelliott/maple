To zzso if there are zzso in insulin zzso clearance in obesity under zzso conditions, plasma insulin and zzso were measured in 22 obese patients and 8 normal subjects, and the plasma zzso to insulin zzso ratio was used as an index of zzso insulin zzso In obese patients, the zzso to insulin zzso ratio correlated indirectly with zzso plasma insulin levels zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso being low in the obese patients with higher insulin levels and within the normal range in obese patients in which insulin levels were similar to those of control zzso It is suggested that zzso insulin extraction is decreased in zzso even under zzso conditions, but this zzso is only zzso when plasma insulin levels are zzso
