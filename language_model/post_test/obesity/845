Women with prior zzso diabetes zzso zzso are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and associated zzso Because increased fat mass and inflammatory processes are zzso risk factors, the relationship between insulin sensitivity, parameters of zzso zzso and plasma zzso of zzso was investigated in zzso both at 3 months and 12 months after zzso 

zzso sensitivity (through a frequently sampled intravenous zzso tolerance zzso and plasma zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso were measured in 89 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso age 32 zzso zzso zzso and in 19 women with normal zzso tolerance during pregnancy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 31 zzso zzso zzso 

zzso showed lower zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a decreased zzso zzso insulin sensitivity index zzso and disposition index zzso zzso but increased plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso After adjustment for body fat mass, plasma zzso remained lower in zzso zzso zzso and correlated positively with zzso zzso zzso and HDL cholesterol zzso zzso but zzso with plasma zzso zzso oral zzso tolerance test zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso On zzso analysis, only HDL cholesterol, zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso and zzso remained significant zzso of plasma zzso explaining zzso of its zzso Of note, zzso further decreased zzso zzso only in zzso zzso despite unchanged body fat content and distribution after a zzso zzso 

Lower plasma zzso zzso characterize women with previous zzso independently of the prevailing insulin sensitivity or the degree of obesity and are associated with zzso inflammation and zzso zzso
