zzso patients have a high prevalence of zzso sleep zzso zzso but a low response rate and high frequency of zzso after zzso zzso In this study we have determined the level of obstruction during sleep in 31 men with zzso using a zzso with multiple zzso zzso and a portable digital zzso The proportion of zzso episodes with obstruction at lower levels correlated with increasing body mass index zzso zzso zzso Thus, with increasing zzso there seems to be a shift to a lower level of zzso All patients with zzso 30 and zzso index zzso 5 had predominantly lower zzso zzso zzso This may explain why many obese patients fail to respond, or have relapses after zzso
