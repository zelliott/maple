To evaluate the changes of serum zzso levels after weight reduction in diabetic subjects with and without zzso we studied 10 obese healthy subjects, 12 obese diabetics with persistent zzso and 10 obese diabetic subjects without zzso zzso diabetic patients with zzso showed serum zzso levels significantly higher than zzso zzso while no difference was found between obese diabetics without zzso and healthy zzso All obese subjects followed a 12-month intensive weight reduction program during which the mean change in body mass index was similar between obese diabetic and obese healthy subjects zzso diabetics without zzso zzso vs zzso zzso obese diabetics with zzso zzso vs zzso zzso obese healthy zzso zzso vs zzso zzso The mean changes in serum zzso levels tended to be similar in two groups of subjects studied zzso diabetics without zzso zzso vs zzso zzso obese healthy zzso zzso vs zzso zzso obese zzso subjects showed higher zzso levels zzso vs zzso zzso than zzso diabetic and obese healthy zzso In conclusion, during weight loss, independently from the quality of zzso control, serum zzso zzso declined in both groups of obese zzso The changes of zzso in diabetics seem to be similar to those observed in healthy obese zzso
