zzso is a zzso family member that acts as a negative regulator of muscle zzso Mice lacking the myostatin gene zzso have a widespread increase in skeletal muscle mass resulting from a combination of muscle fiber zzso and zzso Here we show that zzso mice have a significant reduction in fat zzso with increasing age compared with zzso zzso even in the setting of normal food intake zzso to body zzso normal body temperature, and a slightly decreased resting zzso zzso To investigate whether myostatin might be an effective target for suppressing the development of obesity in settings of abnormal fat zzso we analyzed the effect of the zzso zzso in two genetic models of zzso zzso lethal yellow zzso and obese zzso In each case, loss of zzso led to a partial suppression of fat zzso and of abnormal zzso zzso Our findings raise the possibility that pharmacological agents that block myostatin function may be useful not only for enhancing muscle growth, but also for slowing or preventing the development of obesity and type 2 zzso
