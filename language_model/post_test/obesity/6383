To determine the effect of a zzso zzso weight loss diet compared with a zzso zzso diet on fat and lean tissue and zzso and zzso zzso and insulin zzso 

zzso dietary protein for zzso zzso during energy restriction and weight loss has been effective in sparing lean mass and improving insulin sensitivity in obese subjects but has not been tested in subjects with type 2 zzso We compared an zzso diet zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fat zzso saturated fatty zzso zzso zzso fatty zzso zzso zzso fatty zzso with an LP diet zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fat zzso saturated fatty zzso zzso zzso fatty zzso zzso zzso fatty zzso in 54 obese men and women with type 2 diabetes during 8 weeks of energy restriction zzso zzso and 4 weeks of energy zzso Body composition was determined by zzso X-ray zzso at weeks 0 and zzso 

Overall, weight loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso was achieved independently of diet zzso However, women on the zzso diet lost significantly more total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and abdominal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fat compared with the women on the LP diet, zzso in men, there was no difference in fat loss between diets zzso zzso zzso zzso Total lean mass decreased in all subjects independently of diet zzso LDL cholesterol reduction was significantly greater on the zzso diet zzso than on the LP diet zzso zzso zzso 

Both dietary patterns resulted in improvements in the cardiovascular disease zzso risk profile as a consequence of weight zzso However, the greater reductions in total and abdominal fat mass in women and greater LDL cholesterol reduction observed in both sexes on the zzso diet suggest that it is a valid diet choice for reducing zzso risk in type 2 zzso
