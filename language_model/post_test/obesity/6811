To better understand how elevated zzso levels regulate food intake and obesity in zzso we treated zzso female mice with zzso zzso zzso zzso measured food intake and body weight, and evaluated zzso changes in liver function, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mice were treated with zzso or zzso Mice were then fed a high fat diet under zzso or zzso conditions for 3 zzso We found that when zzso zzso mice had free access to food zzso they had increased food intake and higher body weight compared with control zzso These mice also had a significantly greater zzso of fat in the liver and exhibited increased zzso zzso impaired zzso zzso and resistance to zzso However, when these mice were placed on a restricted diet and fed the same caloric amounts as controls zzso their body weight increased at the same rate as control zzso This suggests that zzso regulates food intake through altered zzso sensitivity, and this increase of food intake could significantly contribute to an obesity zzso In zzso we demonstrated a role for zzso in the regulation of food intake and weight gain in females using a mouse zzso This model will be useful to further zzso the role of elevated zzso in zzso
