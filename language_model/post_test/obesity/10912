To determine the zzso and dietary characteristics of energy zzso in a healthy population of middle-aged women using accurate body composition zzso 

zzso study of zzso healthy middle-aged female volunteers, unaware of any hypotheses regarding diet and body zzso mean age 58 y zzso zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The prevalence of overweight zzso zzso zzso zzso and obesity zzso 30 zzso were zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso intake by food frequency questionnaire zzso zzso zzso zzso 197 subjects also completed seven-day food zzso body composition by dual energy X-ray zzso zzso physical activity by zzso zzso zzso were subjects whose estimated energy expenditure zzso exceeded reported energy intake zzso Three zzso levels of zzso were determined from estimates of zzso zzso zzso body composition zzso zzso and two including zzso from physical activity zzso the ratio zzso or ratios from reported physical activity zzso 

zzso had significantly greater weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso total fat P zzso fat free mass zzso zzso but not zzso zzso body zzso than zzso at each of the three zzso zzso zzso reported significantly lower zzso of energy and all zzso zzso zzso zzso as a percentage of zzso the reported diet of zzso was significantly lower in fat, similar in zzso and higher in zzso Similar results were found with seven-day food record data, although reported zzso from these were significantly lower than those from zzso The prevalence of zzso was highest in obese subjects zzso by zzso zzso with up to zzso of these subjects zzso zzso and in the highest zzso zzso zzso of zzso In those with zzso zzso zzso the zzso prevalence rate of zzso was zzso zzso however, the rates of zzso were similar between zzso of zzso Most zzso but not all, zzso were found in the lowest zzso for reported zzso 

A low reported zzso and greater zzso may help identify energy zzso However, whilst zzso may more frequently be zzso (by zzso they are not necessarily zzso zzso direct measures of body zzso As zzso was present among all zzso of zzso and zzso these results zzso the importance of following past recommendations to identify and exclude energy zzso in nutritional zzso Where zzso have not been zzso reported zzso relationships must remain in zzso
