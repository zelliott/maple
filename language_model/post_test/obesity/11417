The putative role played by insulin zzso in modulating zzso tissue zzso in the zzso state was evaluated in obese conscious zzso rats treated with zzso or zzso acid zzso zzso and compared with zzso lean and obese zzso The rates of appearance zzso of zzso and free fatty acid zzso primary zzso zzso and secondary zzso of plasma zzso in zzso fat were measured using constant infusion of stable zzso zzso zzso and radioactive zzso The overall zzso flux zzso zzso was increased zzso and zzso in obese animals treated with zzso or zzso 16, respectively, resulting in increased zzso export zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso fatty acids was enhanced twofold by insulin zzso whereas zzso of plasma fatty acids was unaffected by either zzso Despite the unchanged zzso zzso in zzso 16 or the increased zzso zzso induced by zzso very low density zzso production rates were robustly zzso Total zzso tissue zzso used as an estimate of zzso conversion to zzso was increased zzso by treatment with the insulin zzso Our results indicate that, in the zzso state, insulin zzso zzso in zzso a significant zzso rather than suppression of zzso tissue zzso together with stimulation of zzso conversion to zzso
