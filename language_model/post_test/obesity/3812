zzso binding protein zzso zzso primarily from the liver and zzso zzso was recently proposed as a link between obesity and insulin zzso The role of zzso in pediatric zzso its relationship with zzso zzso and its response to lifestyle changes are not zzso 

The objective of the study was to determine in children: 1) the status of zzso levels in lean zzso zzso 2) the relationship between zzso levels and zzso zzso and 3) the effect of zzso intervention on zzso zzso 

zzso and obese children zzso zzso zzso matched for age zzso zzso to zzso zzso and maturity stage zzso zzso were studied at baseline and with lifestyle intervention in obese subjects only zzso zzso zzso 

Patients received 3 months of zzso and controlled physical zzso lifestyle zzso 

zzso levels in children before and after intervention and the relationship between zzso and zzso inflammation were zzso 

Higher zzso levels were found in the obese group zzso lean group zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with not only zzso of obesity and insulin resistance but also inflammatory factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso protein and zzso respectively, P zzso zzso reduced zzso levels by approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso reduction was correlated with the magnitude of decrease in inflammatory factors zzso zzso zzso 

zzso in serum zzso occur at an early age in the clinical course of obesity and appear to correlate with zzso zzso zzso intervention almost entirely reversed the raised zzso levels in obese zzso Future studies should determine whether zzso of zzso is a direct trigger for the insulin resistance and zzso inflammation implicated in the premature development of cardiovascular disease and zzso
