Our purpose was to assess to what extent disturbances in zzso maternal metabolism and zzso complications and zzso contribute to poorer zzso development in offspring of diabetic zzso 

One hundred zzso pregnant women and their singleton offspring participated in this prospective zzso zzso zzso women had zzso diabetes zzso and 101 women had zzso diabetes zzso zzso estimates of circulating maternal fuels were obtained throughout each index pregnancy along with detailed records of the zzso course and zzso zzso were administered the zzso development index of the zzso zzso of zzso Development at age 2 years and the zzso Test Of Motor zzso at ages 6, 8, and 9 zzso Tests were performed blinded to the mother's zzso zzso status, and zzso history, and the child's previous test zzso zzso correlations and analyses of zzso were used to control for other influences and zzso such as family socioeconomic status, racial or ethnic origin, patient group zzso zzso or zzso diabetes zzso and sex of zzso 

Children's average score on the zzso test at ages 6 to 9 years correlated significantly with maternal second zzso zzso and third zzso zzso zzso zzso There was also a borderline association between the children's scores on the zzso development index at age 2 years and maternal zzso zzso levels zzso zzso zzso No other correlations approached zzso 

zzso zzso experiences continue to influence the zzso course in offspring of diabetic zzso zzso practices in diabetes management and zzso and zzso care appear to effectively mitigate the potential long-term effects of most zzso complications and zzso Management and zzso and zzso care appear to effectively zzso the potential long-term effects of most zzso complications and zzso
