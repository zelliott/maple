To study the potential role of the zzso gene zzso in childhood zzso we have investigated zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso tissue obtained from zzso zzso children zzso zzso zzso obese zzso children zzso zzso zzso and children with zzso syndrome zzso zzso 6) by in zzso zzso zzso We have also investigated the zzso serum zzso levels in such zzso Compared with zzso children, zzso zzso expression was higher both in children with zzso syndrome and in children with zzso obesity zzso zzso Furthermore, the serum zzso levels were also significantly higher in both children with zzso syndrome and zzso obesity compared with the zzso children zzso zzso However, no significant differences in zzso tissue zzso zzso or serum zzso levels were observed between children with zzso syndrome and zzso obese zzso As expected both zzso serum zzso levels and zzso zzso expression levels correlated to body mass index zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, p zzso No difference in zzso expression between zzso syndrome and zzso childhood obesity could be revealed in the present zzso However, differences in the zzso response to zzso between the two forms of obesity cannot be zzso
