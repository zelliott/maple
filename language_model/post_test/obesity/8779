To determine effects of dietary zzso and protein on plasma zzso and free fatty acid zzso and zzso fatty acid synthesis during weight gain and rapid weight loss in zzso 

24 zzso zzso 

Cats were fed a high energy diet until they gained zzso of their ideal body weight and then randomly assigned to receive 1 of 4 weight reduction diets (6 zzso at zzso of maintenance energy zzso zzso contained a low or high quality protein source and a zzso source deficient or sufficient in long chain essential fatty zzso Plasma samples and liver biopsy specimens were obtained before and after weight gain and during and after weight loss for determination of free fatty acid, zzso and zzso zzso zzso of these substances was measured by use of isotope zzso 

Plasma total cholesterol concentration and concentration of zzso zzso increased after weight gain, compared with baseline zzso Weight loss resulted in a significant decrease in zzso of all zzso zzso except high density zzso High density zzso concentration was significantly greater in cats fed diets containing an oil zzso compared with cats fed diets containing corn zzso zzso acid synthesis after weight loss was below the detection limit of the measurement zzso 

In cats undergoing rapid weight loss there is neither increased zzso synthesis nor decreased transport of very low density zzso from the liver, suggesting that their involvement in the development of zzso zzso may be zzso
