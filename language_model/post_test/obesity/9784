To further understand documented associations between obesity and urban zzso this research describes zzso zzso between zzso activities and commuting zzso A zzso of zzso zzso individuals employed full-time and residing in urban counties is constructed from the American Time Use zzso zzso Data are analyzed using seemingly unrelated zzso to zzso zzso activity decreases in response to additional time spent zzso Outcomes are total daily minutes spent in physical activity at a moderate or greater intensity, preparing food, eating meals with family, and zzso zzso time is measured as all travel time between home and work and vice zzso The mean commuting time is 62 zzso daily, the median is 55 zzso and zzso of workers commute 120 zzso or zzso Spending an additional 60 zzso daily commuting above average is associated with a zzso decrease in zzso zzso activities and spending an additional 120 zzso is associated with a zzso zzso The greatest percentage of commuting time comes from sleeping time reductions zzso Additionally, larger proportions of commuting time are taken from physical activity and food preparation relative to the mean commuting zzso of 60 zzso spent zzso zzso is taken from physical activity and zzso is taken from food zzso of 120 zzso zzso zzso is taken from physical activity and zzso is taken from food zzso The results indicate that longer commutes are associated with behavioral patterns which over time may contribute to obesity and other poor health zzso These findings will assist both urban planners and researchers wishing to understand time zzso impacts on zzso
