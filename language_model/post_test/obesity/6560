IGF-1 zzso were measured in plasma from 20 obese patients and 20 zzso and zzso control subjects all of whom were zzso Plasma IGF-1 zzso were lower zzso less than zzso in the obese individuals than in the zzso Plasma zzso and insulin responses to stimulation with oral zzso were measured in 7 healthy normal weight individuals and both before and after energy restriction in 7 obese zzso Before treatment the obese individuals were zzso zzso and integrated zzso zzso p less than zzso and showed zzso of the plasma zzso response to stimulation zzso and integrated zzso values p less than zzso and less than zzso zzso following oral zzso when compared to normal weight zzso Plasma insulin levels fell (both zzso and integrated zzso p less than zzso and less than zzso zzso and zzso plasma zzso responses increased (both peak and integrated values p less than zzso and less than zzso zzso in the obese individuals following 3 zzso treatment with a synthetic very low energy zzso Plasma IGF-1 zzso remained unchanged during energy zzso These results fail to support an zzso IGF-1 zzso feedback zzso on the zzso axis as the cause of the attenuated release of zzso in zzso
