zzso syndrome and zzso are linked with cardiovascular disease zzso in the obese zzso In particular, cardiovascular risk is more frequent in central obesity and is associated with zzso zzso MA and changes of zzso zzso to proteins in obesity might be related with zzso zzso modifications zzso is zzso zzso Since zzso is zzso involved in zzso zzso regulation, the purpose of this study was to examine whether changes of circulating zzso levels might zzso induce MA and zzso in patients with central zzso 

Forty zzso obese zzso 22 with central zzso zzso and 18 with peripheral zzso zzso body fat distribution and 11 healthy zzso 

zzso insulin and zzso zzso zzso and after oral zzso tolerance test zzso by radio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rate zzso zzso total zzso and urinary zzso rates of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and insulin zzso zzso and during zzso were higher in the CO than the PO zzso zzso zzso zzso were increased, and not zzso suppressed during zzso in patients with CO zzso zzso zzso 60 and 120 zzso zzso vs PO zzso Moreover, zzso zzso were significantly correlated with zzso in the CO group zzso zzso zzso 60 zzso after zzso zzso zzso whereas no correlations were found in the PO zzso Higher zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso urinary zzso were found in patients with CO than in the PO zzso 

The increase of serum zzso zzso may be associated with the enhancement of zzso in patients with central zzso zzso zzso might influence the development of MA and of zzso by means of a zzso mechanism so contributing to increase the risk of zzso zzso complications and of zzso in central zzso
