Type 2 diabetes is associated with a small body size at birth and a high zzso in adult zzso The aim of our study was to assess the associations between Type 2 diabetes and birth size, infant growth and age at zzso zzso 

We carried out a zzso study of zzso subjects born in Helsinki during 1934 to zzso On average, they had 18 zzso of height and weight between birth and 12 years of zzso In western countries zzso usually decreases after the age of 2 years and rises again at around 6 zzso so-called zzso zzso We defined age at zzso rebound by the age of lowest zzso between one and 12 zzso We identified people with Type 2 diabetes using a national zzso 

A total of 290 individuals developed Type 2 diabetes in adult zzso The cumulative zzso of Type 2 diabetes decreased progressively from zzso in persons whose zzso rebound occurred before the age of 5 years to zzso in those in whom it occurred after 7 years ( zzso Early zzso rebound was preceded by low weight gain between birth and 1 year ( zzso 

Large differences in the zzso of Type 2 diabetes are associated with growth rates in zzso weight gain in infancy and age at zzso zzso
