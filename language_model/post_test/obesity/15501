The zzso zzso gene zzso has been implicated in weight zzso Recently, two independent groups reported zzso zzso associated with a dominant form of obesity zzso zzso We screened the coding region of the zzso in zzso extremely obese children and adolescents zzso body mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 25 healthy zzso students zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 52 normal weight individuals zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 51 zzso with anorexia zzso zzso zzso IV criteria, mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 27 patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso IV criteria, mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by single strand zzso zzso analysis zzso Several zzso were identified, including the zzso zzso described zzso The zzso were as zzso a) The deletion of 4 zzso zzso of zzso at zzso zzso results in a zzso thus rendering a truncated zzso This zzso has been assumed to be associated with zzso zzso obesity in humans zzso Both the index patient zzso zzso zzso height zzso zzso age zzso zzso and her mother zzso zzso zzso height zzso zzso age zzso zzso were zzso for the zzso b) A nonsense zzso at position 35 of the zzso was detected in two obese zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This zzso leads to a truncated protein that encompasses the zzso zzso zzso Both carriers additionally showed zzso a zzso zzso zzso In both of these cases zzso and zzso were zzso zzso thus these variations form a zzso zzso zzso A male obese zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Four different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected in four different male zzso zzso All of these zzso (a to zzso were found solely in extremely obese individuals whose zzso were all above the zzso zzso zzso A silent zzso zzso zzso was detected in a male zzso zzso zzso A previously described zzso zzso 3) was detected with similar zzso in all different study zzso 1) We identified a novel zzso zzso with similar zzso zzso in all groups under zzso In conclusion, our data indicate that zzso in the zzso are not zzso Whereas our data support the evidence for zzso inherited obesity as revealed by the three obese zzso with zzso the functional significance of the zzso zzso remains to be zzso
