To explore the association between body mass index and mortality in the elderly taking the diagnosis of zzso into zzso 

zzso zzso 

cohort study of aging in Medicare recipients in New York zzso 

zzso elderly individuals 65 years and older of both zzso 

We used zzso hazards zzso for zzso zzso analyses relating body mass index zzso and weight change to zzso zzso 

There were zzso deaths during zzso zzso of zzso There were 210 cases of prevalent zzso at zzso and 209 cases of incident zzso during zzso Among zzso persons with zzso information, the lowest zzso of zzso was associated with a higher mortality risk compared to the second zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after adjustment for age, zzso education, ethnic group, smoking, cancer, and zzso When persons with zzso were zzso both the lowest zzso zzso zzso and highest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso were related to higher zzso Weight loss was related to a higher mortality risk zzso zzso zzso zzso but this association was attenuated when persons with short follow-up or persons with zzso were zzso 

The presence of zzso does not explain the association between low zzso and higher mortality in the zzso However, zzso may explain the association between weight loss and higher zzso
