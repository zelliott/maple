Numerous studies have documented an obesity paradox in which the overweight and obese elderly have a better prognosis than those with ideal body zzso Good prognosis among the overweight or obese elderly may reflect the relative safety of storing the harmful zzso zzso known as persistent organic pollutants zzso in zzso tissue rather than in other critical zzso zzso we hypothesized lower mortality among the obese elderly with a higher body burden of zzso but this pattern may not exist among the obese elderly with a lower body burden of zzso 

Using the National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso zzso zzso study with a mean zzso zzso we tested whether the association between fat mass and total mortality in zzso zzso for zzso zzso elderly participants aged zzso years differed depending on serum zzso of 23 zzso 

There were statistically significant interactions between fat mass and zzso in predicting total zzso In those with low POP zzso there was no obesity zzso mortality increased with fat mass zzso ratios about 2-3 in the highest zzso lowest zzso of fat zzso However, consistent with an obesity paradox, these patterns completely disappeared in those with high POP zzso Compared with the lowest zzso of fat mass, statistically significantly lower mortality was observed in the elderly in the third to fifth zzso of fat zzso In the case of zzso zzso the mortality in the highest zzso of fat mass was only one-fifth of that in the lowest zzso 

These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that zzso tissue provides relatively safe storage of toxic zzso zzso a phenomenon that could explain the obesity zzso Although weight loss may be beneficial among the obese elderly with low POP zzso weight loss in the obese elderly with higher serum zzso of zzso may carry some zzso
