zzso in zzso metabolism are among the risk factors for zzso cardiovascular disease frequently present in patients with zzso zzso We have examined the effects of dietary restriction induced by gastric bypass surgery on plasma zzso levels in 22 morbidity obese zzso Operation induced weight loss in all zzso zzso (12 zzso 7 zzso zzso decreased from zzso zzso 67 zzso zzso zzso before zzso to 104 zzso 44 zzso zzso less than zzso total cholesterol decreased from zzso zzso 52 to 166 zzso 39 zzso zzso less than zzso LDL cholesterol levels decreased from 119 zzso 42 to 104 zzso 36 zzso zzso less than zzso and HDL cholesterol levels increased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso less than zzso HDL cholesterol to LDL cholesterol ratio increased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso less than zzso The results of zzso zzso zzso and B zzso zzso zzso zzso paralleled the changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio increased suggesting an increase in the concentration of zzso We conclude that weight loss following gastric bypass surgery is associated with favorable changes in zzso metabolism which may help prevent or delay the development of zzso cardiovascular zzso The mechanism responsible for the zzso changes remains to be zzso
