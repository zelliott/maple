zzso zzso zzso production is considered a zzso factor in zzso fatty liver disease zzso zzso blood production of zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso was studied in relation to the severity of zzso changes of the liver in obese zzso zzso zzso levels in serum and production of zzso and zzso in peripheral blood cell cultures after stimulation with zzso zzso zzso zzso were measured in 11 patients with zzso and 15 with zzso who underwent zzso with a zzso zzso in zzso and Y, and in 9 controls who underwent zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was 122 and zzso higher in patients with zzso than control values, zzso In patients with zzso zzso production was 300 and zzso higher and that of zzso 110 and zzso higher, as compared with controls and zzso patients, zzso zzso of zzso was positively correlated with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso production were both positively correlated with the degree of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso at liver zzso and with the zzso model assessment index zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso serum zzso and zzso levels were comparable in the three groups zzso It is concluded that elevated production of zzso and zzso by in zzso zzso whole blood cell cultures occurs in zzso obese patients, which might play a zzso role upon inflammatory zzso zzso of the zzso
