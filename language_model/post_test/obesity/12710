zzso children may be at increased risk of becoming obese zzso To examine the relationship between obesity in childhood and obesity in adulthood, we reviewed the zzso literature published between 1970 and July zzso zzso between studies was complicated by differences in study design, definitions of zzso and zzso methods zzso Although the correlations between zzso measures of obesity in childhood and those in adulthood varied considerably among studies, the associations were consistently zzso 

About a third zzso to zzso of obese preschool children were obese as adults, and about half zzso to zzso of obese school-age children were obese as zzso For all studies and across all ages, the risk of adult obesity was at least twice as high for obese children as for zzso zzso The risk of adult obesity was greater for children who were at higher levels of obesity and for children who were obese at older zzso 

The wide range of estimates in this literature are, in part, due to differences in study designs, definitions of zzso ages at which participants were measured, intervals between zzso and population and cultural zzso
