Recently, a gene zzso a novel human zzso zzso designated zzso was zzso The zzso zzso was mapped to a region on mouse zzso 7 which in several models has been shown to be linked to obesity and zzso Single strand zzso zzso zzso analysis and direct sequencing of the coding region of the zzso gene in 35 obese Caucasian zzso patients of Danish ancestry revealed one zzso zzso replacing an zzso with a zzso at zzso zzso The zzso acid zzso was present in 24 of the 35 zzso examined zzso The zzso frequency of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso among 144 subjects with juvenile onset zzso zzso zzso among 182 subjects randomly selected at the draft board examination, and zzso zzso among lean control subjects selected from the same study zzso Within these zzso there were no differences in zzso values at different ages among zzso carriers and zzso zzso In a zzso sample of zzso young healthy Caucasians the zzso showed no association with zzso in zzso zzso ratio, fat mass or weight gain during childhood or zzso The zzso zzso was not related to zzso in zzso values of serum insulin and zzso or to an impaired insulin sensitivity zzso We conclude that genetic zzso in the human zzso gene is not a common factor contributing to zzso in obese Danish Caucasian subjects and the common zzso zzso acid zzso of the gene is not implicated in the zzso of juvenile or maturity onset obesity or insulin resistance in zzso
