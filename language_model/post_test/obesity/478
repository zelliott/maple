In zzso beta cells activate zzso mechanisms to adapt to the higher insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prevents zzso zzso and is a potent target for the treatment of diabetes, but the mechanisms of its zzso and regulation in obesity are zzso In the present study, we zzso the regulation of zzso zzso by zzso zzso receptors in zzso 

zzso and regulation of zzso were studied in pancreatic sections from lean and obese diabetic patients, zzso controls and in isolated zzso zzso zzso and insulin zzso zzso tolerance and beta cell mass were studied in zzso (also known as zzso zzso 

zzso levels were elevated in beta cells of obese patients, but zzso in patients with type 2 diabetes zzso zzso zzso and zzso fatty acids rapidly activated zzso and zzso zzso in human zzso and this was inhibited by zzso zzso In line with our results in zzso zzso mice had a lower capacity to zzso zzso They exhibited severe and rapid zzso zzso intolerance and impaired beta cell function in response to a zzso diet, were unable to compensate by increasing their beta cell mass in response to the diet and showed increased beta cell zzso 

Our study shows a tight correlation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and regulation of beta cell mass and zzso The increase in zzso production is one mechanism that may explain how beta cells compensate by adapting to the higher insulin zzso zzso within that system may result in the progression of zzso
