Eighty-one healthy subjects divided into three group according to their zzso All subjects were evaluated by conventional zzso zzso and zzso A full zzso were performed in subjects with zzso zzso 30 zzso 

RV zzso and zzso diameters of patients in these three groups were similar zzso zzso There were no differences between each group in RV zzso tract fractional zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso plane zzso excursion zzso zzso zzso No correlation observed between zzso and RV zzso parameters obtained with zzso zzso peak zzso strain and zzso were similar in all groups through each segment zzso zzso 

The results of our study show no changes in the RV functions in obese and overweight who were otherwise healthy zzso We also revealed a significant correlation between zzso and left zzso diameters and wall thickness but no relation with RV diameters or zzso
