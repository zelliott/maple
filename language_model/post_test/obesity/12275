The present study investigated the effects of zzso zzso gain on respiratory function and airway responsiveness in healthy zzso using zzso whole body zzso zzso Six adult dogs were examined before and after a fattening zzso The zzso diet induced a mean increase in zzso of zzso zzso zzso parameters were recorded prior to airway zzso testing zzso increasing zzso of zzso zzso An airway responsiveness index zzso was calculated as the zzso concentration necessary to reach zzso of zzso enhanced pause zzso zzso zzso The same dogs underwent a zzso zzso zzso stimulation testing 2 weeks zzso zzso zzso showed that obese dogs had tidal volume per zzso zzso that was significantly decreased whilst respiratory rate zzso increased zzso zzso decreased significantly in obese zzso indicating increased zzso zzso administration induced a significant increase in zzso minute volume per zzso zzso peak zzso and zzso flows per zzso zzso and zzso in both normal and obese dogs although the zzso increase was significantly less marked in the obese zzso In conclusion, obesity induced changes in zzso respiratory zzso increased zzso and a blunted response to zzso respiratory zzso This combination of zzso respiratory zzso zzso testing and pharmacological stimulation testing using zzso zzso can help characterize pulmonary function and airway responsiveness in obese zzso
