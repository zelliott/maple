The objective of the current study was to examine the potential impact of a cryptic zzso repeat zzso in zzso 3 of zzso zzso on serum zzso levels and zzso zzso as well as obesity and estimates of insulin, zzso and zzso metabolism in zzso unrelated Swedish men born in zzso Moreover, we examined if a single zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 3 was associated with these zzso The amplification of the zzso locus yielded a zzso zzso and a zzso with one additional copy of the zzso repeat unit zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso Tests for differences in zzso showed that subjects with the longer zzso chain reaction zzso repeat product zzso zzso zzso had significantly higher serum zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with subjects with the shorter zzso product zzso zzso zzso zzso cortisol levels, as well as obesity and its related zzso zzso were the same across the zzso zzso In conclusion, a zzso zzso in zzso 3 of zzso is associated with elevated serum zzso zzso This association might reflect variations in zzso expression and/or activity, because zzso 3 zzso among others, the coding sequences for zzso
