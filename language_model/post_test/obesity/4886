zzso has been associated with lower serum testosterone, theoretically resulting in decreased zzso zzso zzso has also been associated with zzso enlargement, making the detection of zzso cancer more zzso Together these findings would result in an apparent protective effect of obesity on prostate cancer risk due to technical detection issues unrelated to cancer zzso We examined the association between zzso and zzso and prostate weight in a cohort of men undergoing zzso 

We evaluated the association of zzso with prostate weight and zzso using linear regression, adjusting for patient age at zzso year of zzso race, and pathological stage and grade in zzso men treated with zzso between 1988 and 2004 at the 5 equal access medical centers that comprise the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital zzso 

On zzso analysis increasing zzso was associated with increasing prostate weight but only in men younger than 63 years and not in men 63 years or older zzso zzso and zzso zzso In men younger than 63 years mean zzso adjusted prostate weight zzso zzso in those with a zzso of less than 25 vs 30 to zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no significant association between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In a cohort of men undergoing zzso obesity was associated with larger prostate size but only in younger zzso There was no association between zzso and zzso Assuming equal zzso the degree of zzso enlargement observed in younger obese men in this study would be expected to result in a modest decrease in the odds of detecting prostate cancer in a contemporary series of zzso screened men due to the decreased sensitivity of cancer detection related to larger prostate zzso zzso may appear protective for prostate cancer in younger men due to technical issues unrelated to cancer zzso
