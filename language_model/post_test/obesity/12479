Studies have previously indicated that surgical outcomes are poorer for obese zzso To date, few reports concerning the effect of obesity on patient outcomes following a zzso for zzso zzso zzso have been zzso The present study, therefore, sought to determine the impact of patients' body mass index zzso zzso on zzso and long-term surgical outcomes and to identify potential zzso factors for zzso following a zzso 

Patient data was zzso collected from 181 consecutive patients between September 2002 and August 2007 who had undergone zzso for zzso with zzso zzso Patients were assigned to three groups according to their zzso zzso zzso standard zzso and zzso and the clinical and pathological data, surgical outcome, and long-term survival were analyzed and compared between the three zzso 

The overall survival rate of the low zzso group was notably below that of the standard zzso zzso outcomes were not significantly different between the three zzso zzso analysis revealed that a low zzso zzso is a predictor of zzso zzso 

The present study suggests that a low zzso is a significant zzso factor for low overall survival when performing a zzso for zzso
