The objective was to examine cardiovascular zzso zzso function and its potential relationships with zzso resistance, insulin resistance, zzso stress, and inflammation in a pediatric sample with varying levels of zzso 

Participants were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 male, 4 zzso overweight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 male, 4 zzso and obese children zzso zzso zzso 6 male, 10 zzso who had zzso function assessed via heart rate zzso zzso methods during resting zzso Standard zzso and zzso measures zzso zzso units zzso measure of zzso nervous system zzso and low zzso ratio zzso overall zzso zzso of zzso were zzso zzso blood samples were drawn for measurement of zzso insulin, zzso zzso zzso soluble zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso were reported as mean zzso standard error of the zzso 

zzso had significantly elevated zzso and decreased zzso when compared with zzso zzso zzso but no differences between zzso and zzso were zzso zzso of zzso were significantly related to zzso insulin resistance, zzso and zzso zzso zzso but these relationships were not significant after adjustment for fat zzso 

When compared with zzso zzso but not zzso children are characterized by zzso dysfunction and increased zzso insulin resistance, zzso stress, and inflammation zzso The relationships between these factors seem to be dependent on quantity of fat mass and/or other factors associated with being zzso
