The presence of distracting stimuli during eating increases the meal size and could thereby contribute to zzso and zzso However, the effects of zzso distraction on later food intake are less zzso 

We sought to test the hypothesis that distraction zzso memory zzso for a zzso which, in turn, increases later food zzso 

The current study assessed the effects of playing zzso (a computerized zzso game) during a fixed lunch, which was eaten at a fixed rate, on memory for lunch and food intake in a taste test 30 zzso zzso A zzso design was used with 44 zzso Participants in the zzso group ate the same lunch in the absence of any distracting zzso 

zzso individuals were less full after lunch, and they ate significantly more zzso in the taste test than did zzso participants zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso P zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso memory for the presentation of the 9 lunch items was less accurate in participants who had been distracted during zzso 

These findings provide further evidence that distraction during one meal has the capacity to influence subsequent zzso They may also help to explain the well-documented association between sedentary zzso activities and zzso
