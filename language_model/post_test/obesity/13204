The aims of this study were to test the possible association between zzso fatty liver disease zzso and iron and insulin resistance, and to determine the prevalence of zzso in apparently healthy obese zzso 

zzso clinical zzso zzso 

A total of 210 apparently healthy obese patients, aged from 18 to 65 zzso with a body mass index zzso of 28 zzso or more, were enrolled in a body weight reduction program in our zzso 

All the subjects underwent screening and zzso zzso including zzso data zzso zzso testing, and zzso of the zzso zzso was defined as fatty liver diagnosed by zzso plus persistent zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Of the 210 patients, zzso zzso had fatty zzso zzso zzso zzso in two separate tests was further detected in zzso zzso of zzso Multiple zzso zzso analysis showed waist circumference and insulin resistance to be independently associated with fatty zzso zzso zzso level and insulin resistance were two major risk factors predicting zzso 

The prevalence of zzso was zzso zzso in obese zzso As both zzso induced by insulin resistance and iron overload represented by zzso zzso might damage zzso we concluded that these two factors were significantly associated with zzso in obese zzso
