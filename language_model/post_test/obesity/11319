Increased body mass index zzso is an established zzso cancer risk zzso High waist circumference or zzso zzso may better reflect an abnormal zzso state and be more zzso of zzso cancer risk than zzso 

We examined zzso waist zzso zzso and hip circumference in relation to zzso cancer risk among zzso participants followed for 10 zzso We derived standardized zzso cancer risk estimates for each zzso zzso and compared zzso characteristics zzso zzso In women, we examined whether hormone replacement therapy zzso use modified the associations between zzso measures and zzso zzso 

We zzso zzso zzso zzso In men, increased colon cancer risks were associated with zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso waist circumference zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In women, zzso variables were unrelated to colon zzso For men and women, zzso variables were unrelated to zzso zzso Compared with zzso waist circumference and zzso did not materially influence colon cancer prediction models zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In current zzso users, colon cancer was zzso or suggestively zzso associated with waist circumference zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but positively related to hip circumference zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso waist zzso and zzso show comparable positive associations with colon cancer in zzso zzso between zzso measures and colon cancer are weak or zzso in women, but there is some evidence for effect modification by zzso 

These findings may improve our understanding of the relation of zzso to zzso zzso
