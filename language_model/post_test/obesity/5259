zzso induced in mice by a single injection of gold zzso or by a change to a zzso zzso zzso zzso were studied in young and adult mice of Charles River zzso These two forms of obesity were compared and contrasted with normal animals maintained on zzso fat diet for zzso The comparison was based on individual growth, zzso fat, water and zzso dry weight of carcasses and their distribution of weights within larger zzso Young animals on diets containing zzso fat showed an elevated zzso of fat but not of zzso Individual variations lead to an zzso distributed population where in some animals the excess in weight was characterized by an excessive fat and lean body mass and in others by an excess fat zzso Some animals showed no excessive weight when compared to animals maintained on zzso zzso The rapid gain in weight which followed a successful injection with gold zzso showed a normal zzso and was correlated with an zzso of fat in young and adult zzso A significant retention of water was observed only in zzso The relative merits of these zzso as models for human regulatory zzso are briefly zzso
