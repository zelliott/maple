We evaluated if selected zzso zzso and/or the protein zzso of zzso signaling 3 zzso could account for decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in the skeletal muscle of the obese zzso zzso 

Eight lean and eight obese zzso rats zzso of age were obtained and allowed to feed ad zzso for zzso before undergoing hind limb zzso in the presence of zzso zzso 

zzso skeletal muscle zzso activity and zzso transport rates were reduced zzso in obese compared to lean zzso zzso concentration remained unchanged although zzso zzso zzso was decreased zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was increased zzso in obese animals compared to lean zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was increased zzso in the obese zzso zzso concentration was decreased zzso and zzso zzso was increased zzso in the obese compared to lean zzso zzso zzso concentration and zzso zzso with both insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso were elevated zzso in obese compared to lean zzso zzso zzso with zzso was reduced zzso in the obese zzso 

Increased zzso and zzso zzso zzso may contribute to increasing zzso zzso zzso while concurrent zzso of zzso with both zzso and zzso may prevent zzso from interacting with zzso These two mechanisms zzso may independently contribute to zzso zzso zzso zzso in the skeletal muscle of the obese zzso zzso
