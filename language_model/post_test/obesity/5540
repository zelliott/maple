This study investigates the effects of zzso an zzso II type 1 zzso zzso on carotid zzso zzso zzso and zzso tolerance in zzso male zzso fatty rats and their zzso zzso lean zzso zzso was orally administered to zzso rats for 21 days, and zzso rats without the agent were used as the respective zzso zzso zzso in the left common carotid artery was performed on day 7, and the artery was removed on day 14 for zzso zzso Compared with the area ratios of the zzso in fatty rats without treatment, the ratios in fatty rats treated with zzso at 1 zzso zzso zzso and lean rats without treatment were significantly decreased to zzso on the other hand, the ratios of fatty rats treated with zzso at 10 zzso zzso zzso and lean rats treated with 1 zzso zzso zzso were reduced to zzso and those of lean rats treated with 10 zzso zzso zzso were reduced to zzso The administration of zzso also decreased the level of plasma zzso zzso and zzso in fatty zzso In an zzso zzso load, the levels of both zzso and insulin at 30 and 60 minutes were significantly decreased when fatty rats were treated with zzso at 10 zzso zzso zzso In cultured vascular smooth muscle cells from fatty rats, zzso zzso (New England zzso zzso and zzso zzso were inhibited to 59% and zzso respectively, by zzso II, but the effects were ameliorated by the addition of zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso could be effective for the suppression of vascular smooth muscle cell growth zzso in zzso fatty and lean zzso Furthermore, the agent could improve insulin resistance in zzso fatty zzso
