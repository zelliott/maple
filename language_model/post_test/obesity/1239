To examine how the relationship between parity increase and weight gain is modified by zzso and behavioral zzso 

Prospective zzso data from the first National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso zzso I, zzso and its follow-up of those aged 25 y and older, the zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso sample was nationally representative of the United States and included zzso white or African-American zzso women aged zzso y at zzso who were zzso approximately 10 y zzso 

zzso interactions in multiple linear and zzso zzso models were examined to identify how eight zzso and three behavioral factors modified the effect of parity increase on body weight change and risk of substantial weight zzso 

zzso that increased zzso weight gain included being African-American, living in a rural area, not working outside the home, having fewer children, lower income and lower education, and being zzso Among white women, being younger and having higher body weight at baseline increased zzso weight gain, while among African-American women, being older and having lower body weight increased zzso weight zzso African-American smokers gained less weight with an increase in parity, while the interactions between smoking and physical activity with zzso weight gain in whites were zzso 

The effects of zzso and behavioral factors on zzso weight gain varied by race and parity change, with the most consistent findings being that unmarried and unemployed white women had greater zzso weight gain, while both white and African-American women who smoked, had higher education, or higher parity had lower zzso weight zzso This information may contribute to better targeting and more effective interventions to prevent zzso weight zzso
