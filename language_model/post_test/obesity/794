The zzso equations of zzso and zzso which are based on mixed ethnic samples, are currently recommended for predicting body fat from zzso measures in prepubescent children of African zzso These equations contain zzso problems that could make them inappropriate for African zzso 

The objective was to apply the zzso and zzso equations to predict body fat in African zzso children and to compare the results with body fat measured by zzso X-ray zzso zzso If significantly different outcomes were observed, then the objective was to develop new prediction equations and validate them on African zzso 

The zzso and zzso equations were applied to a zzso sample of 214 prepubescent zzso stage 1) African children zzso zzso Body fat was determined by zzso and subcutaneous fat at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and calf sites was measured with use of zzso zzso A randomly selected sample of zzso participants (78 zzso was used to generate new prediction equations that were validated on the remaining 80 participants (40 zzso 

The zzso and zzso equations significantly underestimated zzso zzso body fat compared with zzso in both boys and zzso The best combination of zzso thicknesses to predict body fat in African zzso boys, controlling for zzso age, was zzso zzso zzso zzso and thigh zzso zzso zzso and for girls it was zzso zzso zzso zzso and calf zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso equations are zzso for predicting body fat in zzso African zzso zzso New equations that are based on zzso combinations from African children provide more accurate zzso
