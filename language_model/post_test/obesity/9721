Starting from a model of impaired response zzso and zzso attribution for addictive zzso we investigated whether obese participants show a greater impairment of zzso control in response to zzso cues compared with neutral stimuli and whether this is seen in zzso control zzso In addition, we questioned whether an zzso bias towards zzso cues can be observed in an early stage of information zzso 

zzso study including the administration of zzso tasks zzso is, zzso task with zzso and neutral words, visual dot probe task with zzso and neutral zzso and zzso measures of eating zzso and zzso 

Although zzso measures indicated zzso of eating zzso of obese patients, we found that zzso stimuli induced an impairment of zzso control in both obese participants as well as zzso zzso zzso from the visual zzso task indicated that zzso cues did not zzso attention allocation in a very early stage of information processing, which suggests that the incentive zzso of zzso stimuli might be lower than that of zzso zzso 

These findings are not in line with hypotheses derived from models of addictive zzso and call into question that an impairment of zzso control in response to zzso cues and zzso attribution might be at the core of zzso Future studies using larger sample sizes and refined experimental procedures are warranted to further investigate mechanisms controlling food intake in zzso
