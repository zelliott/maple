The function of zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein muscle excess 3 zzso was unknown until our recent report that zzso is necessary for normal zzso growth and enhances the expression of local bone zzso zzso Here we report the pivotal role of zzso in energy balance zzso zzso zzso caused zzso in both zzso and zzso transgenic mice, as well as a more beneficial blood zzso and zzso profile in zzso transgenic mice, in both zzso Although transgenic mice showed normal food intake and zzso zzso zzso they had increased energy expenditure independent of physical zzso zzso mice had normal body temperature, zzso expression in brown zzso zzso and muscle and liver fatty acid zzso zzso is expressed in zzso and is zzso in the zzso nucleus, the zzso nucleus, and the zzso nucleus of the zzso zzso was not detected in zzso or zzso zzso but was detected in zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso double zzso mice were growth retarded and obese and had blood profiles similar to those of zzso mice but showed none of the zzso observed in zzso zzso Our data show that zzso is involved in energy balance zzso
