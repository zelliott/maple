zzso zzso zzso and zzso may be influenced by diabetes, but their associations remain zzso We hypothesized that serum zzso might be parallel to zzso 

We measured serum zzso in zzso obese zzso zzso women and 61 zzso and 65 obese diabetic zzso women and 32 zzso humans, and examined their relationships with zzso The presence of diabetes was the only zzso factor between the zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso median and zzso range, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso To investigate the influence of zzso on zzso both groups were divided into zzso based on zzso In zzso zzso was similar in high, zzso and low zzso subgroups, zzso and zzso was not influenced by zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso differed between zzso zzso zzso and was influenced by zzso r zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso are similar in diabetic and zzso humans with the same range of zzso However, zzso is associated with zzso only in zzso obese individuals which may point to the fact that zzso is a marker of zzso balance in obesity but not in zzso
