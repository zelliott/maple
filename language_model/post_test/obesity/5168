The age-related development of the capacity of the cardiac zzso zzso system to be zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was compared in obese zzso zzso rats and their lean zzso zzso The obese zzso zzso rats tested developed zzso obesity associated with marked zzso mild zzso and zzso At 4 weeks, there was already a 57% reduction in zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso At 12 weeks, the zzso was reduced by zzso and zzso and zzso by zzso At 45 weeks, zzso was reduced by zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso and zzso and zzso by zzso The reductions of zzso zzso and zzso were totally or partially reversed in zzso old zzso animals submitted for 5 weeks to severe food restriction that almost zzso the altered blood zzso In sharp contrast, food restriction imposed a further decrease in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This pattern of impaired zzso zzso zzso activity appeared limited to cardiac zzso in obese animals as the responses of liver, brain and anterior zzso zzso zzso activities to zzso and/or zzso were zzso These results suggest that zzso receptors coupled to zzso zzso were rapidly and specifically altered in the heart of zzso zzso zzso
