To examine the relationship between zzso zzso of obesity and zzso knee zzso zzso 

We included zzso Caucasian men and 275 Caucasian women aged 40 years and above who were participants in the Baltimore zzso Study of zzso zzso had bilateral zzso standing knee zzso read for features of zzso using zzso zzso zzso blood pressure, zzso zzso 2 h oral zzso tolerance test, and zzso zzso were obtained at the same visit as the knee zzso zzso zzso of obesity were compared between subjects with zzso zzso or zzso 2 zzso knee zzso and grade 0 zzso zzso by zzso 

Both men and women with knee zzso had higher zzso zzso blood pressure than those with normal knee zzso zzso measures of zzso metabolism and lipids did not vary by presence of knee zzso in men or zzso After adjustment for age and zzso zzso blood pressure did not vary by presence of knee zzso in zzso While women with knee zzso did have higher adjusted mean zzso blood pressure than women with normal zzso zzso zzso zzso vs 120 zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso both values were within normal zzso zzso men with knee zzso had lower adjusted mean 2 h zzso levels compared to men without zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Other adjusted variables did not differ by presence of knee zzso 

These data do not support the hypothesis that zzso zzso of obesity are independently associated with zzso knee zzso after adjustment for age and zzso
