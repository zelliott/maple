zzso is an increasing problem in zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso is present in increased serum zzso in an obese zzso Our group has previously highlighted that the zzso zzso and zzso have a potential role in zzso zzso of zzso zzso in obese zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of zzso on human zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso of human zzso were obtained at zzso zzso zzso zzso strips suspended under zzso conditions, undergoing spontaneous and zzso zzso were exposed to cumulative additions of zzso in the concentration range of 1 zzso to 1 zzso Control experiments were performed zzso 

zzso exerted an zzso effect on spontaneous and zzso induced zzso in human zzso The mean zzso zzso values were zzso zzso zzso for spontaneous zzso zzso 6; P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso 6; P zzso 

zzso zzso human zzso zzso in zzso raising the possibility that such zzso zzso may play a zzso role in obese zzso
