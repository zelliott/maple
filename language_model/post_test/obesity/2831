The possibility of a relationship between the zzso hormone level and the peripheral action of catecholamines was examined in 4 zzso and 19 obese zzso subjects as well as in 27 zzso subjects by comparing the serum zzso hormone level and the in zzso effect of catecholamines on zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso tissue incubated with and without zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso rates of zzso and zzso zzso production were significantly correlated with free zzso index zzso zzso zzso and with the serum zzso level zzso zzso zzso The zzso hormone level was neither correlated with zzso rate of zzso nor with zzso zzso zzso production zzso zzso These results suggest that the magnitude of zzso zzso zzso production by peripheral cells may be regulated by the level of circulating zzso zzso The effect of zzso hormones on zzso appears to be specifically linked to the action of zzso
