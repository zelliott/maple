Physical conditioning using weighted ankle zzso was evaluated in eight men in the age range 33 to 45 years zzso zzso zzso consisted of zzso and zzso heart rate zzso and oxygen zzso zzso responses to five zzso work zzso cycling six minutes at 600 zzso meter per minute zzso level walking for ten minutes at both zzso and zzso zzso with and without a zzso weight spat added to each zzso After the initial baseline zzso subjects wore zzso weight zzso on both zzso for three weeks and were zzso during the next three-week period weight was increased to zzso zzso per zzso Following the zzso evaluation period, subjects did not wear ankle zzso and zzso was evaluated after three zzso A control group of four subjects was evaluated at these same zzso work loads on three different occasions with three-week periods between zzso The experimental group wore the zzso about zzso hours per day and averaged zzso zzso zzso miles per day) during zzso After six weeks of training, zzso zzso decreased 6 to 9 beats per minute zzso smaller than zzso from zzso values for all five zzso work zzso predicted zzso max and predicted work capacity to achieve a zzso of 170 beats per minute increased by approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso responses increased slightly, but not significantly, from post zzso training zzso Control group zzso responses were unchanged between zzso It was concluded that individuals who initially possess a low level of zzso fitness may have a low threshold for zzso Thus, leg weight conditioning may be extremely useful for rehabilitation of patients and for sedentary middle-aged men as special adaptation zzso to more high intensity zzso
