To explain why subjects vary in body fat content despite similar zzso intake and physical activity, a hypothesis is proposed zzso individual zzso in the potentially vast quantities of energy zzso for such zzso functions as cellular zzso zzso and for protein zzso The collective term zzso activity is zzso The hypothesis explains variation without differences in external energy zzso After zzso for indispensable zzso needs and the variable zzso activity, excess energy is mainly zzso to anabolic zzso and eventually stored as chemical energy, mostly as zzso zzso At one extreme, are subjects with the least degrees of zzso activity, the consequently largest zzso of energy for chemical storage, and thus the greatest zzso to massive zzso The converse applies to inordinate zzso Between the extremes, the almost infinite individual zzso is due to a zzso distribution of zzso activity zzso related to the quantity remaining for chemical zzso While the extremes may result from zzso the intervening zzso is ascribed to genetic zzso and to novel zzso zzso In addition, such environmental influences as diet and drugs might zzso zzso zzso This hypothesis is zzso to all living zzso
