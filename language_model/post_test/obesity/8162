To explore zzso hormones following stress in overweight individuals, and their relationship with night eating zzso zzso 

We measured plasma cortisol and zzso zzso and recorded ratings of stress and hunger in response to a zzso laboratory zzso zzso zzso test, zzso in overweight women with zzso zzso and without zzso zzso zzso 

Following the zzso cortisol zzso and zzso zzso levels increased, as did stress and hunger ratings (all zzso across all subjects zzso and zzso zzso exhibited higher baseline cortisol zzso levels than zzso zzso also had greater cortisol area under the curve zzso than zzso zzso but not when controlling for baseline cortisol zzso zzso baseline and zzso did not differ between zzso zzso showed higher zzso stress zzso even when controlling for baseline zzso 

zzso individuals showed increased zzso zzso stress and hunger following a laboratory zzso and there was some evidence for greater increases in cortisol and zzso stress among zzso The greater zzso cortisol level in zzso was due to higher baseline levels, but the group difference in stress was in direct response to the zzso Our results support a role for cortisol and stress in zzso
