zzso in zzso tissue has been zzso as a possible contributor to zzso chronic zzso insulin resistance, and zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso a master signal zzso of zzso response, is elevated in obese zzso zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso zzso remains to be zzso Here we show that transgenic mice with zzso zzso expression of a dominant negative version of zzso developed more severe obesity and were more susceptible to high fat zzso zzso intolerance and insulin resistance compared with their wild type zzso zzso in the transgenic mice was attributed to impaired energy expenditure and reduced zzso zzso examination of zzso brown zzso tissue zzso in the transgenic mice demonstrated a markedly increased size of zzso droplets and decreased zzso density in zzso a zzso similar to that in white zzso zzso These changes in BAT of the transgenic mice were accompanied by decreased zzso zzso and reduced expression of key zzso zzso In the transgenic mice, zzso in BAT was decreased but was little affected in white zzso zzso These findings support an indispensable role of zzso in maintaining the zzso functions of zzso possibly through promoting zzso and zzso zzso in this zzso
