The objectives of the present study was to compare the zzso explosive muscle power developed by the lower limbs in obese and non-obese zzso zzso 

Twenty-five obese zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso and 30 non-obese zzso zzso zzso zzso children aged 8-12 years, participated in this zzso Body composition was measured by zzso zzso analysis and the zzso explosive power of the lower limbs was assessed by the zzso (a zzso zzso 

Absolute peak force zzso was higher in obese than in non-obese children by zzso zzso Peak speed zzso was not significantly different between groups zzso zzso zzso zzso absolute peak power zzso was higher in obese than in non-obese children zzso P zzso zzso Considering gender differences, absolute zzso and zzso were higher in boys than in girls by zzso and zzso zzso respectively, thus yielding higher absolute zzso values in boys as compared to girls zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso for zzso mass zzso was not different between obese and non-obese children but higher in boys than in girls zzso zzso 

Power generation capability per unit of zzso was similar between obese and non-obese children but was significantly higher in boys than zzso On the clinical practice it seems important to devote supplementary care to sustain and improve the motor function of obese and non-obese zzso
