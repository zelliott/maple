zzso association studies zzso of body mass index zzso using large samples have yielded approximately a dozen robustly associated zzso and implicated additional zzso zzso these zzso have small effects and in zzso explain a small proportion of the zzso As a result, replication attempts have limited power to achieve zzso significance, even with several thousand zzso Since there is strong prior evidence for genetic influence on zzso for specific zzso alternative approaches to replication can be zzso Instead of testing individual zzso zzso a genetic risk sum score zzso zzso the total number of risk zzso can be zzso In the current study, zzso zzso 56 top zzso zzso from two large zzso was tested for association with zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso controls zzso zzso zzso zzso After accounting for zzso known to influence zzso zzso sex, age), zzso was highly associated with zzso zzso value zzso zzso zzso although explained a limited amount of the zzso zzso However, area under receiver operator criteria curve zzso estimates indicated that the zzso and zzso significantly predicted overweight and obesity zzso with maximum zzso ability for predicting class III obesity zzso zzso zzso The relative contributions of the individual zzso to zzso were examined post hoc and the results were not due to a few highly significant zzso but rather the result of numerous zzso of small zzso This study provides evidence of the utility of a zzso as an alternative approach to replication of common zzso variation in complex zzso
