Excess zzso zzso resulting from an elevated supply of plasma fatty acids is linked to the zzso of the zzso syndrome and heart zzso The term zzso was coined to describe how zzso zzso leads to cellular dysfunction and death in zzso zzso including the heart, zzso and zzso While zzso has been shown in cultured skeletal muscle cells, the degree of zzso in zzso and the functional consequences are zzso We studied three models of fatty acid overload in male zzso 5 h zzso and zzso infusion, prolonged high fat feeding zzso and genetic obesity induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were assessed as zzso of zzso The zzso infusion increased zzso 3 activity in skeletal muscle, demonstrating that enhancing fatty acid flux activates zzso zzso zzso and genetic obesity increased tissue zzso content but did not influence zzso Gene array analysis revealed that zzso reduced the expression of 31 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were unaffected by zzso and were associated with enhanced zzso protein zzso zzso activity was similarly unaffected by zzso or in zzso zzso Thus, contrary to our previous findings in muscle culture in zzso and in other zzso zzso in zzso zzso overload did not induce zzso zzso or zzso in skeletal zzso A broad zzso suppression of zzso proteins may explain this resistance to zzso cell death in skeletal zzso
