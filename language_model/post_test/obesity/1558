Most definitions of zzso fatty liver disease zzso allow some intake of alcohol but little attention has been paid to the possible contribution of zzso calories in the overall daily zzso The aim of the present study was to determine whether, in a group of 144 patients referred to liver zzso with zzso a more structured questioning of dietary habits and alcohol consumption would provide better information on zzso and zzso calorie intake and the relationship with the zzso 

Both food intake and calories resulting from alcohol zzso were frequently underestimated as was the percentage of patients who were drinking excessively zzso U a week), which was surprisingly high at zzso The substantial calorie intake resulting from alcohol consumption in this group was associated with a reduction in dietary calorie zzso so that the total daily calorie intake remained similar to those with zzso or no alcohol zzso The findings also showed that the zzso although still zzso was significantly reduced in those drinking heavily compared with low and zzso 

Patients with zzso can have substantially higher levels of alcohol consumption than usually zzso The additional calorie intake resulting from this is to some extent balanced by a reduction in dietary calorie intake with less zzso in zzso and a clear distinction from an zzso zzso may be zzso
