The zzso syndrome zzso is associated with central obesity and leads to increased morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular disease zzso Since obesity is associated with a zzso state, it has been speculated that zzso is linking zzso to zzso 

We zzso examined 81 overweight children and 32 zzso children aged zzso zzso We analyzed blood pressure, zzso zzso zzso insulin, zzso and zzso generating test determining time to peak zzso peak, time preceding the zzso burst zzso and zzso zzso potential zzso 

zzso children demonstrated significantly higher zzso levels zzso shorter zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and peak zzso were significantly higher in overweight than in zzso zzso zzso and all parameters of the zzso test correlated significantly zzso always zzso to body mass index zzso but not significantly to insulin resistance index zzso or occurrence of zzso in multiple linear backward zzso analyses adjusted for age and zzso 

The increased zzso levels and the changes in the zzso generation test points towards a zzso zzso in overweight zzso The parameters of the zzso test were related to the degree of overweight but not to insulin resistance or occurrence of zzso questioning a direct association between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso studies are needed to confirm these zzso
