zzso is likely to be involved in the zzso of body zzso zzso is suggested to regulate both short-term and long-term circulating zzso zzso The present study aims to assess the relation between insulin and zzso levels in obese zzso 

Some 53 obese subjects zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were prescribed a zzso diet and zzso to either a zzso or the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso for 2 zzso zzso zzso and insulin levels were determined repeatedly during these 2 years (5 times in the zzso condition and twice after an oral zzso zzso 

zzso zzso appeared to be regulated at a specific level for each individual throughout the weight-loss zzso The zzso explained zzso of the total zzso in zzso levels, the zzso distribution zzso individual characteristics zzso and the zzso serum insulin concentration zzso After a mean weight loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso insulin response to an oral zzso load was significantly lower but the zzso response remained zzso 

The zzso is the main zzso of the circulating zzso concentration in obese zzso Individual characteristics seem to determine the zzso level, given the zzso In a short-term zzso study in obese humans, changes of insulin levels do not appear to be correlated to changes in zzso zzso
