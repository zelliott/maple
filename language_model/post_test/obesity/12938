Both obesity and insulin resistance increase the risk of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases, but the mechanisms linking these abnormalities are zzso The current study was undertaken to examine the effects of zzso fat distribution, and insulin resistance on plasma levels of zzso and other adrenal steroids that might contribute to zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso zzso women and 27 zzso men with a wide range of body fat underwent zzso of visceral zzso tissue by CT zzso total fat mass by dual energy X-ray zzso blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, and plasma levels of three adrenal steroid zzso 

Plasma zzso in women correlated directly with visceral zzso tissue zzso zzso and zzso with insulin sensitivity zzso zzso and these associations were independent of plasma zzso zzso There were no corresponding correlations in zzso Plasma zzso was significantly correlated with plasma cortisol and zzso zzso in zzso zzso women and 15 men completed a zzso regimen, losing an average of zzso zzso After weight loss, plasma zzso was significantly lower and insulin sensitivity zzso however, the correlations of zzso with visceral zzso tissue and insulin sensitivity in women persisted zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although none of the women were zzso blood pressure correlated with plasma zzso both before and after weight zzso 

We conclude that visceral zzso and insulin resistance are associated with increased plasma zzso and other adrenal steroids that may contribute to cardiovascular diseases in obese zzso
