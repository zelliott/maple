zzso syndrome zzso is a leading genetic cause of zzso characterized by zzso zzso and zzso zzso It is suggested that the intense zzso could zzso in part, from impaired gut hormone zzso Previous studies produced conflicting results, being zzso by differences in body composition between zzso and control zzso 

zzso and zzso gut hormone responses were investigated in a zzso cohort study including 10 adult zzso 12 obese subjects matched for percentage body fat and central abdominal fat, and 10 healthy normal weight zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured by zzso or zzso Body composition was assessed by dual energy X-ray zzso Visual analog scales were used to assess hunger and zzso 

In contrast to lean subjects zzso zzso and obese subjects were similarly insulin resistant and had similar insulin zzso zzso levels were significantly higher in zzso compared to obese subjects before and during the meal zzso zzso meal responses were higher in zzso than in lean subjects zzso but not significantly different to obese zzso with an additional zzso trend in zzso zzso There were no significant differences in zzso zzso between groups, however zzso subjects reported more hunger throughout zzso and exhibited a markedly reduced zzso suppression of hunger zzso compared to lean or obese zzso 

Compared to zzso control subjects, zzso in zzso is not related to a lower zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso are consistent with increased hunger and are unrelated to insulin zzso
