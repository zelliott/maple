zzso zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso with zzso human serum zzso were studied by equilibrium dialysis in a 66 zzso sodium zzso zzso pH zzso 37 zzso Three hundred and zzso observed points for bound versus free zzso concentration were obtained and analyzed in terms of zzso zzso It was found that the best fit resulted from a model in which zzso of the zzso was capable of binding zzso whereas zzso did not zzso Thirty acceptable zzso of the curve fitting were generated in order to assess the variation of the binding zzso The binding zzso component combines with three molecules of zzso with high affinity and with at least seven additional molecules that are loosely zzso zzso of the protein cannot be zzso At very high zzso of free zzso (above 10 zzso irreversible changes in the zzso take place, resulting in poor zzso in the amount of bound zzso In the presence of zzso zzso 1, and zzso zzso of zzso binding of zzso is decreased by a competitive zzso It is hypothesized that zzso developing as a complication of zzso treatment of zzso results from increased availability of zzso fatty acids due to competitive zzso zzso
