The molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of selective zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and storage as well as zzso metabolism are currently largely unknown and were analyzed in female zzso zzso rats on a high-fat zzso zzso received zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso for 10 zzso In zzso zzso treatment with zzso Alpha, and zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso zzso In liver and skeletal muscle of zzso zzso zzso and zzso animals, zzso and zzso zzso were significantly zzso Increased zzso and muscular zzso gamma zzso expression was observed in zzso zzso and zzso animals, which zzso with increased zzso zzso zzso However, only zzso animals showed impaired insulin sensitivity compared to all other zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso in zzso animals suggests a zzso zzso probably due to increased zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso animals may benefit from the anabolic potency of zzso beta that ameliorates zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso of either zzso zzso reduces fat enrichment and improves insulin zzso Depending on the investigated zzso different molecular pathways seem to be zzso
