zzso fatty liver disease zzso is associated with zzso insulin resistance, and type 2 zzso The zzso that occurs as a consequence of insulin resistance is thought to be an important contributor to the development of fatty zzso We have shown that the zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso is a potent zzso of insulin signaling in zzso models for insulin resistance and type 2 zzso The present study was designed to assess the impact of zzso on insulin levels, liver zzso zzso and gene expression zzso Treatment of zzso mice with zzso restored insulin signaling in the liver, corrected blood zzso values to levels found in lean mice, and decreased insulin zzso The expression of zzso regulatory zzso protein zzso target genes involved in fatty acid synthesis zzso zzso treatment significantly reduced liver to body weight ratio and reversed zzso zzso zzso fat as well as inflammatory zzso In addition, zzso treatment corrected to a large extent the gene expression profile of zzso mice zzso toward the profile of lean zzso 

zzso lowering of zzso with the zzso zzso is a promising approach to restore insulin signaling and improve zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso
