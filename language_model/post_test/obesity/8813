zzso of zzso zzso 3 and 4 receptors zzso are known to take part in the complex control mechanism of energy zzso In this study, we compared the zzso response to an zzso zzso zzso and the zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso few zzso zzso between broiler and layer chicken zzso These zzso representing the two most prominent commercial strains of chickens grown for meat zzso and egg production zzso differ in their food zzso fat zzso and zzso performance and, therefore, form a good model of obese and lean zzso zzso A single zzso injection of the synthetic zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso body zzso into the wing vein of zzso birds led to zzso of food intake upon exposure to feeding ad zzso in both broiler and layer zzso A study of the zzso zzso zzso the two prominent natural zzso zzso zzso and zzso also revealed a general similarity between the zzso Under feeding conditions ad zzso zzso zzso levels were highly similar in zzso of both strains and this level was significantly reduced upon feed zzso However, zzso zzso zzso upon feed restriction was more pronounced in layers than in zzso These results zzso zzso a role for zzso zzso in the control of zzso zzso that the zzso differences between zzso and layers are not related to zzso of broiler chickens to the zzso signal of zzso zzso zzso these findings suggest that artificial zzso of this circuit in broiler zzso could help to accommodate with their agricultural shortcomings of zzso zzso and impaired zzso
