It has been suggested that inflammation is important in the zzso of hypertension and that this may be most relevant among obese zzso To study this, we examined the independent relationships between zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso and risk for hypertension in the Multi-Ethnic Study of zzso zzso zzso status, defined as a blood pressure zzso or a history of hypertension and use of blood pressure medications, was determined at baseline and two subsequent exams over 5 zzso Among zzso zzso at zzso zzso individuals developed incident hypertension by zzso zzso Cox zzso hazard models were used to determine the relationship between baseline levels of zzso zzso and zzso and future risk of zzso One zzso difference in baseline concentration of zzso zzso or zzso was associated with zzso greater risk of incident zzso This risk was attenuated after accounting for other hypertension risk factors zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso obesity was an independent risk factor for hypertension risk, minimally impacted by other zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not modify the relationship between obesity and hypertension, though an adjusted twofold greater risk was observed for obese individuals with a zzso compared with zzso zzso The relationship between zzso proteins and hypertension risk was predominantly explained by other hypertension risk zzso zzso independent of zzso remained a potent risk factor for future zzso
