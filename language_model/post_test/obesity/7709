The zzso zzso zzso level has been associated with essential zzso zzso analysis has found a relationship between the zzso gene locus and hypertension in the Mexican-American population, but studies have failed to identify genetic zzso associated with hypertension or plasma zzso zzso This study analyzes the relationship between zzso in the zzso gene and zzso zzso levels in Mexican zzso 

Nine zzso in zzso gene were zzso and plasma zzso level was determined by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso in zzso plasma levels were associated with 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso 2 was associated with low plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso and zzso 8 was associated with high plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso This association remained after adjustment for zzso A zzso zzso Test for zzso association adjusted for zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The total effect of the zzso on plasma zzso level zzso was zzso No association was identified between zzso and quantitative traits of blood zzso 

Two zzso zzso and zzso and 2 zzso zzso and zzso showed an association with plasma zzso levels in Mexican zzso
