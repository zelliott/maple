zzso is a major risk factor for a myriad of disorders such as insulin resistance and zzso The mechanisms underlying these chronic conditions are complex but low grade inflammation and zzso of the zzso stress defense system are well zzso Previous studies indicated that impairment of zzso and zzso was linked to zzso insulin resistance and diabetes in humans and animals while their induction was associated with improved clinical zzso In an attempt to identify additional components of the heat shock response that may be zzso by zzso we used the zzso zzso heat shock zzso zzso with zzso and validated by Western zzso and zzso Using zzso tissue zzso and zzso of zzso lean and obese subjects, we report the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and protein in obese that zzso correlated with percent body fat zzso zzso zzso and the inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso positively correlated with maximum oxygen consumption zzso Based on the beneficial effect of physical exercise, we investigated its possible impact on zzso expression and indeed, we found that exercise restored the expression of zzso in obese subjects with a zzso decrease of zzso zzso Using cell lines, zzso protein was reduced following treatment with zzso and zzso which is suggestive of the link between the expression of zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was also shown to zzso with zzso and zzso stress zzso along with zzso and thus, suggesting its potential role in modulating their zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso can potentially play a protective role against zzso
