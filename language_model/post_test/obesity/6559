zzso resistance is one of zzso factors for zzso diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso is a promising candidate to lower zzso by reducing insulin zzso The genetically zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to test the action of zzso because they develop severe insulin resistance in the peripheral zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso administered orally zzso zzso for 7 zzso dose zzso reduced zzso zzso and zzso in male fatty zzso zzso improved zzso tolerance and zzso the zzso response to zzso insulin and clearance of plasma zzso These effects on zzso and zzso metabolism seem to be due to increased insulin sensitivity and responsiveness in the peripheral zzso because zzso increased zzso zzso synthesis and zzso in the isolated zzso muscles, and zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso The latter effects were not accompanied by any changes in insulin zzso The actions of insulin zzso zzso and vitamin zzso which act on the zzso binding sites, on these zzso events were also zzso by zzso These findings suggest that zzso can improve zzso and zzso metabolism by reducing insulin resistance on the zzso zzso zzso zzso may be zzso for treating human zzso
