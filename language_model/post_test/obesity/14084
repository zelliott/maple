zzso is a negative zzso factor in patients with critical illnesses such as acute zzso zzso The outcome of zzso is determined by the severity of systemic inflammation and organ zzso In a previous study, we found that zzso caused more deaths in obese rats than in lean zzso In the present study, we examined whether the effect of obesity on rats with zzso is associated with distinct zzso in inflammatory zzso expression in zzso involved in zzso 

zzso was induced in lean and obese zzso rats by pancreatic infusion of zzso zzso All survivors were killed 8 h zzso Gene transcripts for two zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso were determined in the zzso liver, and lungs by quantitative real-time zzso chain zzso The severity of zzso was assessed by means of zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso rats had higher zzso zzso in all zzso zzso lower zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso and lower zzso zzso in the liver, compared to lean zzso zzso zzso and obese zzso rats had similar pancreatic zzso as assessed by zzso However, zzso and increased serum zzso zzso zzso levels, which are indications of zzso injury, were present in obese but not lean zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest that altered inflammatory zzso expression and increased vulnerability in the liver zzso the zzso influence of obesity on zzso
