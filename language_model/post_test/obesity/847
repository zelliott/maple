The zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by generating active zzso We have shown that zzso tissue zzso zzso levels were associated with zzso and zzso Here we conducted further expression and genetic association studies in zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso were measured in abdominal subcutaneous zzso zzso and skeletal muscle zzso zzso Single zzso zzso in the zzso gene were zzso in a larger group of zzso zzso zzso 

Two representative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were associated with Type 2 diabetes zzso zzso although neither zzso was associated with zzso Among subjects with normal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were associated with zzso zzso zzso rates zzso and zzso and zzso was further associated with zzso zzso and zzso plasma insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were correlated positively with zzso and zzso and were additionally zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso expression did not correlate with zzso of the zzso The muscle zzso zzso zzso did not correlate with any zzso or zzso zzso 

We confirmed that zzso zzso zzso zzso were associated with zzso and showed that genetic variations in the zzso gene were associated with Type 2 diabetes zzso plasma insulin zzso and insulin action, independent of zzso The variable zzso expression might not be a primary consequence of these zzso zzso zzso it is possible that the zzso gene is under zzso regulation, and has zzso zzso
