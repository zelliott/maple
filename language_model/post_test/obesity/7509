The impact of walking and bicycling on insulin resistance zzso in women with abdominal obesity is zzso 

zzso analysis of data from a zzso trial on physically active commuting zzso + walking vs walking only) in women with abdominal obesity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso waist circumference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and walking data were collected during 7 consecutive days by trip meters zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso 2, 4, and 6 zzso zzso to a skew distribution we analyzed bicycling as a zzso dummy variable with a 10 zzso zzso zzso serum insulin and zzso model assessment - insulin resistance zzso were assessed at baseline and 6 months, as were body mass index zzso zzso and dual zzso zzso zzso % zzso zzso 

Increased bicycling by 10 zzso was associated with reductions in zzso serum insulin at follow-up independent of age, treatment zzso baseline zzso zzso walking, and zzso % body fat zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Increased walking was not associated with zzso serum insulin zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso after adjustment for the same zzso and zzso zzso 

Increased bicycling but not walking was associated with reduced insulin levels at zzso zzso may be more effective than walking for reducing insulin levels in zzso obese zzso
