The zzso membrane zzso is the recommended site of access to the airway during zzso to provide emergency zzso Despite the apparent simplicity of the technique, this rescue maneuver frequently fails to achieve its goals and complications are zzso The reasons for this failure are zzso We sought to determine the ability of physicians to correctly identify the zzso in female zzso 

Using fluorescent zzso zzso the physician was asked to mark the zzso with the patient in the zzso neutral position and then with the head zzso The actual level was identified using ultrasound and the distance between the actual and estimated margin of the zzso was zzso A correct zzso was defined as a mark made between the upper and lower limits of the membrane and within 5 zzso of zzso Participants were also asked to assess the ease of zzso zzso using a zzso visual analog scoring zzso zzso 

zzso patients participated of whom 15 were zzso In the zzso neutral neck position, the zzso was identified in zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso versus obese, zzso Of the 46 incorrectly identified zzso in this position, 24 were above zzso 3 zzso and 22 below zzso 3 zzso the actual zzso Similar results were observed when the patients were placed with the neck in the extended zzso the zzso was identified correctly in zzso vs zzso zzso and obese patients, zzso The range of values was also zzso the zzso of the position of the membrane was as high as zzso zzso above and 4 zzso below the actual level, and up to zzso zzso zzso Participating doctors found zzso of the zzso zzso more difficult in the obese than zzso zzso zzso score for zzso difficulty was zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso respectively, P zzso zzso Using multiple linear regression, zzso scores for zzso correlated zzso with increased patient height zzso zzso and greater zzso distance zzso zzso zzso and correlated positively with increased zzso distance zzso zzso zzso and neck circumference zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso in female patients is common and its zzso is less precise in those who are zzso This has implications for the likely success of invasive airway access via the zzso
