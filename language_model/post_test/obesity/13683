The aim of this work was to determine the zzso differences in the expression of genes related to zzso metabolism and fuel zzso in response to a high-fat zzso diet in rats, and whether this is linked to the higher tendency of males to suffer from zzso zzso 

Male and female zzso rats were fed for 6 months on a zzso zzso or an zzso zzso Body weight, fat depot weight, zzso concentration in liver, blood zzso and the expression of genes involved in fuel metabolism and zzso in the liver, white zzso tissue zzso and skeletal muscle were zzso 

Female rats fed on an zzso diet gained more weight and had a greater increase in the zzso index than male rats, while the circulating insulin levels remained zzso these animals also showed an increased expression of genes related to the energy influx in zzso and with fat zzso in skeletal zzso Male but not female rats showed increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggesting enhanced zzso handling and zzso by this organ, and have a higher zzso content in zzso Male rats under the zzso diet also displayed higher blood insulin zzso 

These results show zzso differences in zzso handling and zzso between zzso in response to an zzso diet, with females showing a higher capacity for storing fat in zzso tissue and for zzso fatty acids in zzso These adaptations can help to explain the lower tendency of females to suffer from zzso disorders under the conditions of an zzso zzso
