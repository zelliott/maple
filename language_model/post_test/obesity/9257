More women than men pursue zzso surgery for treatment of zzso zzso zzso sleep zzso zzso in zzso patients increases zzso morbidity and zzso and, therefore, most zzso surgeons screen for zzso with zzso zzso We sought to develop a model for predicting zzso in women seeking zzso surgery in order to use this diagnostic resource most zzso 

We identified 296 women who had zzso in preparation for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses were used to assess the relationship between history and physical examination findings and zzso zzso After developing best statistical models, we constructed a summary index to identify patients exceeding clinical thresholds for mild zzso index zzso zzso 5) and moderate to severe disease zzso zzso zzso 

In our sample, most women zzso had zzso and more than half zzso had moderate to severe zzso Multiple zzso zzso showed that age, body mass index zzso neck zzso hypertension, witnessed zzso and zzso predicted zzso Diabetes zzso and daytime zzso measured with the zzso zzso zzso zzso were not significant zzso of zzso zzso models were statistically significant but had poor specificity for predicting zzso zzso 

zzso is highly prevalent in symptomatic and zzso women planning zzso surgery for zzso Best prediction models based on clinical characteristics did not predict disease severity under conditions superior to those in which they might be zzso In light of the zzso risks associated with zzso in zzso patients, all women considering zzso surgery for obesity should be evaluated for zzso with zzso
