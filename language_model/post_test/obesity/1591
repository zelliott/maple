The zzso syndrome and associated fatty liver disease are thought to contribute to poor outcomes in trauma zzso zzso obesity compromises liver blood zzso We sought to correlate the effect of zzso injury severity, and liver dysfunction with trauma zzso We hypothesized that zzso liver dysfunction could be zzso with the novel technique of zzso direct zzso resuscitation zzso 

This study has clinical and experimental zzso The clinical study was a zzso retrospective analysis of zzso trauma patients zzso zzso 72 obese, zzso zzso zzso zzso The experimental study was a zzso shock model in obese rats to assess the effect of zzso on liver blood flow, liver function, and inflammatory zzso 

In trauma patients, zzso and zzso analyses demonstrated increasing mortality zzso zzso septic complications zzso zzso liver dysfunction zzso zzso and zzso impairment zzso zzso with increasing body mass index and injury severity zzso zzso in rats zzso liver blood flow, liver function, zzso function, and inflammation zzso zzso zzso high mobility group protein zzso The addition of zzso to shock resuscitation restores liver blood flow, improves organ function, and reverses the systemic zzso zzso 

Our clinical review zzso that obesity worsens trauma outcomes regardless of injury zzso zzso liver and zzso dysfunction is aggravated by injury zzso In an obese rat model of zzso zzso zzso the addition of zzso abrogates zzso liver, zzso and inflammatory zzso We conclude that the addition of zzso to the clinical resuscitation regimen will benefit the obese trauma zzso
