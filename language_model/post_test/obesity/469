zzso protects against zzso joint damage in zzso arthritis zzso through poorly defined zzso zzso are produced in zzso tissue and zzso inflammatory responses and zzso joint damage in animal zzso The purpose of this study was to examine the hypothesis that zzso zzso inflammation and zzso joint damage in patients with zzso 

We compared serum zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in 167 zzso patients and 91 control zzso The independent association between zzso and body mass index zzso measures of inflammation zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso and zzso joint damage zzso zzso zzso zzso 93 zzso was examined in zzso patients by multivariable zzso analysis first controlling for age, race, and sex, and then for obesity zzso and inflammation zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso of all zzso were significantly higher in zzso patients than in zzso for zzso and zzso this association remained significant after adjusting for zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso were associated with higher zzso scores, and this association remained significant after adjustment for age, race, sex, disease zzso zzso and inflammation zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a positive association with the zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and showed a negative association with the zzso score after adjustment for inflammation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso but not after adjustment for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso are increased in patients with zzso and may zzso zzso joint zzso zzso is associated with increased, and zzso with reduced, levels of zzso joint zzso
