zzso zzso may cause zzso instability and is an initiating event in zzso cancer zzso zzso is associated with reduced zzso length in zzso and is a risk factor for zzso but the impact of obesity on zzso length in the zzso zzso is zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of weight loss, induced by zzso zzso on zzso length in the zzso zzso of obese zzso zzso zzso were collected by zzso at three time points (at weeks 0, 12, and zzso during a programmed weight loss zzso Weight was reduced by an average of zzso zzso across the zzso zzso zzso measured by quantitative real-time zzso zzso was zzso correlated with body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso at baseline zzso zzso zzso and increased at week 12 zzso zzso and week 52 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sites in DNA decreased at week 12 zzso zzso and week 52 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso p zzso zzso Furthermore, gain of zzso length appeared to be greater if more weight and body fat was lost zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and r zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that weight loss by zzso diets may contribute to the prevention of zzso zzso and DNA base damage, which are important initiating events in zzso
