To investigate the prevalence of obesity and the zzso characteristics among young male adults in the Taiwan zzso 

After cluster zzso a zzso survey with a total of zzso males zzso age 20, zzso were zzso 

The distribution of zzso and zzso variables and their correlations in young male adults were zzso The prevalence of obesity by different criterion and the zzso characteristics of obese and non-obese were analyzed zzso 

The prevalence of obesity was zzso by the criterion of body weight greater than zzso of ideal body weight, or zzso by the criterion of body mass index zzso greater than zzso The obese subjects had significantly higher serum total cholesterol zzso zzso zzso and zzso B zzso zzso and lower higher density zzso zzso levels than the zzso The zzso A1 levels were zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso in obese and non-obese respectively, the difference being not statistically zzso zzso correlation zzso of body weight, body zzso zzso waist zzso hip circumference and zzso ratio zzso to zzso variables showed that both zzso and zzso are positively correlated with zzso zzso and zzso B, but zzso correlated with zzso zzso the zzso variables were better correlated with zzso than zzso in lean subjects zzso zzso However, this phenomenon was quite different in obese zzso 25) subjects, where the zzso was more highly correlated with zzso variables than with zzso 

The prevalence of obesity is slightly higher than reported in previous studies in zzso The obese subjects had various abnormal zzso zzso zzso such as higher zzso zzso and zzso B and lower zzso levels than non-obese zzso The zzso was more highly correlated with zzso variables than was zzso in lean subjects, but the zzso was more highly correlated with zzso variables than was zzso in obese zzso
