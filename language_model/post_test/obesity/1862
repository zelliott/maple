This study was carried out to test the effectiveness of zzso a weight loss program designed specifically for urban African-American women, when administered in urban churches by trained lay zzso 

Thirty-nine obese women were recruited from three urban African-American zzso After zzso and the collection of baseline data on weight and lifestyle practices, subjects in the experimental group zzso zzso zzso were assigned to receive a zzso weight loss program zzso conducted by trained lay zzso control group subjects zzso zzso zzso were put on a waiting list to receive the program at the conclusion of the study zzso 

Of the 39 women zzso 15 experimental group subjects and 18 control group subjects were available for zzso data zzso After completing the program, zzso participants lost an average of zzso zzso and the control group subjects gained an average of zzso zzso zzso difference in weight loss between the groups was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso circumference among zzso participants decreased zzso inches, while waist circumference among control group subjects remained relatively the zzso This difference between the groups was statistically significant zzso zzso 

A weight loss program administered by trained lay volunteers was effective in producing significant and clinically meaningful weight loss among African-American women who often do not benefit from typical weight loss zzso zzso research is focusing on whether the weight loss can be maintained or enhanced through monthly reinforcement zzso
