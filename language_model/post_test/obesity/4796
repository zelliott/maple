The gene coding for the brain derived zzso factor zzso has emerged as an interesting candidate for multiple brain and brain zzso zzso The primary aim of the present investigation was to consider the relationship between the zzso zzso zzso and two zzso compulsive hoarding as a symptom dimension of obsessive-compulsive disorder zzso and body mass index zzso We examined the zzso gene in a large zzso clinical sample of zzso with zzso Participants were classified as hoarding or zzso using a zzso zzso grouping zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso was linked with hoarding zzso and more severe hoarding behaviors, as well as greater zzso zzso zzso status was also associated with greater zzso scores, with individuals in the hoarding group being far more likely to be classified as obese compared with the zzso zzso Our findings may provide a distinct avenue through which hoarding and zzso could be zzso These findings are suggestive of a complex zzso body weight, and zzso relationship wherein a zzso survival zzso zzso strategy may be zzso and represented in a zzso of humans zzso severe hoarding zzso
