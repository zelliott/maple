The concept of zzso displacement is based on the hypothesis that unrefined complex carbohydrates of low energy density will prolong eating time and induce zzso at a low energy zzso The present study compared the effects of diets low in energy density and high in energy density on zzso energy zzso and eating time among 20 obese and zzso zzso Each diet was served over a zzso period, and subjects were allowed to eat to zzso With equal acceptance ratings of the zzso zzso was reached on the diet low in energy density at a mean daily energy intake one-half that of the diet high in energy density zzso versus zzso zzso Eating time was significantly longer on the diet low in energy density by an average of zzso zzso and zzso subjects were comparable in their zzso ratings, energy consumption, eating time, and food zzso These data support the concept of zzso zzso which should therefore have zzso to the treatment and prevention of zzso
