zzso is associated with increased zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in several zzso zzso including zzso zzso liver, and skeletal zzso In this study, we aimed to define the role of zzso zzso in zzso tissue in the development of zzso insulin zzso 

zzso mice with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso under the zzso control of the zzso gene promoter were generated and subjected to zzso characterization together with the zzso zzso 

On a high-fat diet zzso the zzso mice displayed a marked suppression of both zzso and zzso zzso in their zzso zzso accompanied by a marked reduction in weight gain, fat mass, and size of the zzso The transgenic mice were resistant to the deleterious impact of an zzso on systemic insulin sensitivity, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was evident in in zzso and ex zzso studies and showed greater zzso zzso zzso in skeletal zzso These changes were accompanied by reduced zzso zzso in zzso zzso decreased production of zzso zzso and increased expression of zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the transgenic mice had significant increases in oxygen consumption and reductions in zzso exchange rates compared with their zzso zzso 

Selective suppression of zzso zzso in zzso tissue alone is sufficient to counteract zzso obesity and its associated zzso zzso in part through an increase in energy expenditure and a decrease in systemic zzso
