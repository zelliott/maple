To evaluate whether breast feeding is associated with prevalent overweight in zzso zzso 

zzso studies of 9 to zzso children attending fourth grade in zzso in zzso zzso and Munich zzso Germany, according to the International Study of zzso and zzso in Childhood zzso Phase II zzso A comprehensive questionnaire including detailed breast feeding history was filled out by the child's zzso Height and weight were measured in a random zzso of children undergoing zzso zzso was defined as body mass zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the German zzso 

While the prevalence of overweight differed substantially between zzso zzso zzso boys zzso and Munich zzso zzso we observed a markedly lower overweight prevalence among breast fed than zzso fed children in both zzso Controlling for age, sex and city, zzso children were substantially less likely to be overweight at zzso y zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were slightly attenuated after adjustment for zzso zzso status, number of siblings, parental smoking zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A longer overall duration and duration of exclusive breast feeding was associated significantly with decreasing prevalence of zzso 

The results highlight the importance and possible preventive potential of early nutrition in the development of overweight in zzso Both feeding behaviors acquired by the nursing infant and zzso effects may contribute to the observed inverse association of breast feeding and overweight in zzso
