The common single zzso zzso zzso zzso in the fat mass and zzso gene zzso is associated with zzso As genetic zzso associated with weight regulation might also be implicated in the zzso of eating disorders, we evaluated whether zzso zzso is associated with zzso zzso zzso and anorexia zzso zzso 

Association of zzso with zzso and AN was assessed in zzso patients with zzso 477 patients with zzso zzso healthy zzso controls, and zzso zzso controls zzso Based on the familial and zzso occurrence of obesity in patients with zzso we hypothesized an association of the obesity risk zzso with zzso 

In accordance with our hypothesis, we observed evidence for association of the zzso zzso with zzso when compared to the zzso controls zzso odds ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and a trend in the zzso controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Interestingly, compared to both control groups, we further detected a nominal association of the zzso zzso to AN zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso or OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

Our data suggest that the zzso zzso zzso might be relevant in both AN and zzso
