To determine zzso acid dosage requirements for individuals across a broad range of zzso values, using dose per zzso lean body weight zzso as a primary predictor of systemic zzso zzso folate zzso of zzso zzso zzso were assumed to be sufficient for reducing the risk for neural tube defects in the general zzso 

Data from a recent study of zzso zzso acid zzso among 12 obese and 12 non-obese women of zzso age were analyzed to determine expected zzso zzso The mean zzso acid dose per zzso zzso that achieved serum folate zzso of zzso zzso zzso was applied to a broad range of zzso values to evaluate daily dose zzso 

zzso differences in zzso acid requirements were noted for individuals among the zzso overweight, and obese zzso The current supplementation guidelines suggesting a daily dose of zzso zzso appear to satisfy the needs of women at even the upper extremes of zzso However, because even with appropriate folate supplementation obese women have an increased risk of neural tube zzso and they may benefit from higher intake and higher serum zzso of zzso zzso 

Current guidelines recommend an adequate zzso acid dose for obese women of zzso zzso Thus, it is unlikely that folate zzso is associated with the elevated risk for neural tube defects in this zzso
