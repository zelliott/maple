zzso use of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and transgenic zzso of zzso in mice suggest zzso of features of the zzso syndrome through enhanced fat zzso in skeletal zzso We zzso a similar mechanism operates in zzso 

The zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso (20 mug zzso zzso and zzso were given in a zzso randomized, zzso group, zzso study to six healthy moderately overweight subjects in each zzso zzso evaluation was made before and after treatment including liver fat zzso zzso blood samples, a zzso meal tolerance test with stable isotope fatty zzso skeletal muscle biopsy for gene zzso and urinary zzso for global zzso zzso 

Treatment with zzso showed statistically significant reductions in zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso B zzso LDL cholesterol zzso and insulin zzso whereas HDL cholesterol was zzso A zzso reduction in liver fat content zzso zzso and zzso reduction in urinary zzso zzso zzso zzso were also zzso Except for a lowering of zzso zzso P zzso none of these changes were observed in response to zzso The relative proportion of zzso zzso directly originating from the fat content of the meal was increased zzso zzso in response to zzso and skeletal muscle expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso was also significantly zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso reverses multiple abnormalities associated with the zzso syndrome without increasing zzso zzso The effect is probably caused by increased fat zzso in skeletal zzso
