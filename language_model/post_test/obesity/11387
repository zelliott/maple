The major psychoactive constituent of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso such as zzso signal through zzso zzso receptors zzso to regions of the brain associated with important neurological zzso zzso is mostly zzso and suggests a role for cannabinoids as therapeutic agents in zzso disease where zzso of neurotransmitter release would be zzso zzso evidence suggests that patients with disorders such as multiple sclerosis smoke zzso to relieve zzso zzso zzso can alleviate zzso and zzso in animal models of multiple zzso and clinical trials of the use of these compounds for these symptoms are in zzso The zzso zzso is currently licensed for use as an zzso agent in zzso zzso Evidence suggests that cannabinoids may prove useful in Parkinson's disease by zzso the zzso neurotransmitter zzso and zzso zzso damage to zzso zzso The zzso effect of cannabinoids on zzso oxygen species, zzso and zzso necrosis factor suggests that they may be potent zzso zzso zzso zzso a synthetic zzso is currently being assessed in clinical trials for traumatic brain injury and zzso Animal models of zzso zzso and noxious pain suggest that cannabinoids may be effective zzso Indeed, in clinical trials of zzso and cancer pain and pain associated with spinal zzso injury, cannabinoids have proven more effective than zzso but may be less effective than existing zzso zzso a commercially available form of zzso has been used successfully for increasing appetite in patients with zzso wasting disease, and zzso zzso zzso may reduce zzso Acute adverse effects following zzso usage include sedation and zzso These effects are usually transient and may be less severe than those that occur with existing therapeutic zzso The use of zzso cannabinoids such as zzso and zzso may allow the zzso of unwanted psychoactive effects from potential therapeutic zzso The existence of other zzso receptors may provide novel therapeutic targets that are independent of zzso receptors (at which most currently available cannabinoids zzso and the development of compounds that are not associated with zzso zzso adverse zzso Further understanding of the most appropriate route of delivery and the zzso of agents that act via the zzso system may also reduce adverse effects and increase the efficacy of zzso zzso This review highlights recent advances in understanding of the zzso system and indicates zzso disorders that may benefit from the therapeutic effects of zzso zzso Where zzso reference is made to ongoing clinical trials of cannabinoids to alleviate symptoms of these zzso
