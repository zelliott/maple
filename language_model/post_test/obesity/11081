zzso can affect disease progression and/or response to treatment in various zzso zzso conditions are prevalent in patients with pulmonary zzso hypertension zzso however, their effect on patient outcomes remains zzso 

We evaluated the effect on functional class zzso zzso walk test distance zzso and survival of the seven most common, zzso conditions at enrollment in patients with zzso from the zzso to Evaluate Early and zzso zzso Disease Management zzso zzso hypertension, clinical depression, type 2 diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso sleep zzso and zzso zzso 

Patients with COPD or diabetes had the shortest zzso at enrollment zzso and zzso zzso zzso vs other zzso zzso linear zzso for zzso at enrollment revealed significant reductions among patients who were zzso obese, zzso or had COPD zzso A larger proportion of patients who were obese or had COPD were zzso zzso vs zzso zzso at enrollment zzso There was a greater risk for death among patients with diabetes zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or COPD zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but there was a reduced risk for death in patients who were obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Compared with other analyzed zzso in patients with zzso hypertension, zzso diabetes, and COPD were associated with significantly worse zzso obesity and COPD were associated with worse zzso and diabetes and COPD were associated with increased risk for zzso Further investigation of the effects of treating these zzso in patients with zzso is zzso
