The effects of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso were investigated in zzso in isolated human fat cells of 11 obese zzso zzso release and zzso were determined simultaneously in the same test tube and related to zzso transport and specific insulin zzso zzso binding and sensitivity and the responsiveness zzso zzso of zzso zzso were enhanced by zzso The latter was strongly correlated with an enhancement in the zzso zzso The effects of zzso on zzso were not dependent on the zzso zzso unlike zzso zzso At 1 zzso of zzso where zzso transport is rate limiting, sensitivity and responsiveness of zzso zzso were inhibited by zzso Similar results were obtained with zzso zzso At zzso zzso of zzso where zzso metabolism is rate limiting, insulin zzso zzso before zzso but was totally ineffective after zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso multiple zzso in insulin action on zzso and zzso in zzso zzso is enhanced because of stimulation at the zzso and zzso levels, which may be associated with an enhanced rate of zzso zzso zzso the zzso effect of insulin due to zzso changes involving both transport and metabolism of zzso making zzso unresponsive to insulin at zzso zzso zzso
