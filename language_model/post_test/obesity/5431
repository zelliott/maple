zzso is a principal zzso factor in the development of zzso zzso Here we report that increased zzso stress in accumulated fat is an important zzso mechanism of zzso zzso zzso Fat zzso correlated with systemic zzso stress in humans and zzso zzso of zzso increased selectively in zzso tissue of obese mice, accompanied by zzso expression of zzso zzso and decreased expression of zzso zzso In cultured zzso elevated levels of fatty acids increased zzso stress via zzso zzso zzso and zzso stress caused zzso production of zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Finally, in obese mice, treatment with zzso zzso inhibitor reduced zzso production in zzso zzso attenuated the zzso of zzso and improved diabetes, zzso and zzso zzso zzso our results suggest that increased zzso stress in accumulated fat is an early zzso of zzso syndrome and that the zzso state in zzso tissue is a potentially useful therapeutic target for zzso zzso zzso
