The aim of this research was to investigate differential gene expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso in white zzso tissue zzso and liver from high-fat fed male zzso rats with or without vitamin C zzso supplementation zzso zzso of body zzso After 56 d of zzso animals fed on a cafeteria diet increased significantly body weights and total body zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso studies showed that cafeteria diet decreased zzso and zzso zzso expression in subcutaneous zzso and increased zzso zzso in zzso Overall, these data provide new information about the role of high fat intake on zzso levels of several zzso with implications in zzso cell metabolism and weight zzso Interestingly, VC supplementation partially prevented zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso in liver without any changes in the other zzso and genes zzso Thus, zzso zzso changes induced by zzso acid indicate a possible role of these genes in zzso zzso stress zzso
