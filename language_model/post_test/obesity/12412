Information is limited about the correlation between cardiovascular risk factors zzso and zzso nervous system zzso activity in zzso 

In all, 180 children aged 9 to 11 years were zzso Heart rate zzso obtained by 24-hour zzso recordings, was analyzed for zzso activity by measuring standard zzso of zzso zzso intervals zzso the standard zzso of the averaged zzso zzso zzso the root mean square of successive differences zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and ratio of zzso to zzso zzso were defined as hypertension, zzso zzso and elevated zzso blood zzso Children were subdivided into 4 zzso 0 (no zzso 1 (1 zzso 2 (2 zzso or 3 (3 or more zzso zzso zzso activity of each level was zzso The correlation between zzso and zzso activity was analyzed by zzso multiple zzso 

With an increasing number of zzso there was a progressive zzso in blood pressure, obesity zzso most blood zzso zzso and zzso blood zzso Moreover, increase in the number of zzso was associated with progressive reduction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso blood pressure zzso correlated zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso had a negative correlation with zzso and zzso As the number of zzso increases, so does the extent of abnormal zzso of zzso and changes in zzso zzso 

zzso and elevated zzso are associated with marked zzso in zzso activity, obesity with reduced zzso nerve activity, and elevated zzso with altered zzso and sympathetic nerve zzso
