Studies of the bacterial communities of the gut zzso have revealed a shift in the ratio of zzso and zzso in obese zzso zzso the variations of microbial communities in feces may be beneficial for the identification of specific profiles in patients with abnormal zzso The roles of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso species have not been described in these zzso 

We developed an efficient and robust real-time zzso tool that includes a zzso internal control and allows for zzso of the bacterial divisions zzso zzso and zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso We applied this technique to the feces of 20 obese subjects, 9 patients with anorexia zzso and 20 zzso healthy zzso Our results confirmed a reduction in the zzso community in obese patients zzso We found a significantly higher zzso species concentration in obese patients than in lean controls zzso or zzso patients zzso The zzso zzso concentration was much higher in zzso patients than in the lean population zzso 

zzso species are widely used as growth promoters in the farm industry and are now linked to obesity in zzso The study of the bacterial zzso in zzso patients revealed an increase in zzso zzso This increase might represent an zzso use of nutrients in this zzso
