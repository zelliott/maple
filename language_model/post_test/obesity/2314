The role of zzso tissue insulin resistance in the zzso of zzso fatty liver disease zzso remains zzso To evaluate this, we measured in zzso patients with zzso (age zzso 51 zzso 1, body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ) and 22 controls without zzso (no zzso zzso tissue insulin resistance by means of a validated index zzso zzso plasma free fatty acids zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso and as the suppression of plasma zzso during an oral zzso tolerance test and by a zzso insulin zzso We also explored the relationship between zzso tissue insulin resistance with zzso and zzso parameters by dividing them based on zzso of zzso tissue insulin resistance zzso zzso zzso zzso more zzso zzso zzso more insulin zzso zzso insulin resistance, measured as an index derived from zzso zzso production zzso zzso zzso and muscle insulin sensitivity, were assessed during a zzso insulin clamp with zzso zzso zzso Liver fat was measured by magnetic resonance imaging and zzso and a liver biopsy was performed to assess liver zzso Compared to patients without zzso patients with zzso were insulin resistant at the level of zzso zzso liver, and skeletal muscle and had higher plasma zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and lower zzso zzso cholesterol and zzso levels (all P zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin resistance, and liver zzso (but not zzso deteriorated as zzso of zzso tissue insulin resistance worsened (all P zzso 

zzso tissue insulin resistance plays a key role in the development of zzso and zzso abnormalities of obese patients with zzso Treatment strategies targeting zzso tissue insulin resistance zzso weight loss and zzso may be of value in this zzso
