It has been hypothesized that zzso peptides play a role in the development of zzso The zzso zzso zzso decreases zzso insulin release, while the sensitivity of diabetic rats to zzso zzso is zzso These findings suggest a possible interaction between zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the control of food zzso In three experiments the energy balance and zzso regulatory responses of zzso obese and lean rats to chronic administration of zzso an zzso zzso were zzso zzso when injected zzso or added to feed for 21 days, decreased food intake and weight gain of obese and lean zzso These responses were more pronounced during the first week of treatment and were greater in obese than lean zzso zzso increased zzso zzso during day 1 and weeks 1, 2 and 3 only when given zzso zzso given zzso attenuated zzso increases in insulin release only in obese zzso Thus, chronic zzso administration is not likely to be an effective treatment for obesity or zzso
