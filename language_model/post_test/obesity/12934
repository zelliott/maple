The objectives of the present investigation were to zzso 1) whether a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso obesity among Danish zzso and 2) whether the relation of a zzso zzso in zzso with zzso and long-term weight regulation differ between lean and obese subjects within the same zzso 

The zzso and zzso zzso were examined using zzso and zzso in a group of zzso subjects with a Body Mass Index zzso of zzso zzso or more and in zzso non-obese control zzso 

We did not find zzso in any of the zzso male subjects we zzso Among the males with zzso zzso the zzso frequency of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso among the non-obese control subjects zzso zzso of the zzso 12 zzso was not associated with differences in zzso or changes in body weight regulation during follow up in lean or obese zzso In the group of obese subjects, 21 zzso zzso carriers had, however, a higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and a higher weight gain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso Moreover, within the control group of zzso men the 14 zzso carriers of the zzso had a lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and a slower increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso 

The zzso 12 zzso of zzso is not zzso associated with juvenile zzso The zzso may in its zzso form zzso however, with various combinations of genetic and environmental factors in lean and obese subjects to cause divergent modulating effects on zzso and long-term body weight zzso
