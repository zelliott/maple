There is conflicting literature about zzso zzso points zzso that define the lower limit of zzso physical activity zzso among zzso The aim of the present study was to compare the diagnostic quality of zzso zzso relative to different body mass index zzso zzso systems of the weight status of zzso 

One hundred and thirteen children aged 8-11 years recruited from three randomly selected elementary schools wore the zzso model zzso zzso Manufacturing zzso for 3 zzso Five zzso expressed in counts per minute zzso zzso 1000 zzso 2000, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used to zzso their zzso The area under the receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso together with specific zzso allowed assessment of the performance of these zzso in reference to zzso status as defined using zzso criteria from the International zzso Task Force zzso French zzso zzso and World Health Organization zzso zzso 

zzso frequency ranged from zzso to zzso with no sex-related zzso All zzso zzso zzso were significantly higher than zzso except from those of zzso 1000 and 2000 using the zzso criteria zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso Furthermore, with the WHO standards, all the zzso provided zzso zzso zzso zzso According to the zzso and the zzso criteria, respectively, zzso zzso had the highest probability of correct decision zzso and zzso the lowest zzso errors zzso and zzso the highest zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the highest expected maximum utility zzso and zzso 

When children are classified using zzso criteria, the threshold of zzso zzso should be more appropriate in discriminating zzso from zzso
