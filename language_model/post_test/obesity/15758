We examined the preventive effect of zzso zzso zzso fruit zzso zzso on zzso and insulin resistance in zzso mice fed with a high-fat zzso zzso zzso mice were divided randomly into two groups: the control group was fed low-fat zzso diet, whereas the experimental group was fed with a zzso zzso diet last for 12 zzso After 8 week of zzso the zzso group was subdivided into six groups and was given orally with or without zzso zzso or zzso 4 weeks zzso We demonstrated that bitter melon was effective in zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreased the levels of blood zzso zzso zzso and free fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively), whereas increased the zzso zzso and liver zzso zzso zzso Additionally, bitter melon significantly decreased the weights of zzso white zzso tissue and visceral fat, and decreased the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso It is tempting to speculate that at least a portion of bitter melon effects is due to be through zzso zzso resulting in lowering zzso levels and improving insulin resistance, and partly be through zzso pathways to improve plasma zzso zzso This is the first report demonstrating that bitter melon, is a food factor, but not a medicine, itself could influence dual zzso expression and the zzso gene zzso is effective in zzso insulin resistance and visceral zzso
