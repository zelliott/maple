zzso and insulin resistance are modifiable risk factors for breast zzso zzso seems to be an important linkage of these zzso In this study, we investigated the relationship between zzso zzso zzso expression and insulin resistance as well as zzso zzso zzso expression in breast cancer zzso 

Breast cancer tissue and zzso serum were collected from 26 female zzso After zzso of frozen samples, zzso was isolated and expression of insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was measured on zzso level by means of real time zzso zzso insulin, zzso and zzso serum levels were zzso by zzso zzso resistance was calculated using the zzso zzso 

We were able to confirm zzso and zzso zzso respectively, in breast cancer zzso Actually, neither insulin serum level nor zzso insulin resistance showed any effect on zzso or zzso zzso expression in breast zzso A strong positive correlation between insulin as well as zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso expression could be zzso Interestingly, zzso expression significantly correlated with vascular and zzso invasion of breast zzso 

We propose a close relationship between the zzso insulin zzso system and zzso but not zzso zzso As zzso but not zzso expression seems to correlate with zzso we assume different functions of the two zzso receptors in breast zzso
