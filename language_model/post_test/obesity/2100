The zzso fatty rat is a model of obese zzso diabetes zzso zzso but not zzso develop zzso zzso and zzso within 8 weeks of zzso The regulation of gene expression by insulin has been shown to be zzso impaired in the liver of the fatty zzso The genes resistant to insulin include zzso gene and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso gene responds to insulin zzso raising the possibility that the signaling zzso from the insulin zzso to the zzso zzso but not to the zzso zzso is defective at a point beyond the zzso zzso in the fatty zzso On the other hand, female fatty rats develop zzso only when they are given zzso for several zzso This treatment causes a decrease in zzso while zzso involved in zzso are zzso zzso feeding of zzso also leads to zzso and visceral fat zzso which is more frequently associated with abnormalities in zzso and zzso zzso zzso is believed to be the responsible component of zzso for these zzso zzso effect of zzso is mainly due to an increase in zzso production of zzso Most zzso related to zzso in the liver are induced by dietary zzso even in zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of such zzso zzso element named zzso in the zzso region of this gene is shown to be responsive to dietary zzso as well as to dietary zzso Thus, identification and characterization of a protein bound to this element could help in the further understanding of the molecular mechanism of the zzso zzso
