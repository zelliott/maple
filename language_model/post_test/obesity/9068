We previously reported that zzso zzso gene zzso may be the zzso gene of a quantitative trait locus associated with cortisol levels, fat deposition, and muscle content in a pig zzso zzso analysis of parental animals allowed us to identify four zzso zzso Here we have examined if any of these single zzso acid zzso could be responsible for the difference in zzso binding and affinity for cortisol between the parental breeds, using in zzso zzso of zzso zzso after zzso of zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso coding region was analyzed in samples from a synthetic pig line to study association between zzso and zzso zzso properties, carcass zzso and meat zzso Both in zzso zzso zzso and the association studies suggest a role of the zzso zzso in increasing zzso capacity zzso and decreasing zzso affinity for cortisol (by zzso The zzso substitution may also have an effect on decreasing zzso affinity for cortisol by zzso The zzso zzso and zzso do not seem to have an effect on zzso zzso The zzso substitution was the only zzso associated with a zzso of meat quality and no zzso was linked to carcass zzso
