The aim of this study was to investigate zzso content and expression of genes involved in zzso zzso in lean and obese zzso rats and in obese rats undergoing food restriction and weight zzso 

We studied lean and genetically obese zzso rats zzso Another group of obese rats were food restricted to lose zzso of initial body zzso We measured expression of genes involved in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso content, cell zzso and tissue zzso were also zzso The hearts of obese rats have higher zzso content compared to lean controls despite an increased expression of genes involved in fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No differences were found in zzso and tissue zzso between the two zzso Weight loss resulted in a significant reduction in heart zzso content, while the expression of genes involved in fatty acid zzso remained zzso 

In contrast to data reported in diabetic rats, pathways of zzso zzso are increased rather than decreased in zzso obese zzso Food restriction reduced heart zzso content while zzso genes remained zzso probably as a consequence of zzso zzso coming from the zzso zzso
