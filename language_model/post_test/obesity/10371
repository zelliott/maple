To compare the accuracy of percentage body fat zzso estimates between zzso zzso analysis zzso and zzso in obese African-American zzso 

Fifty-five obese African-American women zzso age, 45 years; mean zzso 38; mean zzso zzso were zzso zzso was assessed by both zzso zzso Systems zzso zzso zzso Systems, Clinton Township, zzso and zzso zzso zzso Bone zzso zzso zzso Bedford, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso equations were used to calculate zzso from the zzso zzso analyses were used to compare the agreement between the zzso and the zzso with the zzso serving as the criterion zzso 

Two of the generalized equations provided consistent estimates across the weight range in comparison with the zzso estimates, whereas most of the other equations increasingly underestimated zzso as zzso zzso One of the generalized and one of the zzso equations had mean differences that were not significantly different from the zzso zzso 

The findings show that the zzso equation provided the most precise and accurate estimates of zzso in comparison with the zzso 2000 and provide preliminary support for the use of this equation for obese African-American zzso
