Weight bias has strong associations with zzso in overweight and obese zzso However, zzso zzso as zzso in the process model of zzso and implications for other zzso zzso remain to be zzso 

In a representative general population sample of N zzso zzso overweight and obese individuals, the impact of core zzso as a zzso between weight bias zzso and mental and global health outcomes as well as between weight bias zzso and health care zzso was examined using structural equation zzso 

In overweight and obese individuals, greater weight bias zzso predicted lower core zzso which in turn predicted greater depression and anxiety, lower global health, and greater health care zzso These zzso associations were largely stable in zzso analyses and after controlling for zzso zzso 

The results show that overweight and obese individuals with zzso weight bias are at risk for impaired health, especially if they experience low core zzso making them a group with which to target for interventions to reduce zzso Weight bias zzso did not represent a barrier to health care zzso but predicted greater health care zzso in association with greater health zzso
