Although weight loss improves risk factors for cardiovascular and zzso disease, it is unclear whether intentional weight loss reduces mortality zzso 

To examine the relationships among intention to lose weight, weight loss, and zzso zzso 

Prospective cohort study using a probability sample of the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso 

zzso overweight and obese persons zzso mass zzso or zzso 25 zzso who were at least 35 years of zzso 

zzso to lose weight and weight change during the past year were assessed by self-report in zzso Vital status was followed for 9 zzso zzso rate ratios zzso were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, education, smoking, health status, health care zzso and initial body mass zzso 

Compared with persons not trying to lose weight and reporting no weight change, those reporting intentional weight loss had a zzso lower mortality rate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and those with unintentional weight loss had a zzso higher mortality rate zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso However, mortality rates were lower in persons who reported trying to lose weight than those in not trying to lose weight, independent of actual weight zzso Compared with persons not trying to lose weight and reporting no weight change, persons trying to lose weight had the following zzso no weight change, zzso zzso zzso to zzso gained weight, zzso zzso zzso to zzso and lost weight, zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

zzso weight loss is associated with lower zzso zzso independent of weight zzso zzso intentional weight loss is associated with lower mortality rates, and weight loss is associated with higher mortality rates only if it is zzso
