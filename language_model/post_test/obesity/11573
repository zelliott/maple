To determine the effects on weight loss of feeding zzso diets in mildly restricted zzso zzso and severely restricted zzso zzso zzso we measured body zzso weight zzso deficit ratio, and nitrogen metabolism in 14 obese women housed in a zzso ward consuming zzso diets for 21 zzso zzso consumed either a zzso diet zzso g zzso 175 g zzso or a zzso diet zzso g zzso 75 g zzso Body composition and zzso zzso and turnover were determined before and after weight zzso Energy deficit was calculated from resting zzso zzso zzso fed the zzso diet showed a greater weight loss zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso SE, P less than zzso and fat loss zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso Weight zzso deficit ratio was the same with both zzso zzso balance and zzso zzso and turnover were similar in both zzso We conclude that with feeding of zzso zzso zzso severe restriction of energy content zzso zzso 75 g zzso will enhance weight and fat loss without increasing nitrogen loss compared with mild restriction of energy zzso zzso
