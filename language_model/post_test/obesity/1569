The effects of obesity on cardiac function during incremental exercise to peak oxygen consumption zzso have not been previously zzso The purpose of this study was to compare zzso and zzso cardiac function during exercise in zzso and obese zzso 

zzso zzso zzso 20; means zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso years; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and obese zzso zzso 15; means zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso years; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso participants were assessed for body zzso zzso and cardiac variables zzso zzso zzso at rest and at heart rates zzso of zzso zzso 150 and 170 beats zzso and zzso zzso during incremental cycling exercise to zzso zzso between groups were assessed with zzso zzso with repeated zzso zzso variables were statistically zzso for body surface area and resting zzso zzso and zzso oxygen difference zzso were statistically zzso for zzso mass and resting zzso 

zzso main effects for group indicated obese participants had higher cardiac output zzso index and stroke volume zzso index but lower ejection fraction zzso and zzso index during incremental exercise to exhaustion compared with their zzso peers, despite similar zzso and zzso zzso and absolute power zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest that although Q index and zzso index were higher in obese, young adults, zzso and zzso index were significantly lower when compared to zzso zzso zzso
