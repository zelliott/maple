zzso dysfunction zzso is common among men with an elevated body mass index zzso However, a high waist circumference zzso and low levels of physical activity may predict zzso independently of zzso 

We investigated the independent relationships between zzso zzso and physical activity with zzso 

zzso consisted of zzso adult men zzso or zzso 20 zzso with no history of prostate cancer from the zzso National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses were used to examine the relative odds of zzso association with categories of zzso zzso and physical zzso 

zzso thresholds were used to divide subjects into three zzso and zzso zzso Physical activity level was divided into active zzso or zzso zzso moderately active zzso zzso and inactive zzso zzso zzso A single survey question was used to assess the presence of zzso 

After control for potential zzso men with either a high zzso or an obese zzso had an approximately 50% higher odds of having zzso compared with men with a low zzso or a normal zzso zzso Further, moderately active or inactive men had an approximately zzso greater odds of zzso compared with active zzso When all three zzso zzso zzso and physical activity zzso were entered into the same zzso zzso model, both a high zzso and low physical activity level zzso active and zzso were independently associated with a greater odds of zzso whereas zzso level was zzso 

Maintaining a zzso level below 102 zzso and achieving the recommended amount of zzso physical activity zzso zzso zzso is associated with the maintenance of proper zzso function, regardless of zzso zzso These findings suggest that the clinical screening for zzso risk should include the assessment of zzso and physical activity level in addition to zzso
