The contribution of reduced energy expenditure to the development of obesity has been a point of zzso We measured 24-hour energy expenditure zzso for body zzso age, and zzso in a respiratory chamber, in 95 southwestern American zzso Energy expenditure correlated with the rate of change in body weight over a two-year follow-up period zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso The estimated risk of gaining more than zzso zzso in body weight was increased fourfold in persons with a low adjusted 24-hour energy expenditure zzso zzso per day below predicted zzso as compared with persons with a high 24-hour energy expenditure zzso zzso per day above predicted values; P less than zzso In another 126 subjects, the adjusted zzso rate at rest at the initial visit was also found to predict the gain in body weight over a four-year follow-up zzso When the 15 subjects who gained more than 10 zzso were compared with the remaining 111 subjects, the initial mean zzso zzso adjusted zzso rate at rest was lower in those who gained weight zzso zzso 103 zzso zzso zzso 109 zzso per day; P less than zzso and increased to zzso zzso zzso zzso per day zzso less than zzso after a mean weight gain of zzso zzso zzso zzso In a group of 94 siblings from 36 families, values for adjusted 24-hour energy expenditure zzso in families zzso correlation zzso zzso We conclude that a low rate of energy expenditure may contribute to the zzso of obesity in zzso
