Body mass index zzso and bone mineral density zzso are positively correlated in several studies, but few data relate bone density, zzso profile and zzso zzso 

To investigate these relationships in a large, zzso cohort of men and women (The zzso zzso zzso 

Men zzso zzso zzso and women zzso zzso zzso from zzso UK were zzso Information was available on demographic and lifestyle factors, zzso zzso body fat percentage, zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso bone mineral density zzso was recorded at the zzso spine and total zzso 

zzso at the zzso spine zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso females r zzso zzso p zzso zzso and total zzso region zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso females r zzso zzso p zzso zzso was related to serum zzso level, even after adjustment for zzso ratio, age, social class and lifestyle factors, but not if body fat percentage was zzso for zzso ratio in the zzso zzso zzso HDL cholesterol level was related to zzso spine zzso in women zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and total zzso zzso in both sexes zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso females r zzso zzso p zzso these relationships were also attenuated by adjustment for body fat percentage but not zzso zzso No relationships were seen between total or LDL cholesterol with zzso 

In this zzso relationships between zzso profile and zzso were robust to adjustment for one measure of central obesity zzso zzso but not total body zzso This broadly supports the idea that zzso may confound the relationship between lipids and bone zzso
