To investigate how weight loss zzso with changes in generic and zzso quality of life zzso 

Youth generic zzso and zzso instruments zzso from 133 youth age zzso were analyzed at the beginning and end of zzso immersion camp sessions known to produce weight zzso zzso samples zzso tests were used to test mean difference between baseline and final Body Mass Index zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso scores were transformed to values between 0 and 100, with higher values indicating better zzso Cohen's d effect sizes were calculated to assess magnitude of zzso zzso weight loss (as % of baseline zzso change in zzso zzso zzso zzso and change in % overweight zzso zzso for age and zzso zzso for age and zzso were zzso Multiple zzso were used to model final zzso scores in the zzso and zzso age groups as functions of each measure of weight change, sex, age, and baseline zzso zzso 

Youth experienced significant reductions in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the other measures of weight zzso zzso and zzso scores improved significantly zzso and effect sizes were zzso and zzso zzso 

Changes in generic and zzso quality of life scores are associated with weight zzso The zzso measure is slightly more sensitive to weight changes; however, when controlling for zzso the zzso remained significantly associated with weight loss, while the generic zzso measure did zzso
