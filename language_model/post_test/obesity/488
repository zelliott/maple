To evaluate the effects of a multidisciplinary obesity treatment zzso on zzso zzso composition and zzso bacteria in overweight and obese adolescents and their relationship to weight zzso 

zzso intervention study based on both a zzso diet zzso zzso and increased physical activity zzso zzso zzso body weight per week) for 10 zzso 

Thirty-nine overweight and obese adolescents zzso mean zzso range zzso age mean zzso range, zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and plasma zzso parameters were measured before and after the zzso zzso zzso was analyzed by fluorescent in zzso zzso zzso bacteria were detected using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proportions significantly correlated with weight and zzso zzso reductions in the whole adolescent zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso dropped significantly whereas those of the zzso group increased after the intervention in those adolescents who lost more than 4 zzso Total zzso energy was almost significantly reduced in the same group of adolescents but not in the group that lost less than zzso zzso zzso bacterial proportions also decreased significantly in participants who lost more than 6 zzso after the intervention, paralleled to reductions in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proportions also correlated with weight loss and zzso zzso reduction in participants whose weight loss exceeded 4 zzso 

zzso gut bacteria and an associated zzso response were related to body weight changes in adolescents under lifestyle zzso These results suggest interactions between diet, gut zzso and host metabolism and immunity in zzso
