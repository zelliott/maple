zzso and obese individuals have increased health zzso Clinical reminders positively affect health outcomes in diabetes and zzso but the effect of automated zzso on weight loss in obesity has not been zzso Our objective was to determine whether an automatic prompt for the zzso to recommend lifestyle changes to patients with a body mass index zzso zzso led to greater weight loss over a 3- to zzso zzso compared with the absence of a clinical zzso 

We conducted a retrospective analysis of electronic medical records of obese adult patients with a zzso zzso who were seen in 2009 and 2010, before and after zzso of an automated printed clinical zzso zzso We evaluated 1600 patients in each of the control and intervention zzso The primary outcome was the mean change in zzso between the control and intervention zzso Multiple linear zzso was used to assess the effect of the clinical reminder on the change in zzso while adjusting for baseline zzso and potential zzso zzso 

The reduction in zzso zzso zzso standard zzso in the group with the clinical reminder zzso zzso zzso zzso was not significantly greater than the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso A zzso model incorporating the clinical zzso age, baseline zzso obesity diagnosis, diabetes, and zzso found that baseline zzso zzso zzso obesity diagnosis zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso and zzso diagnosis zzso zzso zzso were significant zzso of weight loss, but the clinical reminder was not zzso zzso zzso There was a significant interaction between the clinical reminder and baseline zzso zzso zzso zzso as the prompt increased weight loss more in those with lower baseline zzso 

zzso clinical reminders alone do not improve weight loss in overweight and obese zzso zzso diagnoses of obesity or zzso were associated with weight loss, suggesting that formally noting these diagnoses contributes to successful weight zzso
