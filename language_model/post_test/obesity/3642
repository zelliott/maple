zzso fat zzso zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the zzso of coronary artery disease zzso The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between EAT and generalized zzso central or visceral zzso tissue zzso and the components of the zzso zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cholesterol zzso and zzso blood zzso zzso are linked to zzso A systematic review of the literature, following zzso guidelines, was conducted until May, zzso using the search strategy zzso OR zzso zzso OR zzso zzso OR zzso syndrome zzso AND zzso zzso zzso studies fulfilled the zzso There was a highly significant zzso correlation between EAT and body mass index zzso waist circumference zzso or zzso The correlation between EAT and zzso was significantly zzso greater than the correlation between EAT and zzso which in turn was significantly greater than the correlation between EAT and zzso Overall, EAT was zzso zzso zzso zzso in thickness in the zzso syndrome zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso in controls zzso EAT correlated significantly zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso but the strength of the association was less than one-half of the relationship of EAT to zzso of zzso The results of zzso analysis were less consistent but show a relationship between EAT and zzso syndrome independent of zzso In zzso the very strong correlation between EAT and zzso suggests a relationship between these two zzso tissue zzso zzso of EAT can be useful to indicate zzso Whereas EAT zzso significantly with each of the components of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso magnitude of the relationship is considerably and significantly less than the relationship of EAT to zzso These data show the strong relationship between EAT and zzso but especially with zzso and zzso They also demonstrate the smaller magnitude of the association of EAT with standard coronary risk factors, related to the zzso syndrome, and suggest that the unique features of this zzso tissue warrant detailed zzso
