Body composition changes during childhood and zzso It is markedly different in children with idiopathic zzso zzso This study was carried out to assess the nutritional status of patients with IS based on standard zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

59 patients with IS zzso zzso 14 zzso at a mean age of zzso zzso zzso years were qualified into the zzso zzso zzso were assessed zzso by measuring zzso angle and zzso zzso rotation zzso standing zzso zzso zzso weight, waist and hip zzso were measured and the body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso and zzso ratio zzso were calculated for each zzso A zzso zzso zzso was used to assess body composition in every zzso 

zzso of the children in the study had normal weight, while zzso of them were zzso and zzso overweight or zzso More patients in the juvenile IS group were zzso and fewer were overweight compared with the adolescent IS zzso zzso zzso nutritional status was found significantly more frequently in zzso Body composition correlated significantly with zzso curve severity in the study zzso Higher correlation zzso were seen in overweight and obese patients, but significance was reached only for predicted muscle zzso zzso correlated significantly with curve severity in the entire group, in zzso patients and in zzso zzso curve severity also correlated significantly with the degree, as measured by the zzso zzso of both overweight zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and obesity appear to have a similar prevalence in zzso adolescents and in the general pediatric zzso zzso zzso curve severity appears to be related to body composition zzso especially in overweight and obese zzso zzso zzso tissue distribution measured by zzso seems to be significantly related to the clinical grade of zzso zzso Further investigations concerning the nutritional status of children and adolescents with IS are zzso
