The aim is to study the relationship between insulin resistance and serum zzso and zzso in obese zzso 

A total 113 obese and 37 zzso children were enrolled and serum zzso and zzso were zzso 

Compared with controls, higher insulin resistance by zzso model zzso and lower whole body insulin resistance index zzso found in obese children (all P zzso The zzso levels in obese children and controls were zzso and zzso zzso with a significant difference zzso while the difference of zzso levels was not significant zzso zzso zzso zzso correlations between insulin resistance zzso and zzso development, zzso serum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, or zzso levels (all P zzso were zzso zzso multiple zzso analysis showed that zzso and zzso levels were independent zzso of zzso 

These results suggest that zzso may play a protective role in obese children through decreasing insulin zzso
