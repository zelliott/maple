The zzso hormone zzso growth factor 21 zzso is a zzso regulator of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates fatty acid metabolism through multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduces zzso and zzso intolerance in obese zzso We investigated mechanisms by which zzso controls zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso knockout zzso zzso mice and their zzso zzso zzso were divided into groups that were placed on a normal zzso diet, zzso for 24 hours, or zzso for 24 hours and then fed for 6 zzso Liver zzso were collected and analyzed by zzso examination, gene expression zzso and real-time zzso chain reaction zzso Human zzso cells were incubated with zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso consumption rate and zzso analyses were zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso mice using an zzso zzso Energy expenditure was assessed by indirect zzso 

zzso zzso induced zzso deposition in zzso of control mice, but severe zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Gene expression analysis showed that zzso zzso zzso in zzso of control mice but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and circulating levels of zzso in zzso zzso zzso mice were associated with reduced zzso expression of genes involved in fatty acid zzso and zzso and increased expression of genes that control zzso compared with zzso control zzso zzso or zzso each increased the zzso activity of the zzso promoter zzso and levels of zzso zzso zzso and protein in zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso mice developed zzso obesity with impaired zzso energy zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso mice increased the expression of genes that regulate fatty acid zzso decreased zzso zzso reduced zzso increased energy zzso and promoted zzso of white zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso prevents liver zzso caused by zzso This zzso zzso signaling appears to regulate expression of genes that control a brown zzso program in white zzso zzso energy zzso and zzso Strategies to activate zzso or zzso could be used to treat fatty liver disease and zzso
