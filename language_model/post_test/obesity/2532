To describe the natural history and risk of early chronic kidney disease zzso in zzso Australian zzso 

A prospective cohort of zzso zzso and zzso children enrolled from primary schools throughout New South Wales from February 2002 to June 2004 and followed for 4 zzso 

zzso zzso weight, blood pressure, zzso and zzso status at baseline and zzso and zzso zzso zzso risk factors: zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso children zzso zzso 51% zzso mean age, zzso years zzso zzso zzso were enrolled at zzso zzso children zzso were zzso at zzso zzso and zzso children zzso at zzso zzso zzso of baseline zzso risk factors was frequent zzso but most abnormalities were zzso Besides persistent obesity zzso persistence of zzso risk factors at final follow-up was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hypertension zzso and zzso hypertension zzso There was no difference in prevalence of persistent zzso risk factors between zzso and zzso zzso 

Over 4 years of zzso zzso Australian children had no increased risk for early evidence of zzso More than zzso of baseline risk factors were zzso and persistent risk factors were zzso Our findings suggest the increased risk for zzso kidney disease seen in zzso adults is not yet manifest in these zzso and may be potentially zzso
