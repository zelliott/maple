zzso is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular zzso Until recently, the importance of zzso de zzso zzso zzso in contributing to zzso was difficult to assess because of zzso zzso 

We evaluated the extent of the contribution by zzso to different conditions associated with zzso 

After 5 d of an zzso zzso zzso diet, zzso zzso was measured in zzso zzso 85 zzso lean zzso zzso 9) and obese zzso zzso 6) and zzso zzso 115 zzso obese zzso zzso 8) zzso zzso zzso was measured after a zzso zzso diet in zzso lean zzso zzso 5) and zzso obese zzso zzso 5) zzso Mass zzso distribution analysis was used to measure the fraction of newly zzso fatty acids in zzso 

With the zzso zzso diet, zzso obese subjects had a zzso higher fractional zzso zzso zzso zzso than did zzso lean zzso zzso zzso or obese zzso zzso zzso zzso With the zzso zzso diet, zzso lean and zzso obese subjects had similarly high fractional zzso (13 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with zzso consumption of the zzso zzso diet did not affect zzso zzso However, after the zzso zzso diet, zzso increased significantly and zzso was zzso higher than in zzso subjects consuming a high-fat zzso The increase in zzso after the zzso zzso diet was correlated with fractional zzso zzso zzso indicating that subjects with high zzso had the greatest increase in zzso 

These results support the concept that both zzso and a low-fat diet increase zzso and that zzso contributes to zzso
