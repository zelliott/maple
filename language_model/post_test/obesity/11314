As a typical zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to the structural zzso and regulates cellular behavior by modulating growth factor and zzso zzso zzso and diabetes are associated with marked zzso of zzso in zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso may play an important role in the zzso of zzso obesity and zzso zzso zzso we examined the effects of zzso gene disruption on weight gain, zzso and zzso tissue inflammation in mice receiving a high-fat diet zzso zzso fat, zzso zzso or a zzso low-fat diet zzso zzso fat, zzso zzso zzso mice had significantly higher zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso was predominantly localized in the zzso zzso zzso loss attenuated weight gain and fat zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Compared with corresponding zzso animals, zzso mice had decreased insulin levels but exhibited elevated free fatty acid and zzso levels, suggesting impaired fatty acid zzso zzso loss did not affect zzso size and had no effect on zzso vascular zzso However, zzso mice exhibited attenuated tumor necrosis zzso zzso expression and reduced zzso zzso suggesting a role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso enhanced proliferation of zzso zzso but did not zzso inflammatory zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso contributes to weight gain, zzso growth, and the zzso of zzso zzso The effects of zzso may involve stimulation of zzso zzso zzso of inflammatory zzso and facilitated fatty acid zzso by zzso
