zzso was identified as a result of screening in search of selective zzso for zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso We examined whether zzso functioned as a zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso and investigated zzso effects of zzso 

The effect of zzso as a zzso zzso was studied in a zzso reporter zzso and an zzso differentiation zzso Target zzso expression levels were determined by zzso DNA zzso zzso To examine the effects as a zzso zzso in zzso a competitive study between zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso was performed using zzso zzso The effects of zzso alone after administration to zzso mice were also zzso zzso antagonized zzso activity in a reporter zzso system, but not zzso 

zzso inhibited the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso but not zzso itself or zzso zzso (as zzso zzso and also suppressed zzso zzso in differentiated zzso vascular fraction cells zzso zzso antagonized zzso zzso action by zzso in zzso mice on high-fat diet, in terms of plasma zzso body weight gain and zzso brown zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso alone inhibited body weight gain and decreased plasma zzso level in zzso zzso 

zzso acted as a pure and potent zzso zzso in zzso Interestingly, zzso completely antagonized the effects of zzso zzso zzso in an obese diabetic zzso zzso may be a useful tool for the study of zzso in biological and zzso zzso
