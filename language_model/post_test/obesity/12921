The zzso response to provocative stimuli in obese is often as low as in zzso patients with severe zzso however, zzso levels are normal or slightly zzso In 53 patients with simple obesity (11 M and 42 zzso age: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we evaluated the zzso response to zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and total zzso zzso The mean zzso zzso peak after zzso was markedly lower zzso reduction, zzso in obese zzso zzso than in normal subjects zzso zzso zzso levels in obese patients zzso zzso were lower zzso reduction, zzso than in normal subjects zzso zzso Taking into account the 3rd zzso limit of normal response, the zzso response to zzso was reduced in zzso zzso of the obese patients, and zzso zzso of them had low zzso zzso Assuming the 1st zzso limit, it was reduced in zzso zzso obese subjects, and zzso zzso of them had low zzso zzso Considering zzso zzso as arbitrary zzso the zzso response was reduced in zzso zzso of the obese patients, and still one of them had low zzso zzso Our findings: a) confirm that the zzso capacity of zzso cells is often deeply impaired in zzso b) demonstrate that zzso zzso generally rules out severe impairment of zzso axis in obese patients with marked reduction of the zzso zzso c) indicate that the percentage of obese patients with zzso reduction of zzso zzso and zzso levels is not zzso Thus, zzso zzso should be routinely performed in obese zzso those presenting with low zzso levels should undergo further evaluation of their zzso function and zzso particularly in the presence of empty zzso
