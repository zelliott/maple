zzso is an oral inhibitor of zzso zzso an zzso mainly responsible for zzso zzso and one of the widely used drugs for the treatment of type 2 zzso However, effects of zzso on retinal injury in diabetes remain zzso We examined here whether oral administration of zzso inhibited gene expression of inflammatory and zzso parameters in zzso zzso zzso zzso rats zzso zzso an animal model of obese type 2 zzso 

zzso rats at 22 weeks of age were given vehicle or 3 zzso of zzso for another 10 zzso Gene expression was analyzed in quantitative real-time reverse zzso chain zzso 

zzso significantly inhibited the increase in body weight and decreased average zzso blood zzso in the zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso rats, gene expression levels of vascular zzso growth factor, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor were significantly increased in the zzso of zzso rats at 32 weeks of age, all of which were inhibited by treatment with zzso 

The present study demonstrated for the first time that zzso inhibited inflammatory and zzso reactions in the zzso of obese type 2 diabetic zzso zzso may play a protective role against diabetic zzso
