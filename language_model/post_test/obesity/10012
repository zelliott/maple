The zzso and zzso effects of a highly specific beta zzso zzso zzso zzso beta 1: beta zzso beta 3 zzso zzso were investigated in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Daily injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso to these rats (10 weeks old) for 14 weeks caused a significant reduction in body weight zzso zzso control, zzso associated with a marked decrease in fat pad weight zzso zzso zzso control, zzso zzso zzso zzso control, zzso without affecting food zzso The levels of zzso protein zzso and protein levels of zzso protein zzso as well as zzso zzso (a reliable index of zzso in brown zzso zzso were lower in the fatty than in the control zzso However, after zzso treatment, these parameters in brown zzso tissue increased significantly zzso to zzso in both zzso Furthermore, zzso protein was induced in white zzso tissue as well as in brown zzso zzso The fatty rats showed zzso and zzso during the zzso tolerance test, but zzso ameliorated these zzso These findings suggest that decreased zzso in brown zzso tissue may be one of the causes of obesity in the fatty rats and that administration of zzso prevents obesity by decreasing white fat mass, by zzso brown zzso tissue zzso and by inducing zzso protein in white zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment may inhibit diabetes zzso by zzso obesity and by zzso zzso zzso 4 in white zzso tissue and brown zzso zzso
