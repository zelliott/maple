To examine whether or not obesity in later life is related to feeding practice in early zzso daily zzso intake was studied in relation to relative weight in a cohort of 170 healthy infants from birth to 3 zzso of zzso zzso records were made monthly for the first 6 months and at zzso intervals thereafter, always covering the week preceding zzso zzso The frequency distribution of relative weight varied according to age and zzso the infants did not remain in the same relative weight group during the observed zzso When comparing the relative weight at 6 and 36 months, the zzso of correlation were rather weak for both sexes zzso zzso zzso and zzso There were no significant differences in the history of breast-feeding according to relative zzso The mean energy intake per zzso of body weight was always lower in infants with relative weight above zzso of expected weight and fats and carbohydrates were consumed less in the same zzso There were no differences in protein intake according to relative weight, although this intake was always higher than the recommended zzso zzso Daily intake of zinc was comparable in all weight zzso zzso indicate that the infants with above-average relative weights did not consume greater quantities of principal zzso The results, therefore, do not support the hypothesis that implicates zzso in early infancy as a major cause of obesity in later zzso
