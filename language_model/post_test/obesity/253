zzso in the liver is a common feature of obesity and type 2 diabetes and the precursor to the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso and liver zzso It has been shown previously that zzso zzso zzso synthesis increases insulin sensitivity and lowers zzso levels in diabetic zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso synthesis in zzso mice not only improved zzso zzso but also markedly reduced the development of zzso zzso The zzso mice were treated for 7 weeks with a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso the initial zzso involved in the synthesis of zzso Besides lowering zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels, drug treatment also significantly reduced the zzso weight ratio, decreased the zzso of zzso and improved several markers of liver zzso Drug treatment reduced liver zzso zzso levels in the zzso zzso Treatment also reduced the expression of several genes associated with zzso zzso including those involved in zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso zzso synthesis in zzso obese mice both prevented the development of zzso and partially reversed zzso zzso 

These data indicate that zzso zzso synthesis ameliorates the liver pathology associated with obesity and diabetes, and may represent a novel strategy for treating fatty liver disease and zzso
