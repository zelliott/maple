To evaluate whether exposure to maternal zzso diabetes zzso is associated with zzso and fat distribution in a multiethnic population of zzso 

zzso cohort study of 82 children exposed to maternal zzso and zzso zzso youths zzso years of age with measured zzso waist zzso zzso zzso and visceral and subcutaneous abdominal zzso 

Exposure to maternal zzso was associated with higher zzso zzso larger waist circumference zzso more subcutaneous abdominal fat zzso and increased zzso to zzso zzso thickness ratio zzso in models adjusted for age, sex, zzso and zzso zzso Adjustment for socioeconomic factors, zzso and zzso age, maternal smoking during pregnancy and current diet and physical activity did not influence zzso however, adjustment for maternal zzso zzso attenuated all zzso
