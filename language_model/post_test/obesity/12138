The effects of insulin and zzso growth factor I zzso on protein synthesis were compared in muscle isolated from lean and zzso zzso zzso Two types of skeletal muscles, the red zzso and the white zzso zzso zzso zzso muscles, were zzso In muscles from lean mice, zzso zzso insulin and 50 zzso zzso caused a similar zzso stimulation of zzso incorporation in total proteins zzso zzso However, the potency of zzso was only zzso that of insulin both in zzso and in zzso muscles zzso approximately equal to 6 zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso rate of protein synthesis was identical in muscles from zzso and lean zzso Similarly, a comparable increase in the rate of protein synthesis was obtained using zzso effective zzso of insulin and zzso in both lean and zzso zzso zzso gel zzso analysis of proteins labeled with zzso confirmed that, in muscles from lean and zzso animals, insulin and zzso increased overall protein synthesis in a similar zzso These results suggest that the protein synthesis machinery is not impaired in zzso zzso which is therefore not associated with resistance to insulin for its effect on protein zzso
