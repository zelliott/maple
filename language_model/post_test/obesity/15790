The data reported in literature revealed a novel function for zzso zzso zzso as zzso of zzso However, their expression profile and role in the cellular zzso during zzso zzso tissue development remain poorly zzso The authors hypothesized that zzso and zzso levels might be abnormal in zzso reflecting zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso One hundred and sixty three obese patients and 165 controls were zzso The following were zzso body mass index zzso waist circumference zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso plasma insulin zzso zzso model assessment zzso index, zzso blood pressure zzso zzso blood pressure zzso total cholesterol zzso zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and plasma levels of zzso and zzso A significant increase of zzso and zzso zzso was observed in obese zzso No zzso change was present in obese group, whereas zzso and zzso index increases zzso were obtained in obese patients compared to control zzso No zzso and zzso variations were observed in obese zzso zzso zzso and zzso increases zzso were present in obese patients, whereas no zzso zzso and zzso changes were obtained in both zzso zzso and zzso levels were significantly higher in obese group zzso Plasma levels of zzso and zzso are increased in obese patients which may reflect abnormal zzso zzso
