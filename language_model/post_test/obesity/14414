zzso zzso and zzso zzso are two zzso which induce changes in zzso in the brain after peripheral zzso A zzso mediation of these effects was investigated since the zzso responses to both peptides are affected differently by zzso This work was performed on genetically obese and lean zzso rats and on zzso and lean zzso rats as the effects of the peptides are dissimilar in these different zzso zzso either inhibited or zzso the zzso effects, or created new zzso With zzso the zzso occurred mainly in the zzso system and in the zzso strain, while new effects appeared in the zzso system of lean rats of both zzso With zzso zzso inhibited the effects in the zzso system in all lean rats, while new effects were observed in the zzso system in the zzso zzso These data enable the differentiation of the mechanisms of action of both peptides and their selective effects, according to the strain of rat and the presence or absence of zzso
