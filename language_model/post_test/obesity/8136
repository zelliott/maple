zzso appliances are increasingly prescribed for patients with moderate zzso sleep zzso zzso instead of zzso zzso However, the efficacy of oral appliances varies zzso We hypothesized that oral appliances were not zzso in patients with moderate zzso who were obese with zzso zzso 

Japanese patients with moderate zzso were zzso and zzso zzso The zzso score zzso was used as an estimate of zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed with the adjusted oral zzso in zzso zzso were defined as subjects who showed a follow-up zzso index zzso of zzso 5 with zzso 50% reduction in baseline zzso 

The mean baseline zzso was reduced with an oral zzso from 21 zzso 4 to zzso zzso 8 in 95 zzso Thirty-five patients were regarded as zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that both zzso and zzso could individually predict the treatment zzso When the zzso value of zzso was determined to be 24 zzso based on a receiver operating characteristic curve, 53 obese patients zzso zzso zzso 24 zzso with an zzso of class 4 were indicative of treatment failure with a high negative zzso value zzso and a low negative likelihood ratio zzso 

We conclude that patients with moderate zzso who are obese with zzso crowding are unlikely to respond to oral zzso zzso This simple prediction can be applied without the need for any cumbersome tools immediately after the diagnosis of zzso
