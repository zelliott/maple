The present review investigates donor qualities that impact zzso and zzso zzso with a focus on donors that have been historically zzso including those of extreme age, extreme size, and donors after cardiac zzso 

The increasing waiting time caused by the shortage of available zzso and the growing number of patients with uncontrolled diabetes has led to the expansion of acceptance criteria for zzso zzso The possible increased zzso risks and/or zzso graft survival associated with the use of zzso donors should be weighed against the mortality of zzso diabetics on the waiting list and the risk of dying from a zzso zzso Current data have shown that pediatric zzso donors are associated with excellent zzso zzso donors up to 50 years of age are suitable for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso donors are more appropriate as zzso donors, and donors after cardiac death provide an zzso source of zzso for zzso with clinical results that are identical to those observed from ideal zzso 

zzso selection in zzso transplantation significantly impacts outcome, yet the use of extended criteria donors can provide results comparable with those of ideal zzso
