zzso zzso is characteristic of some forms of human zzso but the role of zzso number in obesity and how normal zzso number is established are zzso zzso zzso and then differentiate to become zzso zzso zzso This involves exit from the cell cycle, a process regulated by cell cycle zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso show marked changes in zzso and zzso during zzso suggesting zzso may regulate establishment of zzso number in zzso To study the role of these zzso in zzso we analyzed adult zzso knockout zzso zzso knockout zzso zzso double knockout zzso and zzso zzso zzso Adult zzso mice weighed zzso more and had fourfold increases in body fat percentage compared with zzso Fat pad weights were increased 80, 90, and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso mice, respectively, compared with zzso zzso numbers of zzso zzso and zzso mice were zzso zzso and zzso respectively, that of zzso zzso size was not zzso zzso mice showed zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of these effects occurred in zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso mice are obese because of zzso zzso and zzso mice have further increases in obesity and zzso zzso indicating that their functions in establishing zzso number are not zzso zzso and zzso are major regulators of zzso number in zzso and zzso lacking one or both of these proteins provide models for producing zzso zzso and understanding its zzso zzso
