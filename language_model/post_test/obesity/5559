zzso fat distribution is a consequence of menopause, but the mechanisms responsible are zzso zzso zzso in humans can be modeled using zzso zzso We have shown that increased zzso in these rats is due to reduced physical activity and transient zzso and can be reversed with zzso zzso The aims of this study were to examine whether this altered energy balance is associated with circulating zzso zzso central zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or increased zzso zzso Y zzso 

Plasma zzso levels, zzso tissue zzso gene zzso energy balance responses to zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso concentration in five separate zzso regions were measured in adult female rats after either zzso or sham zzso 

zzso was not associated with zzso or decreased zzso gene expression in zzso zzso however, it was associated with zzso to central zzso zzso Food intake was less suppressed and spontaneous physical activity was less zzso by zzso This was not due to decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration in the zzso nucleus of the zzso was elevated in the zzso rats, consistent with zzso zzso however this effect was transient and disappeared as body fat and zzso levels increased further and zzso zzso 

zzso central zzso sensitivity and overproduction of zzso may contribute to excess fat zzso caused by zzso zzso
