To critically evaluate the most recent literature on the methods used to assess body zzso cardiovascular and zzso function in children and zzso 

Although regional body composition can be fairly accurately calculated by zzso X-ray zzso the accuracy of zzso zzso of visceral zzso tissue is zzso Regarding the cardiovascular and zzso zzso there is no doubt that direct and invasive methods provide high accuracy and zzso For instance, exercise until exhaustion, direct zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance and magnetic resonance imaging are valid methods to determine maximum oxygen zzso cardiac output and tissue zzso zzso zzso Except for the direct zzso zzso all have been successfully used in pediatric zzso Relatively new techniques for the assessment of exercise zzso adaptations in youths include the zzso zzso and the zzso method for cardiac output determination, and magnetic resonance zzso for intramuscular and zzso zzso zzso Additional validation and reliability studies in pediatric populations are needed for some of these techniques zzso the zzso zzso 

Most of the techniques used in adults appear not directly zzso to zzso A combination of techniques and/or the application of new, promising and easy to use ones, such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso may advance our knowledge in pediatric exercise zzso
