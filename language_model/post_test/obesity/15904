The association between dietary obesity and zzso systems that regulate hedonic aspects of feeding is currently zzso In the present study, we examined differences in baseline and zzso central zzso levels in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso rats were zzso and showed a zzso weight gain over OR rats at zzso 15 of age, when fed a standard zzso zzso This zzso was associated with a 50% reduction in zzso zzso zzso as measured by a zzso probe in the nucleus zzso a projection site of the zzso zzso system that has been implicated in food zzso Similar defects were also observed in younger animals (4 zzso zzso In zzso studies, zzso evoked zzso release in slice preparations was significantly attenuated in zzso rats, not only in the nucleus zzso but also in additional terminal sites of zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso prefrontal cortex, suggesting that there may be a widespread dysfunction in mechanisms regulating zzso release in this obesity zzso Moreover, zzso impairment in zzso rats was apparent at birth and associated with changes in expression of several factors regulating zzso synthesis and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that an attenuated central zzso system would reduce the hedonic response associated with feeding and induce zzso zzso leading to zzso
