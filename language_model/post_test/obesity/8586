zzso studies have revealed strong and internationally zzso links between early growth restriction and subsequent risk of developing type 2 diabetes and the zzso syndrome zzso zzso hypertension and zzso This effect can exist independently of genetic zzso There is also direct evidence that poor maternal nutrition and maternal smoking cause both a reduction in zzso and subsequent loss of zzso zzso High rates of growth in childhood may add to these zzso The zzso zzso hypothesis attempts to explain these associations in terms of an altered programming of growth and metabolism that aids survival both zzso and zzso Type 2 diabetes is zzso as a consequence of a clash of this programming with adult zzso Tests of this hypothesis in animal models have shown that both the zzso syndrome and type 2 diabetes can result from early growth restriction in rats zzso upon rat zzso being fed a reduced zzso zzso diet (in which the protein is replaced by an equal quantity of zzso zzso A variety of other models of early growth restriction in rats lead to a similar zzso Several structural and gene expression changes have been shown in many zzso including zzso liver, zzso muscle and zzso zzso Changes in gene expression include those concerned with hormone zzso zzso and zzso zzso Many important questions remain for future zzso
