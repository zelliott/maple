zzso a protein containing 167 zzso zzso demonstrates structural similarities with zzso family and is mainly produced by zzso The zzso zzso zzso is a large membrane spanning protein that belongs to the zzso 130 family of zzso class I zzso Besides the neuroendocrine effects of zzso in the control of food intake and energy zzso binding of this hormone has been proven in zzso liver, zzso skin, stomach, heart, zzso zzso and so zzso Thus zzso affects zzso fetal and zzso function, it appears to act as an zzso and zzso factor for the regulation of reproduction and zzso prevents zzso zzso deposition, zzso insulin sensitivity in the muscle or liver, and links the immune and zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes for zzso It has been localized in humans on the 7 alpha zzso zzso and consists of three zzso separated by two zzso In humans, a zzso in the zzso gene was reported in two children with the same zzso zzso Other studies reported a zzso in the promoter untranslated zzso 1 of the zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso in the promoter region of the zzso gene zzso and a zzso at zzso zzso The zzso activities of zzso on target zzso are carried out through binding to a specific zzso zzso zzso maps in humans to the zzso zzso zzso commonly occur, which cause two zzso zzso to zzso at zzso 656 zzso to zzso in zzso 14 zzso zzso to zzso at zzso 109 zzso to zzso in zzso 4 zzso a zzso change zzso to zzso at zzso 223 zzso to zzso a silent zzso change at zzso zzso and a silent zzso transition at zzso zzso zzso is related with obesity and its zzso zzso However, new relation ships have been zzso inflammatory zzso disease, cancer, bone formation, asthma and so zzso In conclusion, despite the great advances in our knowledge of zzso zzso many areas of investigation zzso Future research is expected to discover new molecules in the zzso pathway, to treat obesity and its related zzso
