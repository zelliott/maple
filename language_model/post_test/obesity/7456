zzso is a major contributor to the overall burden of disease (also reducing life zzso and associated with high medical costs due to zzso zzso However, obesity zzso while reducing zzso morbidity and zzso may not result in overall zzso cost savings because of additional costs in zzso zzso zzso financial consequences of preventing obesity are less well zzso for pharmaceutical spending as well as for other zzso zzso 

To estimate the effect of obesity prevention on annual and lifetime drug spending as well as other zzso zzso zzso the hospital segment, long-term care segment and primary zzso 

The zzso zzso National Institute for Public Health and the zzso zzso Disease Model and Dutch cost of illness data were used to zzso using a zzso model approach, the lifetime expenditures in the pharmaceutical segment and three other zzso segments for a hypothetical cohort of obese zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso people with a starting age of 20 zzso In order to assess the zzso consequences of obesity zzso these costs were compared with the costs of two other similar zzso zzso a zzso cohort zzso and a zzso and zzso zzso and a smoking zzso To assert whether preventing obesity results in cost savings in any of the zzso net present values were estimated using different discount zzso zzso analyses were conducted across key input values and using a broader definition of zzso 

Lifetime drug expenditures are higher for obese people than for zzso people, despite shorter life expectancy for the zzso zzso prevention results in savings on drugs for zzso diseases until the age of 74 years, which outweigh additional drug costs for diseases unrelated to obesity in zzso zzso Furthermore, obesity prevention will increase long-term care expenditures zzso while savings in the other zzso segments are small or zzso zzso costs more heavily or using lower relative mortality risks for obesity would make obesity prevention a relatively more attractive strategy in terms of zzso costs, especially for the long-term care zzso Application of a broader definition of zzso costs has the opposite zzso 

zzso prevention will likely result in savings in the pharmaceutical segment, but substantial additional costs for long-term zzso These are important considerations for policy makers concerned with the future zzso of the zzso zzso
