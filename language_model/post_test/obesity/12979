The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of abdominal obesity and its impact on the risks of hypertension in the US adult zzso 

Data from the third US National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso obesity was defined as waist zzso or zzso zzso in men zzso or zzso zzso in zzso zzso was defined as mean zzso blood zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso blood zzso or zzso zzso zzso or current treatment with prescribed hypertension zzso zzso of abdominal obesity were estimated in zzso White, zzso Black and Hispanic zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis using empirical waist zzso points was used to determine the risks of zzso The impact of abdominal zzso on risk of hypertension was estimated from zzso risk adjusting for age, current smoking and alcohol zzso 

The zzso of abdominal obesity were zzso zzso and zzso in White, Black and Hispanic men, zzso The corresponding values in women were zzso zzso and zzso zzso obesity was found to be associated with a two to zzso increased risk of hypertension in this zzso In men, the attributable risk percent ranged from zzso in Hispanics to zzso in zzso and in women ranged from zzso in zzso to zzso in zzso We estimated that 24 million adult men and 40 million adult women of Hispanic and zzso Black and White ethnicity were suffering from abdominal zzso 

In this population, hypertension appears to be associated with abdominal zzso The estimates of population attributable risks suggest that the risk of hypertension could be potentially reduced if waist size were reduced to zzso zzso in men and zzso zzso in zzso
