To test the hypothesis that zzso zzso may be related to peripheral nerve zzso we examined the changes occurring to zzso nerve processes zzso the zzso muscles in women with stress urinary zzso associated with zzso 

Thirty patients with zzso zzso and 10 zzso control subjects entered the zzso All patients were evaluated by zzso zzso Ten of 30 patients had pure stress urinary zzso none of the control subjects was zzso During surgery, four biopsy samples were obtained from each woman from the zzso and zzso zzso The muscle sections were processed for zzso using specific zzso to zzso zzso zzso and general zzso markers zzso zzso and zzso including zzso Y, zzso zzso zzso and substance zzso The evaluation of zzso nerves was based on a zzso analysis that allowed for a zzso zzso scale zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso zzso nerve zzso running either zzso or in small zzso along with a dense network of neural processes containing zzso Y, zzso zzso zzso and substance zzso were found throughout the zzso tissue and zzso muscle of the control zzso In contrast, in the muscle specimens from those with zzso zzso both the density and the intensity of zzso Y, zzso zzso zzso and substance P zzso nerves were markedly reduced compared with the control zzso 

The evidence of a reduced zzso nerve supply to the zzso muscles provides a zzso basis suggesting that neural abnormalities contribute to the zzso of zzso zzso and urinary zzso
