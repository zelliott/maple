It has been suggested that zzso protein 3 zzso can increase energy zzso thereby regulating body zzso Although studies on zzso zzso mice suggest that lack of zzso function does not cause obesity or Type 2 diabetes, it is possible that zzso of zzso function improves these disorders or their clinical zzso A zzso to zzso increase of zzso gene expression is achievable through zzso or pharmacological zzso We examined the zzso of transgenic mice with approximately zzso zzso of mouse zzso zzso in skeletal zzso 

We generated transgenic mice with approximately zzso zzso of mouse zzso zzso in skeletal muscle under control of the skeletal zzso muscle zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso of these mice was zzso either on a standard diet or on a zzso high-fat zzso 

In mice on standard zzso there was no difference in body weight, oxygen consumption and zzso zzso force between transgenic mice and zzso zzso However, transgenic mice tended to have lower body weight, increased oxygen consumption and decreased zzso zzso force than the control zzso zzso mice on a zzso high-fat diet consumed much more oxygen and had noticeably less weight gain and less zzso fat, as well as better zzso tolerance than zzso zzso 

Our study shows that zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the skeletal muscle reduced zzso zzso An zzso increase of zzso zzso can be attained by zzso or pharmacological zzso suggesting that zzso has therapeutic potential in the treatment of zzso
