To compare outcomes of zzso born from women with Class III obesity with those whose mothers were of normal body zzso 

A retrospective cohort study of zzso singleton infants was zzso zzso zzso body mass index zzso defined matched normal and Class III obese zzso zzso zzso models were used to determine adjusted relative odds ratios zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso for selected adverse zzso zzso 

zzso exposed to maternal Class III obesity had greater risks of fetal overgrowth and low zzso artery zzso Class III obesity was protective against small for zzso age and low zzso There was no difference in the risk of zzso delivery, zzso in the zzso fluid or zzso zzso 

The new knowledge generated by this study provides further information on unique challenges faced by newborns of women with Class III zzso suggesting more specialized care in the zzso and zzso periods may be zzso
