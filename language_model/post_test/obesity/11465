zzso zzso transplantation is associated with a survival advantage compared with dialysis patients remaining on the zzso transplantation waiting list, but this advantage has not been confirmed in obese zzso zzso disease zzso zzso 

Using data from the zzso we studied zzso patients who presented with zzso from 1 April 1995 to 29 June 1999 and later enrolled on the zzso transplantation waiting list with body mass zzso zzso zzso at the time of presentation to zzso and followed until 6 November zzso zzso of zzso zzso transplantation or zzso other than zzso were zzso Cox zzso hazards zzso models were used to calculate zzso zzso hazard ratios zzso for time to death in a given patient during the study period, controlling for zzso zzso demographics and zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of mortality was zzso episodes per 100 zzso zzso in zzso zzso transplantation and zzso zzso in living donor zzso transplantation compared with zzso zzso zzso in all patients on the transplant waiting zzso In comparison to maintenance dialysis, both recipients of solitary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and recipients of living donor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso had statistically significant improved zzso A benefit of zzso zzso transplantation did not apply to patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso patients on the zzso transplant waiting list had a significantly lower risk of mortality after zzso transplantation compared with those remaining on zzso
