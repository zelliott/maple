zzso abdominal zzso tissue zzso visceral zzso tissue zzso fat in the neck area zzso fat zzso and liver fat zzso are associated with zzso traits related to insulin zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging and zzso offer a unique approach to zzso fat zzso in larger zzso 

The objective was to study 1) the impact of the aforementioned fat zzso on insulin sensitivity in a zzso design and 2) changes in these fat zzso and in insulin sensitivity during a lifestyle intervention zzso 

One hundred zzso subjects were included in the zzso zzso zzso data during zzso were available in zzso zzso Body fat zzso were zzso by zzso magnetic resonance imaging, and representative reference slices at the zzso level zzso zzso and at the level of the shoulder joint zzso were zzso zzso was measured by zzso resonance zzso zzso sensitivity was estimated from an oral zzso tolerance zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso associated with IS (all P zzso The change in insulin sensitivity during zzso was associated with the changes in these fat zzso (all P zzso In a zzso model, the change in insulin sensitivity during zzso adjusted for zzso age, zzso and IF at baseline was associated with change in IF zzso zzso and with change in zzso zzso zzso 

IF represents a subcutaneous fat depot determining zzso zzso both zzso and during zzso The impact of zzso and IF on insulin sensitivity appears to be independent from each zzso Additional studies are needed to clarify the zzso properties of zzso
