To study the relationship between body weight and blood pressure, we have developed an animal model of zzso zzso Nine adult zzso dogs were chronically zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso After a zzso control period, all dogs were made to gain weight by adding 2 zzso of beef fat to their diet for 5 zzso Blood pressure, heart rate, and body weight were measured daily before the addition of dietary fat, during the 5 weeks of the high fat diet, and for 6 weeks after the fat supplement was zzso Plasma volume and cardiac output were measured prior to and after 5 weeks of the fat zzso During the zzso high fat diet, the zzso body weight increased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso less than zzso mean blood pressure increased from 90 zzso 5 to 112 zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso less than zzso and heart rate increased from 70 zzso 7 to 85 zzso 5 zzso zzso less than zzso Blood pressure, heart rate, and body weight returned to near control values after the fat diet was zzso Over the zzso fat diet, the zzso plasma volume increased from 920 zzso 130 to zzso zzso 195 zzso zzso less than zzso cardiac output increased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso less than zzso and systemic vascular resistance increased from zzso zzso 8 to zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso zzso less than zzso Weight gain in the dogs was also associated with zzso and insulin zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
