Natural killer zzso cells are a key component of innate zzso their activity is modulated by zzso and hormones and is influenced by zzso In zzso a higher risk of cancer and infections has been zzso Studies on zzso cell activity have yielded inconsistent results; zzso cell sensitivity to zzso has not been assessed zzso 

In this zzso study, we assessed both spontaneous zzso cell activity and responsiveness to positive zzso zzso and negative zzso zzso in uncomplicated zzso we searched for correlations between zzso cell activity and zzso dietary and zzso zzso 

In all, 21 obese (six zzso zzso and 21 zzso and zzso healthy zzso subjects underwent clinical examination and dietary and laboratory zzso zzso and modulated zzso activities of peripheral blood zzso cells were measured by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso cell activity was not different in obese subjects vs zzso zzso zzso and cortisol inhibited zzso cell activity in both zzso zzso zzso was lower in the obese than in the control group zzso vs zzso zzso but decreased sensitivity was restricted to women zzso In obese subjects, zzso zzso zzso correlated with serum zzso levels zzso zzso and, in women, with body mass index zzso zzso zzso stimulation positively correlated with dietary carbohydrates zzso zzso and serum LDL levels zzso zzso and zzso correlated with dietary lipids zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso cell activity is normal in uncomplicated zzso zzso to zzso zzso with fat and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso with serum zzso levels and is significantly diminished in obese women, in whom it zzso with body mass zzso
