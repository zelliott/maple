There is an inverse relation between body mass and mortality in large populations of patients with chronic heart failure with a broad range of disease zzso The best measure of body size to describe the relation is not zzso 

Patients with chronic heart failure zzso zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso years; zzso zzso due to left zzso zzso dysfunction were followed for a median of 1785 days zzso range, zzso zzso in zzso We measured body mass index zzso zzso zzso index zzso zzso and body surface area zzso In a subset of zzso patients, we also calculated the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso together with zzso zzso During zzso zzso patients zzso zzso of body mass were strong zzso zzso of outcome, and zzso zzso zzso zzso was the strongest predictor followed by height zzso zzso zzso weight zzso zzso zzso then zzso zzso zzso zzso The larger the patient's size, the lower the risk of zzso Body surface area was the single strongest predictor of outcome in a multivariable model including 14 zzso In the subset with zzso data, zzso zzso rate, zzso weight, zzso percentage body fat, fat mass, zzso and zzso mass were all zzso zzso of zzso 

zzso of body size are strongly related to outcome in patients with chronic heart zzso Body surface area is a stronger predictor of mortality than other measures of body zzso irrespective of height zzso The greater the overall bulk of the body, the better the zzso
