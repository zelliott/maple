Estimates of the attributable number of deaths zzso from all causes can be obtained by first zzso population attributable risk zzso adjusted for zzso zzso and then zzso the zzso by the number of deaths determined from vital mortality statistics that occurred in the population for a specific time zzso zzso hazard zzso estimates of adjusted relative hazards obtained from mortality follow-up data from a cohort is combined with a joint distribution of risk factor and zzso to zzso an adjusted zzso Two zzso of adjusted zzso are zzso These zzso differ according to which reference population is used to obtain the joint distribution of risk factor and zzso Two types of reference populations were zzso zzso the population represented by the baseline cohort and zzso a population that is external to the zzso zzso used in survey sampling are applied to obtain estimates of the zzso of the zzso zzso These zzso can be applied to data that range from simple random samples to zzso zzso cluster samples, which are used in national household zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is illustrated in an analysis of excess deaths due to having a zzso body mass index using the second National Health and zzso zzso zzso zzso Study and the zzso zzso These methods can also be used to estimate the attributable number of zzso deaths and their standard errors when the time period for the zzso of deaths is zzso
