The levels of plasma insulin and zzso during exercise and subsequent recovery have been determined in obese zzso obese diabetics Type II and middle-aged female zzso It has been found that exercise reduces levels of peptides both in the control and in the obese zzso zzso This effect of acute exercise was found blunted in the obese diabetic zzso zzso obese subjects zzso with zzso showed no reduction either in plasma insulin or zzso levels during zzso During the recovery, the level of plasma insulin returned promptly to the zzso value in the control group but increased above the resting value in obese subjects, both zzso and zzso In controls and zzso obese the zzso of zzso insulin zzso ratio occurred early after the onset of exercise and then returned to the resting value despite the exercise being zzso The plasma zzso zzso ratios were reduced during the first 15 zzso of recovery period in obese zzso subjects and returned to normal in the next 15 zzso The latter may suggest that reduced insulin removal could also contribute to the increase in plasma insulin values in the obese during zzso
