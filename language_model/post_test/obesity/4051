We have determined total body zzso and zzso zzso rates in response to a standard breakfast in nine obese patients with zzso diabetes zzso zzso and in seven zzso and zzso zzso The patients with zzso were studied twice, once while in poor zzso control zzso blood zzso concentration 267 zzso 24 zzso urinary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and again after modest zzso improvement following 2 zzso of fiber treatment zzso blood zzso 227 zzso 19 zzso urinary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rates were normal in patients with zzso before and after fiber zzso However, in patients before fiber treatment the rise in zzso zzso rates, the zzso fall in zzso zzso rates, and the rise in serum insulin and zzso zzso after the breakfast were all severely zzso In addition, storage of zzso zzso was significantly reduced (from zzso to zzso P less than zzso After fiber treatment, zzso zzso zzso rates had improved and were no longer significantly lower than control zzso In contrast, zzso storage remained zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso zzso remained normal but that zzso zzso zzso was impaired in our obese patients with zzso This zzso however, appeared to be a relatively late event, occurring only during severely uncontrolled zzso zzso zzso to dispose of zzso by storage appeared to be an earlier zzso with a greater impact on zzso tolerance than the impairment of zzso zzso
