The zzso has many similarities to humans, making it an excellent research model in which to study the role of exercise on zzso zzso zzso adapt to zzso by increasing muscle zzso zzso zzso stroke volume, cardiac zzso zzso and high density zzso cholesterol levels, while decreasing total cholesterol levels and resting heart zzso The zzso profile of zzso and humans is also similar, and low density zzso is the major cholesterol transporting zzso in both zzso Several studies in zzso report conflicting results on the effect of zzso on zzso profile and zzso zzso zzso This may result from differences in total exercise time between the zzso With sufficient total exercise, zzso was reduced and high density zzso cholesterol levels were zzso Exercise may also play a role in reducing zzso a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, by enhancing zzso zzso from zzso Recent research suggests that zzso zzso sensitivity to zzso a zzso zzso agent, is reduced after exercise zzso Cellular mechanisms responsible for this zzso change include a reduction in zzso A1 zzso zzso Current studies are examining the transport of zzso zzso zzso from zzso and its role as a potential zzso zzso
