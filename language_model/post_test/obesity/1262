zzso zzso peptides are widely distributed in the central nervous system as well as in the gastrointestinal zzso where they zzso zzso contraction, zzso and zzso zzso metabolism and zzso They bind to zzso receptors on the cell surface to elicit their zzso zzso zzso receptors cloned so far include, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, despite the molecular characterization of zzso determination of its function has been difficult as a result of its low affinity for zzso and its lack of an identified natural zzso We have generated zzso mice in an attempt to determine the in zzso function of the zzso Mice lacking functional zzso developed a mild zzso associated with hypertension and impairment of zzso zzso They also exhibited reduced zzso rate, increased feeding efficiency and subsequent zzso Our data suggest that zzso is required for the regulation of zzso processes and metabolism responsible for energy balance and zzso zzso mice provide a useful new model for the investigation of human obesity and associated zzso
