zzso zzso exhibits both zzso activity zzso and homocysteine zzso activity zzso which respectively prevent LDL zzso and zzso homocysteine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso preventing LDL zzso by zzso of oxidized zzso Both of these zzso exhibit a zzso zzso zzso is an zzso inhibitor of zzso oxide zzso synthesis causing zzso zzso The aim was to compare non-obese zzso patients with a zzso matched control group using the following zzso serum zzso zzso zzso and zzso and hormonal zzso 

77 women with zzso and 25 healthy subject were recruited for this study, The controls were non-obese zzso and age matched with the zzso There were no significant differences with respect to age, zzso zzso free testosterone, zzso zzso total cholesterol, zzso zzso LDL, zzso zzso zzso ratio and zzso among the groups zzso zzso However, total testosterone and zzso zzso levels were significantly higher in the zzso group zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso were significantly lower in the zzso group while zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso were significantly higher in the zzso zzso However, there was no significant difference in zzso activity among the zzso 

zzso zzso and increased zzso levels might be a relevant marker for the development of future zzso heart disease zzso in non-obese zzso zzso Further studies are needed to confirm our zzso
