This investigation addressed the hypothesis that, as a marker of zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso gene expression would be greater during growth in obese pigs than in zzso contemporary zzso zzso pigs from a single litter were removed from the sow for sampling at 0, 3, 10, and 17 zzso The number of litters at 0, 3, 10, and 17 d of age was zero, two, three, and three zzso zzso and four, two, three, and three zzso zzso zzso zzso pigs were removed from the sow at 14 d of zzso One set of zzso pigs was fed a zzso zzso diet from d 28 to zzso pigs were killed on d 28 and 49 for zzso The zzso pigs were switched to a zzso zzso zzso diet at d 28, and samples were obtained at 31, 35, or 49 d of zzso zzso tissue from all pigs in a litter for zzso and zzso pigs was pooled for the measurement of zzso and zzso zzso There were significant genetic and age effects for zzso diameter and zzso overall, zzso from obese pigs were larger than those from zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso was barely zzso at 0 d of age and increased zzso zzso by zzso by 49 d of zzso There was a significant genetic zzso age interaction zzso zzso zzso there was more zzso zzso in zzso tissue from obese pigs than in that from zzso pigs during the zzso period, whereas zzso pigs exhibited greater zzso gene expression than obese pigs during the zzso zzso The lesser zzso gene expression in zzso obese pigs was caused by a strong depression in zzso gene expression in the zzso obese zzso The data indicate that zzso gene expression provides a marker for terminal zzso especially in zzso zzso Furthermore, these results provide additional evidence that zzso gene expression is zzso by diets high in saturated fatty zzso
