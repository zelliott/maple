To examine the associations of body mass index zzso and weight change with risk of stroke in zzso 

Prospective cohort study among US female registered nurses participating in the zzso Health zzso 

A total of zzso women aged 30 to 55 years in 1976 who were free from diagnosed coronary heart disease, stroke, and zzso 

zzso of zzso stroke, zzso stroke zzso or zzso zzso and total zzso 

During 16 years of zzso zzso total strokes (including zzso zzso strokes and zzso zzso zzso were zzso In zzso analyses adjusted for age, smoking, zzso hormone use, and zzso status, women with increased zzso zzso or zzso zzso had significantly increased risk of zzso stroke, with relative risks zzso of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso for zzso of 27 to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso of 29 to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso of 32 zzso or more zzso for zzso as compared with those with a zzso of less than 21 zzso For zzso stroke there was a zzso inverse relation between obesity and zzso stroke, with the highest risk among women in the leanest zzso category zzso for zzso For total stroke the zzso were somewhat attenuated compared with those for zzso stroke but remained elevated for women with higher zzso zzso for zzso In zzso analyses that also adjusted for zzso at age 18 years, weight gain from age 18 years until 1976 was associated with an zzso for zzso stroke of zzso zzso zzso zzso for a gain of 11 to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for a gain of 20 zzso or more zzso for zzso as compared with women who maintained stable weight zzso or gain zzso zzso Although weight change was not related to risk of zzso stroke zzso for zzso a direct relationship was observed between weight gain and total stroke risk zzso for zzso 

These prospective data indicate that both obesity and weight gain in women are important risk factors for zzso and total stroke but not zzso zzso The relationship between obesity and total stroke depends on the distribution of stroke zzso in the zzso
