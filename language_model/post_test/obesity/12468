zzso and risk of asthma are zzso Different zzso of zzso such as zzso subcutaneous or zzso zzso may affect asthma risk zzso 

To explore the association of different zzso types with zzso zzso zzso inflammation and lung function, accounting for possible effect zzso such as zzso and zzso 

In a general population sample of zzso persons aged zzso visceral zzso tissue zzso and subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso were measured by zzso and fat percentage by zzso Body mass index, waist zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso inflammation as fractional zzso zzso oxide zzso lung function zzso and forced vital capacity zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

All zzso measures were associated with a higher risk of zzso The risk estimates zzso ratios, zzso with zzso confidence zzso zzso of current asthma were of similar magnitude for all six zzso measures ranging between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso associations were significantly stronger in zzso than in zzso In zzso the risk estimates of current asthma ranged between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for SAT and zzso zzso zzso results were obtained using zzso zzso measures zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso decreased significantly with increasing zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso decreased between 36 zzso zzso zzso 10, 62 zzso and 155 zzso zzso zzso zzso 186 zzso for one unit zzso zzso increase of SAT and zzso zzso zzso measures were not associated with zzso and not consistently associated with zzso zzso 

The effect of zzso on asthma was mainly seen in zzso and did not appear to depend on the distribution of zzso as reflected by the zzso measures used in the present zzso zzso zzso was associated with lower lung function independent of zzso zzso
