Human HDL are zzso in their metabolism and comprise small, nascent zzso and more mature zzso Evidence exists that zzso zzso is the initial zzso of cellular free cholesterol, which then transfers zzso to other zzso species and then, after zzso into zzso As HDL particles are themselves transformed during this process, we zzso that in disorders in which zzso is low, such as zzso the distribution of HDL particles may be zzso In this study, we analyzed the HDL profile in 23 obese and 18 lean subjects, and further investigated the effects of dietary change in 15 obese zzso HDL were separated by two-dimensional zzso zzso and the zzso content in each fraction was zzso alpha zzso in obese subjects was significantly lower zzso zzso and alpha zzso alpha zzso and zzso zzso were significantly higher zzso zzso for alpha zzso P zzso for alpha 3- and zzso zzso than in lean zzso On zzso zzso analysis, body mass index accounted for zzso zzso of the zzso in alpha zzso and for zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso in alpha 3- and zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso and zzso zzso increased significantly after zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The profile of zzso particles and also of zzso particles therefore shifted to smaller species in obese subjects, and this was influenced by dietary zzso Increased zzso zzso in obese subjects is likely to derive from increased HDL zzso but may also reflect diminished transformation of zzso zzso to zzso zzso which might reduce capacity for reverse cholesterol transport and partly explain lower zzso zzso
