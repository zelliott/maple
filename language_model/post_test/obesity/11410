This paper provides a personal perspective of the role of abnormal zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso support for a major role of zzso zzso in long-term control of zzso pressure and sodium balance comes from studies demonstrating that zzso pressure zzso is impaired in all forms of chronic hypertension and zzso prevention of pressure zzso from zzso by zzso of zzso zzso pressure, also prevents the maintenance of sodium balance zzso Although the precise mechanisms of impaired pressure zzso in essential hypertension have remained zzso recent evidence suggests that obesity and overweight may play a major zzso zzso increases zzso sodium zzso and zzso pressure zzso by zzso of the zzso and sympathetic nervous systems and by altered zzso physical zzso zzso obesity also causes marked structural changes in the zzso that eventually lead to a loss of zzso function, further increases in zzso pressure, and severe zzso injury in some zzso Although there are many unanswered questions about the mechanisms of obesity hypertension and zzso disease, this is one of the most promising areas for future research, especially in view of the growing, worldwide zzso of zzso
