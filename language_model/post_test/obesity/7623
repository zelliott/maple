zzso are an important class of agents that are used in combination zzso regimens to treat bacterial zzso zzso of zzso is typically based on total body zzso However, the most appropriate alternative body size zzso for dosing zzso at the extremes of weight zzso and zzso is not zzso Also, the zzso performance of newer formulas to assess kidney function, such as the modification of diet in zzso disease zzso and chronic kidney zzso zzso equations compared to the zzso equation to predict zzso zzso is not zzso We sought to examine dosing of zzso across the extremes of weight using a variety of formulas to assess kidney zzso zzso data were obtained from a set of zzso collected data zzso to 2003) of zzso zzso zzso adult patients that included 497 zzso and zzso zzso zzso The median zzso zzso age, weight, and body mass index were 66 zzso zzso years, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The percentage of zzso zzso overweight, and obese cases based on the World Health Organization zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso volume of distribution was zzso to several alternative body size zzso Only lean body weight estimated by the method of zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the volume of distribution for both zzso and zzso across all weight zzso with the estimate being approximately zzso zzso zzso dosing can be simplified across all weight strata with the use of lean body zzso The zzso equation best predicts zzso zzso
