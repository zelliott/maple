This study was designed to investigate the efficacy of the zzso vascular closure device after zzso puncture of the zzso zzso 

In a prospective study, 120 consecutive patients underwent lower limb vascular intervention by an zzso access to the common zzso artery zzso After intervention, a zzso zzso zzso zzso or an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vascular closure device was used to achieve zzso The technical success or the cause of failure was zzso In addition, the zzso status zzso zzso zzso time, zzso zzso time zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso body mass index zzso presence of zzso and history of previous surgical interventions of the zzso were zzso 

zzso was achieved in 97 patients zzso In 12 patients zzso persistent bleeding of the puncture site required manual zzso In another nine patients zzso a zzso of the sheath zzso the passage of the collagen plug toward the vessel, and in two patients the anchor zzso out of the vessel, requiring manual zzso There were no significant differences between the groups of successful and unsuccessful zzso regarding the mean zzso zzso zzso 254 * zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso time zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso (30 zzso 31 zzso P zzso zzso However, unsuccessful zzso was more likely in obese patients with an increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso seems to be an independent risk factor for insufficient zzso using the zzso vascular closure device after zzso puncture of the zzso In zzso of our patients, zzso could not be achieved due to zzso of the flexible zzso
