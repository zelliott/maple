The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of zzso zzso for reducing cardiovascular risk factors and improving compliance towards diet in a group of young patients hospitalized for essential obesity of high degree zzso or zzso zzso 

103 adolescents zzso age zzso zzso zzso participated in a zzso zzso zzso study of zzso (15 zzso zzso versus zzso All patients received a zzso zzso zzso zzso 600 zzso for two zzso In zzso conditions, and after 30 and 60 days of treatment, zzso variables zzso weight, zzso and zzso and cardiovascular risk factors zzso zzso zzso total cholesterol, zzso zzso zzso and zzso blood zzso were zzso zzso in hunger and zzso were also zzso 

During the treatment period, both the zzso group and the zzso group presented a similar pattern of weight loss zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso No important zzso were recorded in either zzso Blood pressure and zzso markers decreased significantly in both zzso Earlier reductions in total cholesterol and zzso blood pressure in zzso subjects were the only significant differences observed as compared to the patients receiving zzso zzso 30 zzso total zzso 120 zzso 2 zzso vs 132 zzso 3 zzso zzso p zzso zzso blood zzso 73 zzso 1 zzso vs 77 zzso 1 zzso zzso p zzso However, after 60 days, these values were similar in the two zzso As far as zzso data are concerned, zzso determined a reduction in hunger and an increase in zzso in a significantly higher number of subjects than did the zzso not only after 30 days of treatment zzso vs zzso and zzso vs zzso zzso p zzso but also after two months of treatment zzso vs zzso and zzso vs zzso zzso p zzso 

These findings demonstrate that zzso represents a useful support in the treatment of juvenile obesity and might ensure a better individual compliance towards restrictive zzso particularly in the initial zzso zzso in the absence of important zzso
