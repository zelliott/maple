Recently, quantitative trait zzso zzso for body weight and obesity have been mapped in an zzso population between the high body zzso mouse line zzso and the zzso line zzso Most zzso were highly zzso but had small effects zzso Under the hypothesis that zzso zzso might result from changes in gene activity, our strategy to identify candidate genes for the observed effects was directed towards the identification of zzso expressed zzso zzso here we compare the zzso profile of about 11 zzso genes in zzso fat zzso of males of two high body zzso zzso and zzso and two zzso mouse lines zzso and zzso For the zzso of zzso we used pooled samples of 20 individual zzso By zzso comparisons between selected and zzso mouse lines, a set of 77 genes was identified representing genes whose level of expression differed between obese and lean mouse zzso According to the functional zzso of zzso 69 zzso expressed genes were involved in regulatory and zzso zzso cell division, cell stability, or immune response, and thus might have an effect on body weight and fat zzso 14 out of these zzso occur in zzso regions for body weight or abdominal fat zzso Further analyses are necessary to discriminate between genes directly causing zzso effects and indirectly regulated zzso expressed zzso
