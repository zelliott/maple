Type 2 diabetes is a zzso disease in which both zzso dysfunction and insulin resistance are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is another zzso in type 2 diabetes whose mechanism is zzso Increased demand due to obesity and/or insulin resistance may result in zzso of immature zzso zzso with a higher content of intact zzso 

We investigated the impact of obesity on zzso zzso in normal subjects and in type 2 diabetic patients by measuring intact zzso total zzso zzso zzso intact insulin, and zzso (by zzso by specific zzso zzso zzso in the zzso state and during a zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso stimulation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type 2 diabetic patients matched for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared with zzso and zzso lean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso normal control zzso 

zzso patients zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso had elevated zzso levels of intact zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and total zzso zzso 39 zzso 4 zzso 15 zzso zzso and 35 zzso 5 zzso 13 zzso zzso all P zzso After zzso zzso zzso levels were disproportionately elevated zzso insulin based on area under the curve zzso in diabetic patients zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both P zzso zzso insulin and zzso net responses were significantly reduced in type 2 diabetic patients, most pronounced in the lean zzso The ratio of intact zzso to zzso was higher in diabetic patients after stimulation in both zzso versus zzso 32 zzso 3 zzso 23 zzso zzso and zzso versus zzso 28 zzso 4 zzso 16 zzso zzso both P zzso In obese normal subjects, intact zzso was lower both in the zzso state and after zzso zzso OC versus zzso 22 zzso 3 zzso 33 zzso zzso zzso and 16 zzso 2 zzso 23 zzso zzso zzso both P zzso 

Increased zzso demand from zzso insulin resistance cannot explain elevated intact zzso and disproportionate zzso in type 2 zzso This zzso may be an integrated part of pancreatic zzso dysfunction in this zzso
