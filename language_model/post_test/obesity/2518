Exercise intensity may affect the selective loss of abdominal zzso zzso 

This study showed whether zzso exercise intensity affects the loss of abdominal fat and improvement in cardiovascular disease risk factors under conditions of equal energy deficit in women with abdominal zzso 

This was a zzso trial in 112 overweight and obese zzso mass index (in zzso zzso waist zzso zzso zzso women assigned to one of three zzso interventions of equal energy zzso calorie restriction zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso exercise zzso + zzso or zzso plus zzso exercise zzso + zzso The diet was a controlled program of zzso during which meals were provided at individual calorie levels zzso 400 zzso Exercise (3 zzso involved treadmill walking at an intensity of zzso zzso or zzso zzso of heart rate zzso The primary outcome was abdominal visceral fat zzso 

Average weight loss for the 95 women who completed the study was zzso zzso zzso zzso and was not significantly different across zzso zzso oxygen zzso ( zzso increased more in the zzso + zzso group than in either of the other groups zzso zzso The zzso group lost relatively more lean mass than did either exercise group zzso zzso All groups showed similar decreases in abdominal visceral fat zzso zzso P zzso for zzso However, changes in visceral fat were zzso related to increases in zzso zzso zzso Changes in zzso zzso zzso or insulin, and zzso zzso and insulin areas during the zzso test were similar across treatment zzso 

With a similar amount of total weight loss, lean mass is zzso but there is not a preferential loss of abdominal fat when either zzso or zzso zzso exercise is performed during caloric zzso This trial was registered at zzso zzso zzso
