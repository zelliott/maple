To describe and compare the body mass index zzso zzso profile of zzso children in zzso Bay, New Zealand in 1989 and zzso To subsequently determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity at the two time points using international zzso 

As part of asthma prevalence studies in zzso Bay data on zzso weight and ethnicity were collected from zzso school children in 1989, and zzso children in 2000 who reached 12 years of age during the year of zzso 

In the total study population the geometric mean zzso increased from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in 1989 to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in 2000, a relative increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso relative increases were found for males zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso females zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso European zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Pacific Island children zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In 2000 zzso of zzso Bay children were classified as overweight and zzso as zzso The risk of being overweight in 2000 was zzso times greater than the risk in 1989, and the risk of being obese was zzso times greater, with these problems more pronounced among zzso zzso zzso obese zzso and Pacific Island zzso zzso obese zzso than European zzso zzso obese zzso zzso However, the risk of being overweight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in 2000 compared to 1989 was greater among European zzso 

Higher percentages of zzso and Pacific Island children are overweight or obese compared to European, but in all ethnic groups there has been a statistically significant increase in mean zzso over an 11-year zzso This increase reflects the trend observed in other developed countries and zzso childhood obesity as a major health problem in New zzso
