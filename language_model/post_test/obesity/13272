zzso zzso of the zzso zzso system has proven clinical efficacy in zzso of various origins, including diabetic zzso We tested the effects of the dual zzso of both zzso converting zzso and neutral zzso by the zzso inhibitor zzso in an animal model of Type 2 diabetic zzso 

We treated 56 obese zzso diabetic fatty zzso zzso rats aged zzso with either zzso ( zzso or the zzso inhibitor zzso in four different doses (each zzso 3, 10, 30, or 60 zzso in zzso We used 11 zzso zzso rats which received zzso and served as zzso lean zzso zzso zzso ratio was assessed as a marker of zzso at baseline (age zzso and after 10 weeks of chronic zzso 

All obese animals had established diabetes zzso that was not influenced by zzso zzso stable in all dose zzso There was massive zzso in the zzso zzso rats zzso zzso zzso vs minimal zzso in lean zzso that was decreased by zzso in a dose dependent manner zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the 3, 10, 30, and 60 zzso groups, zzso all treatment groups zzso vs zzso 

zzso ameliorates zzso in zzso diabetic fatty rats with established diabetes zzso zzso zzso represents an effective novel therapeutic principle for intervention in Type 2 diabetic zzso independent of zzso zzso
