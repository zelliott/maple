It has been proposed that zzso and insulin through central effects are involved in the regulation of energy balance and body zzso Whether circulating zzso or insulin levels predict subsequent changes in body weight is, however, not zzso We examined plasma zzso and insulin at 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of age in zzso mice given a normal diet zzso zzso zzso or a high-fat diet zzso fat on a caloric zzso zzso zzso zzso Plasma zzso levels increased by age and correlated with body weight in the entire material zzso zzso zzso P zzso Also plasma insulin increased by high-fat diet and correlated across all age periods with body weight zzso zzso zzso P zzso In mice, given normal diet, plasma zzso or insulin did not correlate to subsequent changes in body weight at any of the time points zzso However, in mice given the high-fat diet, plasma zzso at 6 zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and 9 months of age zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso as well as plasma insulin at 6 zzso zzso - zzso P zzso zzso and 9 months zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso correlated zzso to the change in body weight during the subsequent zzso zzso zzso both zzso and insulin are negative zzso for future weight gain in high-fat fed zzso This suggests that when the regulation of body weight is challenged by a high-fat diet, zzso and insulin act to restrain or prevent future weight zzso This in turn may suggest that impairment of these (probably zzso actions of zzso and insulin might zzso excessive increase in body weight under such zzso
