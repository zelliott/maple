To document the prevalence of overweight or obesity concurrent with zzso in rural low-income Mexican children and to identify demographic and zzso characteristics that could help identify families at risk of having an zzso and stunted young child in this zzso 

zzso analysis of the nutritional status of very young children, using primary data from a rural community-based survey conducted in zzso zzso obesity and zzso were documented along with several zzso household and community zzso 

zzso areas of rural zzso 

zzso children zzso aged zzso zzso 

The combined prevalence of overweight and obesity was equal to or greater than zzso in all children, as was the prevalence of zzso The prevalence of concurrent overweight or obesity and zzso was approximately zzso in zzso children, and over zzso in indigenous children zzso zzso A zzso zzso analysis revealed that the factors associated with zzso zzso and zzso were lower zzso status zzso lower maternal age, education, intelligence zzso and perceived social status, shorter maternal zzso and larger household zzso Among only stunted children, the risk of also being overweight or obese was associated with younger maternal age zzso risk ratios zzso zzso zzso lower maternal perceived social status zzso zzso zzso and maternal obesity zzso zzso zzso or overweight zzso zzso zzso 

These analyses highlight that concurrent overweight or obesity and zzso is an important public health issue in low-income areas of rural Mexico beginning in early zzso Even within this impoverished population, children living in households with low relative zzso are the most zzso 

Financial support for this research was provided by the National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development, the zzso International Center at zzso the John D and Catherine T MacArthur Foundation zzso Network on zzso zzso and zzso and the Mexican zzso
