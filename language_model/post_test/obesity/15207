zzso zzso mass index zzso is associated with worse outcomes after colon cancer zzso Most research, however, has been performed outside zzso centers of zzso We sought to determine the relationship between obesity and outcomes after colon cancer zzso when performed at a center with zzso zzso 

We performed a retrospective review of 245 consecutive patients undergoing zzso zzso for zzso at a single institution from 2008 to zzso Body mass index, major and minor zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso yield, type of zzso and operating times were zzso 

zzso rates, operative times, and zzso zzso counts were all similar between the two weight zzso zzso patients had similar tumor characteristics at all stages when compared with zzso zzso On zzso analysis, obesity did not correlate with tumor size, tumor zzso or presence of zzso or zzso zzso 

We conclude that obese patients undergoing colon cancer zzso at a zzso center of excellence have similar tumor characteristics and equivalent short-term outcomes as do zzso zzso
