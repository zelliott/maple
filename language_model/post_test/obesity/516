zzso and zzso zzso disease zzso are increasingly important health zzso Previous studies of the relationship between obesity and zzso focus on indirect manifestations of zzso Little is known about the association between obesity and zzso measured zzso acid zzso The aim of this study is to zzso the relationship between body mass index zzso and zzso zzso pH zzso and the status of the lower zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso 

Data of zzso patients zzso male, mean age 51 zzso zzso referred for assessment of zzso symptoms between 1998 and 2008 were zzso These subjects underwent zzso pH monitoring off medication and zzso zzso The relationship of zzso to zzso zzso pH zzso and LES status was studied using linear zzso and multiple zzso zzso The difference of each acid exposure component was also assessed among four zzso zzso zzso normal weight, overweight, and zzso using analysis of zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso was positively correlated with increasing zzso acid exposure zzso R zzso zzso zzso for the composite pH zzso The prevalence of a defective LES was higher in patients with higher zzso zzso zzso Compared to patients with normal weight, obese patients are more than twice as likely to have a mechanically defective LES zzso zzso zzso 

An increase in body mass index is associated with an increase in zzso acid exposure, whether zzso was examined as a continuous or as a zzso zzso zzso of the variation in zzso acid exposure may be attributable to variation in zzso
