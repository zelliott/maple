Girls with anorexia zzso zzso demonstrate severe depletion of body zzso The aim of this study was to determine an accurate zzso measurement for clinical assessment of fat depletion in girls with AN in connection with body composition measured by zzso X-ray zzso zzso 

In 64 female AN patients aged zzso years zzso zzso zzso zzso body mass index zzso zzso thickness zzso abdominal and zzso zzso arm and thigh zzso fat mass zzso and lean mass were determined and compared with the data of 71 zzso 

Girls with AN had lower zzso traits and were fat depleted compared to controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso using zzso all p zzso zzso thigh circumference and zzso zzso thickness demonstrated a very similar zzso value for zzso assessment of body zzso Based on the zzso characteristic curve analysis and the determination of the positive zzso value, thigh circumference appeared the most specific and sensitive zzso predictor of zzso discriminating between AN and healthy girls, with the zzso value reaching zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso value of zzso zzso accuracy was zzso sensitivity zzso and specificity zzso 

zzso circumference strongly zzso with zzso and demonstrates a slight clinical advantage over zzso This simple measurement might also serve as a useful predictor of body zzso in adolescent girls with AN and should therefore be further evaluated in independent cohort zzso
