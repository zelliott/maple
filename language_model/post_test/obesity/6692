zzso protein 27 gene zzso isolated by screening for genes specifically expressed in fully differentiated mouse zzso belongs to the cell zzso DNA fragmentation factor, alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso is induced in not only zzso tissue but also the liver of zzso mice, and it promotes the development of fatty zzso The zzso gene is expressed in a fatty zzso manner and is not detected in the normal mouse zzso zzso expression is directly regulated by the induction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso fatty zzso In the present study, expression of zzso zzso zzso was determined in zzso fatty liver zzso The zzso gene was markedly induced in the zzso or zzso and zzso zzso zzso fatty liver, but it was not elevated in zzso fatty zzso Interestingly, the induction of zzso zzso due to the zzso diet was independent of zzso levels and completely absent in the liver from zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso expression in the liver depends on the zzso of fatty zzso
