We predicted the future economic burden attributable to high rates of current adolescent zzso 

We constructed models to simulate the costs of excess obesity and associated diabetes and coronary heart disease zzso among adults aged zzso years in the US population in 2020 to zzso 

Current adolescent overweight is projected to result in 161 million zzso complicated by zzso diabetes, or zzso and zzso million zzso zzso The cumulative excess attributable total costs are estimated at zzso zzso zzso billion because of lost productivity from earlier death or morbidity and $46 billion from direct medical zzso Currently available therapies for hypertension, zzso and diabetes, used according to guidelines, if applied in the future, would result in modest reductions in excess mortality zzso to zzso million zzso zzso but increase total excess costs by another $7 billion zzso to zzso billion zzso 

Current adolescent overweight will likely lead to large future economic and health zzso especially lost productivity from premature death and zzso Application of currently available medical treatments will not greatly reduce these future burdens of increased adult zzso
