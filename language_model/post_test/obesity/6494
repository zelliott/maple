In this review we discuss the biological significance of zzso originally discovered as a component of a putative zzso of zzso insulin action, where as a putative mediator, it zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso rate limiting zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Early studies demonstrated a linear relationship between its decreased urinary zzso and the degree of insulin resistance zzso When tissue zzso including muscle, of type 2 diabetic subjects were zzso they demonstrated a more general body zzso Administration of zzso to diabetic rats, zzso monkeys and now to humans accelerated zzso disposal and zzso insulin zzso A zzso in zzso in the zzso of zzso to zzso in insulin sensitive zzso of the zzso type 2 diabetic rat has been zzso Thus, administered zzso may act to bypass a defective normal zzso of zzso to zzso associated with insulin resistance and act to at least partially restore insulin sensitivity and zzso zzso
