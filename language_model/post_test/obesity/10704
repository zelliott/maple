This study was undertaken to determine whether a reduction in body weight in laboratory mice by regimens that appear to delay the rate of aging zzso food restriction and chronic zzso zzso zzso or a production of obesity by the presence of the zzso zzso gene or by gold zzso zzso alter the rate of binding of zzso zzso to mouse skin zzso acid zzso We have found that treating zzso mice with food containing zzso zzso for 10 weeks or reducing the food intake of zzso treated mice to zzso of ad zzso fed animals significantly reduces the amount of zzso bound to mouse skin DNA 12 hours after a topical application of the zzso zzso zzso mice made obese by a gold zzso zzso and zzso mice with the zzso zzso bind significantly increased amounts of zzso to skin DNA when compared to their zzso zzso
