zzso resistance is a characteristic feature of obesity and type 2 diabetes zzso but it is also present in up to zzso of healthy zzso zzso The molecular mechanisms causing insulin resistance are not yet fully zzso Recently, zzso of several potential zzso of the insulin zzso zzso activity, a key step in insulin zzso has been described in zzso subjects zzso zzso is expressed in many zzso and zzso insulin signaling either at the level of the insulin zzso or downstream at a zzso zzso An elevated zzso content in insulin target zzso may play an important role in the development of insulin resistance in obesity and type 2 diabetes zzso A zzso in zzso has been demonstrated to be associated with insulin zzso This was a DNA zzso in zzso 4 that causes an zzso acid change from zzso to zzso at zzso 121 zzso zzso zzso zzso might zzso independently of other well established risk factors for early zzso zzso Testing for the zzso zzso zzso might be valuable in patients with a family history of zzso vascular disease and zzso zzso There is growing evidence that genetic factors play an important role in the development of diabetic zzso zzso Efforts to identify these factors rely primarily on the candidate gene zzso candidate genes for insulin resistance may be considered candidates for zzso as zzso In a zzso analysis according to duration of diabetes, the risk of zzso zzso zzso disease zzso for carriers of the Q zzso was zzso times that for zzso The cellular mechanisms for the insulin resistance of pregnancy and zzso diabetes zzso zzso are zzso Women with zzso have an increased zzso content and excessive zzso of zzso zzso in muscle insulin zzso The zzso defects in insulin signaling may contribute to the zzso of zzso and the increased risk for type 2 diabetes later in zzso Although widely zzso the true cause of insulin resistance in zzso patients is not entirely zzso zzso During the last decade it was found that zzso zzso therapy, used for correction of anemia in patients with end stage zzso failure, ameliorates insulin zzso An increased zzso zzso activity over control was found in zzso zzso A two-month EPO therapy significantly decreased zzso activity to the control values, suggesting that an effect on zzso expression could be implicated in the zzso of insulin resistance in zzso patients treated with zzso Current investigations zzso that therapeutic modification of zzso expression would be of great benefit for zzso type 2 zzso zzso a zzso oral zzso agent, was shown to affect insulin resistance by decreasing zzso activity of zzso zzso molecules in obese type 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso drugs are a class of compounds that improve insulin action in zzso Treatment of patients with zzso seems to have a beneficial effect on most, if not all, components of zzso zzso zzso have also been used in the treatment of zzso human zzso states, and have demonstrated an improvement in insulin zzso Although much remains to be learned about zzso gamma zzso and zzso action, the advent of zzso zzso agents has an enormous impact on our understanding of insulin zzso The great potential of insulin resistance therapy illuminated by the zzso will continue to catalyze research in this area directed toward the discovery of new zzso agents that work through other zzso
