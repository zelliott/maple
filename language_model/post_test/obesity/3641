We investigated whether the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein 1 gene zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso are associated with type 2 diabetes zzso zzso and features of zzso syndrome in a zzso zzso 

Both zzso were zzso in zzso zzso patients and zzso zzso zzso The combined effect of both zzso on zzso and zzso zzso parameters was analyzed according to a zzso inheritance pattern, by which at least three minor zzso from two zzso are necessary for trait zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were not associated with zzso zzso Patients carrying the zzso zzso zzso had higher zzso plasma zzso and zzso zzso cholesterol zzso than patients with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso was also associated with protection against zzso zzso mass index zzso 25 zzso odds ratio zzso zzso Interestingly, prevalence of zzso was lower among carriers of at least three minor zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso than among patients with fewer than three minor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with at least three minor zzso also had higher zzso levels zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso may have a combined effect in the zzso of zzso and zzso levels in type 2 diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso
