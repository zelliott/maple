Despite the reported benefits, weight loss is not always advised for older adults because some zzso studies have associated weight loss with increased zzso However, the distinction between intentional and unintentional weight loss is difficult to make in an zzso context, so the effect of intentional weight loss on mortality may be clarified in the setting of a zzso controlled zzso 

The objective was to determine the effect of intentional weight loss on zzso mortality by using follow-up data from a zzso trial completed in 1995 that included a weight-loss zzso 

The Trial of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso used a 2 zzso 2 zzso design to determine the effect of dietary weight loss, sodium zzso or both on blood pressure control in zzso overweight or obese older adults being treated for hypertension zzso zzso zzso age: 66 zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso mortality was zzso by using the Social Security Index and National Death Index through zzso 

The mortality rate of those who were randomly assigned to the weight-loss intervention zzso zzso zzso mean weight zzso zzso zzso did not differ significantly from that of those who were not randomly assigned to this group zzso zzso zzso mean weight zzso zzso zzso The adjusted zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso dietary weight loss was not significantly associated with increased zzso mortality over 12 y of follow-up in older overweight or obese zzso Additional studies are needed to confirm and extend our findings to older age zzso This trial is registered at zzso as zzso
