zzso zzso into zzso tissue is a hallmark of zzso We recently reported two zzso distinct zzso of zzso tissue zzso zzso based on the surface expression of the zzso zzso and responsiveness to treatment with a zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso and zzso zzso zzso express zzso zzso This study zzso and functionally characterizes zzso and zzso zzso zzso during zzso Changes in gene expression were also examined on sorted zzso and zzso zzso by quantitative real-time zzso We show that while zzso zzso predominate in zzso tissue of lean mice, obesity causes zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso in zzso tissue is associated with impaired zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso express greater amounts of zzso zzso II, zzso and zzso and produce more zzso zzso and zzso than zzso zzso Gene expression analyses of the sorted populations revealed that only the zzso population produced zzso whereas the zzso zzso expressed greater amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso gamma in immune cells favors expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso marker expression in zzso zzso Thus, zzso gamma is zzso expressed in zzso versus zzso zzso zzso and its zzso favors a predominance of zzso markers in zzso
