zzso obesity is a rare zzso of zzso zzso for which zzso and treatment remain zzso In zzso zzso zzso damage causes zzso zzso zzso and insulin zzso Reduction of insulin zzso in humans may zzso weight zzso 

Eight children with intractable obesity after therapy for leukemia or brain tumors underwent oral zzso tolerance testing zzso with simultaneous insulin levels before and after treatment with zzso for 6 zzso 

In comparison with a zzso zzso observation period, patients exhibited weight loss zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and decrease in body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso Recall calorie count decreased during the 6 months of treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso zzso intolerance in 5 of 8 patients initially and in 2 of 7 at study end, whereas insulin response was decreased (281 zzso 47 zzso vs 114 zzso 35 zzso P zzso zzso weight change correlated with changes in insulin response zzso zzso zzso P zzso and changes in plasma zzso r zzso zzso P zzso 

Patients with zzso obesity demonstrate excessive insulin zzso zzso administration promoted weight loss, which correlated with reduction in insulin zzso on zzso and with reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tolerance improved in several patients while they were receiving zzso These results suggest that zzso of insulin zzso may be an effective therapeutic strategy in this zzso
