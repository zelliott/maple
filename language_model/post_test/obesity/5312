To detect the zzso expression of white zzso tissue in zzso obese zzso versus zzso zzso rats, and to investigate the relationship of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and Western zzso were used to detect gene zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso and induced to differentiation using zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso insulin, and 1 zzso zzso Oil red O zzso was applied to detect the degree of zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso was zzso in zzso rats and zzso in DR zzso However, the expression levels varied greatly within the zzso zzso of the zzso genes from zzso and DR rats revealed a zzso zzso zzso zzso within the signal zzso in one DR zzso The zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso Local experiments and Western zzso with zzso zzso fusion proteins identified both zzso and wild type proteins in the zzso and zzso into the culture zzso Computer predictions using the zzso and zzso programs revealed four putative zzso sites and a possible zzso zzso motif within the rat zzso zzso 

zzso differentiation may be inhibited by the zzso precursor zzso or by the zzso zzso zzso zzso
