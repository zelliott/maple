zzso zzso is the zzso modification of proteins by zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso of zzso fatty zzso The most widely studied zzso product of zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso zzso dysfunction and has demonstrated zzso toward key proteins involved in cellular zzso However, zzso is only one of many zzso zzso products and the zzso zzso profile in zzso tissue has not been zzso To further understand the role of zzso stress in zzso zzso dysfunction, a novel zzso method was developed to evaluate zzso products of zzso zzso and applied to the analysis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were the most abundant zzso present in zzso zzso In high zzso zzso and zzso mice the levels of zzso zzso products were increased zzso to zzso in zzso zzso unchanged in brown zzso but decreased in subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue of high zzso mice also exhibited increased levels of proteins modified by zzso and zzso whereas subcutaneous zzso tissue levels of these modifications were zzso High fat feeding of zzso mice resulted in decreased expression of a number of genes linked to zzso biology selectively in zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso treatment of zzso zzso resulted in decreased expression of zzso zzso and zzso while zzso the expression of zzso These results suggest that inflammatory zzso selectively zzso zzso gene expression in visceral zzso zzso resulting in elevated zzso zzso and increased protein zzso
