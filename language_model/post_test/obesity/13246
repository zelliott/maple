The impact of obesity on survival in zzso zzso disease zzso patients as related to dialysis zzso zzso a direct comparison of zzso with zzso zzso has not been assessed adjusting for differences in medication use, zzso or zzso years, or accounting for changes in dialysis zzso 

We performed a retrospective cohort study of the United States Renal Data System zzso zzso zzso and zzso Wave II Study zzso patients who started dialysis in 1996, and were followed until October 31 zzso Cox zzso analysis was used to model adjusted hazard ratios zzso for mortality for categories of body mass index zzso both as zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Because such a large proportion of zzso dialysis patients changed to zzso during the study period zzso a sensitivity analysis was performed calculating survival time both zzso and not zzso on the date of change from zzso dialysis to zzso 

There were zzso zzso and zzso zzso dialysis zzso Among zzso patients, zzso survival for patients with zzso or zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso for lower zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso Among zzso dialysis patients, zzso survival for patients with zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso for lower zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso In adjusted analysis, zzso or zzso 30 zzso was associated with improved survival in zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso dialysis patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were not different on zzso of change from zzso dialysis to zzso 

We conclude that any survival advantage associated with obesity among chronic dialysis patients is significantly less likely for zzso dialysis patients, compared to zzso zzso
