What is the role of myostatin and its relationship with zzso zzso and zzso levels in women with zzso zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso The myostatin level was positively correlated to the risk of abdominal zzso but zzso associated with circulating levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in women with zzso 

zzso is a well-known negative regulator of skeletal muscle and is involved in zzso however, little is known about the role of myostatin in women with zzso In this study, we found that the myostatin level was positively related to the risk of abdominal zzso but zzso related to the circulating levels of zzso and zzso in women with zzso Such a relationship might imply a potential regulatory role of zzso and zzso in the metabolism of skeletal muscle in women with zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso 

A total of 239 zzso consecutive women with zzso and 38 healthy volunteer women without zzso were enrolled and studied in a zzso medical zzso 

zzso level was higher in women with zzso than those without zzso zzso and zzso zzso but were not significantly different between non-obese women with and without zzso after considering the effect of obesity zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis in women revealed that only the presence of zzso zzso zzso total testosterone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels were left in the final model and were significantly related to the myostatin level after considering all the explanatory zzso By using zzso zzso zzso analysis, the total testosterone levels zzso zzso were zzso but the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso related to myostatin levels in women with zzso after adjustment for age, zzso zzso insulin sensitivity index and hormonal zzso The high myostatin level was associated with the increased risk of abdominal obesity after further adjusting the zzso and zzso levels in women with zzso 

This study is a zzso zzso design, and therefore, cannot answer the zzso relationship among the zzso zzso and myostatin zzso The small sample size and non-obese control group may also limit the application of the conclusion of the present study to general population other than women with zzso In addition, lack of data regarding muscle mass is another limitation in this study that prevents clarification of the relationship between myostatin, lean mass and obesity and therefore restricts the clinical application of the zzso 

Future studies to investigate the efficacy of exercise and lifestyle modification in treating women with zzso should consider the myostatin, zzso and zzso levels as well as the effect of muscle mass and zzso
