zzso were conducted to determine if zzso zzso specifically binds to liver zzso or interferes in the binding of other steroid zzso zzso were isolated from obese, female zzso rats that were treated with and without zzso zzso in their diets for 2 zzso The zzso were incubated with either zzso zzso or zzso The zzso isolated from the incubated cells from either control or zzso rats had no binding with zzso but had the expected binding with zzso and zzso Furthermore, increasing zzso of cold, zzso zzso in the incubation media with zzso or zzso failed to have any effect on the binding of either of these steroid hormones to the zzso These results suggest that zzso treatment does not exert its effects on cellular metabolism through a zzso mechanism like other steroid hormones or by interfering in the expression of steroid hormones such as zzso and zzso
