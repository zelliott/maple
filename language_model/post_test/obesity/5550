zzso are well-known regulators of energy turnover and zzso tissue zzso We investigated the effect of zzso on the expression of the human zzso protein 2 zzso 2) zzso which has been implicated in energy zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was administered orally daily for 7 zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso 2 zzso was measured before and after zzso 

Eight healthy female subjects (age zzso zzso body mass index zzso zzso 

No differences in body weight, zzso ratio or zzso of zzso or zzso were found after zzso treatment, as compared to zzso values under these zzso In contrast, plasma insulin levels were significantly increased by zzso administration, zzso before vs zzso zzso zzso after treatment zzso Furthermore, using zzso the zzso 2 zzso level in abdominal subcutaneous zzso tissue was found to be zzso by half zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso No difference in expression levels of the reference gene zzso was observed before, as compared to after zzso exposure zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These data suggest that zzso may play a role in the regulation of zzso 2 zzso expression in human zzso tissue in zzso
