Our goal was to determine whether differences in zzso E zzso zzso influenced the response to dietary changes aimed at reducing serum cholesterol levels, especially increases in zzso zzso E zzso and zzso were determined in 43 men and 24 women who had previously taken part in parallel zzso zzso dietary studies involving either wheat zzso or zzso zzso supplementation at a level of zzso g zzso zzso zzso blood zzso zzso had been made at the beginning and end of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cholesterol levels across both zzso and wheat zzso diets were significantly different depending on the E zzso zzso zzso zzso The LDL cholesterol level reduction for zzso carriers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was greater than that for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 38; P zzso zzso and zzso carriers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 16; P zzso zzso Only the change in dietary fiber on the zzso zzso diet was related significantly to the decrease in LDL cholesterol levels zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No such relationship was seen on the wheat zzso diet zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso appear to be more responsive than zzso to a dietary change involving increased fiber zzso The data also support a zzso advantage of zzso zzso over wheat zzso Current dietary recommendations to reduce serum zzso levels may vary in effectiveness depending on distribution of zzso E zzso in the different populations zzso
