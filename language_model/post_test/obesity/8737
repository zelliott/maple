To explore the zzso role of zzso in zzso hypertension, we examined cardiovascular zzso of transgenic skinny mice whose elevated plasma zzso zzso are comparable to those seen in obese zzso We also studied genetically obese zzso mice with zzso in which zzso zzso system is antagonized by zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso blood pressure zzso and urinary zzso zzso are elevated in transgenic skinny mice relative to zzso zzso The zzso zzso in transgenic skinny mice is abolished by zzso zzso or zzso zzso at doses that do not affect zzso in zzso zzso Central administration of an zzso hormone zzso causes a marked increase in cumulative food intake but no significant changes in zzso The obese zzso mice develop zzso zzso with increased urinary zzso zzso relative to control zzso zzso After a zzso caloric zzso zzso zzso is reversed in zzso zzso with the zzso zzso in parallel with a reduction in plasma zzso zzso but is sustained in transgenic mice zzso zzso with the zzso zzso which remain zzso This study demonstrates zzso zzso in transgenic skinny mice and obese zzso mice that are both zzso thereby suggesting the zzso role of zzso in some forms of zzso zzso
