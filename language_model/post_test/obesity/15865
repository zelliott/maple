Increased fat zzso in skeletal muscle has been associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be used to measure muscle density, which reflects the zzso content of skeletal muscle such that greater fat zzso in skeletal muscle is associated with lower muscle zzso The relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors to fat zzso in skeletal muscle has not been zzso zzso our aim is to determine genetic and environmental contributions to measures of skeletal muscle zzso and describe their associations with type 2 diabetes in zzso families of African zzso 

zzso zzso zzso measures of skeletal muscle density were obtained for the calf in zzso individuals zzso zzso mean 43 zzso belonging to eight large, zzso Afro-Caribbean families zzso family size 51 zzso zzso relative zzso 

The proportion of zzso in muscle density due to additive genetic effects zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso and significant zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso explained zzso of the total zzso variation in muscle zzso Muscle density was lower zzso zzso in 62 diabetics zzso zzso than in 339 zzso zzso zzso and remained significant after adjusting for age, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso or age, zzso and waist circumference zzso zzso zzso 

Our results provide new evidence that zzso zzso deposition in skeletal muscle is a zzso trait and is associated with diabetes, independent of overall and central obesity in families of African zzso zzso screens and candidate gene studies are warranted to identify the genetic factors contributing to zzso deposition of skeletal muscle zzso
