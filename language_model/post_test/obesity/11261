We examined the association of plasma zzso at rest, a marker of zzso capacity, with incident cardiovascular outcomes in zzso participants in the zzso zzso in Communities zzso Study visit 4 zzso We used Cox zzso models to estimate hazard ratios of incident coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, and zzso mortality by zzso of plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso During a median follow-up time of zzso years, there were zzso coronary heart disease cases, zzso stroke cases, 820 heart failure cases, and zzso zzso A significant graded relation between zzso level and cardiovascular events was observed in the demographically adjusted model (all P for zzso After further adjustment for traditional and other potential zzso the association remained significant for heart failure zzso zzso zzso hazard ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mortality zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso for these zzso but not for coronary heart disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and stroke zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results for heart failure were robust across multiple subgroups, after further adjustment for zzso zzso zzso zzso and after exclusion of participants with incident heart failure within 3 zzso The independent associations of plasma zzso with heart failure and zzso mortality suggest an important role for low resting zzso zzso
