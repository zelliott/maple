zzso syndrome zzso and zzso syndrome zzso are caused by the loss of imprinted gene expression from zzso zzso zzso gene expression in the region is regulated by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso The zzso is a positive regulatory element required for zzso zzso of a number of zzso expressed zzso The function of the zzso appears to be to suppress zzso function on the maternal zzso through a zzso imprint acquired during female zzso Here we have placed the entire mouse locus under the control of a human zzso by targeted replacement of the mouse zzso with the equivalent human zzso zzso inheritance of the human zzso demonstrates for the first time that a positive regulatory element in the zzso has zzso These mice show zzso zzso and growth zzso zzso not previously attributed directly to the affected zzso Following maternal zzso the human zzso is able to acquire a zzso imprint in mouse zzso suggesting that acquisition of the zzso imprint is zzso However, the imprint is lost in zzso cells, showing that maintenance has zzso This maternal zzso zzso results in expression of maternal zzso and repression of zzso in zzso providing evidence that zzso is regulated by its zzso and creating the first reported mouse model for AS zzso zzso
