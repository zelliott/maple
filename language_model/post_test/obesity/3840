zzso zzso zzso catalyze the zzso of zzso fatty acids from saturated fatty zzso Four zzso genes have been identified in mice and three in human (including one zzso Among the four mouse zzso zzso zzso is predominantly expressed in liver and zzso zzso Mice zzso for the zzso gene have reduced zzso increased energy expenditure and altered zzso zzso To further evaluate the specific role of zzso zzso and the potential to achieve similar desirable zzso changes in adult obese mice, zzso short hairpin interfering zzso zzso was used to acutely knock down zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso reductions in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity were zzso sustained up to 2 zzso zzso zzso content of neutral lipids and robust lowering of zzso zzso indexes, but increased content of liver zzso were observed with zzso zzso Increased total plasma cholesterol levels were also zzso No significant changes in body weight were zzso zzso levels of several zzso and zzso zzso genes were not significantly altered by short term zzso reduction, but zzso expression was zzso Our results demonstrate that significant changes to both zzso and systemic zzso profiles can be achieved through specific zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso mouse zzso However, zzso zzso zzso does not result in significant changes in body weight in the short zzso
