In order to evaluate the difference in the energy cost of zzso cycling between normal weight zzso and obese zzso zzso nine zzso (age zzso zzso SE, zzso zzso zzso and nine zzso (age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso healthy young women were studied during a graded bicycle zzso test at 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 zzso At rest and at all zzso oxygen zzso zzso was higher in zzso than in zzso women zzso zzso test, zzso as well as respiratory zzso during all exercise levels zzso while similar values of heart rate, pulmonary ventilation and breathing efficiency were found between the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso threshold were higher in zzso women, and they also explained the higher oxygen pulse observed during zzso exercise, but no difference was found when the values were adjusted for zzso zzso While net mechanical efficiency zzso was significantly lower in zzso zzso zzso delta ME was similar in both groups, indicating no substantial zzso of muscle intrinsic efficiency in zzso but suggesting that the increased mass of body segments involved in cycling movements may be chiefly responsible for the higher energy cost of this type of zzso zzso of the actual zzso presently measured with that predicted by available cycle zzso equations at the different zzso indicated inaccuracy of various degrees ranging from zzso to zzso It is concluded that the lower mechanical efficiency displayed by obese women in cycling has to be taken into account when prescribing exercise through methods predicting the zzso zzso
