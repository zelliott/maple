zzso 1 zzso an zzso factor and transforming growth factor zzso activity regulator, has been recently recognized as an zzso that zzso with zzso inflammation and insulin resistance zzso In the present study, zzso zzso of rats that were fed a zzso or a high-fat diet zzso for zzso were isolated and incubated zzso in low zzso or high zzso zzso zzso in the presence or absence of zzso zzso zzso fed the zzso diet showed an established obesity zzso zzso zzso levels and zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso from zzso rats were higher than those from zzso zzso from zzso animals presented an insulin resistance state, as suggested by the lower zzso zzso zzso as compared to zzso zzso expression in culture was higher in zzso from obese animals at zzso but when the zzso were treated with zzso these expression levels dropped zzso Later at zzso zzso expression was lower in zzso from zzso rats, and no effects of the other treatments were zzso Surprisingly, the zzso levels of this protein at zzso were increased significantly by the zzso treatment in both types of zzso although they were even higher in zzso from obese zzso Finally, cell viability was significantly reduced by zzso treatment in both types of zzso In zzso zzso zzso was modulated in an in zzso model of zzso zzso The difference between expression and zzso patterns suggests a zzso zzso The present study confirms that zzso is closely associated with zzso zzso
