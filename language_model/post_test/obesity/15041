The objective of present project was to improve the dissolution profile of zzso by developing floating zzso beads using various zzso zzso like zzso zzso and zzso zzso The floating beads were prepared by a simple zzso gelatin method using calcium zzso as gas generating zzso The developed beads were characterized by zzso transform infrared zzso analysis, differential scanning zzso X-ray zzso analysis and scanning electron zzso zzso The prepared beads showed good in zzso zzso which was dependent on the concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that the developed beads were zzso in shape and had particle size in the range of 730 to zzso zzso The incorporation efficiency was found to be in the range of zzso to zzso The cumulative percent drug release from the beads after 10 h dissolution study at pH zzso and pH zzso was in the range of 33 to zzso and 82 to zzso zzso The concentration of the gas generating agent was found to influence the release zzso The mechanism of drug release was zzso diffusion with zzso The in zzso zzso zzso study in high fat diet induced diabetic zzso mice demonstrated significant zzso zzso zzso effect over a period of 12 h and 24 zzso respectively, with zzso and zzso zzso A significant zzso & zzso reduction in zzso and zzso blood zzso levels, reduction in zzso plasma insulin level and a significant improvement in zzso tolerance were observed in animals treated with zzso The developed beads were suitable carriers for improving the systemic zzso of zzso and maintaining reduced blood zzso zzso
