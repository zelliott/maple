To clarify the mechanism by which insulin resistance develops in zzso zzso fatty rats zzso and lean litter zzso zzso were temporally subjected to oral zzso tolerance tests zzso at 6 and 15 weeks of zzso 

As candidates for zzso factors of insulin resistance, plasma zzso free fatty acids zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso levels were zzso 

There was no difference in the body weight between the two groups at 6 weeks of age, but zzso were significantly heavier than zzso at 15 weeks of zzso At 6 weeks of age, blood zzso levels and area under the curve of zzso zzso during zzso were not significantly different between the two groups, while plasma insulin levels and area under the curve of insulin zzso in the zzso group were significantly higher than those in the zzso zzso At 15 weeks of age, the blood zzso levels and zzso as well as plasma insulin levels and zzso in the zzso group during zzso were significantly higher than those in the zzso zzso The ratio of zzso insulin to zzso in the zzso group was significantly higher than that in the zzso group at 6 and 15 weeks of zzso zzso and portal plasma zzso and zzso levels were significantly higher in zzso than zzso both at 6 weeks and 15 weeks of zzso Meanwhile, at 6 weeks, plasma zzso levels and expression of zzso protein in subcutaneous and visceral fat zzso were similar in both zzso however at 15 weeks, these were significantly higher in the zzso group than the zzso zzso 

These results suggest that zzso rather than zzso may play an important role in early events involved in the development of insulin resistance and zzso zzso insulin resistance together with zzso in the later zzso
