The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that body mass index zzso and waist circumference zzso associate to a comparable degree with insulin resistance and zzso risk factors in South zzso 

We measured blood pressure and zzso zzso insulin, zzso zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso and calculated the zzso model assessment of insulin resistance zzso in a community-based sample of zzso zzso South zzso 

zzso and zzso were highly correlated in both genders zzso zzso zzso and zzso The relationship between zzso and values of blood pressure, zzso insulin, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was comparable to that between zzso and these zzso zzso insulin and zzso correlated most strongly with zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

These results show that zzso and zzso associate to a comparable degree with estimates of insulin resistance and related zzso abnormalities in South zzso
