We measured whole body and regional zzso and zzso tissue blood flow zzso sensitivity to zzso in 8 lean zzso mass index zzso 21 zzso 1 zzso and 10 upper body obese zzso women zzso 38 zzso 1 zzso waist zzso zzso All subjects underwent a zzso zzso infusion zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plus pancreatic hormonal zzso Whole body free fatty acid zzso and zzso rates of appearance zzso in plasma were determined by stable isotope zzso zzso zzso and zzso subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso activity was determined by zzso and zzso clearance zzso zzso whole body zzso zzso and zzso zzso were both greater zzso zzso in obese zzso zzso 31 and 220 zzso 12 zzso zzso compared with lean subjects zzso zzso 44 and 167 zzso 21 zzso zzso zzso infusion significantly increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso in lean (71 zzso 21 and 122 zzso zzso zzso P zzso but not obese subjects (7 zzso 6 and 39 zzso zzso zzso P zzso not zzso In addition, zzso and zzso sensitivity to zzso was blunted in abdominal but not zzso subcutaneous zzso tissue of obese compared with lean zzso We conclude that whole body zzso sensitivity to zzso is blunted in women with zzso because of decreased sensitivity in upper body but not lower body subcutaneous zzso zzso
