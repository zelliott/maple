zzso trait zzso zzso with large effects on zzso and growth have been identified previously on pig zzso 4 in an zzso between the European wild pig and Large White domestic zzso Two zzso zzso zzso for the actual zzso region, were zzso to a Large White zzso and two zzso zzso zzso were in turn zzso to Large zzso zzso One of the zzso was zzso for an intact wild zzso zzso region, whereas the other carried a zzso zzso A total of 85 zzso animals were zzso zzso zzso included daily weight gain, zzso zzso of fat depth at 70 and 90 zzso and several carcass zzso zzso segregation was deduced using 15 markers previously assigned to zzso zzso zzso significant zzso effects were observed on all zzso traits and on the length of the zzso A small but significant effect on growth was also zzso The results confirm the presence of one or more zzso on zzso 4 affecting zzso and zzso There was a good agreement between the estimates of zzso effects in the zzso and zzso zzso The results from the zzso zzso family allowed us to map the major zzso effect zzso to the zzso zzso We propose that this confirmed zzso with a major effect on zzso is designated zzso
