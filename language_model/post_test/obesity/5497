zzso is a zzso agent reducing serum zzso of zzso and zzso fatty zzso zzso may reduce zzso synthesis by decreasing zzso fatty acid availability from zzso but this effect has yet to be demonstrated in zzso zzso after zzso treatment was examined in subcutaneous zzso tissue of severely obese subjects with associated zzso zzso 

The zzso technique was performed in abdominal subcutaneous zzso tissue of eight zzso zzso After oral treatment with zzso zzso concentration was determined as an index of zzso zzso Blood flow was assessed by the ethanol escape zzso The rates of release of zzso from human zzso tissue zzso zzso by zzso were also investigated in the presence of zzso Eight zzso and zzso subjects served as a control zzso 

Under zzso treatment, zzso zzso release decreased in subcutaneous zzso zzso whereas no effect was observed on blood zzso In zzso zzso tissue zzso showed no zzso 

In the present study zzso zzso zzso from zzso tissue was inhibited by zzso The zzso action of the agent may diminish elevated plasma zzso of free fatty acids in subjects with severe zzso
