zzso fatty liver disease zzso has been linked to cardiovascular disease zzso but it is largely unknown if such a relationship between zzso and zzso risk relates to severity of liver disease or if it is zzso We aimed to study the severity of zzso in a well characterized non-obese population and to compare this to prevalence of zzso risk factors and zzso risk zzso 

This study included zzso zzso Based on the presence or absence of zzso on ultrasound and serum zzso zzso zzso subjects were divided into controls, an increased serum zzso group without zzso and a group with presumed zzso fatty liver disease zzso which included a zzso alone group and a group with presumed zzso zzso zzso with zzso and an elevated zzso 

The odds ratio for 10-year risk by total zzso risk zzso or zzso was zzso times higher in NASH zzso The prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, elevated zzso and zzso syndrome were all increased up to zzso over controls, independent of age, zzso smoking and exercise zzso zzso zzso risk was significantly greater in NASH than in either zzso or raised zzso zzso 

Young, non-obese subjects with zzso are at significantly increased zzso risk, especially those with zzso As well as specific therapy for liver disease, a diagnosis of zzso should lead to targeted risk assessment and risk factor zzso
