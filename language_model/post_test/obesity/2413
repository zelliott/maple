zzso in both insulin zzso and action have been documented in patients with zzso diabetes zzso zzso leading to the suggestion that both zzso zzso and insulin resistance in zzso are secondary to insulin zzso In order to test this hypothesis, insulin zzso zzso insulin response to oral zzso and insulin action zzso zzso were determined in 25 patients with zzso The results documented relationships between incremental plasma insulin response to zzso and degree of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso These data indicate that differences in insulin zzso response accounted for only approximately zzso of the zzso in zzso plasma zzso level and zzso of the zzso in insulin resistance in zzso Thus, differences in zzso response contribute modestly to magnitude of zzso and not at all to variations in insulin resistance in zzso permitting rejection of the hypothesis that insulin resistance is secondary to insulin zzso
