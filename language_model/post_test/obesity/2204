This study aimed to determine whether 2 zzso of high-intensity intermittent training zzso altered inflammatory status in plasma and zzso tissue in overweight and obese zzso Twelve participants zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso body mass zzso zzso zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso undertook six zzso sessions over 2 zzso zzso blood and subcutaneous abdominal zzso tissue samples were collected and insulin sensitivity determined, zzso and zzso zzso proteins were zzso in plasma and zzso zzso There was a significant decrease in soluble zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in plasma zzso Plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso and insulin sensitivity did not zzso In zzso zzso zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased zzso zzso zzso while zzso tended to decrease zzso zzso zzso with no change in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not zzso in zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso were then resolved using one-dimensional gel zzso and major changes in the zzso tissue zzso as a consequence of zzso were zzso This zzso approach identified significant reductions in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso as a response to zzso The present investigation suggests 2 zzso of zzso is sufficient to induce beneficial zzso in the resting inflammatory profile and zzso tissue zzso of an overweight and obese male zzso
