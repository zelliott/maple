The relative contribution of zzso zzso and adrenaline zzso in the control of zzso zzso in subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso during exercise was evaluated in men treated with a zzso zzso zzso Eight lean and eight obese young men matched for age and physical fitness performed 60 zzso exercise bouts at 50% of their zzso oxygen consumption on two zzso zzso during zzso infusion of zzso and zzso during zzso zzso zzso and local blood flow changes in zzso were evaluated using in zzso zzso zzso of zzso suppressed plasma insulin and growth hormone levels at rest and during zzso It blocked the zzso increase in plasma adrenaline while that of zzso was zzso Plasma zzso peptides zzso level was higher at rest and during exercise under zzso infusion in lean zzso Under zzso no difference was found in the zzso increase in zzso between the probe zzso with zzso solution alone and that with zzso (an zzso zzso zzso in lean subjects while a greater increase in zzso was observed in the obese zzso Under zzso zzso infusion in the probe containing zzso reduced by about zzso zzso zzso zzso this effect was fully suppressed under zzso infusion while zzso was still elevated and zzso zzso zzso maintained in both lean and obese zzso In conclusion, blockade of zzso receptors during exercise performed during infusion of zzso zzso the zzso rise in adrenaline but not that of zzso does not alter the zzso zzso This suggests that adrenaline is the main zzso agent contributing to zzso zzso in zzso Moreover, it is the combined action of insulin suppression and zzso release which explains the zzso response which remains under zzso after full local blockade of fat cell zzso zzso For the moment, it is unknown if results apply specifically to zzso and exercise only or if conclusions could be extended to all forms of zzso in zzso
