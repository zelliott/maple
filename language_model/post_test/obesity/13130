zzso is an important risk factor for heart failure in both women and zzso zzso between right and left zzso contraction and relaxation has been identified as an independent predictor of heart zzso We examined the relationship of zzso synchronization abnormalities with the concentration of zzso zzso in obese women at baseline and after sustained weight zzso 

zzso parameters of zzso zzso circulating levels of tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso were investigated in 67 healthy, zzso obese women and 40 zzso zzso zzso 

Compared with zzso women, obese women had increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, obese women had a higher zzso performance index zzso zzso and lower zzso zzso flow zzso zzso pulmonary zzso flow analysis zzso zzso and ejection fraction zzso zzso indicating zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were related to zzso indexes of obesity and to zzso parameters of zzso zzso After 1 year of a multidisciplinary program of weight reduction, obese women lost at least zzso of their original zzso This was associated with reduction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and with improvement of zzso parameters of zzso zzso which correlated with changes in zzso particularly visceral zzso 

In obese women, zzso zzso zzso with body fat, possibly through inappropriate zzso of zzso Weight loss represents a safe method for zzso the inflammatory state and zzso cardiac function in obese zzso
