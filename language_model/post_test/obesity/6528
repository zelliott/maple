The kinetic pattern of subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso zzso following zzso zzso was investigated in zzso with a zzso technique in zzso zzso zzso zzso and obese subjects zzso zzso zzso before and after a zzso fast zzso zzso zzso A dialysis probe (4 zzso zzso zzso was implanted zzso and was continuously zzso (5 zzso The tissue zzso zzso concentration was determined in zzso samples before and during a period of 180 zzso after a zzso oral zzso zzso A comparison was made between the tissue zzso zzso and the zzso blood zzso zzso In all study groups the increase in subcutaneous tissue zzso zzso following zzso zzso paralleled that in blood, with a zzso of up to 15 zzso In the zzso subjects the maximum relative increase in abdominal zzso tissue zzso zzso was zzso higher zzso less than zzso than the corresponding blood zzso level, and the total relative zzso level zzso under curve, zzso in abdominal fat was zzso zzso less than zzso higher than in zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso subcutaneous tissue zzso and blood zzso levels were zzso In the obese patients before the zzso period the maximum relative zzso level in abdominal fat was almost twice as high as in blood zzso less than zzso and the total zzso level zzso was 50% higher than the blood zzso zzso zzso less than zzso After the fast, on the other hand, almost identical relative dynamics of abdominal subcutaneous tissue and blood zzso levels were zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
