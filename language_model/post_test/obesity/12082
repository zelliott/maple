zzso and associated zzso are major global health zzso zzso growth zzso signaling has been implicated in various zzso zzso including zzso insulin zzso and pancreatic zzso zzso However, the systemic effects of zzso zzso on zzso and insulin resistance in zzso remain zzso This study investigated the effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso and its contribution to the development of obesity and type 2 zzso 

We compared various zzso profiles of zzso and zzso zzso We also determined the mechanism by which zzso zzso affects the expression of genes involved in zzso and zzso Mice were then challenged with a high-fat diet to study the impact of zzso zzso on the development of obesity and insulin zzso 

zzso mice exhibited diminished zzso with improved zzso tolerance and insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso increased zzso protein zzso zzso protein 10 interaction and exerted a differential regulation on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso gene expression profiling revealed an altered expression of genes involved in zzso zzso zzso and fatty acid zzso indicative of altered zzso zzso Despite reduced physical activity with no modification in food zzso these zzso mice were resistant to obesity and insulin resistance induced by a high-fat zzso 

zzso is a multifaceted regulator in zzso physiology and the zzso of obesity and type 2 diabetes, suggesting that zzso may be a potential target for the treatment of obesity and its associated zzso
