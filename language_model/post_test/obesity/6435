zzso zzso patients are characterized by an zzso insulin zzso Whether obese patients also have decreased zzso insulin sensitivity remains zzso 

To estimate their zzso insulin sensitivity, we measured the rate of zzso insulin infusion required to maintain mildly elevated zzso in obese patients with type 2 diabetes, obese zzso patients, and lean control subjects during constant infusions of zzso and zzso zzso replacement zzso To account for differences in insulin zzso among the three groups of subjects, an additional protocol was also performed in healthy lean subjects with higher insulin infusion rates and zzso zzso zzso 

The insulin infusion rate required to maintain zzso at zzso zzso was increased zzso in obese patients with type 2 diabetes and zzso in obese zzso zzso The net zzso zzso production zzso with zzso and total zzso output zzso with zzso were approximately zzso lower in the patients than in the lean zzso Net zzso zzso production and total zzso output were both markedly increased in both groups of obese patients compared with lean control subjects during zzso 

Our data indicate that both obese zzso and obese type 2 diabetic patients have a blunted zzso action of insulin on zzso production, indicating zzso and zzso insulin zzso
