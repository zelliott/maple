The aim of the present study was to evaluate the expression profile of genes potentially related to zzso complications of obesity in the whole zzso tissue and isolated zzso from subcutaneous zzso and visceral zzso tissue zzso from 12 zzso obese women and 12 lean zzso zzso zzso chain reaction was used for expression analysis of 41 genes of interest and two zzso zzso We found increased expression of specific zzso and zzso genes and reduced expression of specific zzso and insulin signaling zzso genes in obese relative to lean women with no preferable zzso in SAT or zzso zzso The gene expression significantly differed between zzso and zzso tissue but both contributed to the zzso profile in zzso We conclude that both SAT and zzso exhibit zzso in the expression of specific genes possibly contributing to zzso and insulin resistance state and consequently to zzso complications of zzso
