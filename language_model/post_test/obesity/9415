To investigate whether an exercise intervention zzso with or without zzso use, is effective at reducing chronic zzso inflammation in those with impaired zzso zzso 

Using baseline and 12-month data from the zzso zzso Education and Physical zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso controlled trial, we investigated whether the zzso or the standard version of the zzso zzso is associated with reduced chronic zzso zzso Outcomes included zzso zzso zzso zzso and 2 h zzso zzso values and zzso measured ambulatory zzso 

zzso participants zzso zzso mean age, 65 years; body mass index, zzso zzso zzso zzso ) were included, of which 26 were in the control group and 24 were in each intervention zzso At 12 months there was an increase in ambulatory activity of zzso and 1849 zzso in the standard and zzso group, respectively, compared with control zzso however, there was no significant change in markers of chronic zzso zzso Across the pooled study sample, change in ambulatory activity was significantly correlated with change in zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso after adjustment for group, age, sex, ethnicity, aspirin and zzso medication, baseline body mass index and change in body mass zzso Change in zzso was also significantly correlated with change in 2 h zzso after adjustment for the same variables zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

This study failed to show reductions in markers of chronic zzso inflammation following an intervention that promoted modest increases in ambulatory zzso however, across the study sample, increased ambulatory activity was associated with reduced zzso independent of zzso
