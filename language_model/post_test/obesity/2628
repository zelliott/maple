The zzso and prevalence of type 2 diabetes zzso continue to escalate at an unprecedented rate in the United States, particularly among populations with high rates of zzso The impact of zzso on bone mass, zzso architecture, strength, and resistance to fracture has yet to be zzso characterized because of the complex and zzso nature of this zzso This study zzso zzso mature male diabetic rats of the commonly used zzso diabetic fatty zzso and zzso diabetic zzso zzso strains as surrogate models to assess zzso in bone attributable to zzso zzso After the animals were zzso bone data were collected using zzso X-ray zzso peripheral quantitative zzso and zzso imaging zzso and via zzso zzso or zzso mechanical testing zzso zzso and zzso diabetic rats exhibited lower bone mineral zzso which coincided with declines in structural strength and increased fragility at the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso body in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was compromised in both diabetic zzso zzso and zzso diabetic rats exhibited additional zzso zzso to bone material properties at the zzso Because the zzso origin of the zzso state that develops in the zzso rat strain is highly relevant to zzso diabetes, it is a particularly attractive novel model for future zzso zzso
