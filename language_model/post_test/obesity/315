zzso is a significant predictor of bone zzso zzso factors are thought to play a role in the mechanisms controlling the association of body weight and fat mass with bone zzso Very recently, the zzso hormone zzso has also been implicated in bone zzso In this study we examined the associations of circulating zzso and zzso zzso zzso with measures of bone in a group of obese children and adolescents as well as in a group of healthy control zzso We also determined whether the associations were independent of body zzso zzso age, zzso zzso stage, and zzso zzso insulin and zzso growth factor zzso zzso 

We performed a prospective zzso study of 100 obese children zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and 100 zzso lean healthy zzso zzso insulin, zzso IGF-1, zzso and total zzso were measured by zzso zzso zzso values were calculated as total zzso minus zzso zzso Whole body zzso and zzso spine zzso zzso and zzso as well as body composition were assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was estimated using the formula of zzso zzso while zzso zzso data were expressed as zzso 

zzso linear zzso analysis was performed for individual groups, with age, zzso zzso stage, weight, zzso body composition zzso and fat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin, and IGF-1, entered into the zzso In healthy children, zzso zzso was a significant and independent negative predictor of zzso zzso and zzso zzso while lean mass was positively associated significantly with these bone zzso In contrast, in obese children, a positive significant association was observed between zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso along with lean mass, and to a lesser degree, with fat zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso were not significant zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in obese as well as control zzso 

The results of this investigation indicate that the influence of the two distinct zzso of zzso on zzso is zzso by specific body composition parameters in obese and control healthy zzso
