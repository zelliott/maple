Type 2 diabetes zzso zzso is a complex zzso and zzso zzso Recently, several zzso association studies zzso have identified many novel zzso zzso for zzso and indicated that there are common genetic causes contributing to the zzso to zzso in multiple populations zzso In addition, clinical and zzso studies have indicated that obesity is a major risk factor for zzso However, the prevalence of obesity varies among the various ethnic zzso We aimed to determine the combined effects of these zzso zzso and zzso for development of zzso in the zzso 

Single zzso zzso zzso in or near 17 zzso zzso for zzso identified through zzso in Caucasian and Asian zzso were zzso in zzso cases with zzso and zzso control zzso 

We confirmed that the cumulative number of risk zzso based on 17 zzso zzso for zzso was an important risk factor in the development of zzso in Japanese population zzso although the effect of each risk zzso was relatively zzso In addition, the significant association between an increased number of risk zzso and an increased risk of zzso was observed in the non-obese group zzso for zzso but not in the zzso group zzso for zzso 

Our findings indicate that there is an zzso zzso of zzso between zzso and non-obese zzso
