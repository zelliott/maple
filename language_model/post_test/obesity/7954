The purpose of this study was to evaluate available variables of a long-term weight maintenance study to investigate possible factors zzso to weight regain after a period of weight zzso 

The zzso Weight Maintenance Study is an ongoing zzso study of healthy men and women (29 men and 62 zzso 18 to 65 years of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A variety of parameters were measured before and after a zzso diet and after a follow-up of at least 2 zzso 

Mean weight loss was zzso zzso zzso zzso and percent weight regain was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regain was zzso associated with an increase in dietary restraint zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso weight regain was zzso correlated with baseline resting zzso rate zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and baseline fat mass zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and positively correlated with the magnitude of change in body weight zzso expressed as maximum zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso In addition, zzso of zzso was positively correlated with the frequency of dieting zzso zzso zzso p zzso 

The best zzso for weight maintenance after weight loss were an increase in dietary restraint during weight loss, a high baseline resting zzso rate, a relatively high baseline fat mass favoring a zzso zzso effect during weight loss, a rather stable zzso and a low frequency of zzso zzso zzso maintenance after zzso loss seems to be a zzso issue, including mechanisms that regulate an zzso energy zzso body zzso and eating behavior in such a way that energy zzso is zzso
