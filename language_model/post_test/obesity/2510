zzso of zzso function has received less attention than that of the zzso although normal zzso function is required for optimal overall cardiac zzso zzso is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and zzso In this study, we compared left zzso functions in obese adults zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso with those in non-obese adults zzso zzso zzso by color tissue zzso zzso There were 37 adults with zzso zzso zzso age 36 zzso 11 zzso and 26 adults with zzso zzso zzso zzso age 35 zzso 5 zzso Mean zzso was 38 zzso 6 zzso in the obese group whereas that was 24 zzso 2 zzso in the non-obese zzso For color tissue zzso imaging, sample volumes were placed on the mid left atrium at the zzso zzso inferior, and anterior zzso The peak zzso strain zzso peak zzso strain rate zzso peak early zzso zzso zzso peak late zzso zzso zzso peak zzso tissue zzso zzso peak early zzso TV zzso and peak late zzso TV zzso values were zzso For each zzso values in three consecutive cardiac cycles were measured and then zzso To simplify the analysis, the values at each wall were combined and averaged to obtain mean zzso All left zzso zzso function parameters zzso zzso zzso were similar between the zzso In addition, there was no statistically significant difference at left zzso zzso function parameters zzso zzso zzso zzso We could not find any significant difference between obese and non-obese adults at left zzso functions assessed by color tissue zzso zzso
