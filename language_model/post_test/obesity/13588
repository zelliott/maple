Recent zzso research has confirmed that zzso factors are associated with increased risk of developing coronary heart disease zzso a major cause of death and disability zzso This association is probably zzso by changes in health risk behaviors and neuroendocrine and zzso functions that affect zzso zzso zzso and cardiovascular functions that are the zzso agents in zzso zzso over time as well as the zzso of acute disease zzso Recent developments in zzso have now made it possible to begin the process of identifying specific genetic zzso that act either independently or via moderation of the impact of zzso to stressful environmental situations to increase the expression of these zzso zzso factors and the accompanying behavioral and zzso changes that lead to zzso It will be possible ultimately to use the knowledge emerging from research on gene zzso environment interactions that affect expression of zzso risk factors, health risk behaviors, and biological changes inside the body to speed the development of a new field of prospective zzso field where instead of spending the majority of health care resources on the treatment of chronic diseases at the end of life, it will be possible to allocate more resources to zzso test, and implement earlier in the disease process zzso proactive interventions that target persons at high zzso
