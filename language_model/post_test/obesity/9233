In the late zzso period of gastric bypass surgery, we observe that many patients weight zzso The objective of this study was to determine the excess weight loss variation at 24 and zzso zzso A secondary objective was to evaluate in the period zzso the association of weight regain with red meat zzso age, zzso and body mass zzso 

Historical cohort study includes only patients who had completed a follow-up of up to zzso zzso zzso zzso The variation in percent excess weight loss was determined at 24 and zzso zzso to assess any association with the variables zzso body mass index zzso zzso age, and red meat zzso 

The excess weight loss varied about zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso This weight regain showed a significant association with the variable age, where the patients who regained the least weight tended to be younger than those who regained more zzso When comparing the intolerance level to red meat with weight zzso we observed that the lower the intolerance the greater the weight loss, although this finding did not reach statistical significance zzso 

Weight regain did not compromise therapeutic zzso Less weight regain was seen in younger zzso Patients with lower intolerance to red meat tended to show less weight zzso Further studies are needed to zzso the role of protein intake in weight regain in patients submitted to gastric zzso No association between weight regain and zzso zzso or gender was zzso
