Although obesity is more prevalent in Hispanics than zzso whites in the United States, little is known about the genetic zzso of the related traits in this zzso To identify genetic zzso influencing obesity in zzso Hispanics, we performed a zzso linkage scan in zzso subjects from 100 Caribbean Hispanic families on six zzso quantitative zzso body mass index zzso body weight, waist zzso zzso ratio, abdominal and average zzso zzso thickness after adjusting for significant demographic and lifestyle zzso We then carried out an association analysis of the linkage zzso and the zzso gene in an independent community-based Hispanic zzso (N zzso zzso zzso Caribbean zzso from the Northern Manhattan zzso Evidence of linkage was strongest on zzso with zzso zzso score of zzso zzso zzso zzso for body zzso zzso linkage evidence of zzso zzso was also identified on zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for abdominal zzso thickness zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and weight zzso zzso zzso and zzso for average zzso zzso thickness zzso zzso zzso In the association analysis of zzso single zzso zzso zzso under zzso unit down regions of our linkage zzso on zzso zzso and zzso as well as in the zzso zzso we found that two zzso zzso and zzso on zzso and one zzso zzso zzso were significantly associated with zzso or body weight after adjustment for multiple zzso Our results suggest that in addition to zzso multiple genetic zzso particularly those on zzso region, may contribute to the variations in zzso quantitative traits in Caribbean zzso
