An increase in zzso may contribute to the development of insulin resistance in zzso zzso Increased zzso in women has been found to be associated with the development of type 2 zzso In addition, obesity and central obesity are associated with greater zzso zzso sensitivity, zzso and body composition were characterized in 34 zzso zzso women age 72 zzso 1 years zzso zzso zzso to test the hypothesis that zzso is a predictor of insulin sensitivity independent of measures of zzso zzso was measured using levels of sex zzso zzso zzso total and free testosterone, zzso zzso zzso zzso and free zzso index zzso zzso sensitivity zzso was determined from a frequently sampled intravenous zzso tolerance zzso Body composition measures included body mass index zzso and dual energy zzso zzso zzso of total and central fat zzso zzso was found to be associated with total fat mass zzso zzso zzso P zzso central fat mass zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso levels zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso levels were zzso correlated with central fat mass zzso zzso zzso P zzso Using multiple regression, zzso and central fat mass were the only significant independent zzso of zzso accounting for 50% of its zzso zzso zzso P zzso total fat mass, zzso total and free testosterone, zzso zzso and zzso did not enter the zzso We conclude that there is a significant association between insulin sensitivity and zzso in zzso women that is independent of zzso zzso to decrease zzso may therefore be useful in improving insulin sensitivity in zzso zzso
