This study examined whether the presence of hypertension, an zzso condition, zzso the zzso in insulin action observed in obesity and type II diabetes zzso zzso metabolism in the zzso state and in response to insulin was zzso by using the zzso insulin (20 zzso zzso zzso clamp in combination with zzso infusion and indirect zzso in 20 obese zzso subjects (10 zzso and 10 zzso 26 type II diabetic subjects (13 zzso and 13 zzso and 11 normal zzso zzso The two groups of obese subjects and the two groups of diabetic subjects were matched for sex, age, race, body mass index, and fat zzso Both in the zzso state and during insulin infusion, zzso disposal rates zzso zzso and zzso were similar in obese subjects with or without zzso Compared with control subjects, both groups of obese subjects were markedly insulin zzso Similarly, type II diabetic individuals, whether zzso or zzso were equally insulin zzso The severity of insulin resistance was nearly identical in obese and diabetic zzso In diabetic subjects, the zzso effect of insulin on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was blunted compared with normal zzso In obese subjects the ability of insulin to inhibit zzso and zzso zzso was zzso However, hypertension did not alter the zzso effects of insulin on zzso zzso production, plasma free fatty acid levels, or zzso zzso in either obese or type II diabetic zzso These results indicate that hypertension does not zzso a greater severity of insulin resistance than that already is present in obesity and type II diabetes zzso
