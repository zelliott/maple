zzso of zzso beverages may cause excessive weight zzso We aimed to assess the effect on weight gain of an intervention that included the provision of zzso beverages at home for overweight and obese zzso 

We randomly assigned 224 overweight and obese adolescents who regularly consumed zzso beverages to experimental and control zzso The experimental group received a zzso intervention designed to decrease consumption of zzso zzso with follow-up for an additional year without zzso We hypothesized that the experimental group would gain weight at a slower rate than the control zzso 

zzso rates were zzso at 1 year and zzso at 2 zzso zzso consumption of zzso beverages was similar at baseline in the experimental and control groups zzso servings per zzso declined to nearly 0 in the experimental group at 1 year, and remained lower in the experimental group than in the control group at 2 zzso The primary outcome, the change in mean zzso index zzso the weight in zzso divided by the square of the height in zzso at 2 years, did not differ significantly between the two groups zzso in experimental group minus change in control group, zzso zzso At 1 year, however, there were significant zzso differences for changes in zzso zzso zzso and weight zzso zzso zzso We found evidence of effect modification according to ethnic group at 1 year zzso and 2 years zzso In a zzso analysis according to ethnic group, among Hispanic participants (27 in the experimental group and 19 in the control group), there was a significant zzso difference in the change in zzso at 1 year zzso zzso and 2 years zzso zzso but not among zzso participants zzso at years 1 and zzso The change in body fat as a percentage of total weight did not differ significantly between groups at 2 years zzso zzso There were no adverse events related to study zzso 

Among overweight and obese zzso the increase in zzso was smaller in the experimental group than in the control group after a zzso intervention designed to reduce consumption of zzso zzso but not at the zzso follow-up (the zzso primary zzso zzso by the National Institute of Diabetes and zzso and zzso Diseases and zzso zzso number, zzso
