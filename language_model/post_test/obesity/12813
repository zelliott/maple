Human obesity has a significant genetic component which contributes to the risk for this zzso The application of molecular genetic techniques to identify these genes using a variety of approaches, including information from animal models, will help clarify the role of specific genes in the zzso of human zzso Identification of these genetic mechanisms is likely to lead to new approaches, both zzso and zzso for the prevention and treatment of this zzso
