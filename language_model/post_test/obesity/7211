The importance of zzso tissue in health as well as disease has been demonstrated in several studies recently, and it has become appropriate to use the term zzso zzso when referring to zzso tissue as a zzso The obesity epidemic, with a marked increase in the zzso of the zzso syndrome leading to diabetes type 2 as well as cardiovascular zzso has zzso considerable interest in zzso tissue zzso Moreover, several studies in different species have shown that limited energy intake is associated with less zzso improved zzso of health and a marked increase in zzso In addition, there is convincing evidence that an optimal amount of zzso tissue is essential for many body functions such as immune response, reproduction and bone zzso Some nutrients and their zzso are important as energy sources as well as zzso for many zzso factors expressed in zzso zzso including all zzso nutrients both directly and indirectly as well as cholesterol, vitamin E and vitamin zzso In particular, fatty acids can be effectively taken up by zzso and they can interact with several zzso factors crucial for growth, development and zzso response, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso and 2 and liver X receptors alpha and zzso Moreover, zzso is also readily taken up and stored as fatty acids via zzso in zzso It is known that some zzso signals released as proteins from zzso tissue zzso are important for normal as well as pathological responses to the amount of energy stored in the zzso zzso The future challenge will be to understand the function of zzso tissue in energy zzso and the interplay with nutrients in order to be able to give optimal advice for the prevention and treatment of zzso
