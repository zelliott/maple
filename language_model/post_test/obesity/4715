We sought to zzso novel genes zzso by sex hormonal imbalances that induce obesity and zzso disorder in a setting of zzso zzso and zzso dominance in zzso hormone zzso (For zzso known as zzso knockout female zzso 

zzso analysis of zzso zzso tissue zzso of zzso revealed novel zzso One novel gene named zzso was selected for zzso zzso was cloned from mouse and human zzso zzso its zzso hormonal regulation and function were zzso 

Mouse zzso is richly expressed in deep visceral zzso tissue and encodes a 22 zzso zzso protein with zzso zzso to human zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso zzso Both have six zzso zzso like many zzso In obese patients, zzso is more abundant in zzso than subcutaneous zzso zzso is zzso in zzso female zzso at 5 months zzso zzso followed by steep zzso at 9 months zzso zzso when zzso progress towards the zzso zzso zzso is expressed predominantly in the zzso cell zzso In this zzso are rich in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is restored by zzso but treatment has no effect in older zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells enhances cell proliferation via zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso and zzso both zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity of the insulin zzso mediator, zzso is also zzso 

zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that is implicated in causing chronic zzso affecting cellular expansion and zzso insulin response in zzso
