zzso fatty liver disease zzso is a major zzso consequence of zzso It has been suggested that the high sensitivity zzso protein zzso is an zzso surrogate marker of severity of zzso especially development of zzso zzso zzso but this remains zzso We aimed to investigate whether associations between various features of zzso and zzso are independent of body mass index zzso in its broad range among obese zzso 

A total of zzso obese adults zzso zzso representing three zzso from France and Belgium, had information on liver zzso obtained from liver zzso and measures of zzso and zzso We investigated whether the different features of zzso and zzso were associated with zzso with and without mutual adjustments using linear zzso 

zzso and zzso were strongly zzso zzso every zzso increase in zzso the zzso level increased by zzso zzso and adjustment for zzso (including zzso did not influence the zzso We found no zzso association between NASH and zzso However, a positive association between degree of zzso and zzso was observed zzso and this effect remained significant after adjusting for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We found no significant associations between the other features of zzso and zzso 

This study indicates that it is the zzso of fat zzso in the zzso tissue and in liver zzso that leads to increased zzso levels among obese zzso Thus, zzso may be a marker of zzso but not of severity of zzso in obese zzso
