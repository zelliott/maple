The mechanisms of marked increase in plasma zzso soon after zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Although rats did not gain body weight or zzso zzso mass 24 h after the operation, the acute zzso rats exhibited substantial five- and fourfold increases in plasma zzso levels compared with zzso control rats in fed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso states, zzso Plasma insulin concentration was doubled in zzso rats compared with zzso controls in both fed and zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso of zzso gene was not increased in zzso fat pad of animals 24 h after the creation of zzso zzso However, zzso content in the fat pad was significantly increased in zzso rats compared with zzso controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso wet zzso The zzso content in zzso fat pad was highly correlated with plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso To define the effect of zzso on their zzso a small dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso body zzso was zzso administered into rats 5 days before the creation of zzso zzso Plasma insulin levels were not increased after zzso zzso in zzso zzso Plasma zzso levels were zzso in the absence of zzso but still remained twofold higher than those in their zzso counterparts zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the destruction of zzso rapidly promotes zzso production before obesity develops through an enhanced zzso process in which zzso occurring after zzso zzso plays an important zzso The present study also suggests that there are other mechanisms that rapidly zzso zzso production in zzso in zzso rats in which the target organ of this hormone has been zzso
