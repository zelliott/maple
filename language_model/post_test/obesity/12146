The present study examines the possibility that the reduced activity commonly found in obese individuals could stem from a reduced zzso responsiveness to zzso zzso to bicycle zzso exercise zzso zzso of four obese and four normal weight women were observed in a zzso zzso This resulted in decreases in exercise heart rate and oxygen consumption, indicating an improvement in mechanical efficiency and suggesting an increase in physical working zzso It also resulted in some decreases of resting oral zzso The differences in the response to exercise between the obese and the normal weight groups were small and not statistically zzso The normal weight subjects showed a trend for greater decreases in heart rate and zzso consumption during exercise, while in the obese resting oral temperature tended to be more zzso The results suggest that obesity in our subjects was not related to a zzso zzso response to physical zzso
