To investigate the effects of high-fat diet enriched with zzso oil or soybean oil on liver zzso zzso zzso stress and inflammation markers in zzso obese zzso rats and estimate the influence of following low-fat diet zzso 

Male zzso rats were fed with standard low-fat diet zzso zzso and two zzso high-fat diets enriched with zzso zzso zzso or soybean oil zzso zzso respectively for 10 zzso Then zzso rats from zzso and HS were fed either high-fat diet continuously zzso zzso or switched to low-fat diet zzso zzso for another 8 zzso zzso in control group were maintained with low-fat zzso Body fat, serum insulin level, zzso and zzso zzso deposition in liver were increased in zzso and zzso compared to control, but increased to a greater extent in zzso compared to zzso zzso of zzso stress including zzso and zzso protein expression and zzso of zzso were significantly elevated in zzso group while zzso of zzso and zzso protein expression were suppressed in both zzso and zzso Besides, inflammatory signals zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressions significantly increased in zzso compared to zzso Switching to low-fat diet reduced liver fat deposition, zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso but only decreased protein expression of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso In addition, zzso and zzso exhibited decreased zzso of zzso and increased zzso of zzso and zzso protein expression when compared with zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso oil was more deleterious in insulin resistance and zzso zzso via promoting zzso stress and inflammation responses in zzso rats, which may be attributed to the enrichment of saturated fatty zzso Low-fat diet was confirmed to be useful in recovering from impaired insulin sensitivity and liver fat deposition in this zzso
