Early zzso tends to be preceded by rapid infancy weight gain and is associated with increased childhood and adult obesity zzso As age at zzso is a zzso zzso we zzso that age at zzso in the mother may in turn predict her children's early growth and obesity zzso 

We tested associations between mother's age at zzso mother's adult body size and obesity risk, and her children's growth and obesity risk in zzso children from the UK zzso Avon zzso Study of Parents and Children zzso birth cohort who had growth and fat mass at age 9 y measured by zzso X-ray zzso A zzso of zzso children also had detailed infancy and childhood growth zzso In the mothers, earlier zzso was associated with shorter adult height (by zzso zzso increased weight zzso zzso and body mass index zzso zzso zzso all p zzso In contrast, in her children, earlier mother's zzso predicted taller height at 9 y (by zzso zzso and greater weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and fat mass index zzso zzso all p zzso Children in the earliest mother's zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were more obese than the oldest zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso p zzso adjusted for mother's education and zzso In the zzso children in the earliest zzso showed faster gains in weight zzso zzso and height zzso zzso only from birth to 2 zzso but not from 2 to 9 y zzso zzso zzso 

Earlier age at zzso may be a zzso marker of a faster growth zzso zzso by rapid weight gain and growth, particularly during zzso and leading to taller childhood zzso but likely earlier maturation and therefore shorter adult zzso This growth pattern zzso increased childhood and adult obesity zzso
