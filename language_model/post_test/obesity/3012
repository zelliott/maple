Forty-eight markedly obese patients for zzso zzso bypass were studied during spontaneous ventilation preoperatively and then zzso after 2 to 4 hours and on each of days 1 to 5 to determine the effect of the operative incision zzso versus zzso on the zzso oxygen tension difference zzso Compared with control zzso zzso there was a significant increase in zzso in all patients, beginning in the zzso recovery area and continuing through zzso zzso day zzso Comparing the mean increase in zzso zzso between the two incision groups, patients with a zzso incision had a significantly greater zzso smaller than zzso increase in zzso on control zzso value by day zzso The authors conclude that in markedly obese subjects, the zzso incision can be expected to result in both more profound and more prolonged reduction in zzso zzso zzso
