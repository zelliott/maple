High zzso zzso potential zzso is associated with zzso and zzso zzso Better knowledge of environmental influences on zzso may help to prevent zzso 

zzso rats exhibited high zzso values that decreased in low-fat diet and remained elevated on high-fat zzso In adult rats, high-fat zzso zzso increase was independent of zzso factors, zzso and insulin resistance and zzso associated with zzso fatty acid zzso Switching from high-fat diet to low-fat diet reversed the zzso zzso with a slower kinetic than the zzso of zzso In humans, zzso was independent of body weight whereas it was zzso associated with nutritional markers such as the percentage of energy provided by zzso the zzso ratio, circulating zzso compounds, and omega-3 zzso fatty zzso A recommended zzso healthy diet with reduced energy density, including zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso Changes in zzso were not associated with body weight, insulin sensitivity, or zzso factor variations, but correlated zzso with plasma zzso acid, a nutritional status sensitive fatty acid, and compounds reflecting vegetable zzso 

Diet plays a pivotal role in regulating zzso independently of obesity and insulin zzso Global nutritional recommendations could be useful in primary prevention of zzso zzso
