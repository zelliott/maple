zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso possesses zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Paradoxically, obesity is associated with declined plasma zzso zzso however, the underlying mechanisms remain zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso involvement of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso mice exposed to a high-fat diet zzso were employed as animal obesity zzso Both zzso zzso and mouse primary zzso were used in the in zzso zzso 

zzso and plasma zzso decline induced by prolonged zzso exposure were associated with suppressed zzso zzso in zzso zzso In zzso specific zzso of zzso zzso decreased zzso and zzso zzso levels, whereas zzso gene expression was increased, suggesting that zzso zzso may promote zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso accelerated zzso protein degradation, which was prevented by zzso a potent zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso activity was zzso associated with zzso zzso protein zzso zzso long-term zzso zzso in mice increased zzso zzso levels in the zzso fat zzso 

zzso tissue zzso activity can zzso regulate zzso gene expression and protein abundance and its suppression in obesity may play a zzso role in zzso plasma zzso zzso
