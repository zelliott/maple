Studies examining the zzso origins hypothesis suggest that small birth size may be a marker of zzso adaptations that zzso future propensity to adult zzso We explore the hypothesis that birth size may relate to fat distribution in childhood and that fat distribution may be a link between birth size and adult zzso 

To investigate the relationship between birth size and abdominal fat, blood pressure, zzso insulin and zzso ratio in zzso zzso 

zzso study, based on a birth cohort of consecutive zzso zzso 

Two hundred and zzso zzso zzso healthy, 7- and zzso zzso 

Body composition and abdominal fat was measured by dual energy X-ray zzso zzso zzso and insulin profiles were measured after an overnight fast and an automated zzso monitor was used for blood pressure zzso 

There was a negative association between abdominal fat and birth weight zzso score across a range of normal birth weights zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and a positive association with weight zzso score at zzso y zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso Children who were born with the lowest weight zzso score and had the greatest weight zzso score at zzso y had significantly more zzso abdominal fat, as a percentage of total fat zzso than those who had the highest birth weight zzso score and the lowest weight zzso score at zzso y zzso Similar results were seen if head zzso but not zzso index, was used as an indicator of birth zzso Increased abdominal fat was associated with higher total zzso cholesterol, higher zzso concentration and increased zzso blood zzso 

Birth weight independently predicted abdominal zzso Children with the highest amount of abdominal fat were those who tended to be born lighter and gained weight zzso Increased abdominal fat was associated with precursor risk factors for zzso heart zzso
