zzso are small zzso zzso that play important regulatory roles in a variety of biological zzso including complex zzso zzso such as energy and zzso zzso which have been studied in the context of diabetes and zzso Some particular zzso have recently been demonstrated to abundantly and zzso exist in serum and to be potentially zzso The aim of this profiling study was to characterize the expression of zzso in serum samples of obese, zzso diabetic and obese diabetic individuals to determine whether zzso expression was zzso in these serum samples and to identify whether any observed deregulation was specific to either obesity or diabetes or obesity with zzso 

Thirteen patients with type 2 diabetes, 20 obese patients, 16 obese patients with type 2 diabetes and 20 healthy controls were selected for this zzso zzso zzso panels were employed to screen serum levels of zzso zzso in pooled samples from these four zzso We compared the levels of circulating zzso between serum pools of each zzso Individual validation of the twelve zzso selected as promising zzso was carried out using zzso 

Three serum zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to have potential as zzso zzso in zzso Use of zzso or zzso provides a powerful zzso tool for distinguishing obese patients from normal healthy controls, diabetic patients, and obese diabetic zzso In addition, the combination of zzso and zzso can distinguish diabetic from obese diabetic zzso 

This study is the first to show a panel of serum zzso for zzso and compare them with zzso identified in serum for diabetes and obesity with zzso Our results support the use of some zzso extracted from serum samples as potential zzso tools for obesity and type 2 zzso
