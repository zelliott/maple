It has been suggested that zzso changes might zzso changes in plasma zzso fatty acids and other obesity zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to evaluate changes in zzso and zzso plasma levels of zzso zzso fatty zzso and tumor necrosis zzso in zzso obese children and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso children of zzso age zzso obese, zzso 23 males and 11 zzso and 20 zzso zzso 11 males and 9 zzso were zzso A standard zzso zzso breakfast was given to both zzso zzso zzso included zzso and plasma zzso The following parameters were determined in plasma before and after zzso zzso insulin, and zzso at baseline and zzso and zzso fatty zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso at baseline and 1, 2, and zzso zzso plasma zzso fatty acid levels were lower in the obese versus zzso children zzso Both at baseline and zzso plasma zzso levels were lower in the obese versus zzso children zzso A trend was observed zzso that levels of tumor necrosis zzso were lower in the obese versus zzso zzso zzso was zzso associated with insulin in the obese children after adjustment for zzso and sex zzso zzso 

At zzso age, obese children show lower zzso and zzso plasma zzso levels in comparison to zzso children, whereas zzso fatty acids and tumor necrosis zzso were not yet zzso zzso zzso appears to be a good marker of early zzso zzso associated with childhood zzso
