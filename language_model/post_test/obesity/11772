zzso obesity has a key role in the zzso of prevalent and serious diseases and has been shown to be associated with an altered zzso zzso axis function, which is regulated by zzso feedback zzso via zzso zzso receptors zzso 

We examined the zzso axis function by repeated zzso samples for the assessment of zzso as well as other zzso zzso zzso and circulatory variables in middle-aged Swedish men zzso zzso zzso With the restriction zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso locus were identified and two zzso with zzso lengths of zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

The observed zzso were zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso and zzso and zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso The larger zzso zzso and zzso zzso was associated with elevated body mass index zzso p zzso zzso circumference ratio zzso zzso zzso abdominal zzso diameter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure zzso p zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso was associated with zzso after adjustment for zzso Moreover, zzso cortisol values, particularly after stimulation by a standardized lunch zzso zzso zzso to zzso were elevated in the men with the larger zzso 

These results indicate that there is an association between a deficient zzso function, defined as a poor feedback regulation of the zzso axis activity, and a zzso restriction site at the zzso gene zzso An abnormal control of zzso axis function due to genetic zzso may contribute to the zzso of abdominal zzso
