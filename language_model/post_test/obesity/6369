zzso type 2 diabetes zzso involves complex genetic and environmental interactions to trigger zzso Here, we combine variable numbers of known quantitative trait zzso zzso for obesity and diabetes contributed by New Zealand zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso strains in the form of 10 zzso zzso zzso strains zzso with zzso as the background strain, to dissect the genetic interactions zzso All 10 zzso gain significantly more weight than the zzso parental strain, but none are as obese as the zzso zzso zzso Diabetes development in these zzso at zzso ranges between 0 and zzso depending on genetic zzso zzso zzso and zzso represent a zzso increase in numbers of specific zzso zzso resulting in a zzso increase in diabetes zzso zzso recreates the zzso zzso seen in zzso zzso but with less weight zzso Similarly, zzso zzso zzso and -9 represent zzso strains with different combinations of zzso zzso zzso zzso and -5 represent obese strains that do not transit to zzso Because these obesity and diabetes syndromes reflect different collections of zzso rather than zzso zzso in the zzso or zzso zzso zzso they are extremely relevant as models for the zzso zzso syndromes in zzso
