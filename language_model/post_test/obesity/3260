Recent data suggest that current overweight and central zzso guidelines based on Western populations are not appropriate for Asian zzso The published data among Chinese are insufficient to address this zzso 

We aimed to identify zzso for body mass index zzso in zzso and waist circumference that zzso increased risk of cardiovascular disease in Chinese adults as would be consistent with overweight and central zzso 

A nationally zzso zzso sample of 15 239 Chinese adults aged zzso y was zzso 

Mean blood pressure, total cholesterol, zzso zzso and zzso values were zzso higher and mean zzso values were zzso lower with each unit increase in zzso and waist circumference in both men and zzso Both the point at which sensitivity equaled specificity and the shortest distance in the receiver operating characteristic zzso for hypertension, zzso diabetes, zzso of these risk factors suggested a zzso zzso of 24 and a waist circumference zzso of 80 zzso for both men and zzso 

Lower zzso for zzso and waist circumference are needed in the identification of Chinese patients at high risk of cardiovascular zzso
