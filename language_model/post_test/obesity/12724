The existence of insulin feedback zzso is a controversial zzso The present study adopted a novel approach to determine whether insulin feedback zzso exists in zzso during zzso zzso and if it could contribute to enhanced insulin zzso in zzso zzso plasma insulin and zzso levels were determined during a zzso state and a zzso clamp zzso zzso and following zzso of the insulin infusion under zzso zzso zzso zzso rates were derived from plasma zzso levels and individual zzso zzso using a zzso zzso Eight non-obese and nine obese men were recruited for the studies, which were performed in random zzso Men with significant variations in zzso levels during zzso were excluded from the zzso Plasma zzso levels were similar between the non-obese and obese groups during all zzso of the study, and similar plasma insulin levels were achieved in both groups during zzso zzso In obese men, zzso levels were significantly greater compared with non-obese men during zzso zzso zzso zzso However, neither the non-obese nor the obese group demonstrated significant suppression of insulin zzso rates during zzso zzso zzso the data in absolute terms or as a percent of zzso did not alter the zzso Moreover, there was no significant change between the non-obese and the obese group during the rapid onset and zzso of zzso Under zzso conditions, zzso zzso does not induce suppression of zzso insulin zzso in non-obese or obese zzso
