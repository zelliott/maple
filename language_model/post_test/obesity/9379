To examine whether waist circumference zzso and zzso index zzso can predict long-term mortality in elderly subjects with and without chronic heart failure zzso 

zzso evaluation with a 12-year zzso

One thousand three hundred zzso subjects aged 65 and older selected from the electoral rolls of zzso 

The relationship between zzso or zzso and mortality during a 12-year follow-up in 125 subjects with and zzso subjects without zzso 

zzso increased as zzso increased in elderly subjects without zzso (from zzso to zzso zzso and the increase was even greater in patients with zzso (from zzso to zzso zzso In contrast, mortality decreased as zzso increased in elderly subjects without zzso (from zzso to zzso zzso but not in those with zzso According to Cox zzso analysis, zzso protected against long-term mortality in the absence but not in the presence of zzso In the absence of zzso zzso was associated with a zzso increased risk of long-term mortality for each zzso greater zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso versus zzso increased in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso but not zzso is zzso of long-term mortality in elderly individuals with zzso and to a lesser extent in those without zzso
