zzso stimulates the clearance of free fatty acids zzso from the circulation and the synthesis of zzso zzso in zzso zzso We tested whether zzso and zzso plasma zzso zzso are increased in zzso Indians, a population with a very high prevalence of zzso but a remarkably low prevalence of zzso 

Plasma zzso of zzso zzso zzso total cholesterol zzso and insulin zzso were measured in 15 zzso Indians zzso and 15 Caucasians zzso closely matched for age, sex, and body weight zzso lean and 8 obese subjects, body mass index zzso zzso 30 zzso before and for 4 hours after a standard mixed meal zzso of daily caloric requirements, zzso zzso zzso fat, zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was positively related to percent body fat zzso energy X-ray zzso zzso zzso and to zzso and zzso independently of percent body fat zzso r zzso zzso and zzso respectively, both zzso There were no differences in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso between lean C and lean zzso In contrast, obese P had lower zzso lower zzso higher zzso and, on average, zzso lower zzso compared to obese zzso The ethnic difference in zzso remained after adjustment for zzso zzso and percent body zzso zzso decreased in response to the meal in all four groups with no differences between zzso There was a significant inverse correlation between zzso zzso and the change in zzso 60 minutes after the meal zzso zzso 

zzso Indians do not have higher plasma zzso zzso than zzso Whether other zzso in the zzso such as increased sensitivity of zzso to zzso contribute to the high prevalence of obesity and low prevalence of zzso in zzso Indians, remains to be zzso
