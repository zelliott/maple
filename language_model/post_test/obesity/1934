A randomized, zzso zzso study was conducted in 82 obese patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, to determine the zzso of zzso the relations between zzso insulin and zzso zzso levels, and the short-term effects of zzso on zzso and insulin serum zzso Increased zzso ratios zzso suggestive of insulin resistance were found in half of our zzso zzso and zzso obese patients with hypertension had comparable zzso zzso and zzso zzso and comparable blood pressure zzso zzso Thus no relations were found between zzso insulin and zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in only half of the obese subjects with hypertension, suggesting that not all obese patients with hypertension are at the same high cardiovascular zzso zzso treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso reduced zzso greater zzso reduction was observed with drugs with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso reduced zzso insulin levels, whereas zzso and zzso did zzso The former drugs reduced zzso insulin levels that were either within normal limits or in the zzso zzso None of the drug treatments produced significant increases in serum zzso zzso although some of them considerably reduced zzso insulin zzso No relations between insulin and zzso levels were observed either at baseline or at the end of the zzso zzso The zzso reduction resulting from the peripheral zzso may explain the zzso action of zzso zzso and zzso These results further emphasize the large zzso present in the zzso mechanisms operating in obesity and zzso
