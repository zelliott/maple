zzso resistance in zzso tissue in human obesity is associated with increased zzso zzso zzso activity and elevated levels of the zzso zzso common zzso zzso zzso and zzso To determine whether the improved insulin sensitivity associated with weight loss in obese subjects is accompanied by zzso changes in zzso we obtained subcutaneous zzso tissue from seven obese subjects zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso before and after a loss of zzso of body weight and again after a zzso maintenance zzso Weight loss was accompanied by an zzso decrease in overall zzso tissue zzso activity zzso zzso zzso that was further reduced to zzso of the control value zzso zzso zzso at the end of the maintenance zzso By zzso analysis, the abundance of zzso was decreased by zzso zzso zzso zzso and abundance of zzso was decreased by zzso zzso zzso after the initial weight loss, and the decreases persisted during the maintenance zzso zzso insulin sensitivity following weight loss, evident from a zzso decrease in zzso insulin levels zzso zzso was also closely correlated with the reduction in the abundance of both zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso These results support the hypothesis that zzso and zzso may be zzso involved in the zzso of insulin resistance, and may be therapeutic targets in zzso zzso
