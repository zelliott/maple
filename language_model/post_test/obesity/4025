In six young obese women zzso weight 85 zzso 3 zzso with a childhood history of zzso and in six young zzso women zzso weight 55 zzso 2 zzso the energy expenditure was measured during 24 h in a respiratory chamber with a maintenance energy zzso The next day, the zzso response to a mixed meal was investigated by using an open circuit indirect zzso hood zzso In addition, five of the same obese women were similarly studied after a mean weight loss of zzso zzso zzso of initial body zzso consecutive to an zzso zzso diet zzso modified zzso zzso in absolute terms, the total 24 h and zzso energy expenditures were found to be significantly greater in the obese zzso zzso 105 and zzso zzso 56 zzso zzso zzso than in the controls zzso zzso 61 and 1230 zzso 40 zzso zzso zzso After weight loss, both the total zzso and the zzso energy expenditures were significantly reduced zzso zzso 99 zzso h and zzso zzso 43 zzso h respectively), but both values were still greater than that of the control zzso The zzso response to the mixed meal (a liquid diet containing 17, 54, and zzso as zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and an energy level determined to cover zzso of the zzso energy expenditure zzso for 24 zzso was found to be significantly reduced in the obese as compared to controls zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso of the energy content of the load, respectively, p less than zzso After weight loss, the zzso zzso of the obese was still markedly reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso Both before and after weight loss, the relative increase in zzso urinary zzso zzso was found to be lower in the obese than in controls, when compared to the nocturnal zzso These results show that the greater 24 h energy expenditure of obese women is entirely due to their higher zzso zzso zzso The lower zzso response to the meal in the obese supports the concept of a zzso zzso which can favor energy zzso zzso the unchanged response after weight loss in the obese suggests that the zzso zzso may be a cause rather than a consequence of zzso
