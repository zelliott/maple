We conducted this study to determine the degree of obesity influence on the zzso response of growth hormone and cortisol after weight loss of zzso A total of 45 zzso male subjects followed in the zzso zzso departments were divided into three groups zzso 15 subjects in each group, based upon body mass index zzso to healthy, overweight and obese zzso zzso was administered in the dose of 50 zzso daily to the overweight and obese zzso zzso was measured at 0, 60 and 120 zzso Growth hormone zzso was measured at zzso 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 zzso zzso of cortisol and zzso were compared upon changes in zzso zzso response to insulin induced zzso initially and after weight loss of zzso for overweight and obese zzso The zzso of the healthy group ranged zzso zzso zzso zzso overweight group ranged zzso zzso zzso zzso and obese group ranged zzso zzso zzso zzso There were no significant differences of cortisol values among groups at 0 zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 60 zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and at 120 minutes zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The comparisons among groups were significant for differences of zzso values at zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso 0 zzso zzso zzso p zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso p zzso 60 zzso zzso zzso p zzso 90 zzso zzso zzso p zzso and at 120 minutes zzso zzso zzso p zzso Healthy and obese subjects significantly differed in growth hormone response at zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso 0 zzso zzso zzso p zzso 60 zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 90 zzso zzso zzso p zzso and at 120 minutes zzso zzso zzso p zzso Changes on the various levels of zzso zzso when it is activated by a stress as it is the case in zzso zzso zzso to the degree of zzso Weight loss of zzso was not enough for restoration of a normal zzso growth hormone release and did not influence on the level of zzso
