zzso zzso kinetic studies were performed on ten clinically zzso zzso obese individuals and on eight normal zzso zzso analysis was carried out according to a zzso model whose basic approach involved the acquisition of data from both vascular and zzso zzso The former were represented by the plasma disappearance zzso of zzso injected zzso zzso The latter included zzso and urinary losses and liver, kidney and thigh zzso A detailed comparison of the zzso zzso of obese and normal individuals did not uncover many differences between these two groups in the way the hormone is distributed, zzso and zzso The mean value for the plasma equivalent distribution volume of zzso in obese individuals zzso zzso was not significantly different from that in controls zzso zzso nor were significant differences observed between the mean value for the plasma appearance rate of the hormone zzso in obese subjects zzso zzso and that in controls zzso zzso The mean value for the size of the slow pool zzso including fatty tissue as well as skeletal muscle, was unchanged in obese individuals when compared with controls, although in the obese subjects the mean value for the mass of fatty tissue was about 5 times zzso In addition, in obese individuals, the mean value for the fractional rate transfer from plasma to the slow pool zzso which was zzso zzso did not significantly differ from that in controls zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
