Brown zzso zzso because of its capacity for zzso zzso zzso has been implicated as an important site of zzso energy zzso This has led to speculation that this tissue normally functions to prevent zzso Attempts to zzso or zzso brown zzso tissue surgically have been zzso because it exists in diffuse zzso and has substantial capacity for zzso and zzso Here we have used a transgenic zzso approach to create two lines of transgenic mice with primary zzso of brown zzso zzso At 16 days, both lines have decreased brown fat and zzso In one line, brown fat subsequently zzso and obesity zzso In the other line, the zzso persists and zzso with its zzso zzso zzso zzso develops in the absence of zzso indicating that brown fat deficient mice have increased zzso zzso As obesity progresses, transgenic animals develop zzso This study supports a critical role for brown zzso tissue in the nutritional zzso of zzso
