zzso type 2 diabetes in mouse models is associated with obesity and results from a combination of zzso and zzso zzso Here we report the identification of a candidate gene for the zzso effect of a zzso zzso zzso contributed by the zzso zzso and zzso strains in zzso populations with New Zealand zzso zzso zzso A critical zzso of zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso the diabetic zzso was identified by zzso zzso zzso of zzso into zzso zzso and subsequent reporter cross with zzso Analysis of the 10 genes in the critical zzso by sequencing, zzso and zzso revealed a striking zzso zzso of zzso zzso zinc finger domain zzso factor zzso In zzso and zzso a zzso zzso in zzso 3 disrupted the gene by formation of a truncated zzso that lacked the coding sequence for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso generated a normal zzso When combined with the zzso background, the zzso zzso zzso produced zzso reduced zzso fat, and increased plasma and liver zzso zzso levels of the human zzso of zzso zzso were significantly increased in zzso tissue from patients with type 2 zzso We conclude that zzso is the most likely candidate for the zzso effect of zzso and that zzso zzso contributes substantially to the genetic zzso of mouse zzso zzso of the zzso factor in zzso tissue may play a role in the zzso of type 2 zzso
