The zzso of equations for the calculation of resting zzso rate zzso were studied and new zzso equations were zzso 

The zzso was measured in a sample of 371 zzso to 16-year-old zzso and zzso zzso The study group included 193 male zzso zzso and 77 zzso and 178 female zzso zzso and 59 zzso zzso for each group the zzso predicted from five equations recommended for this age group were zzso The zzso was assessed by indirect zzso with a zzso hood system for 45 minutes after an overnight zzso Body composition was estimated from zzso zzso 

The mean zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1220 zzso zzso in zzso and obese boys, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and obese girls, zzso All five equations zzso to zzso to 16-year-old children overestimated zzso by zzso to zzso zzso zzso for each zzso zzso zzso analysis, with independent variables such as age, weight, zzso and zzso allowed development of new zzso equations for the calculation of zzso in zzso to 16-year-old boys zzso zzso zzso Weight zzso + zzso Height zzso zzso Age zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso and girls zzso zzso zzso Weight zzso + zzso Height zzso - zzso Age zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso These zzso equations were tested in a second, independent cohort of children zzso male and 61 female zzso and were found to give a reliable estimate of zzso in zzso to 16-year-old obese and zzso zzso 

The currently used zzso equations overestimate zzso in zzso to 16-year-old zzso The use of the newly developed equations is zzso
