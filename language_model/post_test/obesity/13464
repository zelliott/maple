To measure resting and ambulatory systemic blood pressure zzso and left zzso mass zzso in zzso obese and lean children and to determine their zzso 

zzso study including 44 obese and 22 lean zzso children zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso We measured casual and 24-hour ambulatory zzso zzso and zzso index zzso by zzso and whole body lean tissue and fat mass by zzso X-ray zzso 

Mean 24-hour zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso g zzso zzso were significantly higher in obese than in lean zzso zzso ambulatory hypertension was present in zzso of obese children, and casual zzso was normal in zzso of those zzso Body zzso lean tissue mass, and 24-hour zzso correlated positively with zzso When adjusted for body zzso zzso was only associated with 24-hour zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Ambulatory systemic hypertension and increased zzso are found in obese zzso Left zzso mass is partially determined by systemic zzso We conclude that prevention and treatment of childhood obesity should be initiated as early as possible to prevent the premature development of hypertension and zzso organ zzso
