zzso zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes are candidate genes for zzso diabetes zzso zzso insulin resistance, zzso and zzso We studied white Caucasian subjects with zzso 227 being randomly selected, 49 zzso within the top two zzso of insulin zzso 54 with zzso in the top zzso of zzso and the bottom zzso of zzso and 166 zzso control zzso We examined the association of the simple tandem repeat DNA zzso zzso near the zzso and zzso zzso and the prevalence of zzso at zzso of zzso zzso and zzso beta zzso 64 and zzso zzso using restriction zzso length zzso zzso The zzso zzso in zzso were significantly different between zzso and control subjects zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was significantly different between the four groups with increased prevalence in the insulin resistant and zzso subjects (18 and zzso compared with zzso in control zzso p zzso Those with or without zzso zzso had similar clinical characteristics and impaired insulin zzso beta zzso 64 zzso was not significantly different between the four groups but those with the zzso were more obese, with a test for linear association between number of zzso and degree of obesity in an analysis of zzso showing a significant association zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was not detected in any of the diabetic or control subjects and the population association study using zzso zzso showed no difference in zzso zzso between zzso patients and control zzso A zzso in zzso zzso at zzso zzso associated in the general population with low HDL cholesterol, was not at increased prevalence in the zzso patients with zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso had an increased prevalence in subjects with insulin resistance, with or without zzso beta zzso 64 was associated with increased obesity but not with insulin resistance or zzso These separate contributions to different features of zzso are an example of the zzso inheritance of this zzso zzso
