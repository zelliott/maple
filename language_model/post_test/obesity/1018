We hypothesized that zzso treatment would improve vascular dysfunction commonly associated with zzso zzso and insulin zzso A sham operation or zzso zzso zzso was performed in male lean and obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso was exaggerated in control obese rats compared with lean rats, but zzso significantly attenuated VC in the obese zzso zzso reduced the zzso zzso in all zzso This effect was zzso independent, because zzso with zzso reduced VC response to zzso similarly in a subset of control and zzso lean zzso zzso zzso zzso to sodium zzso was similar among groups, but zzso zzso to zzso was significantly impaired in obese compared with lean zzso zzso improved zzso in lean and obese rats by decreasing zzso but impaired function by decreasing zzso zzso The shift in zzso corresponded to an zzso in zzso oxide zzso III protein expression in the zzso of the zzso obese zzso In zzso zzso treatment improves vascular function in male zzso obese rats, partially via an zzso of zzso oxide zzso III protein zzso These effects are zzso by adverse factors, such as zzso and, zzso a release of an zzso zzso zzso
