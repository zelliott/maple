The present study was designed to investigate indicators of abdominal zzso tissue zzso zzso and subcutaneous zzso tissue blood flow and zzso zzso in zzso type II diabetes during zzso conditions zzso and during intravenous infusion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso subcutaneous zzso tissue blood flow and zzso increases in zzso tissue blood flow were not significantly different between subjects with type II diabetes and zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso were significantly higher in subjects with type II diabetes compared with controls zzso zzso and during zzso infusion there was a decrease in zzso zzso in both groups zzso zzso zzso zzso were higher in subjects with type II diabetes compared with controls zzso whereas the increases in zzso zzso concentration in response to zzso infusion were of a similar magnitude in the two zzso zzso subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso release was not significantly different between the groups zzso and subjects with type II zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for fat zzso were not significantly different between groups, whereas the zzso increase in fat zzso tended to be less pronounced in subjects with type II diabetes compared with controls zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus estimated zzso subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso release, expressed per unit of fat mass, is not different in controls and in subjects with type II zzso Additionally, the zzso increases in indicators of local abdominal subcutaneous zzso zzso systemic zzso and abdominal zzso tissue blood flow responses were comparable in obese subjects with type II diabetes and in zzso The last two findings contrast with previous data from obese subjects, indicating that the regulation of zzso may differ in obesity and zzso type II zzso
