There is growing evidence for an implication of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso system in the regulation of eating and fat zzso To further define the zzso role of these receptors in the control of energy balance, we characterized the zzso of zzso zzso knockout zzso mice maintained on an zzso regimen or on a standard zzso 

zzso male mice were compared to zzso animals zzso male zzso in two feeding zzso zzso with a standard laboratory regimen zzso zzso zzso of energy as zzso and zzso on a zzso paradigm consisting of offering both the standard laboratory zzso and a high-fat diet zzso zzso zzso zzso of energy as zzso 

When maintained on the standard diet, zzso mice are zzso At the age of 20 weeks, their body weight and zzso are, respectively, 24 and zzso lower than that of zzso zzso They are slightly zzso but when expressed as percent of body weight, their relative energy intake is similar to that of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso receptors reduces plasma insulin and zzso levels, and enhances the response to zzso zzso zzso The zzso paradigm shows that the preference for a high-fat highly palatable zzso is slightly delayed in onset but maintained in zzso zzso However, loading zzso mice with this zzso diet does not result in development of zzso zzso mice do not display zzso or reduction of their relative energy intake in contrast to zzso mice, and their feeding efficiency remains zzso These data suggest an improved energetic metabolism with the high-fat zzso Furthermore, the insulin resistance normally occurring in zzso mice is not present in zzso zzso 

These results provide evidence that the stimulation of zzso receptors is a key component in the development of zzso zzso and that these receptors and their zzso zzso are implicated not only in feeding control but also in peripheral zzso zzso The lack of effect of zzso a selective zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice further supports this hypothesis, as this compound was previously shown to display potent zzso properties in zzso obese zzso zzso
