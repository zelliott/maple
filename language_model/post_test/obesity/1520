Evidence suggests putative interactions of zzso and zzso protein zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso cardiovascular disease zzso zzso we investigated whether zzso levels modify the relationship of zzso levels with coronary artery calcium zzso We examined zzso zzso individuals from two community-based zzso studies coordinated at a single, zzso research zzso We focused on subjects who were overweight or obese zzso zzso given greater zzso zzso in this zzso In multivariable zzso models, we analyzed the interaction of zzso plasma zzso levels with higher zzso levels as defined by three zzso two clinically based zzso zzso and one zzso specific zzso upper zzso The association of plasma zzso with zzso was modified by higher zzso regardless of zzso zzso term P values all zzso in fully adjusted zzso zzso levels were associated with zzso in those with high, but not low zzso levels zzso zzso ratio for a 1 unit increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso if zzso level zzso N zzso 461 zzso zzso zzso if zzso levels zzso N zzso zzso in fully adjusted zzso No interaction with zzso was present in control analyses with zzso zzso and waist zzso In conclusion, in zzso overweight and obese adults, increased zzso levels were independently associated with increased zzso in the presence of high, but not low zzso levels, supporting a zzso interface in zzso zzso
