zzso and missing data are zzso in obesity zzso controlled zzso threatening zzso and zzso of zzso zzso we zzso evaluate the extent of missing data, the frequency with which various zzso methods are employed to accommodate dropouts, and the performance of multiple statistical zzso 

We searched zzso and Cochrane databases zzso for articles published in English and manually searched zzso zzso Articles of pharmaceutical zzso controlled trials with weight loss or weight gain prevention as major zzso were zzso Two authors independently reviewed each publication for zzso 121 articles met the inclusion zzso Two authors independently extracted treatment, sample size, zzso rates, study zzso and statistical method used to handle missing data from all articles and resolved disagreements by zzso In the zzso zzso rates were substantial with the survival zzso rates being zzso by an exponential zzso curve zzso where zzso was estimated to be zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso and zzso represents time in zzso The estimated zzso rate at 1 year was zzso Most studies used last observation carried forward as the primary zzso method to handle missing zzso We also obtained 12 raw obesity zzso controlled trial zzso for empirical zzso zzso of raw zzso controlled trial data suggested that both mixed models and multiple zzso performed well, but that multiple zzso may be more robust when missing data are zzso 

Our analysis offers an equation for predictions of dropout rates useful for future study zzso Our raw data analyses suggests that multiple zzso is better than other methods for handling missing data in obesity zzso controlled trials, followed closely by mixed zzso We suggest these methods supplant last observation carried forward as the primary method of zzso
