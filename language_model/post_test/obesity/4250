Recent studies have linked zzso type 2 diabetes zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso to insulin resistance in the brain, cognitive impairment and zzso zzso resistance compromises cell survival, metabolism and zzso zzso and increases zzso stress, zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been demonstrated to be associated with increased zzso generation, suggesting a zzso link between peripheral insulin resistance and zzso because zzso mediate insulin resistance and can cross the zzso barrier zzso zzso insulin resistance diseases may potentially cause brain insulin resistance via a zzso axis of zzso as a result of the trafficking of zzso across the zzso zzso that includes zzso agents may help prevent brain insulin zzso cognitive zzso
