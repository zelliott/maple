Upper reference values of zzso zzso mass in the European population are based on zzso data mostly derived from northern European zzso zzso Furthermore, data in apparently healthy populations have included individuals with conditions affecting zzso mass such as zzso diabetes and masked zzso Thus, from zzso individuals with normal office blood pressure zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso E zzso zzso study population, we selected a group of 675 sustained zzso individuals in order to provide reliable zzso reference values for defining the criteria of zzso zzso zzso 

The study group zzso zzso mean age zzso zzso was identified after excluding individuals with isolated home or ambulatory hypertension, zzso diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and zzso examinations of insufficient quality to evaluate zzso zzso 

zzso upper limits of zzso zzso + zzso standard zzso zzso for zzso mass, zzso mass zzso to body surface area, zzso height were the zzso zzso zzso 114 zzso 51 zzso 123 zzso in men and 161 zzso zzso zzso 47 zzso 101 zzso in zzso In zzso zzso body size measures and ambulatory zzso levels were the most important zzso of zzso zzso 

Our investigation by providing upper reference limits of zzso mass in a southern European population sample, carefully selected after exclusion of a large number of conditions affecting zzso mass, may offer a contribution for revising diagnostic criteria of zzso zzso currently recommended by European hypertension zzso
