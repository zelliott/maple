zzso compounds are released from body fat into the zzso during weight zzso Because these compounds may impair zzso status, which is implicated in the control of resting zzso rate zzso the aim of this study was to determine if the zzso in plasma zzso zzso might be associated with the decrease in serum zzso concentration and zzso observed in response to body weight zzso Plasma zzso zzso serum zzso zzso and zzso were measured before and after weight loss in 16 obese men who followed a zzso zzso diet for 15 zzso As expected, a significant decrease in serum zzso concentration and zzso was observed after the program, whereas zzso of most detected zzso were significantly zzso Changes in zzso zzso were zzso associated with changes in serum zzso concentration zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 28, zzso 99, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and with changes in zzso adjusted for weight loss zzso for zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso released in plasma during weight loss are associated with the documented decrease in serum zzso concentration and zzso Further studies are needed to verify whether these findings are zzso zzso
