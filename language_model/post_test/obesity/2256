Brown zzso tissue zzso is an zzso organ that produces zzso Expansion or zzso of BAT prevents obesity and zzso zzso cold exposure enhances zzso in BAT through zzso protein 1 zzso zzso triggered via a zzso zzso Here, we report that the zzso transient zzso potential zzso 8 zzso is functionally present in mouse zzso zzso brown zzso with zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and requires protein zzso A zzso Upon mimicking long-term cold exposure with chronic dietary zzso application, zzso significantly increased the core temperatures and locomotor activity in zzso zzso these effects were absent in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso obesity and zzso abnormalities were also prevented by zzso zzso Our results reveal a previously zzso role for zzso suggesting that stimulation of this channel mediates BAT zzso which could constitute a promising way to treat zzso
