zzso resistance, recently recognized as a strong predictor of disease in adults, has become the leading element of the zzso syndrome and renewed as a focus of zzso The condition exists when insulin levels are higher than expected relative to the level of zzso Thus, insulin resistance is by definition zzso to zzso The rising prevalence of medical conditions where insulin resistance is common has energized research into the zzso Many causes and consequences have been identified, but the direct contributions of insulin itself in causing or sustaining insulin resistance have received little sustained zzso We examine situations where insulin itself appears to be a zzso and important quantitative contributor to insulin zzso 1) Mice zzso with extra copies of the insulin gene produce zzso and zzso insulin levels that are two to four times zzso The mice are of normal weight but show insulin resistance, zzso and zzso 2) zzso described patients with unusually high doses of insulin and zzso zzso of zzso with release of zzso hormones, zzso as the culprits in early studies, have largely been excluded by studies including continuous zzso zzso 3) zzso and humans treated with escalating doses of insulin show both zzso and insulin zzso 4) The zzso administration of insulin (rather than zzso results in reduced requirements for zzso 5) Many patients with zzso who have elevated zzso levels of insulin have reduced (but not zzso responsiveness to administered zzso In zzso zzso is often both a result and a driver of insulin zzso
