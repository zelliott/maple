We have studied the zzso and zzso of zzso during long-term therapy in 20 patients with type II diabetes zzso The patients were divided according to body mass index zzso into an obese group zzso zzso 12, age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso total body weight zzso zzso zzso and a non-obese group zzso zzso 8, age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso were zzso to achieve specified therapeutic goals based upon serum zzso zzso or to a maximum dosage of 20 zzso per zzso The zzso of zzso were determined at week 12 of zzso On the study day, the patients took a zzso zzso liquid test dose of zzso with a zzso meal zzso The elimination rate constant zzso zzso clearance zzso and apparent volume of distribution zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the obese group, and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the non-obese zzso These values were not statistically significantly zzso However, there were differences between the groups when the volume and clearance were corrected by zzso or zzso but not by ideal body weight zzso or zzso mass zzso zzso analysis between the zzso variables and body weight status revealed statistically significant correlations between volume or clearance and body zzso However, due to large zzso zzso these relations were relatively weak and were considered to be zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
