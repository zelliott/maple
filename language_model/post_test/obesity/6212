Studies were conducted to determine whether zzso adaptation occurred in the zzso of overfed zzso rats and their partners to distinguish between the adaptations caused by increased caloric intake and those caused by the production of a zzso zzso The induction of overfed obesity in one zzso partner was employed to test the hypothesis that a putative zzso factor produced in the obese zzso zzso the zzso effect observed in the lean zzso via zzso in zzso fatty acid and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of overfed zzso rats and their partners was lower than in ad zzso zzso zzso Net flux of zzso through the zzso zzso acid zzso shunt was elevated in overfed zzso rats compared with the net flux observed in their partners and ad zzso zzso rats, the levels being similar in these last two zzso Net flux of zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso shunt in overfed zzso rats and their partners was elevated relative to ad zzso zzso zzso The putative zzso factor may act to regulate energy balance through modification of zzso fatty acid zzso and/or zzso flux via the zzso zzso zzso
