To determine whether zzso which play a pivotal role in zzso trafficking, zzso zzso zzso into and zzso in the zzso zzso 

Various types of zzso tissue were isolated from different fat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and subcutaneous zzso zzso from obese mice fed a high-fat diet and from non-obese controls fed a standard zzso The isolated zzso were cultured for 24, 48, and 72 zzso The level of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and the amount of protein released were measured by reverse zzso chain reaction or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed to measure the degree of zzso zzso zzso zzso was estimated by measuring the zzso of zzso oxide and tumor necrosis factor zzso 

The level of zzso zzso zzso protein content, and the amount of protein released significantly increased in the zzso zzso from the obese mice compared with those from the non-obese zzso The zzso zzso tissue produced the highest levels of zzso protein among the four different fat zzso zzso zzso zzso medium induced the highest degree of zzso migration and strongly induced zzso to produce zzso zzso such as zzso oxide and tumor necrosis factor zzso The zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso medium significantly inhibited the migration and zzso of zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso plays a crucial role in zzso tissue inflammatory response by zzso and inducing the zzso of zzso into zzso zzso zzso may be closely associated with visceral zzso complications and, thus, may be a useful therapeutic target for modulating visceral zzso zzso
