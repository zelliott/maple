To investigate insulin zzso and its zzso we performed an insulin sensitivity test using the steady state plasma zzso zzso method in 10 lean zzso subjects with normal zzso tolerance before and after treatment with alpha zzso zzso and 14 age body mass zzso healthy control zzso Steady state plasma zzso was significantly higher in the zzso subjects compared with the control group zzso zzso 10 zzso v 104 zzso 7, P zzso mean zzso standard error of the mean zzso Steady state plasma zzso significantly decreased to 136 zzso 12 zzso zzso zzso after the treatment with alpha zzso zzso with a decrease of blood zzso zzso subjects had shown an increased area under the curve of zzso and insulin during the oral zzso tolerance test compared with normal zzso The zzso area decreased significantly, but the insulin area did not change after the zzso There was no difference in plasma zzso zzso and fractional zzso of Na between normal and zzso subjects both before and after treatment with zzso at zzso and during insulin sensitivity tests (2 zzso zzso total cholesterol level decreased and HDL cholesterol increased significantly after treatment with zzso A significant correlation was observed between zzso and blood pressure, but not between insulin level and blood zzso The results indicate that insulin sensitivity is better related than zzso to hypertension and that this zzso is partially zzso by alpha zzso zzso
