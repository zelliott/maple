The zzso zzso to sleeping zzso rate zzso ratio might represent an estimate of the zzso of the nervous system zzso from sleeping to zzso zzso Since this zzso might be influenced by the degree of zzso and might be different between zzso we zzso zzso energy expenditure data collected for a large number of zzso zzso hour energy expenditure zzso zzso and zzso were measured in a respiratory chamber in 122 Caucasians zzso zzso zzso 32 zzso 10 years, 94 zzso 33 zzso 29 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in 123 zzso Indians zzso zzso zzso 29 zzso 7 years, 100 zzso 25 zzso 34 zzso zzso zzso The zzso ratio varied greatly between individuals zzso zzso zzso range zzso In zzso Indians, zzso was zzso correlated to both fat mass zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in zzso zzso was zzso correlated to zzso circumference ratio zzso zzso zzso P zzso On average, the zzso was higher in zzso Indians than in Caucasians zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and higher in zzso Indian males than in zzso Indian females zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso Studies are needed to investigate whether these differences in the increase in energy expenditure from the sleeping to the zzso state are related to differences in the zzso of the nervous system and/or to other zzso zzso
