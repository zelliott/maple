zzso sensitivity is a key function in human metabolism because it has a crucial role in the development of disease that are increasingly common in modern zzso zzso insulin sensitivity is an important zzso of type 2 zzso moreover, it has been proposed as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular zzso Thus, reduced insulin sensitivity is strongly associated with the zzso syndrome, which represents a cluster of zzso abnormalities and cardiovascular risk zzso zzso sensitivity can be modulated by different environmental factors, including dietary zzso zzso especially if associated with abdominal zzso zzso zzso while physical activity can improve it; however, the composition of the habitual diet is clearly an important regulator of this zzso 

To evaluate zzso and markers that can be used to substantiate existing and potential claims of beneficial effects of foods on relevant functions connected with body fat deposition, insulin sensitivity and blood zzso zzso 

We have reviewed the scientific basis for existing and potential claims, based not only on modifications of the target functions zzso fat deposition, insulin sensitivity and blood zzso zzso but also on modifications of other relevant associated functions zzso zzso energy zzso fat storage and zzso zzso body fat zzso zzso zzso stress, vascular function, zzso production and zzso In this context we have identified a number of markers and evaluated appropriate method to measure and validate zzso 

zzso functions contributing to overweight, the zzso syndrome and diabetes have been zzso The evidence reviewed indicates that in this field the link between nutrition, biological responses and diseases is clearly zzso zzso there is a strong potential to develop functional food zzso The major gap in the evidence continues to be the lack of diet based intervention trials of sufficient duration to be relevant for affecting the natural history of these zzso
