Repeat sleeve zzso zzso and the addition of the zzso switch zzso are possible options to increase weight loss after isolated zzso zzso We report the zzso safety, and outcomes of zzso zzso versus zzso in patients presenting with insufficient weight loss or weight regain after zzso 

From November 2003 to December 2009, 7 and 19 patients underwent zzso zzso and zzso respectively, mainly because of the patients' dietary zzso volume eating zzso was treated by zzso and eating meals too frequently zzso by zzso 

At zzso the mean weight and zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso group and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso group, zzso The mean zzso between zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso months for the zzso group and zzso zzso zzso months for the zzso zzso At zzso the mean weight, zzso and percentage of excess weight loss zzso was zzso zzso 21 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso group and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the zzso group, zzso The mean operative time was zzso zzso zzso minutes for the zzso group and zzso zzso zzso minutes for the zzso zzso No conversion to open surgery was required, and no mortality zzso One patient in the zzso group developed a leak at the angle of zzso In the zzso group, 1 patient presented with zzso 1 patient with a zzso zzso and 1 patient with a zzso zzso The mean hospital stay was zzso zzso zzso days for the zzso group and zzso zzso zzso days for the zzso zzso The mean follow-up was zzso zzso zzso months for the zzso group and zzso zzso zzso months for the zzso zzso The mean weight, zzso and zzso was 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso group and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso group, zzso During zzso 3 patients in the zzso group required corrective surgery for late zzso 

The results of the present study have shown that zzso zzso is feasible but carries the risk of zzso development, which is difficult to zzso zzso zzso was also shown to be feasible at a cost of not negligible zzso which are easier to manage than with zzso The efficacy seemed greater after zzso than after zzso
