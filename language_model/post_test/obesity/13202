zzso substantially decreases plasma zzso zzso However, in zzso the zzso decrease in zzso concentration is blunted or zzso The objective of the current study was to determine in zzso obese zzso rats the contribution of altered zzso zzso and zzso expression to the blunted nutritional regulation of zzso zzso zzso decreases in plasma zzso concentration were greater in lean zzso zzso zzso rats compared to zzso zzso 79 vs approximately zzso zzso for zzso vs zzso zzso zzso was significantly reduced by zzso in SC zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso decreased zzso tissue zzso zzso in both SC and zzso but the decrease was greater in SC zzso approximately zzso compared to zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso vs zzso Additionally, zzso zzso in zzso zzso was substantially greater zzso approximately zzso than in zzso SC zzso zzso tissue zzso protein content was increased by approximately zzso in zzso compared to SC zzso We conclude that a probable cause of blunted zzso decreases in zzso concentration in obesity is elevated zzso zzso which possibly results from increased zzso gene zzso
