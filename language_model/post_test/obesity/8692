The zzso content of skeletal muscle samples determined by zzso extraction zzso with the severity of zzso zzso metabolism in zzso To determine whether this reflects increased zzso within muscle fibers and to test the hypothesis that the zzso content in muscle fibers is increased in zzso the present study was undertaken using quantitative zzso of Oil Red O zzso of zzso zzso zzso A zzso muscle biopsy was performed in 9 lean subjects, 15 obese subjects without type 2 diabetes zzso zzso and 10 obese subjects with type 2 zzso zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for lean, obese, and zzso zzso Eight obese and 7 zzso subjects had a weight loss and reassessment of muscle zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso were examined by light zzso with quantitative image analysis zzso images obtained by analog to digital zzso to determine a zzso zzso index zzso based on the percentage of zzso fiber area occupied by zzso zzso Muscle fiber zzso content was greater in obese individuals with zzso than in lean individuals zzso v zzso P zzso but was not different in obese individuals without zzso zzso Weight loss reduced the zzso from zzso to zzso In zzso zzso zzso within muscle fibers is significantly increased in obesity and is reduced by weight zzso This provides important information regarding the zzso and distribution of skeletal muscle zzso in type 2 zzso and zzso
