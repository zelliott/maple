zzso zzso is generally considered to be a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease, but little is known about the possible influence of obesity on the circulating levels of this zzso The present study was undertaken to examine this aspect in 136 zzso active women by comparing the serum zzso of zzso between 72 obese and 64 zzso zzso zzso Since an adverse effect of zzso and a protective effect of zzso have been described for plasma zzso profiles in obese women, the relation between the circulating levels of zzso and those of these other hormones was also investigated in obese zzso In addition, other zzso zzso parameters zzso mass index and zzso zzso and insulin were zzso The levels of zzso were not significantly different zzso U test zzso 2, zzso p zzso zzso zzso between obese zzso sum, zzso and control zzso sum, zzso zzso in addition, the percentage of patients with high zzso levels zzso defined at 30 zzso did not differ between the two groups zzso women, zzso control, zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso Moreover, no correlation was found between zzso and body mass zzso Lastly, when the zzso prevalence odds ratio for obesity was examined by adjusting the levels of this zzso for age, zzso total cholesterol, and high density zzso cholesterol, the probability value zzso was far from zzso In obese women, no correlation was found between the zzso transformed zzso zzso and all the other variables evaluated in the zzso In conclusion, the present study shows that the circulating levels of zzso are not influenced by body weight and cardiovascular risk factors commonly associated with zzso such as enhanced zzso activity, zzso adverse zzso profile, and abdominal fat zzso
