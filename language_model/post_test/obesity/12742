The present research was an attempt to determine the pharmacological actions as for zzso zzso and zzso of small zzso isolated from soybean in zzso Small zzso administration prevented the decrease in sporting movement induced by concussion stress for 3 h in zzso In addition, it should be noted that the recovery rate of fatigue in 60 zzso after small zzso administration was over one hundred percentage in comparison with that after zzso while the equivalent dose administration of zzso acid mixture with the same small zzso zzso acid composition did not prevent the decrease in sporting zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso obese mouse body weight gain, liver weight and body zzso level around zzso were significantly reduced by the chronic oral administration of small zzso zzso 1000 zzso Administration in 1000 zzso per zzso of small zzso significantly lowered zzso in 30 and 120 zzso after zzso (3 zzso zzso administration, whereas the equivalent zzso acid mixture showed no zzso In conclusion, it suggested that small zzso isolated from soybean might have some pharmacological effects of zzso zzso and zzso
