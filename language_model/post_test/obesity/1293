zzso resistance is associated with both obesity and zzso However, the cellular mechanisms of insulin resistance in genetic models of zzso have not been zzso The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of genetic obesity on a background of inherited hypertension on initial components of the insulin signal zzso zzso and zzso transport in skeletal muscle and zzso zzso zzso tolerance testing in zzso demonstrated a sustained zzso zzso in plasma zzso at 180 and 240 zzso compared with lean spontaneously zzso rat zzso zzso which is suggestive of zzso zzso zzso plasma insulin levels were elevated zzso in zzso The rate of zzso zzso transport was reduced zzso in isolated zzso muscles from the zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso of the insulin zzso zzso and insulin zzso zzso zzso in intact skeletal muscle of zzso was reduced by 36 and zzso respectively, compared with zzso due primarily to 32 and zzso decreases in insulin zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso The amounts of zzso alpha regulatory zzso of zzso and zzso protein were reduced by 28 and zzso in zzso muscle compared with zzso In the liver of zzso the effect of insulin on zzso zzso of zzso was not changed, but insulin zzso zzso was decreased by zzso compared with zzso due to a zzso reduction in insulin zzso zzso Our observations suggest that the zzso zzso zzso zzso imposed on a zzso background results in extreme zzso zzso zzso and decreased expression of zzso insulin signaling proteins in skeletal zzso Despite these changes, hypertension is not exacerbated in zzso compared with zzso suggesting these zzso abnormalities may not contribute to hypertension in this model of zzso zzso
