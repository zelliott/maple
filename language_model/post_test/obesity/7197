The aim was to assess the relationship between zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso with development of type 2 diabetes and assess the role of obesity and insulin resistance in these zzso 

We conducted a prospective study of zzso zzso men aged zzso years and followed up for a mean period of 5 years, during which time there were 108 incident cases of type 2 zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and low zzso were associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes even after adjustment for zzso lifestyle factors, zzso cardiovascular disease, and zzso blood zzso The relative risks zzso zzso zzso bottom zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso Further adjustment for insulin resistance made minor differences to the zzso diabetes relationship zzso zzso zzso zzso weakened the associations with zzso zzso zzso and abolished the association between zzso and diabetes zzso zzso The inverse relation between low zzso and diabetes was significantly stronger in men who were obese zzso zzso 102 zzso or zzso or zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso relative to zzso men zzso zzso zzso for interaction P zzso zzso 

The association between zzso and incident diabetes is zzso by insulin zzso By contrast, the positive association between zzso and diabetes appeared to be independent of obesity and insulin zzso Finally, the association between low zzso and increased risk of diabetes appears to be significantly stronger in obese men than in zzso zzso
