zzso weight gain during pregnancy has an important influence on fetal growth and on weight development in future zzso 

A prospective cohort study of 325 obese and zzso Caucasian women with naturally conceived, singleton zzso was zzso They were followed up until delivery for maternal weight gain and for fetal growth with zzso weight zzso and final birth zzso Using cluster analysis distinct profiles of maternal weight gain during pregnancy were zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed to investigate the relationship of the maternal weight gain profile and zzso on fetal growth and final birth zzso 

zzso analysis revealed four zzso maternal weight gain zzso 12 cases zzso ended up at their starting weight or decreased in weight zzso 1), 16 cases zzso who slightly increased in weight zzso 4 zzso as compared to their initial weight zzso zzso 114 cases zzso who gained between 4 and 12 zzso in weight zzso zzso and 183 cases zzso who showed the largest weight zzso more than 12 zzso zzso zzso There were statistically significant differences in fetal growth associated with weight gain zzso which became apparent late in the second zzso and increased toward the end of zzso zzso zzso and maternal weight gain profile were independent zzso of fetal growth and birth zzso 

zzso the conclusion is that the cluster analysis permits to discern four zzso weight gain zzso patterns in obese and zzso subjects and that both maternal zzso and maternal weight gain pattern during pregnancy positively influence fetal growth and birth zzso
