zzso is a risk factor for the development of certain respiratory diseases, and zzso zzso results in an early onset of obesity in zzso However, the influence of zzso zzso on respiratory diseases has rarely been zzso zzso this paper is aimed at investigating the effect of zzso zzso on airway responsiveness and zzso 

The zzso zzso was induced by reducing litter size to three zzso per litter zzso litter, zzso in contrast to the normal litter size with ten zzso per litter zzso on zzso day 3 zzso in male zzso zzso On zzso mice were weaned to standard zzso zzso zzso responsiveness to zzso was measured either on zzso or zzso Total and classified inflammatory cells in zzso zzso fluid zzso were zzso lung inflammatory cells were evaluated through zzso with zzso & zzso and zzso zzso lung zzso was evaluated through zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels in serum were measured by zzso zzso levels in serum and zzso were zzso by zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso in lung zzso were measured using real-time zzso Mice from zzso exhibited accelerated body weight gain, impaired zzso tolerance and zzso zzso airway responsiveness to zzso was observed in zzso mice on zzso but not on zzso Pulmonary inflammation was evident in zzso mice on zzso as reflected by inflammatory cells especially zzso around zzso and zzso zzso and serum zzso levels and lung zzso zzso expression were significantly increased in zzso mice on zzso More collagen accumulated surrounding the zzso on zzso lung zzso levels of zzso and zzso were also increased on zzso 

In addition to inducing a variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced lung zzso which may lead to airway zzso and airway zzso in zzso
