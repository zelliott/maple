The relationship between insulin resistance and zzso function is of increasing zzso Studies looking for such interactions are usually made in muscle and only a few studies have been done in liver, which is known to be a crucial partner in whole body insulin zzso Recent studies have revealed a similar mechanism to that of muscle for zzso insulin resistance in zzso However, the exact mechanism of zzso zzso zzso in liver leading to insulin resistance is far from being zzso One of the hypothetical mechanisms for liver zzso development is an impairment of zzso zzso We examined zzso function in fatty liver and insulin resistance state using isolated zzso from obese zzso zzso We determined the relationship between zzso synthesis and oxygen consumption as well as the relationship between zzso membrane potential and oxygen zzso In order to evaluate the quantity of zzso and the zzso capacity we measured zzso zzso and zzso c zzso zzso zzso showed that despite significant fatty liver and zzso isolated liver zzso from obese zzso rats display no difference in oxygen consumption, zzso zzso and membrane potential compared with lean zzso zzso There was no difference in zzso zzso and zzso c zzso activities between obese and lean zzso rats in isolated zzso as well as in liver zzso indicating a similar relative amount of zzso zzso and a similar zzso zzso zzso which is involved in zzso zzso was increased zzso in obese zzso rats despite insulin zzso In conclusion, isolated liver zzso from lean and obese zzso zzso rats showed strictly the same zzso zzso It remains to be zzso whether zzso increase is involved in these zzso
