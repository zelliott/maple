zzso zzso is a novel zzso with potential roles in zzso insulin resistance, and zzso The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effect of obesity on circulating zzso and gene and protein expression levels of zzso in human visceral zzso tissue zzso as well as its involvement in zzso zzso zzso from 47 subjects were used in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses were performed to zzso levels of zzso in zzso as well as the association with other genes implicated in inflammatory zzso zzso serum samples were used to analyze the circulating zzso of zzso zzso analysis was used to determine the activity of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso patients exhibited increased zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso expression levels of zzso compared to lean zzso Although no differences in plasma zzso zzso were observed, increased circulating zzso complex levels were found zzso zzso zzso in the obese zzso Moreover, obese individuals showed increased zzso zzso activity of zzso and zzso complex, while a positive correlation zzso zzso between zzso and zzso activities and zzso was zzso Gene and protein expression levels of zzso in zzso were positively associated with inflammatory markers zzso zzso These findings represent the first observation that zzso and protein levels of zzso are increased in human zzso of obese zzso Furthermore, zzso is associated with zzso and zzso activities as well as with zzso markers suggesting its potential involvement in the zzso chronic inflammation accompanying zzso
