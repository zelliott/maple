Although fat deposition is a defining clinical characteristic of zzso the cellular mechanisms that regulate this response remain zzso The goals of this zzso study were to determine the effect of zzso fluid stasis on zzso and inflammation zzso I) and how these changes regulate the zzso and spatial expression of fat differentiation genes zzso zzso 

Adult female mice underwent tail zzso zzso and were zzso 6 weeks after surgery zzso zzso zzso Fat deposition, fibrosis, and inflammation were then analyzed in the regions of the tail exposed to zzso fluid stasis as compared with normal zzso zzso 

zzso fluid stasis in the tail resulted in significant subcutaneous fat deposition, with a zzso increase in fat thickness zzso zzso In addition, zzso stasis was associated with subcutaneous fat zzso and collagen zzso zzso in response to zzso fluid stasis was associated with a marked zzso cell inflammatory response zzso increase in zzso zzso p zzso In addition, the authors noted a significant increase in the number of zzso as identified by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso model has zzso findings that are similar to clinical zzso including fat deposition, fibrosis, and zzso zzso in response to zzso fluid stasis closely resembles this process in zzso This model therefore provides an excellent means with which to study the molecular mechanisms that regulate the zzso of zzso
