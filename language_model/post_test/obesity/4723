zzso factor zzso is a nuclear zzso factor that responds to environmental and pathological zzso to induce zzso adaptation, vascular growth, and cell zzso Here we found that zzso zzso and zzso in particular were normally expressed in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso to mediate the feeding control of zzso zzso zzso Two underlying molecular pathways were identified, including suppression of zzso by zzso zzso to prevent zzso degradation and the recruitment of zzso and zzso to regulate zzso protein zzso zzso zzso was found to directly control the zzso of zzso zzso zzso approach was then employed to develop conditional knockout mice with zzso zzso in zzso zzso revealing that zzso zzso in zzso zzso impaired zzso zzso sensing and caused energy imbalance to promote obesity zzso The zzso effects of zzso in zzso zzso zzso were independent of zzso signaling or zzso zzso zzso zzso gene delivery of zzso zzso zzso and obesity under conditions of nutritional zzso In conclusion, zzso controls zzso zzso gene to direct the central zzso sensing in regulation of energy and body weight zzso
