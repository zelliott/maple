zzso zzso syndrome zzso is a leading cause of zzso zzso and affects approximately zzso of zzso age women in the zzso It is characterized by zzso and chronic zzso and is associated with insulin resistance, zzso and increased risk for type 2 zzso In a screen of candidate zzso a region on zzso zzso was identified that shows significant evidence for both linkage and association with zzso A promising candidate gene for zzso zzso maps to exactly this zzso zzso is a protein hormone thought to zzso zzso tolerance and insulin zzso We tested for association between a single zzso zzso in the promoter region of the zzso gene and three zzso zzso zzso and insulin zzso We did not find evidence for association with any of the zzso It is therefore unlikely that variation in the zzso gene accounts for the strong association that we observe between zzso zzso and zzso Instead, this association is most likely due to a gene or genetic element in this region that has not been zzso
