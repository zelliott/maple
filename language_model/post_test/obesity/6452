The zzso 3 zzso zzso plays a critical role in weight regulation as demonstrated in mouse zzso We describe a novel zzso zzso zzso found in zzso in a 13-year-old obese girl and her zzso 

The zzso gene was zzso in 41 unrelated obese children, and 121 DNA samples from non-obese individuals were zzso for this novel sequence zzso by zzso zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso of four family members of the pedigree were also zzso by zzso zzso 

zzso was found in the zzso and her father, though all four family members were zzso The sequence zzso was not found in 121 control zzso The zzso has high percentage body fat zzso but the father's percentage body fat was only zzso There were no distinguishing zzso zzso zzso sensitivity was significantly higher compared to the 40 other obese subjects without zzso gene zzso 

The difference in zzso between the two related zzso and the observation of obesity in other family members without the zzso suggests that obesity results from a varying combination of zzso zzso and multiple genetic factors zzso than zzso even within the same zzso
