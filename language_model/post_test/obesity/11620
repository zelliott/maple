A DNA mapping panel derived from an zzso zzso was used to position the mouse zzso locus zzso on zzso 7, near zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is part of a zzso zzso linkage group that includes zzso zzso and zzso Analysis of segregation in the zzso generation from the cross zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso and the obesity zzso zzso zzso are distinct zzso thus eliminating zzso as a candidate gene for zzso These results also refine the estimated genetic distance between tub and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso The predicted location for a human zzso of zzso is zzso zzso
