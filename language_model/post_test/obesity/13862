The primary aim was to investigate the relative importance of the zzso vs the nonfat cells present in human zzso tissue with respect to release of zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso The second aim was to examine the correlation between body mass index zzso and the subsequent release of zzso and zzso by zzso of human subcutaneous and visceral zzso tissue incubated in primary culture for 48 zzso 

We found that the zzso release of zzso was seen during the first 4 h of a zzso incubation by zzso of human zzso tissue in primary zzso Over zzso of the zzso released to the medium by human zzso tissue zzso over a zzso incubation came from the nonfat cells present in the zzso zzso The release of zzso by the nonfat cells released during zzso zzso was slightly higher than that by the cells present in the zzso tissue zzso after zzso zzso zzso release by the combined zzso and isolated nonfat cells was greater than that by zzso of tissue indicating some zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso disappeared from the medium with a zzso of approximately 10 zzso There was a positive correlation zzso of zzso between zzso release by tissue zzso and the zzso of the fat donors as well as a correlation of zzso between zzso and release by zzso zzso release zzso correlated zzso with zzso release by zzso zzso The release of zzso was far less than that of zzso or zzso and less than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor, or zzso over a zzso incubation of human zzso tissue zzso zzso release over 4 h was enhanced by zzso and inhibited by a zzso zzso 

The release of zzso by zzso tissue of obese humans is primarily due to the nonfat cells present in zzso zzso zzso is a short-lived zzso whose release by human zzso tissue in primary culture zzso with the zzso of the fat zzso
