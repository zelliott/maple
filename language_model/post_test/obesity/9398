zzso smooth muscle cell zzso migration is an important pathological process in several vascular zzso diseases, including zzso and zzso both of which are accelerated by diabetes zzso 

To determine the mechanisms of abnormal vascular zzso migration in type 2 diabetes, the obese zzso rat zzso a model of obesity and insulin resistance, was zzso 

In culture, zzso zzso zzso showed a significant increase in zzso zzso and protein levels compared with the control lean zzso rat zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were increased in zzso zzso indicating zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso failed to inhibit zzso zzso migration in zzso zzso of zzso small interference zzso or zzso of zzso wild type, but not zzso zzso zzso restored the response to zzso zzso of zzso also decreased zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, transforming growth zzso via zzso was necessary and sufficient to zzso zzso zzso zzso and block the zzso action of NO in zzso zzso zzso to the results in cultured zzso zzso confirmed that zzso and zzso zzso were significantly increased in zzso zzso After common carotid artery injury, zzso of zzso by zzso zzso short hairpin zzso decreased zzso and zzso zzso zzso and significantly decreased zzso zzso 

These studies indicate that the zzso of zzso by transforming growth zzso in zzso zzso is responsible for the impaired response to NO by a mechanism involving the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso as well as zzso formation, after zzso common carotid artery zzso
