Although the body mass index zzso zzso is widely used as a surrogate measure of zzso it is a measure of excess weight, rather than excess body fat, relative to zzso The zzso zzso system is derived from cut points obtained from the general zzso The influence of large muscle mass on zzso in athletes and young adults may zzso these individuals as overweight and zzso zzso the use of subcutaneous zzso tissue topography zzso may be more effective than zzso in assessing obesity in physically active people and young zzso The purposes of this study were 1) to describe the relationship between the zzso and zzso of young athletes and zzso and 2) to determine the accuracy of the zzso as a measure of zzso zzso weight, zzso and zzso were determined in 64 males zzso zzso zzso and 42 females zzso zzso zzso who were subsequently separated into two even groups zzso and zzso The optical zzso device was applied to measure the thickness of subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso While zzso was similar, male athletes showed a zzso lower total SAT thickness compared to their male zzso zzso Even though female athletes had significantly higher zzso and weight scores, their total SAT thickness was zzso lower than their zzso zzso These results suggest subcutaneous fat patterns are a better screening tool to characterize zzso in physically active young zzso
