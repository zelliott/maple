To review recent advances in the zzso and potential clinical applications of zzso an zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso search of the literature on zzso and the zzso of relevant zzso 

All zzso publications on zzso 

All identified articles were zzso zzso publications were selected on the basis of study quality and relevance to human obesity and zzso 

zzso is a zzso zzso hormone that zzso in the serum in the free and bound zzso zzso levels of zzso reflect the amount of energy stored in zzso zzso zzso energy imbalance as well as serum levels of several zzso and hormones influence circulating zzso zzso zzso acts by binding to specific receptors in the zzso to alter the expression of several zzso that regulate neuroendocrine function and energy intake and zzso Thus, zzso plays an important role in the zzso of obesity and eating disorders and is thought to mediate the neuroendocrine response to food zzso Phase I and II trials recently showed that zzso administration to humans is safe, and ongoing phase III trials are assessing the efficacy of zzso as a treatment for obesity and related zzso zzso of zzso or smaller and more soluble zzso zzso for clinical studies in humans is expected to significantly advance understanding of the mechanisms underlying energy zzso in zzso 

zzso is significantly broadening our understanding of the mechanisms underlying neuroendocrine function, body weight, and energy zzso zzso of these mechanisms is expected to result in the development of novel therapeutic approaches for obesity and eating zzso
