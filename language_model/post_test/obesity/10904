To study resting zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso and 24 h zzso activity evaluated by zzso of zzso zzso and adrenaline zzso in obese male subjects before and after weight zzso 

Blood samples were collected in obese subjects and in controls after an overnight zzso 

zzso and fat distribution zzso plasma and zzso zzso and A, zzso beta zzso zzso zzso and zzso subset zzso 

zzso zzso plasma zzso at rest was significantly elevated in the obese subjects and correlated to the body mass index and zzso blood zzso zzso zzso and A zzso however, zzso to the body fat % in obese zzso Further analysis showed that zzso zzso and A were reduced in obese subjects with body fat % above zzso but not in the other zzso Weight reduction zzso both zzso zzso plasma zzso and zzso zzso and zzso beta zzso zzso correlated positively to the frequency of zzso and zzso cells in the blood and zzso to plasma A, but there was no difference in the zzso level, zzso zzso and zzso subset composition between obese and zzso 

zzso activity at rest as evaluated by zzso zzso plasma zzso was increased in the obese male subjects and this zzso was related to the increase in body mass index and the zzso blood zzso zzso zzso and A, which is likely to reflect 24 h plasma zzso zzso were reduced in obese subjects with a body fat % above zzso probably due to a reduced physical activity in these zzso Both zzso parameters were zzso by weight zzso
