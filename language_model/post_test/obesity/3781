zzso fat assessed using zzso is associated with abdominal visceral zzso tissue and cardiovascular risk zzso Because of its location, zzso fat may directly affect the coronary zzso and zzso through local zzso of zzso zzso This study examines the effects of weight loss after zzso surgery on zzso zzso tissue in patients with severe zzso Clinical data and zzso of 23 patients with severe obesity who had zzso recorded before and zzso zzso zzso months after undergoing zzso surgery were zzso zzso zzso fat thickness was measured as the zzso space anterior to the right zzso in both the zzso long- and zzso views, and an average was zzso At zzso patients had increased zzso fat compared with zzso controls matched for age, zzso and ethnicity zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso fat thickness was associated with the patient's initial weight in severely obese patients zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Patients lost an average of 40 zzso 14 zzso after zzso zzso fat thickness decreased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Change in zzso fat correlated with initial zzso fat thickness measured using zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso In conclusion, zzso fat thickness decreases in severely obese patients who have substantial weight loss after zzso zzso zzso zzso fat thickness using zzso may be useful to monitor visceral fat loss with weight reduction zzso
