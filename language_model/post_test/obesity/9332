In this review we assess the range of centrally active zzso that are either in human clinical trials, or are likely to be so in the near zzso We describe their weight loss zzso mode of action at both pharmacological and zzso levels, where zzso together with the range of side effects that might be expected in clinical zzso We have however evaluated these compounds against the considerably more rigorous criteria that are now being used by the Federal Drugs Agency and European zzso Agency to decide approvals and market zzso Several trends are zzso Recent advances in the understanding of energy balance control have resulted in the exploitation of a number of new targets, some of which have yielded promising data in clinical trials for weight zzso A second major trend is derived from the hypothesis that improved weight loss efficacy over current therapy is most likely to emerge from treatments targeting multiple mechanisms of energy balance zzso This reasoning has led to the development of a number of new treatments for obesity where multiple mechanisms are targeted, either by a single zzso such as zzso or through drug combinations such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso Many of these approaches also zzso advances in zzso technology to widen safety zzso Finally, the practicality of zzso therapies for obesity has become better validated in recent studies and this may allow more rapid exploitation of novel targets, rather than awaiting the development of orally available small zzso We conclude that novel, more zzso and better tolerated treatments for obesity may become available in the near zzso
