To characterize the gastrointestinal tract at the onset and in well-established zzso 

zzso zzso and obese zzso male zzso rats lacking a functional zzso zzso were killed at zzso weeks and 9 months of age and plasma zzso of zzso hormones zzso The small zzso zzso and stomach were measured, zzso and zzso levels of zzso genes zzso 

At the onset of zzso obese rats had greater zzso zzso and liver mass when adjusted for body weight compared to lean zzso zzso adult rats with established obesity had lower zzso and colon mass and length after adjustment for body zzso Early changes in gene expression included decreased zzso zzso levels in stomach and increased zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso of young obese zzso After massive zzso of zzso tissue had occurred, adult obese rats had increased zzso and zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso In the zzso small zzso obese rats had lower zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Finally, at the onset and in well-established zzso obese rats had higher plasma insulin, zzso zzso like zzso zzso and zzso a finding, with the exception of insulin, unique to this zzso Plasma total zzso levels were significantly lower at the onset of obesity and established obesity compared to the lean zzso 

Several defects are zzso in the obese gut early on in the disease before the zzso of large excesses of body fat and represent potential targets for early intervention in zzso
