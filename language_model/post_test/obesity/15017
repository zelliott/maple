zzso and zzso zzso hormones produced by zzso have recently been reported to be associated with prostate cancer risk, though, the relationship remains poorly zzso We examined the association of zzso and zzso levels in serum with prostate cancer risk after adjustments for age, zzso factors, and prostate cancer zzso 

zzso prostate cancer patients and 70 control subjects provided blood sampled between 2008 and zzso Using those, we determined serum zzso and zzso levels, and evaluated their relationships with prostate cancer risk after adjustments for age, zzso factors zzso weight, body mass index, waist zzso and prostate zzso zzso zzso were calculated by dividing serum level with prostate zzso 

There were no differences for median serum zzso and zzso levels between the prostate cancer and benign control groups zzso and zzso zzso Patients with levels of both zzso in the highest zzso after adjustment for age had significantly higher risks of prostate cancer zzso odds ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso OR zzso zzso Patients with an zzso level greater than the median after adjustment for body weight also had a significantly elevated risk of prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso those with a zzso level significantly greater than the median had a significantly lower risk zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, median zzso density was significantly higher in the prostate cancer group than the benign group zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso levels are useful markers for prostate cancer risk after adjustments for age, zzso factors, and prostate zzso
