Although it has been hypothesized that the zzso relation is zzso few studies have addressed this hypothesis in a prospective zzso We aimed to examine the zzso relationship in middle-aged and elderly zzso 

A total of zzso women aged zzso years in the zzso Health Study were zzso followed from 1996 to 2006 with updated information on body weight, depression status and various zzso every 2 zzso Depression was defined as self-report of zzso depression and/or zzso zzso zzso was defined as a zzso zzso zzso The first three waves zzso were used as the baseline period and the last three waves zzso were used as the follow-up zzso 

After adjusting for baseline age, physical activity, zzso zzso and other zzso depression at the baseline period was associated with an increased risk of obesity at the follow-up period in all women zzso odds ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso and baseline non-obese women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the opposite direction, after adjusting for baseline age, physical activity, zzso depression status and other zzso obese women at baseline had a moderately increased risk of depression at the follow-up period compared with zzso women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and this association was similar for new onset of depression zzso for obese versus normal weight women, zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our results suggest a zzso association between depression and obesity in middle-aged and elderly zzso Future studies are needed to confirm our findings in different zzso and investigate the potential mechanisms underlying this zzso Our results underscore the importance of early detection and proper behavioral modifications to lower the burden of both zzso
