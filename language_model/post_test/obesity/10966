The purpose of this study was to determine whether obese adolescents eat more zzso zzso foods than non-obese zzso 

Using a zzso design, 22 non-obese and 21 obese adolescents kept zzso food zzso Records provided estimates of total daily energy intake and caloric intake from five categories of zzso zzso zzso zzso candy, chips, soda, baked goods, and ice zzso Body composition was determined by zzso dilution and daily energy expenditure by doubly labeled zzso Percentage of energy intake reported zzso was calculated as the ratio of reported energy intake to measured energy expenditure zzso zzso 

Both groups underreported energy zzso but the percentage reported was significantly greater in the non-obese group zzso non-obese zzso zzso obese, zzso zzso of calories from chips and soda was similar among non-obese and obese zzso However, total energy intake from all HC foods was higher in the non-obese group than among the obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and represented zzso and zzso of reported energy intake in the non-obese and obese groups, zzso After adjustment for zzso the percentage of calories provided by each of the HC foods was similar in the obese and non-obese groups except for ice cream, which remained significantly greater in the non-obese group zzso 

Our findings suggest that both non-obese and obese adolescents consume a substantial portion of reported calories from HC foods and that obese adolescents do not consume more calories from these foods than non-obese zzso These data offer no evidence to support the widespread notion that obese adolescents eat more zzso zzso than non-obese zzso Health professionals who treat obese adolescents must be aware that the excess calories in their diets may come from a variety of food sources and not solely from zzso snack zzso
