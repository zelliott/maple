One of the challenges when zzso economic evaluations of weight management interventions is to adequately assess future health zzso Clinical trials commonly measure impacts using surrogate zzso such as reductions in body mass index, and investigators need to decide how these can best be used to predict future health zzso Since obesity is associated with an increased risk of numerous chronic diseases occurring at different future time points, zzso is needed for zzso 

To assess the methods used in economic evaluations to determine health impacts of weight management interventions and to investigate whether differences in methods affect the zzso zzso 

Eight databases were systematically zzso Included studies were zzso according to a decision zzso approach and effect measures zzso 

A total of 44 articles were zzso 21 evaluated zzso interventions, 12 evaluated surgical procedures and 11 evaluated pharmacological zzso Of the 27 papers that estimated future impacts, zzso used zzso zzso seven used a decision tree, five used a mathematical application, two used zzso simulation and the zzso method was unclear in two zzso The most common types of effects included were zzso treatment costs, zzso quality of life due to weight loss and gain in zzso Only 12 of the studies included zzso quality of life gains due to reduced zzso and only one study included productivity zzso Despite consensus that zzso analysis on its own is inadequate in guiding resource allocation decisions, it was used in zzso of the zzso Several of the zzso papers used model structures not suitable for chronic diseases with changing health zzso Three studies concluded that the intervention dominated standard care; meaning that it generated more zzso zzso zzso for less zzso The incremental costs per zzso gained varied from zzso to zzso in the remaining studies using this outcome zzso An implicit hypothesis of the review was that studies including long-term health effects would illustrate greater cost effectiveness compared with zzso zzso This hypothesis is partly confirmed with three studies arriving at dominating results, as these reach their conclusion from zzso future zzso treatment cost zzso However, for the remaining studies there is little indication that zzso zzso disparities explain the zzso 

This is the first literature review comparing methods used in economic evaluations of weight management interventions, and it is the first time that observed differences in study results are addressed with a view to zzso zzso We conclude that many studies have zzso deficiencies and we urge analysts to follow recommended practices and use models capable of depicting long-term health zzso
