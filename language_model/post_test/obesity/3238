The aim of the present work was to study the potential involvement of zzso zzso system in the zzso mechanism of zzso in obese zzso zzso Male obese zzso zzso rats were administered zzso (10 zzso zzso daily for two zzso The control group was given zzso zzso zzso zzso decreases in food zzso final body weight and total body fat were observed after zzso zzso Although zzso rats showed a decrease in urine zzso this effect was not enough to compensate decreased water zzso leading to dehydration, as showed by decreased body water zzso zzso zzso administration increased the numbers of zzso positively zzso neural cells in zzso and lateral zzso areas, lateral zzso area and zzso nucleus zzso and zzso zzso without changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Taken into account that zzso stimulates zzso these results could represent rather a zzso response against reduced food intake than a direct zzso zzso Changes in the zzso region of the zzso zzso nucleus suggest a role for zzso neural circuits at this level in zzso zzso zzso
