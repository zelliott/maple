zzso is considered as independent predictor of cardiovascular zzso Patients treated with zzso zzso exhibit elevated homocysteine levels, even four times higher than the general population zzso This study focuses on the determination of the vascular risk in patients treated with conventional HD and zzso zzso zzso It was also considered important to determine whether there was a relationship between homocysteine and the variables given to the patient such as dialysis dose, obesity and treatment with zzso acid, vitamin B6 and vitamin zzso A one-year zzso zzso study was conducted on patients initially treated with zzso replacement therapy such as zzso zzso and conventional zzso Data collected included patient's age, sex, zzso duration of dialysis treatment and association with dialysis session, including data on body mass index, waist zzso treatment with vitamin zzso B12 and zzso zzso The results obtained zzso indicate that patients treated with zzso replacement therapy such as zzso zzso exhibit lower homocysteine levels than those treated with conventional zzso Therefore we can conclude that: homocysteine markers indicate that patients treated with zzso zzso are exposed to lower average vascular zzso
