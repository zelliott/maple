We investigated whether obese children and adolescents have early zzso signs of zzso cardiac dysfunction and evaluated the respective influence of obesity per zzso versus parameters of zzso and zzso metabolism that are frequently abnormal in obese zzso The role of tissue zzso imaging as a screening tool for these abnormalities was zzso Blood pressure and zzso zzso including tissue zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were evaluated in 49 obese children and adolescents and 45 age and sex matched zzso The respective influence of obesity versus parameters of zzso and zzso metabolism was examined with linear zzso zzso zzso subjects showed significantly larger left zzso wall dimensions zzso wall, zzso and left zzso mass zzso and signs of early zzso filling abnormalities on conventional and tissue zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso Multiple zzso analysis showed that mainly zzso scores and/or body surface area explained significant proportions of the zzso of the early cardiac zzso In conclusion, young, obese children and adolescents have significant changes in left zzso wall dimensions and early zzso filling compared with zzso zzso zzso per zzso and not the parameters of zzso and zzso metabolism predicted the early cardiac zzso
