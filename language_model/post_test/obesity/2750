Most studies identify the American Society of Anesthesiology zzso zzso as the most significant risk factor for zzso The risk factors operative within zzso I and II patients are not well zzso zzso we analyzed zzso collected data to identify the risk factors of zzso in such zzso 

A combination of a narcotic and zzso was used for sedation and oxygen was supplemented if zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses were performed and correlations estimated for predetermined clinical zzso 

40 of 79 patients zzso developed zzso which occurred more frequently in the obese zzso zzso than the zzso zzso zzso group zzso On zzso analysis, the odds ratios zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso for developing zzso were zzso 60 years zzso zzso zzso and incremental zzso doses of zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Body mass index zzso significantly correlated with the number of zzso episodes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso I and II patients, zzso significantly correlated with the number of zzso episodes, whereas zzso 60 years and zzso dose were significant risk factors for zzso
