The prevalence of chronic kidney disease zzso is on the rise in all ethnic zzso This is because of the increased prevalence of zzso diabetes zzso the zzso syndrome, and the inadequate control of elevated blood pressure and other zzso risk factors, especially in ethnic minority zzso The implications of the aforementioned trends in risk factor prevalence and control are zzso Moreover, these trends zzso impact patient quality of life and place an enormous financial burden on the health care system for the provision of care to patients with zzso zzso zzso disease zzso and/or cardiovascular disease zzso Thus, it is of utmost importance to devise strategies that prevent kidney disease and delay progressive loss of kidney function in persons with zzso zzso strategies include pharmacological interventions that lower blood pressure to less than target levels zzso zzso zzso zzso of optimal zzso control zzso zzso zzso and reducing urinary protein zzso It is also possible, although yet zzso that correction of anemia and aggressive treatment of zzso may zzso the loss of kidney zzso In general, ethnic minorities are underrepresented in most large zzso Recently, a few outcome clinical trials in blacks have reinforced the lessons of kidney function preservation already learned in zzso zzso That is, the zzso risk factors for zzso appear to be virtually identical and, at least in zzso zzso pharmacological targeting of the zzso system zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso II zzso zzso preserves kidney function better than zzso blood zzso regimens, especially when significant zzso zzso Although more zzso studies in ethnic minorities are needed, until they become available, the best available evidence from the existing clinical trial database should be applied to minorities with zzso when specific data are not available for a specific racial or ethnic zzso Why this zzso First, there are no known unique risk factors for kidney disease in any ethnic zzso Second, poor control of zzso risk factors for zzso is universal, particularly in blacks and other ethnic zzso Thus, it is logical to predict that more efficient use of strategies proven to zzso loss of kidney function will reduce the excess of zzso and zzso in ethnic minorities relative to zzso zzso However, zzso strategies alone are probably not zzso The global epidemic of obesity will fuel the growing population of zzso especially among ethnic minorities, with diabetes, the main cause of zzso zzso and zzso The obesity and diabetes zzso are unlikely to abate without innovative and ultimately effective public health zzso
