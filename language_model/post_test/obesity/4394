Common zzso in zzso (the fat zzso and zzso zzso associate with obesity and type 2 zzso The regulation and biological function of zzso zzso expression in target tissue is zzso We investigated the genetic and zzso regulation of zzso zzso in skeletal muscle and zzso tissue and their influence on in zzso zzso and fat zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso was zzso in two twin zzso 1) zzso elderly twins aged zzso years with zzso tolerance ranging from normal to type 2 diabetes and 2) 196 young zzso zzso and elderly zzso zzso zzso twins examined by a zzso clamp including indirect zzso zzso zzso expression was determined in subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso and skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso expression in both zzso was low, and zzso expression was not influenced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in skeletal muscle was regulated by age and sex, whereas age and zzso were zzso of zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso tissue was associated with an zzso zzso zzso In skeletal muscle, zzso zzso expression was zzso associated to fat and positively to zzso zzso rates as well as positively correlated with expression of genes involved in zzso zzso including zzso 

The zzso of zzso expression in zzso tissue and skeletal muscle is low and not influenced by zzso zzso zzso The zzso decline in zzso expression is associated with peripheral defects of zzso and fat zzso
