By studying zzso risk factors in children born after maternal zzso diversion zzso surgery zzso compared with those in children born before maternal surgery zzso we tested the hypothesis that significant maternal weight loss may modify zzso factors transmitted via the zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso blood levels were studied in 49 mothers who had lost 36 zzso zzso body weight sustained for 12 zzso zzso zzso and their 111 children (54 zzso and 57 zzso aged zzso zzso 

zzso children had lower birth weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso associated with a reduced prevalence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso with no difference in zzso At the time of zzso zzso children exhibited zzso lower prevalence of severe obesity (11 zzso zzso P zzso zzso greater insulin sensitivity zzso model assessment of insulin resistance index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso improved zzso profile zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso lower zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso than zzso offspring zzso zzso zzso respectively, for zzso 

This unique study of children aged zzso zzso born before and after maternal zzso surgery demonstrated improvements in zzso markers sustained into adolescence, attributable to an improved zzso zzso
