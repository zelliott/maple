The aim of the study was to investigate whether the absence of increased 5 zzso activity explained the absence of zzso in zzso obese women with increased free testosterone zzso zzso 

As in zzso there generally exists evidence for increased 5 zzso activity, we measured, as parameters of 5 zzso activity, plasma levels of 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as their precursor levels in obese women without zzso obese zzso women, non-obese zzso women, and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso women zzso years old) were zzso in four age matched groups: 39 controls, 18 obese without zzso 11 non-obese zzso and 14 obese zzso zzso 

Blood samples were taken between days 5 and 7 of the zzso zzso zzso hormone levels were measured by zzso Free testosterone levels were measured by equilibrium zzso 

Compared to controls, mean free testosterone levels were increased zzso less than zzso in obese, obese zzso and zzso patients, whereas mean zzso levels were increased in zzso and obese zzso zzso less than zzso but not in obese, zzso Mean zzso zzso levels were markedly increased in zzso and obese zzso patients zzso less than zzso but not in obese zzso Plasma zzso zzso levels were increased in zzso zzso less than zzso in the normal range in obese zzso and decreased in obese women zzso less than zzso 

These results show that, despite the presence of higher free testosterone levels, neither 5 zzso activity (as suggested by normal zzso zzso zzso nor adrenal zzso precursor levels zzso are increased in obese women without zzso
