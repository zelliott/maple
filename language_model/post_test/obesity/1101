We investigated the role of insulin and zzso in the zzso of hypertension associated with zzso The comparative effects of an oral zzso load and of an zzso infusion on plasma zzso plasma insulin and blood pressures zzso were assessed in lean zzso and in obese zzso zzso zzso zzso (75 g in 1-2 zzso induced a small but significant lowering of zzso in lean zzso but failed to modify zzso in obese zzso zzso infusion (30 zzso 500 zzso total zzso reduced zzso significantly greater reductions in zzso and zzso zzso were observed in obese zzso than in the control zzso Both oral zzso and zzso induced greater increases in plasma insulin in obese zzso than in lean zzso zzso dysfunction which accompanies the insulin resistant state of zzso zzso intolerance and hypertension, may account for the different zzso effects induced by zzso and zzso in obese zzso and lean zzso
