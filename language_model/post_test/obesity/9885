The zzso growth factor 2 zzso zzso located within a cluster of imprinted genes on zzso zzso encodes a fetal and zzso growth factor affecting birth zzso DNA zzso zzso at the zzso gene locus has been previously reported but its consequences on fetal growth and development are still mostly unknown in normal pediatric zzso We collected one hundred zzso zzso from 50 women with corresponding maternal and zzso blood samples and measured zzso zzso blood pressure and zzso zzso using standardized zzso zzso DNA zzso and zzso circulating levels were assessed using sodium zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso DNA zzso levels were correlated with zzso fetal growth zzso such as weight, and with maternal zzso circulating concentration at the third zzso of pregnancy, whereas zzso zzso DNA zzso levels were correlated with zzso levels in zzso zzso The maternal zzso of a known zzso zzso zzso was associated with birth zzso Taken together, we showed that zzso zzso and zzso independently account for zzso of the zzso weight zzso No association was observed with maternal diabetic status, zzso zzso or prenatal maternal body mass zzso This is the first study showing that DNA zzso at the zzso genes locus may act as a zzso of zzso zzso fetal growth and development within normal zzso zzso DNA zzso could represent a cornerstone in linking birth weight and fetal zzso programming of late onset zzso
