The acquired component of complex traits is difficult to dissect in zzso zzso represents such a zzso in which the zzso and molecular consequences emerge from complex interactions of genes and zzso With the substantial morbidity associated with zzso a deeper understanding of the concurrent zzso changes is of considerable zzso The goal of this study was to investigate this important acquired component and expose zzso changes in biological pathways in an identical genetic zzso 

We used a special study design of zzso zzso rare zzso twins zzso for obesity identified through a national registry of zzso young, healthy twin zzso A total of 14 pairs were studied zzso male, six zzso zzso with a mean zzso standard zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso y and a body mass index zzso difference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso DNA zzso in subcutaneous fat and peripheral zzso revealed no zzso zzso between the zzso However, zzso copy number was reduced by zzso in the obese zzso zzso In addition, novel zzso analyses of the zzso tissue zzso profiles exposed significant zzso of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso In line with this finding, serum levels of insulin zzso zzso were increased in obese male zzso zzso increase, p zzso zzso zzso clinical relevance to the findings, in both sexes the observed aberrations in zzso zzso acid metabolism pathways in fat correlated closely with liver fat zzso insulin resistance, and zzso early aberrations of acquired obesity in these healthy young zzso 

Our findings emphasize a substantial role of zzso zzso and zzso acid metabolism in obesity and development of insulin zzso
