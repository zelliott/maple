zzso from zzso and zzso in human zzso and subcutaneous fat cells were studied as functions of zzso cell size and number in adult zzso Since subcutaneous fat cells were larger than those prepared from the greater zzso a comparison could be made of the metabolism of different sizes of cells within individual zzso Rates per cell of zzso and zzso acid synthesis from zzso were similar in zzso and subcutaneous fat cells incubated in the presence or absence of zzso However, subcutaneous fat cells exhibited higher rates of zzso zzso than zzso fat cells and these differences were maintained when zzso was zzso with zzso Different rates of zzso were not zzso after zzso with zzso indicating that subcutaneous fat cells were less responsive to this hormone than smaller zzso fat zzso zzso and partial correlation analysis showed that differences in zzso and zzso zzso between fat cells prepared from different subjects and between zzso and subcutaneous fat cells could be accounted for by differences in zzso cell zzso In subcutaneous fat cells highly significant zzso were demonstrated between cell volume, zzso zzso and the zzso conversion of zzso to zzso There was no correlation between fat cell volume, age, or relative obesity and the effects of zzso or insulin on zzso or zzso from zzso in zzso when the data were expressed as percentage changes above zzso zzso
