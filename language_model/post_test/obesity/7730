Of zzso women meeting inclusion criteria, zzso were zzso zzso normal weight, zzso overweight, and zzso zzso zzso class I, zzso class II, and zzso class III, zzso After controlling for potential zzso zzso less than recommended rates of second- and zzso weight gain were associated with increased odds of zzso zzso in all zzso groups except obese classes II and zzso Greater than recommended rates of weight gain were associated with increased odds of zzso zzso in all zzso groups and increased odds of zzso delivery in all zzso groups with the exception of zzso and obese class III zzso
