Despite the well-known recidivism of zzso surprisingly little is known about the composition of body weight during weight zzso 

The objective of this study was to determine whether the composition of body weight regained after intentional weight loss is similar to the composition of body weight zzso 

The design was a follow-up to a zzso controlled trial of weight loss in which body composition was analyzed and compared in 78 zzso women before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and 6 and 12 zzso after the zzso 

All body mass and composition variables were lower immediately after weight loss than at baseline (all P zzso More fat than lean mass was lost with weight loss, which resulted in zzso changes favoring a lower percentage of body fat and a higher zzso mass ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in weight regain was noted zzso zzso zzso In women who regained zzso zzso body weight, a decreasing trend in the zzso mass ratio was observed, which indicated greater fat mass zzso than lean mass zzso zzso zzso Specifically, for every 1 zzso fat lost during the weight-loss intervention, zzso zzso lean tissue was zzso for every 1 zzso fat regained over the following year, only zzso zzso lean tissue was zzso 

Although not all zzso women who intentionally lose weight will regain it within 1 zzso the data suggest that fat mass is regained to a greater degree than is lean mass in those who do experience some weight zzso The health ramifications of our findings remain to be zzso
