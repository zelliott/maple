To identify the genetic zzso of obesity using zzso and zzso models in a zzso zzso 

We evaluated the genetic and environmental effects and performed a zzso linkage analysis of zzso traits in zzso subjects from 105 Mexican-American nuclear families zzso through a zzso with documented coronary artery zzso The available obesity traits include zzso body surface area zzso zzso ratio zzso and trunk fat mass as percentage of body zzso zzso estimates and zzso linkage analysis were performed using a zzso components procedure implemented in zzso zzso 

The zzso estimates were zzso for zzso zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for trunk fat mass as percentage of body zzso Using a zzso genetic model, we observed significant genetic correlations between zzso and other zzso traits (all p zzso Evidence for zzso linkage was observed at 252 to approximately 267 zzso on zzso 2 for three zzso traits (except for zzso and at zzso to approximately 167 zzso on zzso 5 for zzso and zzso with the maximum zzso of the odds ratio score of zzso zzso p value, zzso for zzso on zzso zzso Use of the zzso linkage model yielded an additional peak zzso of the odds ratio zzso zzso empirical p value, zzso at 25 zzso on zzso 7 for the pair of zzso and zzso 

The evidence for linkage on zzso zzso and zzso is supported both by zzso and zzso analysis, and an additional linkage peak at zzso was identified by the zzso zzso This suggests that use of the zzso model provides additional information to identify linkage of genes responsible for zzso zzso
