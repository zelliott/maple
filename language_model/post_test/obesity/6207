To bridge the beneficial zzso effects of pronounced weight loss on one side and the data on morbidity and mortality on the other side, we investigated the impact of profound weight loss on structural and functional markers of early zzso 

zzso obese adults were examined before and 18 months after zzso zzso zzso zzso thickness zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and abdominal fat distribution were assessed by high-resolution zzso Surgery resulted in a body mass index decrease of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso improvements in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso thickness diminished from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso improved from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 25; P zzso Both zzso and zzso were associated with zzso fat zzso 

The present results demonstrate that zzso zzso diminution of visceral fat improves both functional and structural markers of early zzso providing a link between the weight zzso improvements of traditional and zzso risk factors and the reduced long-term morbidity and mortality after zzso zzso
