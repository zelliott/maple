Central neural activity was assessed by measuring relative zzso zzso zzso activity in the zzso nucleus zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso nucleus zzso feeding zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in 10 zzso pairs of zzso to zzso zzso zzso When obese zzso were compared to lean zzso rats, relative CO activity was significantly lower zzso 10 percent) in the zzso and zzso zzso but not in the zzso zzso Cell diameters did not zzso To determine if there were corresponding differences in levels or release of zzso zzso we compared 7 pairs of zzso to zzso lean zzso and obese zzso rats at rest and after 2 h of 9 degrees zzso zzso zzso from frozen zzso zzso and zzso area (the latter being a site of zzso units modulating zzso zzso were zzso In obese zzso lean zzso rats, we observed lower zzso of: zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso + zzso zzso of total zzso in the zzso area; and zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso Additionally, in the zzso cold exposure resulted in: elevated zzso of zzso and zzso + zzso in both lean and obese zzso elevated zzso of zzso zzso and zzso + zzso in obese rats, with no significant changes in these variables in lean zzso decreased ratio of zzso in obese rats and increased ratio in zzso In the zzso region, cold exposure led to increased zzso of zzso zzso + zzso zzso and zzso + zzso in obese but not lean zzso In the zzso zzso zzso were increased in zzso obese but not lean zzso Our data support the hypothesis that zzso activity in obese rats differs from that of lean rats at rest and during cold exposure and suggest that several zzso systems play a role in such zzso
