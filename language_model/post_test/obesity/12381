zzso plays an important role in several zzso processes such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso has two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso has zzso functions, while zzso acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of the zzso family and is considered zzso Although zzso and its zzso are zzso in a wide variety of human zzso such as zzso head and neck, and lung cancer, their role in zzso zzso has not been zzso 

We measured by quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction the zzso expression of zzso and zzso in a series of 20 zzso zzso paired with adjacent normal zzso 

zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso in zzso samples, while zzso was zzso zzso in cancer zzso Further analysis revealed that the zzso zzso ratio shifted from zzso in normal samples to zzso in tumor zzso zzso analysis also revealed an association of zzso expression with high body mass index zzso zzso zzso late menopause zzso zzso zzso and lower tumor grade zzso zzso zzso zzso was also correlated with grade zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso 

These results indicate that both zzso zzso and especially zzso play an important role in the development and progression of grade zzso zzso zzso especially in obese and zzso zzso
