In animals, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso and activity in liver and zzso zzso respectively, and zzso zzso reduce zzso zzso from zzso zzso 

Our objective was to test whether zzso zzso alter cortisol zzso and peripheral zzso by zzso in humans and whether reduced cortisol action contributes to zzso effects of zzso zzso 

Three zzso zzso crossover studies were conducted at a clinical research zzso 

Healthy men and patients with type 2 diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso AND zzso In nine healthy men, 7 d of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso had no effect on cortisol zzso zzso cortisol generation after oral zzso administration, or zzso zzso during zzso infusion, although zzso marginally reduced cortisol generation in zzso zzso tissue measured by in zzso zzso In 12 healthy men, 4-5 zzso of zzso increased insulin sensitivity during insulin infusion but did not change zzso zzso or activity in zzso zzso zzso and insulin zzso was unaffected by zzso blockade with a combination of zzso and zzso In 12 men with type 2 diabetes 12 zzso of zzso reduced zzso zzso extraction across abdominal zzso zzso tissue and reduced zzso zzso in zzso zzso tissue but increased plasma cortisol zzso 

Neither zzso nor zzso zzso zzso zzso or cortisol zzso acutely in zzso The early zzso effect of zzso is not dependent on reducing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and increased plasma cortisol during longer therapy with zzso probably reflect indirect effects, zzso zzso by changes in body zzso
