The involvement of zzso zzso in the development of zzso obesity and in the zzso adaptations of zzso zzso zzso metabolism were zzso zzso were fed either zzso zzso which maintains a low zzso zzso or a diet high in zzso and fat zzso that increases zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso similar to those that define the zzso syndrome in zzso The zzso status was manipulated through zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Compared with zzso the zzso diet increased energy intake zzso and whole body zzso and zzso tissue zzso zzso The zzso diet also increased the acute zzso rise in plasma insulin zzso and zzso zzso zzso liver zzso content zzso zzso zzso and zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso activity zzso zzso decreased energy intake and whole body and zzso tissue weights in both dietary zzso but more so in zzso than in zzso zzso These zzso effects were totally prevented by Cort replacement in rats fed zzso but only partially so in those fed the zzso diet in proportion to the degree of restoration of energy zzso In the zzso zzso the above indexes of zzso metabolism remained unaffected by the Cort status, whereas in the zzso zzso these variables were decreased by zzso to levels of zzso zzso Cort replacement in the zzso animals restored indexes of zzso metabolism to intact levels and zzso the zzso differences observed in intact zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso metabolism only minimally when a diet that maintains a low zzso flux is zzso In contrast, their presence is a necessary condition for the development of zzso obesity and the zzso zzso in insulin sensitivity and zzso zzso zzso
