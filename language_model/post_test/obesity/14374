To investigate the reasons for the lack of sex differences in high density zzso zzso observed in population studies of the zzso Indians, we selected 18 lean (9 men, 9 women, body mass index zzso less than zzso and 22 obese (12 men, 10 women, zzso greater than zzso zzso Indians for an zzso study of HDL zzso We measured zzso activities and steroid hormone zzso both of which have previously been implicated in the control of zzso The lean women had higher zzso of HDL and zzso than did either the obese women or the lean or obese zzso zzso women had significantly lower zzso zzso activities and significantly higher zzso of zzso compared to obese zzso zzso women also had different zzso zzso as indicated by the zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso negative correlations between HDL and obesity measured by either zzso or percent body fat were observed in both zzso but the slope of the relationship was steeper in zzso zzso negative associations were observed between HDL or zzso zzso and zzso zzso in both zzso and there were significant positive associations between zzso and plasma zzso in zzso The data suggest that obesity in this population has a stronger negative influence on HDL zzso in women, possibly through changes in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Since there are so few lean women in the zzso population, the net result is that HDL levels in women in the population as a whole do not differ from those of zzso
