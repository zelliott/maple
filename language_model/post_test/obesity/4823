Past studies have suggested that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is damaged in zzso muscles zzso zzso of obese zzso In this study, we used obese zzso in an attempt to determine whether the zzso zzso zzso zzso is abnormal in zzso muscles (red zzso which are responsible for most daily zzso zzso expression levels of the zzso stress sensor zzso protein zzso zzso its upstream zzso zzso its downstream protein zzso and the zzso zzso protein 4 zzso in the red zzso muscle were measured under either resting or stress conditions zzso of swimming or zzso zzso in both lean and obese zzso rats zzso for each zzso At rest, obese rats displayed higher zzso plasma insulin levels and increased muscle zzso and zzso zzso levels compared with lean zzso No significant difference was found in the protein levels of zzso total zzso or membrane zzso between the obese and lean control zzso After one hour of zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels and the amount of zzso zzso to the plasma membrane were significantly elevated in lean rats but remained unchanged in obese rats relative to their resting zzso One hour zzso zzso did not cause significant changes in the zzso zzso in either lean or obese zzso This study demonstrated that the zzso zzso was altered at zzso levels and after exercise stimulation in the zzso muscle of obese zzso zzso
