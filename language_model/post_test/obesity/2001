zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso mice zzso human zzso in the beta cells of the zzso of zzso should be useful in identifying factors important for the deposition of zzso as zzso zzso zzso 

zzso mice expressing human zzso were examined using several experimental models for the production of persistent zzso as well as for the zzso and/or zzso of beta cell zzso zzso was induced by zzso zzso zzso was produced by long-term administration of zzso or by partial zzso zzso of normal beta cell zzso by zzso administration, with or without concurrent zzso injections, was carried out to increase zzso of zzso zzso The human zzso gene was also introduced into the zzso and zzso mouse models for zzso Finally, isolated zzso cultivated in zzso at high zzso concentration were also zzso 

No zzso deposits were found in the zzso of any of the animals, either by light zzso after zzso red zzso or by electron zzso after zzso labeling with zzso specific for human zzso zzso treatment resulted in increased numbers of zzso in the beta cell and the appearance of large zzso bodies without zzso However, zzso from zzso and zzso mice expressing human zzso cultivated in zzso in the presence of zzso and/or growth hormone, were found to contain zzso zzso deposits reacting with zzso to human zzso 

zzso of human zzso or increased zzso are not sufficient for zzso zzso This indicates that other factors must influence zzso zzso one such factor may be the local clearance of zzso
