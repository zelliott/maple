As a sexual zzso appears in plasma zzso levels, the aim of the present study was to zzso in zzso and in zzso the influence of sex steroid hormones on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressions in rat fat cells from various anatomical zzso In male rats, zzso resulted in a zzso of zzso gene zzso expression which was increased by zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, in isolated fat cells from both zzso and zzso fat zzso zzso gene zzso expression was reduced by zzso after a zzso in zzso exposure to zzso zzso zzso This effect of zzso on zzso zzso was prevented by exposure to the zzso zzso zzso and also by zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso from both zzso and zzso zzso was unchanged after 24 h exposure to zzso In female rats, zzso induced a zzso decrease in zzso gene zzso expression in zzso fat zzso In zzso studies revealed that a zzso exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a zzso zzso and zzso increase in zzso zzso expression and a zzso zzso and zzso increase in zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, these effects were prevented by the zzso zzso and also by zzso zzso Altogether, these results demonstrate that in rat zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene expression at the zzso level through sex steroid zzso zzso zzso
