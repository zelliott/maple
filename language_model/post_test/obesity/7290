Data are limited on the effects of controlled zzso exercise programs (without weight zzso on insulin sensitivity and zzso metabolism in children and zzso 

To determine whether a controlled zzso exercise program (without weight zzso improves peripheral and zzso insulin sensitivity and affects zzso production zzso zzso and zzso in sedentary lean and obese Hispanic zzso 

zzso zzso adolescents zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso body fat and 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso body zzso zzso zzso zzso completed a 12 zzso zzso exercise program (4 zzso 30 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso insulin sensitivity and zzso zzso were zzso using zzso zzso and zzso 

No weight loss zzso zzso and obese participants complied well with the program ( approximately zzso of the exercise sessions attended, resulting in approximately zzso increase in fitness in both zzso zzso and zzso insulin sensitivity were higher in lean than obese adolescents but increased in both zzso peripheral insulin sensitivity by 35 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 59 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso insulin sensitivity by 19 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 23 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not differ between the zzso zzso decreased slightly, 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso remained zzso while zzso decreased slightly in the obese group zzso zzso 

This well accepted zzso exercise program, without weight loss, is a promising strategy to improve peripheral and zzso insulin sensitivity in lean and obese sedentary zzso The small decrease in zzso is probably of limited clinical zzso
