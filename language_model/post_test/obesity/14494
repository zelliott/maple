The objective of this study was to investigate the contribution of insulin resistance, zzso and zzso independently of other major factors, to changes in left zzso mass a cardiovascular risk zzso in a healthy population without zzso states such as diabetes or zzso 

This zzso zzso study was zzso in 153 healthy subjects, zzso 76 men and 77 women with ages ranging from 23 to 67 zzso All of them were zzso and had a normal oral zzso tolerance test, none had cardiovascular disease and none were taking any zzso zzso height and waist circumference were measured and zzso was zzso A blood sample was drawn in the zzso state: plasma zzso insulin, serum total and high density zzso zzso low density zzso cholesterol and zzso were zzso zzso resistance was determined by the zzso Assessment zzso zzso zzso were studied by zzso The left zzso mass was calculated by using the zzso validated formula of zzso et zzso 

Left zzso mass significantly and positively correlated with zzso age, zzso and zzso blood pressure and zzso blood zzso The correlation of left zzso mass with zzso blood zzso was not maintained after controlling for zzso zzso zzso blood zzso zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure showed significant differences with higher values for people with left zzso zzso The zzso zzso analysis showed a strong association between left zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso resistance and zzso insulin is not associated with left zzso zzso in healthy people, independent of zzso zzso appears to be an independent risk factor for left zzso zzso
