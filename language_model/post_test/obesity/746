zzso an zzso zzso for growth hormone zzso zzso zzso is known to increase food intake in lean humans and zzso In addition, zzso levels are increased by zzso in lean zzso and are elevated before meals in humans, suggesting an important role for zzso in meal zzso However, in obese human, circulating zzso levels were found to be significantly reduced as compared to lean zzso 

To evaluate whether circulating zzso levels, as well as zzso sensitivity, are decreased in obese individuals in order to limit its effect on food zzso 

: zzso zzso mice fed a zzso a low- zzso or a high-fat diet zzso were used to determine zzso regulation and zzso as well as zzso zzso 

Plasma zzso levels were measured in low- and high-fat fed zzso zzso food intake was measured in zzso low- and high-fat fed zzso 

We measured zzso levels in lean and zzso obese mice, fed on an zzso or an zzso zzso We observed that not only zzso zzso was reduced in obese mice but its zzso regulation was also zzso In addition, we failed to observe any change in zzso zzso upon zzso and zzso Moreover, we observed that the sensitivity to the zzso effects of zzso zzso was reduced in obese mice when compared to lean mice fed a zzso or a zzso The zzso of obese mice to zzso was improved upon weigh zzso 

: Altogether, these results indicate that zzso zzso and regulation is impaired in zzso obesity in mice and suggest that zzso zzso could prevent weight regain after weight zzso
