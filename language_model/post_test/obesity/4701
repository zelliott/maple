To examine whether there is an independent association between body mass index zzso and estimated zzso zzso rate zzso in a large primary care zzso 

zzso data were zzso extracted from primary care records between 2006 and 2009 in a primary care population of approximately zzso people in zzso South East zzso Using zzso zzso age, gender and zzso we examined the association between zzso and zzso zzso and zzso analysis was performed using zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso thousand zzso thirty seven people fulfilled the inclusion zzso There was no correlation between zzso and zzso on zzso zzso When zzso by zzso zzso demonstrated a statistically significant difference in zzso across zzso strata zzso zzso However the absolute differences in zzso between groups were very zzso There was a small association between zzso and zzso on zzso analysis, much of which was lost on adjustment for zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that elevated zzso is not a biologically significant predictor of diminished zzso and therefore may be an insufficiently accurate measure of risk for the zzso syndrome and zzso
