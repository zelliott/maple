zzso increases in the consumption of zzso beverages have paralleled the rise in obesity zzso but whether the intake of such beverages interacts with the genetic predisposition to zzso is zzso 

We analyzed the interaction between genetic predisposition and the intake of zzso beverages in relation to zzso index zzso the weight in zzso divided by the square of the height in zzso and obesity risk in zzso women from the zzso Health Study zzso and in zzso men from the Health Professionals zzso Study zzso and also in a replication cohort of zzso women from the Women's Genome Health Study zzso The zzso score was calculated on the basis of 32 zzso zzso The intake of zzso beverages was examined zzso in relation to zzso 

In the zzso and zzso zzso the genetic association with zzso was stronger among participants with higher intake of zzso beverages than among those with lower zzso In the combined zzso the increases in zzso per zzso of 10 risk zzso were zzso for an intake of less than one serving per month, zzso for one to four servings per month, zzso for two to six servings per week, and zzso for one or more servings per day zzso for zzso For the same categories of zzso the relative risks of incident obesity per zzso of 10 risk zzso were zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso for zzso In the zzso zzso the increases in zzso per zzso of 10 risk zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso across the four categories of intake zzso for zzso the relative risks for incident obesity were zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso respectively zzso for zzso 

The genetic association with zzso appeared to be more pronounced with greater intake of zzso zzso zzso by the National Institutes of Health and zzso
