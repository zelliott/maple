Common human diseases result from the interplay of many genes and environmental zzso zzso a more zzso biology approach is needed to unravel the complexity and causes of such zzso To zzso the complexity of common human diseases such as zzso we have zzso the expression of zzso transcripts in large zzso blood and zzso tissue zzso zzso assessed for various zzso including traits related to clinical zzso In contrast to the blood expression profiles, we observed a marked correlation between gene expression in zzso tissue and zzso zzso zzso linkage and association mapping revealed a highly significant genetic component to gene expression traits, including a strong genetic effect of zzso zzso signals, with 50% of the zzso signals overlapping between the two zzso zzso Here we demonstrate an extensive zzso network constructed from the human zzso data that exhibits significant overlap with similar network zzso constructed from mouse zzso zzso A core network module in humans and mice was identified that is enriched for genes involved in the inflammatory and immune response and has been found to be zzso associated to zzso zzso
