To evaluate the effects of walking combined with diet therapy zzso zzso on insulin sensitivity in obese zzso diabetes zzso zzso zzso 

zzso were divided into two groups: 10 patients were managed by diet alone zzso zzso and 14 patients were placed in the diet and exercise group zzso zzso Group DE was instructed to walk at least 10,000 zzso on a flat field as monitored by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and group D was told to maintain a normal daily routine zzso zzso 290 zzso A zzso clamp procedure at an insulin infusion rate of 40 zzso was performed before and after the 6- to zzso training zzso Mean serum insulin zzso ranged from zzso to 790 zzso 

While body weight zzso in groups D and DE decreased significantly zzso zzso during the study, the amount of zzso reduction in group DE was greater than that in group D zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso After training, zzso infusion rate zzso and zzso clearance rate zzso in group D did not significantly zzso however, zzso and zzso increased significantly in group zzso from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The analysis of zzso showed significant effects of exercise zzso zzso exercise, P zzso zzso for the improvement of zzso zzso correlations were also observed between delta zzso and average steps per day zzso zzso zzso P zzso in group zzso 

zzso which can be safely performed and easily incorporated into daily life, can be recommended as an adjunct therapy to diet treatment in obese zzso patients, not only for zzso reduction, but also for improvement of insulin zzso
