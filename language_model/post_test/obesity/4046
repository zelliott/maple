In the zzso countries, the zzso and mortality of zzso zzso zzso in young women is much lower than in men of equal zzso This difference decreases with advancing age without any abrupt change at zzso Scotland and Northern Ireland have the highest mortality rates from coronary heart disease in women, and Scotland the highest in zzso Studies on the age variation of the sex ratio based on vital statistics have suggested that male behavior may make a contribution to the elevated mortality in males compared to females regarding not only coronary heart disease but also other causes of zzso Studies have shown that uncomplicated angina zzso has the highest zzso of the various coronary disease manifestations in zzso zzso factors include hypertension, serum zzso smoking, diabetes, zzso oral contraceptive zzso use, zzso zzso use, and zzso In a series of 145 women with zzso and angina zzso only zzso had been taking zzso at the time of onset of coronary heart zzso Evidence has been accumulating recently that women using zzso run a higher risk of coronary heart disease with the relative risk increasing with an increasing number of other factors, such as zzso hypertension, and cigarette zzso In 1 study the death rate from circulatory diseases in women who had used zzso was 5 times greater than that of controls who had never used zzso These findings relate mainly to preparations containing 50 zzso of zzso The excess death rate increased with age up to 50 years and with zzso zzso influence zzso and zzso metabolism in ways similar to those induced by zzso such as impairment of oral zzso tolerance with zzso and elevated serum zzso zzso zzso cholesterol and serum zzso levels seem to remain relatively unchanged in OC users with a low zzso zzso In 1 study HDL cholesterol levels appeared to be directly related to the zzso and zzso related to the zzso zzso zzso with both zzso and zzso have an intermediate effect on the level of HDL zzso After menopause, zzso use has not been zzso linked with an increased risk, but the importance of zzso in the causation of the disease should not be zzso There is support for familial zzso of coronary heart disease in women but the role of environmental and genetic contributions to this is zzso Further studies are needed of the sex-related differences in coronary heart disease among men and women of various age groups so that understanding of basic disease factors may be zzso
