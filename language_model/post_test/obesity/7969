The zzso zzso techniques used to measure insulin sensitivity in children are the zzso clamp and zzso minimal zzso Although precise, these techniques are complex, invasive and time zzso Alternative indirect measures of insulin sensitivity have been developed that zzso zzso zzso and insulin data in zzso or computer zzso These methods include zzso model assessment zzso the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index zzso and the zzso to insulin ratio zzso Each of these three zzso techniques has been developed and validated in adults, with little or no validation in zzso Increasingly, zzso and zzso are being used in childhood studies to assess insulin zzso In a group of 79 zzso children, we found that the correlation between the minimal model and zzso zzso zzso zzso was no better than that between the minimal model and zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso with an even weaker correlation between the minimal model and zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, neither zzso nor zzso were able to detect a reduction in insulin sensitivity with obesity or during growth hormone therapy, unlike the minimal zzso In children with normal zzso levels, neither zzso nor zzso was superior to zzso zzso zzso of the derivation zzso for these methods in children is needed before they are more widely zzso The potential benefits of these simple zzso techniques is that they are useful in large field zzso However, if the study groups are small or zzso changes in insulin sensitivity are zzso more precise techniques such as the clamp or minimal model should be zzso
