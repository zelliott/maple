zzso zzso zzso zzso indicative of insulin resistance, has been demonstrated in lean male zzso both with the zzso zzso clamp and the insulin suppression zzso In lean zzso insulin resistance was not accompanied by increases in zzso plasma insulin and zzso zzso but with modest zzso and zzso after a zzso zzso zzso studies (no zzso reveal that: zzso insulin sensitivities vary widely in zzso and zzso zzso there are zzso and zzso with similar degrees of insulin resistance, zzso not all zzso are insulin zzso and zzso insulin resistance does not contribute to the blood pressure level of the zzso zzso In large zzso studies, the zzso of zzso zzso and type 2 diabetes is largely responsible for the observed associations between insulin or insulin resistance and zzso Recent studies indicate a role of zzso in blood pressure zzso zzso has been shown to elevate blood pressure in the presence of zzso dysfunction and zzso values in the zzso range have been shown to be associated with increased cardiovascular zzso Since zzso dysfunction is present in zzso zzso obese and in zzso intolerant individuals, lowering of zzso zzso levels becomes a new, additional therapeutic target in the management of these zzso zzso together with zzso dysfunction may account for the increased zzso of hypertension in obesity and diabetes zzso Because of the strong association between insulin resistance, zzso and zzso dysfunction, and the zzso of risk factors in these subjects, we propose the lowering of high normal zzso levels as part of the therapeutic strategy to prevent cardiovascular and zzso zzso
