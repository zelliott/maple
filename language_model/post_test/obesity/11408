zzso is associated with zzso zzso hypertension and with early increase in heart rate and decreased heart rate zzso The consequences of zzso hypertension on heart gene regulation are poorly known and were investigated in a model of zzso hypertension induced by high fat diet in zzso When compared with control animals zzso a zzso high fat diet zzso provoked significant weight gain and increased blood pressure load and heart rate but failed to significantly change left zzso mass assessed by zzso zzso zzso of dog heart zzso libraries were used to generate zzso containing zzso expressed zzso that were in turn spotted onto zzso to create custom zzso zzso of these zzso with complex zzso representing zzso expressed in right zzso and left zzso from obese zzso and control dogs were zzso zzso zzso expressed genes were zzso altered expression was confirmed by Northern zzso analysis in zzso In addition, real-time quantitative zzso chain reaction confirmed differential expression for zzso of the randomly chosen tested zzso Once identified, transcripts were zzso into groups involved in zzso cell zzso zzso regulation, cell zzso protein zzso and tissue zzso In addition, we found a set of 11 zzso zzso proteins with unknown zzso This study clearly shows that zzso hypertension, lasting for only 9 weeks, causes marked changes in gene expression in right atrium as well as the left zzso that may contribute to early functional changes in heart function and to long-term structural changes such as left zzso zzso and zzso
