Whereas obesity increases overall loading of the knee, limb zzso concentrates that loading on a focal area, to the level at which cartilage damage may zzso This study evaluated whether the effect of body weight on progression of knee zzso zzso differs depending on the degree of limb zzso 

The study population comprised zzso veterans and community recruits with symptomatic knee zzso zzso on most days and zzso disease) who volunteered to participate in a natural history study and from whom baseline zzso were obtained to assess zzso 227 zzso completed a zzso zzso Of zzso knees assessed at zzso zzso zzso were followed zzso zzso body mass index zzso was assessed at each zzso The main outcome measure was progression of knee zzso defined as narrowing of the zzso joint space by 1 grade zzso scale zzso on zzso of the zzso positioned zzso The association between zzso and the risk of knee zzso progression was assessed after adjusting for age, sex, and limb zzso using zzso zzso and generalized zzso zzso 

Of zzso knees, 90 zzso showed disease zzso and limb alignment was strongly associated with progression zzso The risk of progression increased with increasing weight (for each zzso increase in zzso odds ratio zzso for progression zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso However, among those knees with neutral alignment zzso degrees ), increases in zzso had no effect on risk of progression zzso zzso and in those with severe zzso zzso or zzso degrees ), the effect was similarly zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso on progression was limited to knees in which there was moderate zzso zzso per zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Although elevated zzso increases the risk of knee zzso zzso the effect of zzso is limited to knees in which moderate zzso exists, presumably because of the combined focus of load from zzso and the excess load from increased zzso This has implications for clinical recommendations and for trials testing weight loss in those with knee zzso
