We examined whether zzso zzso II zzso zzso could be considered a therapeutic strategy in zzso and zzso zzso in conditions of partial zzso under zzso zzso which is commonly applied in clinical practice to reduce blood zzso We report that zzso II type I zzso zzso zzso but not zzso II type II zzso zzso zzso increased zzso in zzso zzso In the presence of zzso both zzso and zzso zzso increased liver zzso This effect was stronger when the two were zzso Neither of the zzso II zzso zzso protected zzso zzso against zzso Only the zzso zzso through zzso oxide zzso reduced damage in zzso zzso The combination of the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso a similar degree of protection to zzso zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was a key mechanism in the zzso induced by the zzso II zzso zzso in both liver types because when this signaling zzso was zzso the beneficial effects of the zzso II zzso zzso on liver zzso disappeared, regardless of zzso growth factor or transforming growth factor zzso zzso In conclusion, in conditions of partial zzso under zzso the zzso zzso for zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso improved zzso in the remnant liver through zzso zzso In addition, the combination of the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso led to stronger liver zzso than either zzso used separately and also provided the same protection against damage as that afforded by zzso zzso zzso
