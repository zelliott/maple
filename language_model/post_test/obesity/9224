zzso is zzso with and stemming from the same precursor as zzso and is apparently involved in energy zzso Relatively little is known about the regulation of zzso zzso 

The regulation of zzso release and zzso ratios by meal intake and the zzso system were studied in lean and obese zzso 

We conducted a randomized, zzso zzso crossover study with 4 study days in eight obese zzso mass zzso zzso and eight matched lean zzso mass index zzso zzso healthy subjects zzso males and six females per zzso at a University Clinical Research zzso 

zzso (1 zzso zzso was administered alone and in combination with breakfast zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso alone and in combination with zzso 

We measured plasma zzso and zzso zzso 

Both zzso and zzso ratios decreased significantly from baseline by either zzso or meal intake in lean individuals, with the two effects adding up on the combined zzso zzso In contrast, there were no statistically significant differences in obese subjects, who also showed significantly greater association between zzso and zzso values than their lean zzso 

zzso and zzso release is zzso regulated by meal intake and the zzso system in lean zzso This regulation is impaired in zzso
