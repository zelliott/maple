In zzso rats (formerly zzso obesity and male gender zzso zzso zzso insulin resistance and predisposition to zzso Our previous studies showed gender and obesity zzso zzso cell surface insulin binding and insulin clearance zzso zzso insulin receptors zzso bind insulin as a first step in insulin clearance through zzso and zzso We zzso that the synergistic effects of obesity and gender on zzso insulin binding and clearance result from interaction of these two factors on zzso zzso zzso To address zzso expression in zzso rats, we zzso zzso protein levels in zzso liver zzso by Western zzso and zzso zzso levels by a solution zzso protection zzso zzso reduced total zzso zzso content in males and zzso 50% and zzso zzso Male gender reduced zzso protein content zzso in lean, but had no effect on zzso protein content in obese zzso Neither gender nor obesity affected zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, obesity appears to affect zzso zzso protein content and cell surface binding through zzso zzso similarly, male gender in lean rats reduces zzso protein levels and cell surface binding through mechanisms not involving changes in zzso zzso In obese rats, the synergistic effects of male gender appears to involve changes in zzso trafficking and consequently cell surface insulin binding and zzso
