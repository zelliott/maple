zzso one-third of US zzso women are obese, and zzso obesity is a strong risk factor for adverse fetal and infant zzso The annual number of preventable adverse fetal and infant outcomes associated with zzso obesity in the zzso was zzso 

zzso fetal and infant outcomes for which statistically significant associations with zzso obesity had been reported by zzso zzso which included fetal deaths and nine different major birth zzso were zzso The true prevalence of zzso obesity was estimated by zzso zzso zzso obesity by a bias factor based on the difference between measured and zzso obesity in zzso adult zzso A zzso Carlo simulation approach was used to model the attributable fraction and preventable number, accounting for uncertainty in the estimates for: strength of the association with zzso obesity zzso and outcome zzso 

zzso the impact of zzso obesity would potentially prevent the highest numbers of four zzso fetal deaths zzso uncertainty zzso zzso zzso zzso heart defects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso If zzso of women with zzso obesity achieved a healthy weight before pregnancy or otherwise zzso the impact of zzso nearly 300 zzso heart defects and 700 fetal deaths per year could potentially be zzso 

This simulation suggests that effective prevention strategies to reduce zzso obesity or the risk associated with obesity could have a measurable impact on infant health in the zzso
