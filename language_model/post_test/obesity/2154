I examined age patterns of mortality differentials associated with body mass because the declining age effect observed in previous comparisons of zzso age groups is susceptible to cohort and period zzso and because previous studies used time since baseline as time at risk, making the evaluation of zzso mortality zzso 

I conducted a zzso survival analysis of data from the zzso National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso for 3 zzso of American men and women born from 1901 through 1957 and observed from 1988 through 2006 under an zzso zzso 

zzso differentials strengthened across zzso but did not decline with age or change over the study zzso Because excess overweight and obesity mortality increased from earlier zzso to more recent ones, ignoring cohort differences led to a declining age pattern of excess zzso 

zzso age patterns of mortality differentials appear to be distorted by cohort zzso Age should be used as risk time to study age variations in associations between risk factors and time to zzso
