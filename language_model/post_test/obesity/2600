The current study examined the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fraction on zzso stress and zzso zzso in high-fat diet induced obese zzso zzso mice were randomly assigned to normal diet group and high-fat diet zzso zzso diet groups were fed with an zzso zzso diet or zzso g zzso zzso body zzso The high-fat diet groups were fed with an zzso zzso diet, zzso g zzso zzso zzso g zzso fraction or zzso g zzso body zzso zzso fraction strengthened the zzso defense system with an increased activity of zzso zzso zzso and decreased activities of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and content of reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso fraction was found to reduce the zzso of zzso oxygen species zzso such as zzso radical and hydrogen zzso which decrease the generation of zzso stress damage zzso such as the zzso acid zzso substances zzso and zzso zzso zzso fraction was found to be excellent for strengthening the zzso defense system, reducing the generation of zzso and damaging zzso substances in the liver of high-fat diet induced obese zzso
