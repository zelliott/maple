zzso data suggest an association between obesity and depression, however findings vary considerably across different zzso Both depression and obesity are disabling disorders associated with loss over appetite control, influenced by genetic and environmental factors and are risk factors for diseases like hypertension, cardiovascular disorders, zzso This study attempts to establish a link between the symptoms of depression, zzso disorders, and zzso to unravel the underlying zzso 

This exploratory zzso study comprises 133 clinically diagnosed depressed individuals and 136 age matched zzso DNA from all zzso subjects was zzso for zzso repeat zzso in the promoter region of zzso zzso gene using zzso chain zzso 

zzso of the shorter zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso in the depressive group versus zzso in the control group zzso Cases zzso for zzso or zzso zzso zzso had significantly higher value of zzso zzso versus zzso zzso and zzso zzso versus zzso zzso blood pressure zzso and zzso than the individuals zzso zzso zzso zzso A similar trend was observed for zzso zzso versus zzso zzso among controls zzso for the longer or the shorter zzso Thus, the zzso gene appears to be an important genetic zzso for zzso to depression in the Indian population zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso gene zzso could be related to depression and associated zzso such as zzso
