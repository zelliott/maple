We investigated the zzso effects of the adrenal zzso zzso zzso on genetically predisposed obese lethal yellow mice zzso zzso we tested the hypothesis that zzso promotes its zzso effects by decreasing the activity of zzso zzso zzso We subjected four zzso combinations of yellow and zzso zzso mice to four dietary treatments and determined weight changes, food consumption, and zzso zzso Although zzso activities of yellow mice were considerably decreased in the zzso zzso treatment group, they were elevated in the zzso and zzso zzso treatment zzso In contrast, zzso activities of zzso control zzso mice remained relatively zzso These studies confirm that zzso prevents the zzso gene from promoting excess fat deposition via some zzso other than reduced dietary zzso However, the overall absence of agreement between weight change zzso or zzso and zzso activity suggests that the zzso activity of zzso is not zzso via zzso Since yellow obese zzso mice were found to be more susceptible to zzso effects than their zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to induce an altered metabolism in zzso mice which is more susceptible to the effects of zzso than the normal metabolism of zzso zzso
