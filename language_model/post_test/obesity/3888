The zzso syndrome, characterized by zzso insulin resistance and zzso is a major cause of cardiovascular zzso The origins of the syndrome have been hypothesized to lie in continuous availability of energy dense foods in modern zzso In contrast, human physiology has evolved in an environment of sporadic food supply and frequent food zzso zzso food restriction in rats has previously been shown to lead to reduction of cardiovascular risk and a greater life zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is taken up by cells and zzso pharmacological zzso of metabolism of zzso We hypothesized that intermittent zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso may mimic intermittent food deprivation and zzso zzso and zzso aspects of the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso rats were treated with zzso zzso zzso in zzso on an intermittent schedule (2 days treated, one day zzso two days treated and two days zzso or continuously at a dose to give an equivalent averaged zzso 

zzso zzso improved insulin sensitivity, which correlated with increased zzso zzso Further, intermittent treatment (but not continuous zzso reduced plasma levels of zzso and the inflammatory zzso zzso zzso Both zzso treatments reduced zzso zzso zzso but only the intermittent schedule improved zzso zzso 

Our findings are consistent with reduction in severity of the zzso syndrome and protection against end stage zzso and zzso disease through intermittent zzso deprivation at a cellular level by zzso of zzso zzso with zzso
