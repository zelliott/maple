zzso has been linked to components of the zzso syndrome, including zzso insulin resistance, and zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso would reverse zzso in genetic zzso zzso mice lacking zzso zzso knockout zzso had similar body weight and fat as zzso mice when fed standard zzso zzso or a high-fat zzso Nonetheless, zzso zzso serum cholesterol, and very zzso zzso zzso zzso were decreased in zzso obese zzso zzso zzso zzso exacerbated obesity in zzso mice, but zzso zzso was drastically zzso Moreover, the levels of zzso cholesterol, insulin, and zzso were reduced in zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso zzso was related to reductions in the expression of genes involved in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Together, these results demonstrate a crucial role of zzso in promoting zzso zzso and zzso in obese zzso
