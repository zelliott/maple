zzso and obesity are frequently associated with preventable death and have emerged as a major challenge to public zzso There is an ongoing debate on the role of abdominal obesity and its value in predicting cardiovascular and zzso zzso The present analysis evaluates the prevalence of zzso zzso and conventional cardiovascular risk factors in relation to measures of general and abdominal zzso 

In this zzso zzso study, zzso zzso zzso from 26 countries including Europe, North and Latin America, Middle East, and Asia were zzso zzso zzso screening for zzso was performed as well as data on patient zzso zzso measures, cardiovascular risk factors, zzso conditions, and cardiovascular drug therapy zzso zzso prevalence was determined by a zzso zzso zzso analysis with cardiovascular risk factors as zzso 

In the zzso analysis, zzso prevalence systematically increased with body mass index zzso from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an increase which was also observed for waist circumference zzso At any level of zzso zzso increased with zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in all three zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in all zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso analysis, zzso but not zzso was independently associated with zzso Furthermore, zzso were associated with the presence of modifiable and zzso risk zzso 

An abnormal zzso but not zzso appears to be independently associated with zzso an early marker of cardiovascular and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an incremental risk for zzso at any level of zzso underlining the zzso importance of abdominal fat zzso beyond general zzso
