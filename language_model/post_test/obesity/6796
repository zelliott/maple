zzso is a major negative zzso of breast cancer zzso However, there are contrasting data on the differential impact of obesity on specific breast cancer zzso In particular, very little is known on human zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We assessed the zzso role of increased body mass index zzso on a consecutive series of zzso zzso patients treated at our institution before the introduction of zzso zzso We separately zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso we observed a significantly worse overall survival zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso and cumulative zzso of distant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in obese zzso versus zzso zzso zzso Local relapses appeared to be zzso reduced in obese patients, masking the overall effect on zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso instead, was not significantly different between zzso zzso 

zzso significantly zzso with worse overall survival and cumulative zzso of distant zzso in zzso positive breast zzso zzso in the biology of breast zzso may determine individual zzso to zzso The biology of the underlying zzso should be taken into account in the design of dietary intervention trials in breast zzso
