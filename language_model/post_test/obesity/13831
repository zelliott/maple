The type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been proposed to mediate the effects of zzso on zzso release, food zzso and body zzso We have zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso in an attempt to enhance signaling via this zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of human zzso in rat zzso cell lines resulted in increased zzso zzso turnover and rendered them responsive to zzso zzso We then generated transgenic mice zzso human zzso in zzso zzso using a zzso rat zzso zzso zzso zzso transgenic mice showed increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso Body weights of the transgenic mice became similar in adulthood, whereas zzso mass was reduced, particularly so in female zzso zzso zzso and muscle weights of transgenic mice were increased despite chronic exposure to a high fat zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in the zzso zzso However, zzso mice showed no evidence of increased sensitivity to acute or chronic treatment with zzso zzso zzso Food intake and zzso tissue responses to chronic high fat feeding and treatment with zzso zzso were zzso as were locomotor and anxiety behaviors, although zzso mice remained significantly zzso than zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso of zzso can zzso zzso signaling activity in the zzso axis and reduce zzso without affecting other zzso zzso
