The adjusted odds ratio zzso for zzso associated with current OC use was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso The OR associated with OC use was higher for women who were obese than in the zzso zzso zzso zzso for likelihood test for zzso and in women without zzso medical conditions zzso zzso zzso for zzso The adjusted OR for zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso in women with factor V zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in women with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in women with the zzso zzso zzso The OR for zzso in OC users with factor V zzso zzso zzso was elevated more than in OC users without the zzso zzso and women with the zzso who were zzso users zzso but confidence intervals zzso 

The risk of zzso is increased in users of zzso OC zzso zzso women appear to be at greater risk of zzso when using zzso
