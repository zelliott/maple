We demonstrated previously that dietary calcium suppression of zzso reduces zzso zzso suppresses zzso and increases zzso zzso during energy zzso zzso dairy calcium sources exert markedly greater zzso To determine the effects of dietary calcium and dairy products on energy zzso during subsequent zzso we induced obesity in zzso transgenic mice with a zzso diet, then restricted energy intake from a zzso zzso diet for 6 zzso to induce fat loss, and then provided free access to a zzso zzso diet or to zzso zzso diets that zzso either zzso foods or dairy products zzso or zzso for 6 zzso zzso the zzso diet caused the regain of all weight and fat, whereas all zzso diets reduced fat gain by zzso zzso zzso All zzso diets zzso zzso tissue zzso protein zzso and skeletal muscle zzso expression zzso zzso and slightly increased core temperature zzso zzso zzso but only the zzso diets zzso a marked zzso P zzso increase in skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso All 3 zzso diets produced significant increases in zzso decreases in fatty acid zzso expression and activity, and reduced fat regain zzso zzso but the 2 zzso zzso diets exerted significantly greater effects on regain zzso zzso Thus, zzso diets elicit a shift in energy zzso and reduction of weight gain during zzso with dairy zzso sources exerting markedly greater zzso
