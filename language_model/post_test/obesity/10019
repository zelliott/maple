To investigate how abdominal zzso assessed by different zzso zzso and zzso X-ray zzso zzso is associated with zzso risk factors for cardiovascular disease and zzso diabetes zzso in obese zzso 

zzso zzso 

zzso healthy, obese, middle-aged women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso waist zzso zzso ratio, zzso ratio, abdominal zzso and zzso diameters and their zzso zzso zzso X-ray zzso the amount of total and regional abdominal zzso zzso zzso zzso serum total, zzso LDL, HDL cholesterol, zzso zzso and zzso serum insulin and zzso 

After adjustment for age and zzso all the zzso zzso except zzso ratio and zzso ratio related significantly to HDL and LDL zzso On the other hand, zzso ratio and zzso ratio showed an association with zzso In addition, all the zzso zzso except zzso diameter correlated significantly with zzso insulin and zzso zzso zzso ratio was the only measure that associated with 2 h zzso zzso The differences between the correlation zzso were not statistically significant in the zzso correlation zzso zzso As to zzso X-ray zzso results, the region from the dome of zzso to the top of zzso zzso zzso and the area between the first and the fourth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso related to HDL cholesterol and positively to zzso Both of these regions correlated significantly with zzso insulin, and zzso zzso zzso associated also with zzso zzso even after adjustment for age and zzso 

None of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio, zzso ratio or zzso zzso was significantly superior to others to assess the zzso risk zzso zzso zzso zzso (the area between the first and the fourth zzso zzso measured by zzso X-ray zzso discerned obese women with elevated zzso insulin and zzso zzso
