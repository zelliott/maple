The zzso zzso protein zzso which is exclusively expressed in brown zzso zzso regulates energy expenditure in zzso but its importance in the energy zzso of adult humans is zzso To study associations of zzso gene expression with human zzso we determined, by a competitive reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso expression levels in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of 79 obese subjects and 17 lean zzso zzso zzso and internal standard zzso were reverse transcribed and zzso in one reaction in which the same zzso were zzso The signal zzso of zzso zzso products were compared with the signal zzso of standard zzso products to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in all zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In both obese and non-obese subjects, zzso zzso abundance was higher in the zzso than in the zzso tissue zzso zzso Compared to lean controls, zzso obese subjects showed a significantly lower zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression level in the zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso P zzso while zzso zzso abundance in zzso zzso tissue did not differ between obese and zzso zzso These data are consistent with reduced energy expenditure in zzso but it remains to be determined whether the association of decreased zzso zzso zzso expression with obesity status reflects a zzso contribution of brown zzso tissue function to the zzso of zzso
