zzso zzso profiles were investigated in 108 male patients with primary zzso before treatment to zzso the prevalence of each individual zzso of zzso zzso and zzso factors responsible for zzso The mean serum zzso zzso and total cholesterol zzso levels in the patients with zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, which were significantly higher zzso less than zzso and p less than zzso zzso than the levels in age matched controls without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso high density zzso cholesterol zzso values were slightly decreased in patients with zzso compared with controls zzso zzso zzso zzso v zzso zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso zzso was seen in 61 patients zzso of whom patients with type zzso zzso and IV zzso formed 13, 15, and zzso zzso Thus the prevalence of type IV zzso was high in primary zzso as compared with primary zzso with primary zzso zzso v zzso p less than zzso The independent and relative influences of clinical data of the patients upon the zzso of serum lipids were assessed by zzso multiple zzso zzso Two major zzso of serum zzso level were alcohol intake zzso less than zzso and serum zzso acid level zzso less than zzso The most significant zzso variable was alcohol zzso but its influence was judged to be small zzso zzso zzso None of the other zzso including obesity index, had any significant zzso The relationships between any of these variables and serum zzso or zzso levels were not zzso In addition, serum zzso levels were investigated in patients with neither obesity zzso as zzso or more of ideal body zzso nor a history of alcohol zzso Their serum zzso and zzso zzso were also significantly higher than the respective control zzso Thus zzso in primary zzso its unlikely to be secondary to excess alcohol intake or zzso or zzso Instead, it may result from genetic factors such as a combined zzso zzso
