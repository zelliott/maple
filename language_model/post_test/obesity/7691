There seems to be general agreement that the prevalence of obesity is increasing in the United States and that we are in the midst of an obesity zzso The zzso implications of this epidemic have received an enormous amount of publicity in the popular media, but public awareness of the zzso effects of excess weight has not led to an effective approach to dealing with the zzso The gravity of the problem is zzso in light of the report that only approximately 50% of physicians polled provided weight loss zzso Given the importance of excess zzso as increasing the risk of zzso zzso and hypertension and the combination of an increase in the prevalence of zzso and a health care system unprepared to deal with this situation, it is essential that considerable thought be given as to how to best address this zzso In this context, it must be emphasized that zzso zzso and hypertension are characterized by resistance to zzso zzso disposal and that insulin resistance and the zzso zzso associated with insulin resistance have been shown to be independent zzso of all three clinical zzso It has also been apparent for many years that zzso individuals tend to be insulin resistant and become more insulin sensitive with weight zzso In light of these zzso it seems reasonable to suggest that insulin resistance is the link between zzso and the adverse clinical syndromes related to excess zzso The evidence summarized in this review shows that the more overweight an individual, the more likely he or she is insulin resistant and at increased risk to develop all the abnormalities associated with this zzso in insulin zzso Not all zzso individuals are insulin zzso however, any more than all insulin resistant individuals are zzso More important, there is compelling evidence that zzso risk factors are present to a significantly greater degree in the subset of zzso individuals that is also insulin zzso Not zzso have also demonstrated that an improvement in zzso risk factors with weight loss occurs to a significantly greater degree in those zzso individuals who are also insulin resistant at zzso In view of the ineffectiveness of current clinical approaches to weight loss, it seems necessary to recognize that not all zzso individuals are at equal risk to develop zzso and that it is clinically useful to identify those at highest zzso The simplest way to achieve this task seems to be focusing on the zzso risk factors that are highly associated with insulin zzso If this is done, then intense efforts at weight control can be brought to bear on those who not only need it the most but also have the most to gain by losing zzso
