zzso evidence suggests that the zzso zzso system zzso plays a role in the zzso of diabetic zzso Although the zzso zzso is activated in the zzso zzso zzso the status of the zzso zzso in the zzso diabetic fatty zzso zzso which is a commonly used genetic model of diabetes, is not zzso zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso converting zzso zzso and zzso converting zzso 2 zzso were measured in zzso isolated from zzso zzso rats and zzso zzso zzso zzso injury was evaluated by zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso rats exhibited marked zzso and zzso zzso but only zzso rats demonstrated zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso II levels were increased significantly in zzso compared with zzso control rats, accompanied by a reduction in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso II, and zzso were similar in zzso rats and lean zzso zzso levels were not affected by diabetes in either diabetic zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso is activated in the zzso diabetic rat but not in the zzso rat despite a similar degree of zzso The mechanism of zzso in the zzso rat may involve factors other than zzso and zzso zzso such as hypertension and zzso
