The human zzso of recently discovered zzso obesity genes provide relevant candidates to study the genetic component of obesity in zzso We zzso the human counterparts to zzso obesity genes zzso zzso zzso tub, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins 2 and 3 zzso and zzso as well as two other zzso regions reported to be linked to zzso zzso in restricted zzso We found no significant evidence for linkage to any zzso zzso in our total study material of 105 affected zzso pairs collected from the genetically zzso population of zzso However, several markers on 14 zzso zzso region zzso the zzso gene showed sharing of zzso zzso zzso more frequently than zzso A selected subset of zzso obese zzso pairs strengthened the P values down to zzso in this particular zzso The smallest P value zzso zzso zzso was obtained with a marker zzso in a zzso containing only zzso pairs with one lean and one obese zzso We therefore screened seven obese subjects included in our zzso pair material for sequence changes in their zzso zzso but no zzso of apparent zzso relationship were zzso In conclusion, we could not find evidence for significant contribution of the zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso single gene obesity genes for human zzso zzso but additional studies are still needed to clarify whether DNA zzso within or adjacent to the zzso gene play some zzso
