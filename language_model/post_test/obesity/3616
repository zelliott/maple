Several studies have demonstrated that the zzso zzso is usually zzso after a consistent weight loss induced by diet and/or zzso zzso Recently, a single bout of respiratory muscle endurance training zzso by means of a specific commercially available device zzso zzso has been reported to induce a marked zzso response in obese adults, its zzso effect being significantly lower in obese zzso The zzso response disappeared in both obese adults and adolescents when zzso was repeated at zzso intervals zzso The aim of the present study was to evaluate zzso responses to repeated bouts of zzso administered before and after a zzso zzso multidisciplinary body weight reduction program zzso zzso diet, zzso zzso physical activity, psychological counseling, and nutritional education) combined with a progressively increasing zzso (15 daily sessions, 5 sessions per week) in 7 obese male adolescents zzso zzso years; body mass index zzso zzso percent fat mass zzso zzso Blood zzso for zzso zzso were collected during the 1st and 15th sessions, which were composed of 2 consecutive bouts of zzso (of identical intensity and zzso at zzso zzso zzso At the beginning of the study, baseline zzso levels significantly increased after the first bout of zzso in all subjects zzso The administration of the second bout of zzso resulted in a significantly lower zzso zzso increase in comparison with the first zzso Three weeks of the integrated intervention significantly reduced both body weight (from zzso to zzso zzso and zzso (from zzso to zzso zzso these combined effects being, however, not sufficient to influence zzso responsiveness to the 2 repeated bouts of zzso zzso zzso to the first zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the second zzso zzso zzso zzso before and after 3 weeks of the treatment, respectively, zzso In conclusion, a zzso incremental zzso combined with a body weight reduction intervention does not seem useful to positively influence the reduced zzso responsiveness to 2 repeated zzso bouts in obese zzso More intensive and/or long-term zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso determining more consistent changes in body zzso are likely needed to restore the impaired zzso function of obese zzso
