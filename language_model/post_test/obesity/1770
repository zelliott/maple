To use zzso data and a standardized economic model to compare projected costs for obesity prevention in late adolescence accrued using a zzso weight zzso for selecting adolescents at age 15 years compared with a zzso zzso 

All children born in a Swedish county zzso zzso in 1991 who participated in all regular zzso of height and weight at ages 5, 10 and 15 years zzso were included in the zzso The selection strategies were compared by calculating the projected financial load resulting from supply of obesity prevention services from providers at all levels in the health care zzso The difference in marginal cost per 1000 children was used as the primary end point for the zzso 

Using the zzso selection strategy, zzso of adolescents at age 15 years were selected for evaluation by a pediatric zzso and zzso were chosen for zzso zzso In the zzso strategy, zzso of the adolescents were selected for intensive pediatric care, zzso for individual clinical interventions in primary health care, zzso for individual primary obesity prevention using the Internet and zzso for zzso zzso zzso for the zzso selection strategy were projected to zzso zzso per 1000 adolescents and for the zzso strategy were zzso zzso zzso per 1000 zzso 

Using projections from zzso data, we found that by basing the selection of adolescents for obesity prevention on weight zzso the load on highly specialized pediatric care can be reduced by one-third and total health service costs for obesity management among adolescents reduced by zzso Before use in policies and prevention program planning, our findings warrant confirmation in prospective cost-benefit zzso
