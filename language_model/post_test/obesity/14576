We sought to define the mechanisms and zzso of zzso vascular actions in humans with coronary artery zzso 

In 131 patients (age zzso years zzso ex zzso vascular zzso to zzso zzso zzso was assessed in zzso vein zzso zzso zzso led to zzso relaxation zzso relaxation zzso In separate experiments, relaxation to zzso was unaffected by zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso We explored the possibility that zzso vascular effects are zzso via smooth muscle zzso In the presence of zzso (30 zzso to inhibit zzso the zzso effect of zzso was completely blocked zzso P zzso zzso zzso Similar results were demonstrated in internal zzso artery zzso The only independent correlate of zzso zzso was plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso Neither body mass index nor waist circumference correlated with zzso zzso This lack of a correlation with markers of total body zzso distribution suggests that zzso resistance may not extend to the zzso 

zzso is a zzso zzso in human zzso and internal zzso zzso Its action is not zzso oxide or zzso zzso of body fat did not correlate with zzso zzso raising the intriguing possibility of selective resistance to zzso zzso
