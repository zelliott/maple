To examine the relationship between zzso ambulatory activity zzso and body composition variables body mass index zzso and percentage body zzso 

: Secondary analysis of a zzso objective activity monitoring study for up to 21 consecutive zzso 

A total of 109 apparently healthy adults zzso African American zzso 23 African-American zzso 33 Caucasian zzso 45 Caucasian zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso ambulatory activity zzso height and weight, and percentage body fat by zzso zzso
