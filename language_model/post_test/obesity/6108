Smoking and obesity are leading global causes of zzso The aim of the present study was to develop a test to detect early lung abnormalities caused by smoking and/or obesity and to zzso the underlying mechanisms and major zzso zzso 

One hundred zzso healthy adults, 20 to 40 years of age, with normal zzso findings, were divided into the following five groups: 38 healthy subjects (15 female zzso 46 smokers (5 female zzso 18 overweight nonsmokers (2 female zzso normal body mass index zzso 25 zzso range, zzso to zzso zzso 19 overweight smokers (1 female zzso zzso range, zzso to zzso zzso and 8 zzso zzso range, zzso to zzso zzso A modified pulse zzso was employed for measuring the fall in pulse zzso zzso caused by zzso zzso zzso at resting end expiration in the sitting zzso 

In healthy subjects, zzso had no significant correlation with age zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In smokers, zzso correlated with both the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso and closing volume zzso capacity zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso p zzso In overweight nonsmokers, zzso increased significantly with zzso alone zzso zzso zzso p zzso In overweight smokers, the largest increase in the mean zzso was zzso Multiple linear zzso analysis suggested that zzso and zzso are the two major contributing factors determining zzso during zzso In young former smokers, no significant increase in the mean zzso was observed zzso zzso zzso a mean zzso zzso duration of zzso zzso zzso years after the zzso of zzso No significant difference in zzso was observed between men and zzso 

A new test that measures oxygen zzso during zzso reveals early lung abnormalities in subjects who either smoke or are overweight, especially if these factors are zzso zzso airway abnormalities and/or lung volume reduction may play roles in the greater zzso
