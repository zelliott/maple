The Mediterranean zzso pigs are obese zzso due to a zzso resistance syndrome related to zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso pig is affected by a lower zzso when compared to lean breeds, and thus may constitute a good animal model for adverse effects of obesity in zzso zzso The present study determined possible differences in rates of zzso and zzso zzso and later zzso of zzso mortality and zzso growth zzso zzso in zzso of zzso breed zzso zzso zzso and zzso lean commercial crosses zzso White zzso zzso zzso zzso 17) at two critical periods of zzso zzso Day 21 (just after achievement of zzso zzso and Day 35 (just after completion of the transition from late zzso to early zzso zzso Two different zzso performances were identified in the zzso zzso zzso of the females had lower zzso rates than zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso but zzso had a similar number of zzso zzso zzso zzso However, those zzso zzso having high zzso rates showed a high zzso of zzso of zzso zzso and zzso losses between Days 21 and 35, which was not found in zzso females with low zzso zzso therefore, the number of viable zzso was similar in both zzso groups zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and lower that in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso At Day 35, a total of 167 zzso zzso zzso and 94 zzso were evaluated for zzso The zzso zzso were longer and wider than zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso However, zzso zzso were heavier than zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso due to a lower quantity of zzso and a higher development of the zzso zzso in comparison to the zzso zzso In conclusion, current study indicates a zzso effect of obese zzso on zzso performances, either by lowering zzso rate or by increased zzso losses in the first third of zzso
