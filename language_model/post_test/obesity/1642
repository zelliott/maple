zzso and related zzso disorders such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes are associated with a zzso inflammatory state possibly through changes in gut zzso composition and the development of higher plasma zzso zzso levels, zzso zzso zzso Various zzso compounds have been investigated as potential tools to regulate these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains several classes of compounds with zzso zzso Recent evidence suggests that zzso compounds positively impact zzso metabolism and zzso tolerance in obese and diabetic zzso via undefined zzso In this study, we found that administration of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso to high-fat diet zzso obese and diabetic mice for 8 weeks reduced body weight gain, the development of fat mass, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso insulin sensitivity zzso This was associated with reduced portal plasma zzso levels, gut zzso and higher zzso tight junction proteins zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso treatment increased the plasma level of the zzso zzso zzso and decreased the plasma level of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, this research allows us to decipher a novel mechanism contributing to the positive effects of zzso treatment, and supports the need to investigate such compounds in obese and type 2 diabetic zzso
