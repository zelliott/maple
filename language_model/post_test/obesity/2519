zzso studies are needed to estimate the zzso if any, between diet quality and estimated diet zzso 

We hypothesized that lower cost diets among low-income women in California would be energy dense but zzso zzso 

Energy and zzso zzso for 112 women aged zzso y living in California were obtained with a zzso zzso zzso energy density (in zzso or zzso and zzso diet costs (in zzso zzso or zzso zzso were calculated with local food zzso zzso splits of energy density and energy cost were analyzed with zzso analysis of zzso 

Mean daily energy intake excluding all beverages was zzso zzso zzso zzso and mean dietary energy density was zzso zzso zzso zzso Lower dietary energy density was associated with significantly higher zzso of dietary fiber zzso zzso zzso vitamin A zzso zzso and vitamin C zzso zzso and with significantly lower zzso of total fat zzso zzso zzso and saturated fat zzso zzso Higher diet cost was associated with significantly lower dietary energy density zzso zzso total fat zzso zzso zzso and saturated fat zzso zzso zzso and with significantly higher zzso of vitamins A zzso zzso zzso and C zzso zzso Each additional dollar in estimated diet costs was associated with a drop in energy density of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The finding that higher quality diets were more costly for these low-income women has implications for the food assistance and education programs of the US Department of zzso Policy interventions may be required to allow low-income families in the United States to improve the quality of their diets given their food budget zzso
