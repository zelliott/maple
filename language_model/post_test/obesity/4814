Although some prospective cohort studies have shown that baseline zzso is positively associated with a future incident risk for hypertension, these studies do not account for weight changes during the observation zzso zzso it is not evident whether future incident risk for hypertension in obese, zzso people increases when their weight remains zzso We examined the association between long-term weight stability and risk for developing zzso 

A total of zzso Japanese male workers aged zzso years underwent health zzso in 2002 and were followed through zzso To consider transitions in zzso during the follow-up period, we used a zzso zzso Cox zzso hazard model to zzso the relative risks zzso of incident zzso Furthermore, as a complementary analysis, we restricted the data to individuals whose zzso remained unchanged zzso zzso of baseline zzso during the follow-up and compared the zzso between zzso zzso 

During the zzso there were zzso newly diagnosed cases of hypertension among the zzso men zzso zzso Mean change in zzso during the follow-up period of all subjects was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso The zzso zzso for hypertension increased as zzso increased when we applied the zzso zzso Cox zzso hazard zzso The complementary analysis showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso category was zzso zzso times higher than the reference of zzso zzso whereas the zzso for the zzso zzso zzso category was zzso zzso times lower than the zzso 

A higher baseline zzso increases future incident risk for hypertension even when there has been no major weight zzso Weight management should be encouraged for obese, zzso people to prevent future zzso
