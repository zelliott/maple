The plasma concentration of zzso is known to decrease in diabetic zzso In order to evaluate the usefulness of this zzso as a diabetic marker, we examined the specificity of the plasma AG reduction in various zzso the plasma AG level was determined in 108 newly diagnosed diabetic patients, 229 normal subjects and 200 patients with various other zzso The mean plasma AG concentration in diabetes zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which was definitely lower than that in healthy subjects and patients with other diseases including some zzso and hormonal diseases zzso value zzso zzso zzso Only the zzso group showed statistically different mean values from that in normal zzso however, these values were much higher than those of diabetic zzso The AG concentration seemed to be relatively low in some severe by zzso patients, but is likely to be little influenced by the zzso zzso zzso Upon adjustment for sex and age, AG concentration was not found to be correlated with the degree of obesity in both healthy subjects and diabetic zzso The plasma AG concentration showed a tendency to be higher in healthy males than in healthy females in all zzso zzso however, statistically significant differences were not zzso Also, no significant influence of age was zzso
