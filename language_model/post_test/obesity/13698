zzso zzso zzso tissue is a new index of cardiac and visceral zzso with great potential as a diagnostic tool and therapeutic zzso In this study, we sought to provide threshold values of zzso zzso fat thickness associated with zzso and zzso risk zzso 

zzso fat thickness was measured in 246 consecutive white subjects zzso women, 126 men, median age 46 years zzso median zzso 32 zzso zzso median waist circumference zzso zzso zzso who underwent routine zzso zzso for standard clinical zzso zzso syndrome zzso zzso resistance, zzso and waist circumference categories were identified and zzso fat was zzso 

Among 246 subjects, zzso had zzso These subjects showed median values of zzso fat thickness of zzso and zzso zzso (in men and women, respectively), significantly higher than those found in subjects without zzso (no zzso zzso zzso zzso operating characteristics zzso analysis showed that zzso fat thickness of zzso and zzso zzso maximize the sensitivity and specificity to predict zzso in men and women, zzso In separate zzso median zzso fat thickness values of zzso and zzso zzso were zzso points associated with high abdominal fat in men and women, zzso When insulin sensitivity was considered zzso zzso fat thickness of zzso zzso was associated with insulin zzso 

Median values of zzso and zzso zzso should be considered the threshold values for high-risk zzso zzso fat thickness in white men and women, zzso zzso zzso fat measurement may be of help for zzso risk zzso and therapeutic interventions targeting the zzso
