zzso and hypertension are reported among survivors of pediatric acute zzso leukemia zzso However, little is known about the trajectory of body mass index zzso and blood pressure over the course of ALL zzso 

In a retrospective cohort of 183 pediatric ALL patients diagnosed from 2000 to 2008, zzso severity, and risk factors for obesity and hypertension were assessed during zzso 

At diagnosis, zzso of patients were overweight and zzso were zzso Median zzso increased during induction therapy with a return to baseline soon after, but increased again over the first 22 months of maintenance zzso At the end of therapy, zzso were overweight and zzso were zzso Increased zzso zzso at diagnosis was associated with increased zzso during maintenance zzso zzso zzso parental zzso was associated with elevated zzso at zzso Median zzso zzso increased over the first 22 months of maintenance zzso zzso Patients with high risk disease had lower zzso zzso regardless of zzso zzso exposure zzso zzso zzso was prevalent over the course of therapy zzso with zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso was also highly prevalent with zzso meeting zzso criteria and zzso meeting zzso zzso 

During ALL therapy, patients are at risk for early development of elevated zzso and blood pressure, which places them at potentially increased risk for future adverse health zzso Future studies are needed to develop strategies to mitigate these risks, such as potential reduction of zzso zzso or a zzso diet and exercise intervention during maintenance zzso
