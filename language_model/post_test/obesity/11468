Laboratory rats are normally confined to cages that markedly restrict their physical zzso In these rats, the resting energy expenditure accounts for zzso of the total daily energy zzso while the daily physical activity in humans zzso zzso of the total daily energy zzso zzso Long Evans zzso zzso zzso rats have been developed as a model of zzso diabetes zzso zzso with mild zzso and obesity is an important factor that zzso diabetes in this zzso We implemented a zzso exercise regimen that was the equivalent of normal physical activity to provide light exercise for zzso zzso The purpose of the study was to determine if light exercise improves the age-related decline in energy metabolism and zzso intolerance in zzso zzso The effects were also compared in control Long Evans zzso zzso zzso From 12 to 46 weeks of age, the rats performed a zzso exercise zzso zzso Energy metabolism was determined at zzso zzso The typical increase in body weight was significantly decreased in zzso rats in response to exercise, while no significant effect was observed in zzso zzso Energy expenditure and zzso zzso rate zzso per zzso body weight (not zzso zzso were increased by exercise in zzso rats, but not in zzso zzso At 46 weeks of age, after exercise, the blood zzso and zzso zzso levels, as well as the plasma levels of insulin, zzso cholesterol, and zzso significantly decreased in zzso rats, while only the plasma levels of cholesterol and zzso significantly decreased in zzso zzso Light exercise thus appears to be beneficial for preventing age-related decline in energy metabolism and zzso intolerance in zzso zzso
