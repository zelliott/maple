Continuous indirect zzso has been used to measure the amount of zzso both stored and oxidized during the three hours following a 100 g oral zzso load in groups of normal and diabetic zzso In normal subjects, a much greater amount of zzso was stored (62 zzso than oxidized (19 zzso above zzso zzso emphasizing the greater importance of zzso storage in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso alone, as shown in experimental conditions of increased plasma zzso levels was shown to affect zzso tolerance to a limited extent only whereas marked zzso intolerance always accompanied decreased zzso zzso zzso of zzso storage was observed not only in patients with decreased insulin zzso but also in zzso zzso In these last case, the presence of a normal rate of zzso zzso demonstrates that their apparent insulin resistance was not resulting from zzso of peripheral zzso zzso but from a major zzso in zzso zzso This zzso was reversed in great part through a zzso zzso Whatever the nature of the underlying zzso mechanisms, this study shows that insulin resistance can occur not only from lack of peripheral zzso zzso but also from impairment of the capacity of the storing zzso to store zzso in the first hours following immediately oral zzso zzso
