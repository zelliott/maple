zzso offspring of zzso diabetic parents zzso who were zzso initially were available for a zzso after a period of zzso zzso Among them 10 zzso had developed diabetes, 19 zzso had developed zzso and the remaining 35 zzso had maintained normal zzso The zzso value of the baseline zzso parameters was zzso Among the non-obese zzso zzso less than 25 and less than 27 for women and men, respectively), the initial sum of plasma zzso zzso zzso and the mean zzso of insulin during zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso values were higher in the group that developed abnormal zzso tolerance zzso less than zzso compared to controls and normal zzso They also had higher zzso ratios, indicating higher insulin output for a given zzso zzso On the other hand, among the obese zzso the initial parameters did not differ between those who developed abnormal zzso tolerance and those who did zzso zzso multiple zzso analysis showed that the baseline zzso plasma zzso value was significantly related to the final zzso plasma zzso when all the zzso were taken together zzso zzso zzso and also in the non-obese zzso zzso zzso zzso The other zzso which showed a relation to the final zzso plasma zzso was the baseline delta zzso although it was not statistically significant zzso zzso zzso No such relation was observed in the obese zzso
