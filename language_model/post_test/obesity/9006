Our objective in this paper is to assess diets in the European Union zzso in relation to the recommendations of the recent World Health zzso and Agriculture Organization expert consultation and to show how diets have changed between 1961 and zzso 

zzso make use of zzso data on food availability at country level linked to a food composition database to convert foods to zzso We further explore the growing similarity of diets in the zzso by making use of a consumption similarity zzso The index provides a single number measure of dietary overlap between zzso 

The data confirm the excessive consumption by almost all countries of saturated zzso cholesterol and zzso and the convergence of zzso zzso across the zzso Whereas in 1961 diets in several European countries were more similar to US diets than to those of other European countries, this is no longer the zzso moreover, while zzso diets have become more zzso the zzso as a whole and the USA have become less similar over zzso 

Although the dominant cause of greater similarity in zzso diets over the period studied is increased zzso in Mediterranean countries of saturated zzso cholesterol and sugar, also important are reductions in saturated fat and sugar in some Northern European zzso This suggests that healthy eating messages are finally having an impact on zzso a distinctly European diet may also be zzso
