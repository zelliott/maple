The zzso hormone, zzso zzso zzso reduces food intake and enhances zzso in both humans and zzso zzso individuals also have a zzso in circulating zzso zzso although whether this is a cause or a consequence of obesity is zzso Our aims were to determine whether zzso zzso zzso zzso may have therapeutic effects for the treatment of obesity by altering energy balance and zzso zzso We generated zzso transgenic mice and measured body weight, food zzso temperature, zzso zzso zzso circulating hormone and zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso under zzso and high-fat feeding and after crossing these mice onto the genetically obese zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso transgenic mice were protected against zzso obesity in association with increased body temperature zzso of increased zzso and sustained expression of zzso hormone in the zzso nucleus of the zzso Moreover, zzso transgenic mice crossed onto the genetically obese zzso background had significantly decreased weight gain and zzso reduced serum zzso levels and improved zzso tolerance compared to zzso zzso There was no effect of zzso transgenic over expression on zzso or zzso food intake measured at zzso weeks of zzso Together, these findings suggest that long-term administration of zzso zzso compounds or agents that stimulate zzso synthesis in zzso can reduce excess zzso and improve zzso zzso possibly via effects on the zzso axis and zzso
