The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of zzso X-ray zzso zzso percentage fat estimates in obese adults by using zzso zzso values as criterion zzso zzso between methods were also investigated in relation to the influence of zzso mass zzso zzso and various zzso zzso Six women and eight men (age zzso years, zzso zzso zzso zzso percent body fat zzso zzso had relative body fat zzso determined via zzso and a zzso method that incorporated measures of body density zzso total body water zzso and bone mineral mass zzso via underwater zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were also zzso zzso waist and zzso zzso and zzso zzso chest zzso zzso for both methods were significantly correlated zzso zzso zzso and no significant difference zzso zzso zzso was detected between the means zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The slope and intercept for the zzso line were not significantly different zzso zzso from 1 and 0, zzso Although both methods were significantly zzso zzso differences between the methods were sizable zzso range zzso zzso to zzso and significantly correlated with tissue thickness zzso zzso or most surrogates of tissue thickness zzso mass, zzso waist zzso but not zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso provided zzso zzso data for obese adults without zzso However, individual data are associated with large prediction errors zzso This error appears to be associated with tissue thickness indicating that the zzso device used may not be able to accurately account for beam zzso in obese zzso
