zzso surgery in the obese can be a major challenge in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is an uncommon but zzso complication after abdominal zzso 

Our aim was to evaluate the zzso of zzso peripheral zzso after zzso surgery and to identify its risk zzso 

A retrospective review of a zzso maintained database of consecutive patients undergoing zzso operations was zzso The zzso of zzso nerve injury was compared between minimally invasive and open zzso zzso and other potential risk factors for developing peripheral zzso were zzso 

This investigation was conducted at a single zzso 

Over a zzso period, zzso zzso operations were zzso zzso of these operations were performed either zzso or via zzso zzso 166 zzso were robotic zzso and zzso zzso were open zzso zzso patients zzso developed peripheral zzso in the zzso zzso 

Forward zzso zzso zzso was used for zzso zzso 

All 23 of the patients with peripheral zzso had sensory deficits, and 1 patient had both sensory and motor zzso All of the symptoms resolved without any residual zzso deficits within 1 zzso Twenty-two of the 23 patients with peripheral zzso were in the minimally invasive surgery group zzso zzso One patient from the open group had peripheral zzso By zzso zzso analysis, only zzso was an independent predictor for peripheral zzso zzso zzso zzso in minimally invasive zzso 

A limitation of our study is that zzso zzso identification depended on reporting of symptoms, and there was no objective method of zzso In addition, because of the relatively small number of patients with zzso zzso the study may be zzso to detect significant differences in potential risk factors for developing zzso 

The zzso of zzso peripheral zzso was zzso in minimally invasive surgery and zzso in open zzso zzso invasive surgery, age, zzso zzso operative time, and zzso incision all significantly increased the risk of peripheral zzso However, only obesity was an independent risk factor for peripheral zzso in patients undergoing minimally invasive zzso zzso Preventive measures should be instituted and documented in obese patients undergoing minimally invasive zzso zzso
