Changes within the kidney in response to obesity are critical in determining the magnitude of later zzso However, the cause of this process in response to juvenile onset obesity and how it can be determined by sex is poorly zzso We therefore examined the effect of juvenile obesity induced by exposure to a restricted activity environment from weaning until early adulthood on the molecular responses within the kidney together with zzso area and zzso cell zzso This was zzso by sex and was undertaken in a sheep model of early zzso Despite a similar magnitude of increase in fat mass with obesity onset between zzso adverse effects on zzso area and cell number together with raised gene expression within the kidney only occurred in zzso zzso of zzso gene expression of zzso motif zzso 2 was higher, and zzso lower, in male zzso compared with female zzso The effects of sex on molecular differences within the kidney were amplified with zzso which had no effect on any gene studied in females but had an enhanced response in zzso zzso males therefore showed increased gene expression of a range of markers relating to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, young females were protected from adverse zzso effects of zzso which results in very little inflammatory or related zzso Our findings emphasize the critical importance of sex specificity in disease zzso An increased understanding of the specific mechanisms will have important implications for therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing adverse consequences of zzso
