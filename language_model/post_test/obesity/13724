We have compared the zzso density and muscle fiber type of zzso zzso zzso with in zzso insulin action determined by the zzso clamp zzso zzso in 23 Caucasians and 41 zzso Indian zzso zzso M value was significantly correlated with zzso density zzso zzso zzso P less than or equal to zzso percent type I fibers zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso and percent type zzso fibers zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso zzso plasma zzso and insulin zzso were significantly zzso correlated with zzso density zzso zzso zzso P less than or equal to zzso r zzso zzso P less than or equal to zzso zzso zzso zzso circumference ratio was correlated with percent type 1 fibers zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso These results suggest that diffusion distance from zzso to muscle cells or some associated zzso change, and fiber type, could play a role in determining in zzso insulin zzso The association of muscle fiber type with body fat distribution may indicate that central obesity is only one aspect of a more generalized zzso zzso The data may provide at least a partial explanation for the insulin resistance associated with obesity and for the altered zzso of insulin action in the zzso
