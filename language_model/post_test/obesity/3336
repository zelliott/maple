The resting zzso rate zzso was measured in obese zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso children using indirect zzso correlations between zzso and zzso and zzso parameters were also assessed in order to identify the existence of a zzso relationship between the reduction of the zzso and the onset of obesity in zzso zzso was expressed as an absolute value and appeared to be higher in obese subjects in comparison to controls zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso If corrected for zzso of fat free mass zzso the zzso variable which accounts for the major zzso variations of zzso resting metabolism in obese subjects was lower than that in normal weight controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso The lower percentage of zzso active zzso which make up the lean body mass in zzso zzso heart, liver and zzso and the absence of a zzso in resting zzso in the obese child could nevertheless explain the reduction of zzso zzso observed in the zzso
