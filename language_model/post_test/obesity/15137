Since the last decade, a significant increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity among children has been zzso Low zzso fitness and a low compliance with endurance sports in such children are theoretical reasons to favor the use of resistance training in intervention studies, even though positive effects of resistance training on morbidity without accompanying dietary modifications are a matter of zzso In this review we zzso the studies that have shown the isolated effect of resistance training on body composition and cardiovascular risk factors in overweight and obese zzso 

We systematically reviewed zzso studies that exclusively applied resistance training to overweight and obese 3- to 18-year-old zzso zzso zzso were body composition or cardiovascular risk zzso 

Only six studies passed the inclusion zzso All studies preferred an individually planned and supervised zzso resistance training of moderate to zzso intensity during zzso The mean compliance was zzso Four studies reported significant changes in body zzso with an increase in fat free mass and zzso along with a decrease in fat zzso Three studies analyzed the effect of resistance training on cardiovascular risk factors, and only one study reported a significant decrease in zzso blood zzso 

An individually planned and supervised zzso resistance training of moderate to zzso intensity in children seems to be safe and tends to show positive effects on body zzso Similar to interventions based on endurance exercise alone or in combination with dietary zzso the effects on cardiovascular risk factors cannot be zzso In consequence, we suggest to substantiate the effect of resistance training on cardiovascular risk factors in overweight and obese children in upcoming zzso controlled trials with high case numbers, applying both resistance training only and resistance training in combination with dietary intervention to get knowledge about whether resistance training alone is zzso in the treatment of overweight and obesity in youth or if a combination of resistance training and dietary interventions is actually zzso
