Based on findings in zzso we sought to test the hypothesis that zzso zzso of synaptic transmission occurs in the human zzso Time series analysis of zzso free zzso levels in zzso zzso zzso from zzso specimens was done using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso AM zzso zzso A zzso fiber tract stimulation zzso was used to elicit a synaptic zzso zzso zzso current zzso zzso zzso zzso was recorded in zzso in flux zzso A zzso zzso or electrical field stimulation was used to study zzso zzso zzso imaging was done in 1,222 zzso responding to zzso zzso from 61 surgical zzso zzso evoked synaptic zzso responses in zzso of recorded zzso zzso caused zzso zzso responses zzso zzso zzso zzso responses were inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso inhibitor zzso blocked zzso responses zzso zzso occurred in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso responses zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso such zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso with zzso did not prevent zzso zzso zzso caused zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso from zzso patients is a suitable model to study synaptic transmission in human enteric nervous system zzso The zzso zzso signaling pathway, zzso zzso channels, zzso zzso and zzso nerves contribute to zzso in zzso zzso zzso inhibit zzso or zzso transmission in the zzso
