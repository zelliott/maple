zzso towns had more sidewalks, less open space, a greater density of fast food restaurants, and higher rates of zzso Among zzso children, after adjusting for age, zzso race, and town, density of fast food restaurants was positively associated with overweight and zzso whereas distance to nearest zzso school and fast food restaurant were zzso associated with zzso Children from low-income towns appeared to have more consistent associations between weight status and the built zzso
