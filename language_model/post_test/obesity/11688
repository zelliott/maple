The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of obesity on zzso and zzso complications in patients undergoing free zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso breast zzso All patients undergoing breast reconstruction with free zzso zzso at our institution from February 1, 1989, through May 31, 1998, were zzso Patients were divided into three groups based on their body mass zzso normal zzso mass index zzso overweight zzso mass index 25 to 29), obese zzso mass zzso or zzso zzso and zzso complications in the three groups were zzso A total of zzso breast reconstructions with free zzso zzso were performed in zzso zzso There were zzso zzso percent) zzso 212 zzso percent) overweight, and 64 zzso percent) obese zzso zzso complications occurred in 222 of zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with zzso patients, obese patients had a significantly higher rate of overall zzso complications zzso versus zzso percent; p zzso zzso total zzso loss zzso versus 0 percent; p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso percent; p zzso zzso and mastectomy zzso necrosis zzso versus zzso percent; p zzso zzso Similarly, overweight patients had a significantly higher rate of overall zzso complications zzso versus zzso percent; p zzso zzso total zzso loss zzso versus 0 percent p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso percent; p zzso zzso and mastectomy zzso necrosis zzso versus zzso percent; p zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso complications occurred in 106 of zzso patients zzso zzso Compared with zzso patients, obese patients had a significantly higher rate of overall zzso complications zzso versus zzso percent; p zzso zzso infection zzso versus zzso percent; p zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso percent; p zzso and zzso zzso versus zzso percent; p zzso zzso Similarly, overweight patients had a significantly higher rate of overall zzso complications zzso versus zzso percent; p zzso zzso infection zzso versus zzso percent; p zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso percent; p zzso zzso and zzso zzso versus zzso percent; p zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso There were no significant differences in age distribution, smoking history, or zzso conditions among the three groups of zzso zzso patients, however, had a significantly higher zzso of zzso zzso and zzso chemotherapy than did patients in the other two zzso A total of zzso percent of obese patients had zzso radiation therapy compared with zzso percent of overweight patients and zzso percent of zzso zzso zzso percent of obese patients had zzso chemotherapy compared with zzso percent of overweight patients and zzso percent of zzso zzso Multiple zzso zzso analysis was used to determine the risk factors for zzso and zzso complications while simultaneously controlling for potential zzso factors, including the zzso of zzso chemotherapy and zzso In zzso obese and overweight patients undergoing breast reconstruction with free zzso zzso had significantly higher total zzso loss, zzso zzso zzso zzso mastectomy skin zzso zzso zzso infection, zzso zzso and zzso compared with zzso zzso There were no significant differences in the rate of partial zzso loss, vessel zzso fat zzso abdominal zzso zzso or zzso necrosis between any of the zzso The majority of overweight and even obese patients who undertake breast reconstruction with free zzso zzso complete the reconstruction zzso Both such patients and zzso however, must clearly understand that the risk of failure and complications is higher than in zzso zzso Patients who are zzso obese are at very high risk of failure and complications and should avoid any type of zzso zzso breast zzso
