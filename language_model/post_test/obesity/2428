Administration of zzso amounts of zzso was studied in the zzso zzso zzso When administered zzso doses from 250 to 2,000 zzso significantly decreased plasma zzso in obese rats over eight to 12 weeks, with no effect on plasma zzso in lean zzso zzso doses at the same high levels were not effective in decreasing plasma zzso zzso zzso rate was reduced from zzso zzso to zzso zzso in treated obese zzso zzso liver zzso was increased twofold in obese treated rats, and the zzso of these rats showed significant fatty zzso The mechanism of action of zzso in decreasing plasma zzso appeared to be via decreased zzso of zzso by the liver of obese zzso There was no effect of zzso in lean or obese rats on the following zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso capacity, zzso zzso in heart, muscle, and zzso or zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso thus appears to be an zzso of zzso synthesis and/or zzso by the zzso
