Control of zzso mass is important in the treatment of both zzso and zzso This review focuses on a novel zzso zzso zzso which plays an important role in the zzso and zzso of stored zzso 

An increased zzso is responsible for the loss of zzso tissue in zzso through an increased zzso response to zzso arising from an increased expression of zzso zzso In zzso there is a decreased response of zzso to catecholamines and reduced expression of zzso zzso zzso was identified as a zzso factor produced by certain zzso zzso and subsequently zzso tissue (both white and zzso the expression of which was found to increase in zzso In contrast, zzso expression is low in zzso zzso not only increases zzso in white zzso tissue through the classical zzso zzso pathway, but also stimulates an increase in expression of zzso zzso in brown zzso zzso which would stimulate zzso of the release zzso to generate zzso zzso zzso zzso mice show an increase in body weight, especially when fed a high-fat diet, whereas zzso from such animals show a resistance to zzso by catecholamines and agents that increase zzso zzso zzso 

These results suggest that zzso may play an important role in the regulation of zzso mass in obesity and zzso
