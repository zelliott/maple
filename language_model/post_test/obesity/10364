The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of peanut zzso zzso zzso shell extracts zzso on zzso and to evaluate its potential development for the treatment of zzso The peanut shells were extracted in zzso ethanol, and the extracts were screened for zzso effects on pancreatic zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activities as well as on zzso of zzso zzso We also examined in zzso whether zzso could prevent the body weight gain induced by feeding a high-fat diet to male zzso rats for 12 zzso zzso zzso a number of zzso including zzso zzso and, zzso hormone sensitive zzso zzso zzso zzso rats showed increased zzso zzso zzso respect to the control zzso Body weight and body weight gain, and liver size, were significantly lower in rats fed the high-fat diet with zzso of zzso zzso zzso than in those fed the high-fat diet zzso The rats treated with zzso showed reduced zzso content in the liver, as well as the serum zzso and zzso The zzso activity of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso and the increase in zzso fat zzso suggests that zzso might be useful as a treatment to reduce the dietary fat zzso The observed reduction in zzso zzso activity of cultured zzso zzso may reduce the levels of circulating free fatty zzso The observed effects are likely induced by more than one zzso component of zzso The zzso actions may, at least in part, be attributed to the zzso of fat zzso in the zzso tract and the reduction of the zzso zzso
