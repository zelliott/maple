Previous studies demonstrated that administration of insulin and oral zzso agents tends to produce weight gain in type II diabetic zzso The goal of this study was to determine the potential contribution of changes in zzso rate and urinary zzso zzso to changes in energy balance associated with treatment with zzso and zzso Six obese type II diabetic patients zzso zzso old; zzso of ideal zzso were fed a zzso diet of fixed composition and caloric content in a Clinical Research zzso The mean zzso plasma zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso before treatment, zzso zzso zzso zzso at the end of 2 weeks of zzso treatment, and zzso zzso zzso zzso at the end of 2 weeks of insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased from 48 zzso 19 zzso before treatment to 20 zzso 9 zzso at the end of zzso treatment and 2 zzso 1 zzso at the end of insulin zzso Neither treatment affected mean zzso resting zzso rate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso resting zzso rate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the two patients with the largest decreases in urinary zzso zzso also had decreases in energy zzso These data indicate that many obese type II diabetic patients could have significant weight gain from reduced energy losses zzso
