zzso in women has been associated with a variety of factors, including genetic zzso social class, early age at zzso exercise, alcohol consumption and zzso zzso is a risk factor for the occurrence and the recurrence of breast cancer in zzso women, perhaps because of increased exposure to estrogen, insulin and zzso growth factors zzso The zzso zzso zzso and the steroid hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso are hypothesized to mediate signaling zzso between these hormonal zzso zzso in both genes have been described and their association with breast cancer risk zzso If genetic factors contribute to zzso and the zzso and zzso genes influence zzso insulin and zzso zzso then genetic patterns resulting from zzso and zzso zzso may be associated with obesity in zzso zzso 

We compared the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso women with breast cancer with zzso zzso zzso lifestyle and dietary variables in terms of the strength of their relationship with obesity zzso or zzso zzso 

A total of 301 zzso women previously diagnosed with Stage I, II or zzso breast cancer, who are enrolled in the Women's Healthy Eating and Living zzso study zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso was identified by zzso The length of the zzso zzso repeat was determined by zzso and zzso gel zzso or DNA zzso zzso was obtained at the baseline clinic visit upon entry into the zzso zzso Information about date of diagnosis, stage of disease, tumor hormone zzso status and zzso treatment received were obtained from medical zzso zzso zzso history, zzso family history of cancer, smoking history and exercise frequency and intensity information were obtained from zzso zzso and alcohol intake data came from four zzso telephone recalls of food intake obtained at the study zzso 

The combined inheritance of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso odds ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso and early age at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were each associated with the risk for zzso Current use of tamoxifen zzso zzso zzso and an alcohol zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso associated with zzso or zzso zzso 

Early age at zzso and a zzso zzso LG genetic pattern had comparable levels of association with obesity in this zzso sample of zzso women with breast zzso Since this was a zzso rather than a zzso design, the association between zzso and zzso zzso and obesity found in this sample should be considered zzso and must be re-evaluated with a new and larger zzso
