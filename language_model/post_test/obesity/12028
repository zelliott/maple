This review of literature and our data suggests that zzso production of zzso zzso in periphery and brain triggers a merger of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso pathways into inflammation cascade involved in aging and zzso medical and psychiatric disorders zzso zzso syndrome, depression, vascular cognitive zzso zzso zzso inflammation cascade is characterized by zzso of zzso oxide zzso zzso activity zzso by zzso and decreased formation of zzso zzso zzso that results in zzso of zzso that shifting zzso from NO to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and free zzso among zzso derivatives trigger zzso zzso acid cascade associated with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso pathway, decreases TRY conversion into zzso zzso of zzso zzso and increases production of zzso associated with diabetes zzso acid zzso anxiety zzso zzso and cognitive impairment zzso zzso zzso zzso inflammation cascade is impacted by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition to literature data on zzso ratio zzso activity zzso we observe zzso levels zzso of activity of zzso zzso of zzso zzso to be higher in carriers of high zzso than of low zzso producers zzso and to correlate with zzso markers zzso insulin resistance, body mass index, mortality zzso and with zzso depression in zzso C zzso zzso cascade is influenced by environmental factors zzso vitamin B6 zzso increases zzso zzso and by pharmacological zzso and might offer new approaches for zzso and zzso zzso
