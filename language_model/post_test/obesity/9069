We conducted a zzso clinical trial in which all participants completed a 6 month clinical weight loss program and were zzso into two zzso extended care zzso Participants then returned at 12 and 24 months for follow-up zzso A total of 144 individuals zzso women, M age zzso zzso zzso zzso M zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso completed the 6 month intervention and 104 returned at 24 zzso zzso outcomes of weight and zzso using the zzso were analyzed using zzso repeated measures zzso 

There was complete data on 91 participants through the 24 months of the zzso At baseline the participants scored lower than zzso zzso population norms for bodily pain, zzso and mental zzso At the completion of the 6 month clinical intervention there were increases in the physical and mental composite measures as well as physical zzso general health, zzso and mental health zzso of the zzso Despite some weight zzso the improvements in the mental composite scale as well as the physical zzso zzso and mental health zzso were maintained at 24 zzso There were no significant main effects or interactions by extended care treatment group or weight loss group zzso or not they maintained zzso loss at 24 zzso
