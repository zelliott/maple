The purpose of this study was to evaluate the serum chemistry profiles and the degree of protein binding of six zzso in the zzso of genetically obese zzso rats and their lean litter zzso Free fatty acid zzso were significantly elevated in the serum of obese zzso zzso rat serum had a mean fraction zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which was significantly higher than that found in the lean rat zzso zzso serum chemistry and/or pathological states may play a significant role in altering drug protein zzso
