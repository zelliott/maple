zzso dysfunction is implicated in zzso The zzso zzso zzso regulates the synaptic availability of zzso However, zzso availability has not been previously characterized in zzso in obese people using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report findings evaluating zzso availability in individuals with obesity and matched lean zzso normal zzso comparison zzso 

zzso obese but otherwise healthy individuals with a zzso body mass index zzso of zzso and 17 lean individuals with a zzso zzso of zzso were studied using a high-resolution research zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso selective for the zzso The regional brain zzso binding potential zzso was estimated by the zzso reference tissue model 2 zzso with the zzso zzso as a reference zzso zzso for regions of interest were obtained with the zzso zzso zzso zzso template registered to zzso structural MR zzso 

zzso individuals had lower zzso zzso values in the zzso zzso zzso zzso including within the zzso zzso zzso zzso but not in the zzso locus zzso or the zzso zzso compared to lean zzso When age was included as a zzso the difference in zzso zzso values remained significant in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

These results indicate that zzso availability is decreased in the thalamus, including the zzso in obese zzso These findings further support data indicating zzso dysfunction in obesity and suggest impaired zzso clearance in zzso
