zzso zzso levels and body composition of male and female zzso zzso and lean zzso mice were examined between 17 days and 1 year of zzso zzso mice displayed three distinct periods of growth with each phase characterized by a different pattern of zzso Until 4 weeks of age, zzso mice had slightly higher rates of weight gain and fat zzso than zzso lean zzso zzso was in the normal range and insulin levels were zzso Shortly after the transition to solid food, zzso mice displayed several weeks of increased body growth and very high rates of fat zzso During this period of rapid weight gain, zzso arose despite progressively increasing zzso zzso zzso of individual obese mice at this time revealed that zzso was highly correlated with the rate of body fat zzso The final phase of the zzso syndrome began at 3 months of age, as rates of fat deposition abruptly slowed to values slightly less than those of lean mice and zzso values declined to normal although zzso and zzso intolerance zzso The present results show that zzso mice, although characterized throughout life by many zzso and growth zzso only display diabetes zzso and exaggerated fat deposition during a 6 to 8 week period just after zzso
