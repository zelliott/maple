To determine the prevalence of zzso dysfunction zzso in a large cohort of Brazilian men who were screened for prostate cancer, and to determine risk factors in this population, as there are large cultural differences among countries in reporting the frequency of zzso and it is likely that the prevalence of zzso among men screened for prostate cancer cannot be generally applied across zzso 

The analysis focused on the baseline characteristics of 1008 consecutive South American men from Brazil with no known prostate disease who had routine screening for prostate cancer by zzso The variables zzso were patient age, urinary symptoms, patient zzso quality of life zzso zzso zzso zzso levels, prostate volume and zzso zzso To assess lower urinary tract symptoms zzso and zzso we used the American Urological Association symptom score and its appended eighth question, zzso zzso zzso zzso was defined as a prostate volume zzso zzso Sexual function was assessed using the zzso version of the International Index of zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso was considered to absent for scores of zzso mild for zzso mild to moderate for zzso moderate for zzso or severe for zzso zzso was defined by calculating the body mass index zzso and zzso as zzso zzso zzso normal weight zzso zzso overweight zzso zzso or obese zzso 30 zzso The mean zzso zzso level was zzso zzso zzso and the mean prostate volume zzso zzso zzso The correlation of zzso with these variables was estimated using unconditional zzso zzso zzso 

Information about zzso function was available for zzso zzso zzso was considered to be zzso mild, mild to moderate, moderate and severe in 169 zzso 210 zzso 169 zzso 138 zzso and 222 zzso patients, zzso The zzso was severe in zzso zzso and zzso of patients with mild, moderate and severe zzso respectively zzso zzso The answer to the zzso question was also significantly associated with zzso zzso was severe in zzso of patients feeling zzso and in zzso of patients feeling zzso zzso zzso The prostate volume was significantly related to zzso The zzso category showed that normal weight, overweight and obese patients had similar rates of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was severe in about a quarter of the patients in each of these categories, and 50% and zzso of patients in the zzso and greater zzso groups had severe zzso zzso 

Of men screened for prostate cancer in Brazil, approximately zzso have moderate or severe zzso Severe zzso higher zzso scores, a large prostate volume, a low zzso and higher zzso levels might be associated with higher rates of zzso These variables should be considered when zzso the zzso function of patients screened for prostate zzso
