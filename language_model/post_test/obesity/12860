Ad zzso zzso zzso is the most zzso uncontrolled variable affecting the outcome of the current zzso zzso There is a highly significant correlation between zzso food consumption, the zzso obesity and body weight, and low zzso survival in zzso zzso feeding of diets with lowered zzso zzso energy zzso and increased fiber does not improve zzso Only dietary restriction zzso of all diets tested significantly improves survival and delays the onset of spontaneous degenerative disease zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso DR results in an zzso of spontaneous tumors similar to zzso rats, but the tumors are found zzso and do not cause early zzso There is a decreased zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso tumors in moderate zzso rats, but tumor growth time is similar between zzso and DR rats with only a delay in tumor onset time seen in zzso zzso zzso DR does not significantly alter zzso zzso activities nor the zzso response to 5 pharmaceuticals tested at maximum tolerated doses zzso However, moderate zzso rats did require much higher doses of 4 additional pharmaceutical compounds before classical zzso were zzso zzso studies of 2 of these compounds demonstrated equal or higher zzso systemic zzso to parent drug and zzso in moderate zzso zzso zzso of zzso stress zzso zzso protein zzso are decreased and zzso zzso markers are preserved in moderate zzso zzso But moderate DR does not delay zzso zzso in female zzso Only marked DR delays zzso zzso compared to zzso and moderate zzso female zzso These and other data indicate that moderate DR is the most appropriate method of dietary control for the zzso zzso when used to assess pharmaceuticals for human safety and compounds for risk zzso
