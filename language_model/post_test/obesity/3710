zzso duct stones that cannot be removed zzso are still a challenge in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with subsequent zzso extraction of residual fragments is an established treatment option if other zzso means are not zzso Our study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of zzso for clearance of zzso zzso duct zzso 

A total of 73 consecutive patients treated for zzso zzso with zzso were zzso zzso Success and complication rates were zzso 

Complete stone clearance was achieved in 66 cases zzso Patients with complete clearance had a significantly lower body mass index or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and needed less zzso treatments zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso A relevant drop of zzso occurred significantly more often in the group with partial clearance zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso proves to be an excellent clearing approach to zzso zzso duct stones with high success zzso However, obesity is one risk factor for zzso failure and higher procedural zzso
