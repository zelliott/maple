zzso is a chronic inflammatory disease that zzso zzso innate immune response to zzso Since zzso polarization is crucial during acute infectious diseases, we hypothesized that zzso obesity zzso zzso polarization of zzso in the response to bacterial zzso Bone zzso zzso zzso from lean and obese mice were exposed to live zzso zzso zzso zzso for three incubation times (1 zzso 4 h and 24 zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso polarization was inhibited after zzso zzso exposure in zzso from obese mice when compared with zzso from lean zzso Using a zzso approach in conjunction with zzso data, we identified switching genes that may zzso control the behavior of response pathways in zzso from lean and obese zzso The two most prominent switching genes were zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso expression levels of both genes were higher in obese zzso than in lean zzso after exposure to zzso zzso zzso of either zzso 1 or zzso 1 by specific zzso recovered the zzso polarization of zzso from obese mice after zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso 1 and zzso 1 are important bacterial response zzso whose regulation is altered in zzso from obese zzso
