Based on the known effect of zzso zzso in improving insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes, with the scope to focus the effects on zzso and free fatty acids zzso levels, we studied the effects of a short-term treatment with this drug in obese subjects and obese patients with diabetes or family history of diabetes zzso We used a method to allow us to evaluate the possible difference of insulin sensibility with regard to the insulin action on zzso and blood zzso both in the zzso state and during oral zzso tolerance test zzso 

zzso sensitivity was investigated before and after zzso treatment zzso zzso bid for 10 zzso in seven obese subjects with normal zzso tolerance and without zzso and 13 obese patients with diabetes zzso or zzso zzso By using specifically designed zzso we calculated four zzso zzso zzso from zzso level zzso and area values zzso (during zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

In patients with diabetes or zzso zzso improved zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas only minor changes occurred for zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, in simple obese subjects, zzso induced further deterioration of both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso level and total area of zzso were high in the obese patients and were not affected by zzso A statistically significant increase zzso however, was observed for the zzso area of zzso in obese subjects with diabetes or zzso which might probably contribute to the reduction of insulin resistance induced by the drug in these zzso 

Although the low number of subjects studied zzso absolute conclusions, data would suggest that zzso improved zzso towards zzso but not towards zzso in the diabetic and zzso obese patients, whereas worsened it in the obese subjects without zzso zzso the effects of zzso would not be secondary to changes of zzso but rather to a primary action of zzso on zzso zzso Thus, zzso of zzso to treat the insulin resistance in obesity is indicated only in the presence of zzso of zzso metabolism or zzso
