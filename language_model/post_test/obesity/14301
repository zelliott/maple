Enlargement of zzso from subcutaneous abdominal zzso tissue zzso increased zzso zzso content zzso zzso zzso content zzso and low circulating zzso zzso are associated with insulin zzso 

Because zzso increases fat zzso in skeletal muscle and liver, and the expression of the zzso gene in SAT is zzso associated with zzso size, we hypothesized that zzso links zzso obesity with insulin resistance via increased zzso and zzso 

zzso obese zzso Indians with a mean zzso age of 27 zzso 8 zzso body fat of 35 zzso zzso and normal zzso regulation zzso zzso and zzso zzso concentration per WHO 1999 zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso of SAT and zzso zzso muscle, and magnetic resonance imaging of the zzso 

zzso diameter zzso correlated positively with body fat zzso zzso and zzso zzso from magnetic resonance imaging intensity of zzso P zzso zzso No association was found between zzso and plasma zzso or zzso Plasma zzso zzso correlated with type II zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso In a zzso analysis, plasma zzso zzso and visceral zzso tissue zzso independently predicted zzso Low zzso zzso disposal was associated with low plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso and high zzso zzso zzso zzso SAT zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso High zzso was the only predictor of reduced zzso suppression of zzso zzso production zzso zzso zzso and the only independent predictor of zzso zzso disposal in a zzso zzso 

Increased zzso content in the liver may independently link zzso zzso zzso and increased visceral zzso with peripheral and zzso insulin zzso
