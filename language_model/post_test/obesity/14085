A low resting zzso rate zzso is considered a risk factor for weight gain and zzso however, due to the greater zzso mass zzso found in zzso detecting an impairment in zzso is zzso The purposes of this study were to determine the zzso in lean and obese women controlling for zzso and investigate activity energy expenditure zzso and daily activity patterns in the two zzso 

Twenty healthy, zzso zzso women (10 lean and 10 zzso participated in this zzso zzso study on zzso energy zzso zzso was measured by indirect zzso zzso and total energy expenditure zzso were calculated using doubly labeled water zzso and activity patterns were investigated using zzso Body composition including zzso and fat mass zzso was measured by dual energy X-ray zzso zzso 

zzso was similar in the obese zzso lean women zzso zzso 109 zzso zzso zzso 109 zzso respectively, P zzso zzso adjusting for zzso and zzso zzso women sat zzso h more each day zzso zzso zzso h zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso stood 2 h less zzso zzso zzso h zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and spent half as much time in activity than lean women zzso zzso zzso h zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso was not lower in the obese zzso however, they were more sedentary and zzso less energy in activity than the lean zzso If the obese women adopted the activity patterns of the lean women, including a modification of posture zzso an additional 300 zzso could be zzso every zzso
