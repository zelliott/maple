zzso has been identified as an important risk factor in the development of cardiovascular diseases; however, other factors, combined or not with zzso can influence cardiovascular risk and should be considered in cardiovascular risk zzso in zzso 

To analyze the association between zzso measures and cardiovascular risk factors, to investigate the zzso to changes in blood pressure zzso and to propose a prediction equation to waist circumference zzso in children and zzso 

We evaluated 1,950 children and zzso aged 7 to 18 zzso zzso fat was assessed by zzso and zzso relationship, zzso and body mass index zzso In a randomly selected zzso of these volunteers zzso zzso zzso total cholesterol, zzso and zzso levels were zzso 

zzso was positively correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso and zzso zzso r zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso showed a weak correlation with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso e r zzso zzso p zzso zzso Total cholesterol did not correlate with any of the zzso Age, zzso and zzso were significant zzso on the zzso models for zzso zzso zzso We propose a zzso prediction equation for children and zzso boys: y zzso zzso + zzso zzso in zzso zzso y zzso zzso + zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso is associated with cardiovascular risk factors and presents itself as a risk factor predictor of hypertension in children and zzso The zzso prediction equation proposed by us should be tested in future zzso
