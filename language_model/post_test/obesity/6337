Although physical zzso is believed to contribute to the rising prevalence of zzso the role and magnitude of its contribution to weight gain are zzso 

We compared total zzso activity energy expenditure zzso and physical activity level in women successful and unsuccessful at maintaining a normal body zzso 

zzso generally sedentary women were studied at their normal weight and 1 y later after no zzso Two groups were identified on the basis of extreme weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had a weight gain of zzso zzso of their initial body weight ( zzso 2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso had a weight gain zzso zzso zzso At baseline and zzso evaluations were conducted during 4 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and physical activity were assessed with the use of doubly labeled water, exercise energy economy and muscle strength with the use of standardized exercise tests, and sleeping zzso and zzso zzso with the use of chamber zzso 

zzso lost a mean (plus zzso of zzso plus minus zzso zzso and zzso gained zzso plus minus zzso zzso zzso had a lower zzso zzso zzso a lower physical activity level zzso zzso and less muscle strength zzso zzso these differences between groups remained significant from baseline to zzso Sleeping zzso exercise economy, and sleeping or zzso zzso zzso were not significantly different between the 2 zzso A lower zzso in the zzso explained approximately zzso of their greater weight gain after 1 zzso 

The general US population should increase their daily physical activity levels to decrease the rising prevalence of zzso
