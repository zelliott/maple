To determine gender differences of regional abdominal fat distribution and their relationships with insulin sensitivity in healthy and zzso zzso 44 subjects, 22 men and 22 body mass zzso women, with normal and abnormal zzso zzso which included subjects with impaired zzso tolerance and diabetes, were zzso Total body fat and total abdominal fat zzso at zzso were measured by zzso zzso zzso Regional abdominal fat, which consists of zzso abdominal fat and visceral abdominal fat, was determined by zzso computerized zzso of the abdomen at zzso disc space zzso zzso sensitivity was determined by zzso zzso clamp and expressed as zzso infusion rate zzso With comparable body mass index, visceral abdominal fat was most strongly correlated with zzso after adjustment with percent total body fat in both healthy zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso women zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso whereas zzso was most strongly correlated with zzso in both healthy zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso men zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso By linear zzso analysis, visceral abdominal fat accounted for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso of zzso zzso in women, whereas zzso accounted for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso of zzso zzso in zzso We conclude that there are gender differences in the relationships of regional abdominal fat and insulin sensitivity in slightly obese healthy and zzso zzso the difference of which may possibly be in part due to the difference of abdominal fat patterning between zzso
