In this context, we screened a Spanish population, composed of obese subjects and normal weight controls, for zzso in the zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso 313 individuals, 159 obese subjects zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 154 normal weight control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were screened for zzso zzso 

We detected a novel nonsense zzso at zzso 16 of the zzso in an obese female zzso zzso zzso and a previously described zzso zzso zzso located within the sixth zzso domain of the zzso in a normal weight individual zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was detected in one obese individual, while four subjects zzso cases and two zzso with the zzso zzso were zzso 

We have identified a novel nonsense zzso zzso that, based on previously described zzso and nonsense zzso most likely results in zzso inherited zzso Within this Spanish population, the frequency of the zzso zzso of the zzso was similar in obese and control subjects (about zzso while the zzso zzso was only detected in an obese individual zzso
