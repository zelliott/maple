zzso of zzso zzso zzso and RV in chronic zzso include factors related and unrelated to zzso The mechanisms remain to be determined but likely involve the elastic properties and muscle function of the respiratory system and perhaps the effects of systemic inflammation related to zzso Addressing modifiable factors such as zzso muscle zzso and smoking may improve respiratory morbidity and mortality in zzso by improving pulmonary zzso
