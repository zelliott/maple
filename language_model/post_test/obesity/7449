zzso zzso induce zzso zzso Acute exercise has the potential to zzso zzso zzso zzso No study has determined whether there are racial differences in zzso zzso stress with and without a preceding bout of acute zzso 

To investigate the impact of acute exercise on blood zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in African American zzso and White zzso zzso 

10 AA (age 29 zzso 3 zzso zzso index zzso 31 zzso 3 zzso and 10 W (age 30 zzso 2 zzso zzso 30 zzso 3 zzso women consumed a meal of zzso g of fat and zzso and zzso g of protein per zzso body mass, on 2 zzso and without a session of zzso exercise 15 zzso preceding the meal zzso zzso cycling at zzso zzso zzso a zzso crossover zzso Blood samples were collected zzso zzso and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, hydrogen zzso zzso and zzso zzso Area under the curve zzso was calculated for each zzso 

zzso was lower for AA compared with W for both the exercise and the no exercise conditions for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, acute exercise had no effect on decreasing the zzso for any variable in either AA or W women zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso stress are lower in AA than in W zzso zzso However, acute exercise, performed at the intensity and duration in the current study, does not influence zzso zzso or zzso stress in AA or W zzso
