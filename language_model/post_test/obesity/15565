To examine whether fatty acid transport is abnormal in zzso the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso cardiac zzso and zzso from adult male zzso zzso zzso lean zzso and fatty zzso and zzso diabetic fatty zzso rats were zzso A zzso increase in zzso zzso was found in zzso and zzso zzso in which the zzso was increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This increase greatly exceeded the zzso increase in the surface area of zzso from obese animals, and did not result from zzso secondary to increased zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso levels, zzso by Northern zzso increased in the order zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also studied in zzso from zzso male zzso zzso and zzso zzso These animals were not obese, and had equivalent plasma fatty acid and zzso zzso zzso necrosis zzso zzso levels in zzso and zzso cells also were zzso Nevertheless, zzso was increased zzso zzso zzso in zzso compared zzso zzso These studies indicate 1) that regulation of fatty acid zzso is zzso and 2) that zzso of zzso fatty acid zzso is an early event in zzso zzso zzso These findings are independent of the role of any particular fatty acid zzso zzso zzso levels of three putative zzso zzso zzso zzso fatty acid zzso and fatty acid transporting protein zzso were also zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso correlated strongly with fatty acid zzso
