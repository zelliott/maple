Childhood zzso epidemic in the United States, has been accompanied by an increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes among children and zzso We determined the prevalence of impaired zzso tolerance in a multiethnic cohort of 167 obese children and zzso 

All subjects underwent a two-hour oral zzso test zzso g zzso zzso zzso of zzso per zzso of body zzso and zzso insulin, and zzso levels were zzso zzso levels of zzso were zzso and the ratio of zzso to insulin was zzso zzso resistance was estimated by zzso model assessment, and zzso function was estimated by calculating the ratio between the changes in the insulin level and the zzso level during the first 30 minutes after the zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso tolerance was detected in 25 percent of the 55 obese children (4 to 10 years of zzso and 21 percent of the 112 obese adolescents (11 to 18 years of zzso silent type 2 diabetes was identified in 4 percent of the obese zzso zzso and zzso levels were markedly elevated after the zzso test in subjects with impaired zzso tolerance but not in adolescents with diabetes, who had a reduced ratio of the 30-minute change in the insulin level to the 30-minute change in the zzso zzso After the zzso index had been controlled for, insulin resistance was greater in the affected cohort and was the best predictor of impaired zzso zzso 

zzso zzso tolerance is highly prevalent among children and adolescents with severe zzso irrespective of ethnic zzso zzso oral zzso tolerance was associated with insulin resistance while zzso function was still relatively zzso zzso type 2 diabetes was linked to zzso zzso
