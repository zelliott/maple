Certain cardiovascular risk factors have been linked to morbidity and mortality in heart transplant zzso zzso The sum of various risk factors may have a large cumulative negative effect, leading to a substantially worse prognosis and the need to consider whether zzso is zzso The objective of this study was to determine whether the risk factors usually available prior to zzso result in an excess mortality in our setting that zzso zzso 

zzso patients who underwent heart transplantation from November 1987 to January 2004 were zzso zzso transplants, zzso and pediatric transplants were zzso Of the zzso patients, zzso were zzso Mean age was 52 years zzso 12 to zzso zzso disease included zzso heart disease zzso idiopathic zzso zzso zzso zzso disease zzso and other zzso zzso considered risk factors were obesity zzso zzso hypertension, prior zzso surgery, diabetes, and history of zzso heart zzso Survival zzso by number of risk factors using zzso and zzso for comparison of zzso 

zzso patient survival at 1, 5, 10, and 13 years was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Survival at 10 years, if fewer than two risk factors were present, was zzso 59% if two or three factors were zzso and 37% if more than three associated risk factors were present zzso zzso zzso 

The presence of certain risk factors in patients undergoing zzso resulted in lower survival zzso The combination of various risk factors clearly worsened zzso However, we do not believe this should be an absolute zzso for zzso
