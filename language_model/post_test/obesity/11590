Previous investigations have demonstrated an association between impaired insulin sensitivity and elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It has been speculated that insulin resistance and zzso zzso are zzso related to the development of elevated zzso CT zzso To test this hypothesis, we measured insulin sensitivity zzso insulin clamp zzso and zzso CT activity in eight obese women before zzso zzso 102 zzso 5 zzso and after zzso zzso 88 zzso 5 zzso P zzso a 10 week weight reduction zzso zzso zzso of zzso CT activity did not change zzso zzso zzso v zzso zzso zzso zzso red blood zzso P zzso zzso despite the significant improvement in insulin sensitivity zzso zzso 12 vs 110 zzso 7 zzso P zzso and reduction in zzso insulin levels (17 zzso 2 v 10 zzso 2 zzso P zzso that accompanied weight zzso These results suggest that insulin resistance and zzso are not linked zzso to the development of elevated zzso CT zzso
