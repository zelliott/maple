In zzso subjects, insulin zzso and insulin resistance are clearly connected, and both correlate with zzso levels, making interpretations about mechanisms zzso In zzso zzso 2) diabetes zzso zzso however, insulin zzso and insulin resistance are less closely zzso zzso we examined the relationship of plasma zzso zzso within insulin resistance and insulin levels in 32 subjects with zzso who underwent measurement of insulin resistance with an insulin sensitivity zzso Plasma zzso was measured with an in-house zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso level correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso clearance rate of zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso specific insulin zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso but not with age, cholesterol, zzso or blood pressure zzso zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso In linear zzso analysis, after adjustment for zzso and zzso zzso zzso correlated with those of insulin zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso but not insulin resistance zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso We conclude that in zzso zzso of plasma zzso are closely related to those of insulin per zzso and to zzso but not to insulin zzso zzso may be an important regulator of zzso concentration in zzso
