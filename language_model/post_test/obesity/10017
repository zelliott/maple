We investigated the effect of obesity on the serum levels of total and free IGF-1 and their relationship to the circulating levels of insulin and zzso binding proteins zzso in age and zzso zzso 

The study included 43 obese subjects zzso body zzso zzso zzso and 45 controls zzso zzso All of the subjects were zzso 

Total IGF-1, free IGF-1, zzso zzso zzso and insulin were measured in obese subjects and normal control zzso 

No significant differences in the circulating levels of total and zzso were observed between the obese and control zzso In contrast to total IGF-1, free IGF-1 in obese subjects was significantly increased compared to normal controls zzso zzso zzso total and free IGF-1 were zzso correlated with age zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso P zzso zzso zzso serum insulin zzso were elevated in all the obese subjects zzso zzso and positively correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The levels of serum zzso and zzso were suppressed in all the obese subjects zzso zzso zzso was zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and serum insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso zzso were also suppressed in obese subjects and zzso related to free IGF-1 zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Using multiple linear zzso analysis, total IGF-1 and insulin zzso were positively correlated zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and free IGF-1 and zzso zzso were zzso correlated zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

We confirmed that total IGF-1 and zzso zzso were not significantly different between the obese and control groups, despite zzso zzso in zzso We also found that free IGF-1 zzso were higher in obese subjects than in normal zzso It seems likely that zzso and chronic zzso in obesity may alter this regulated growth response by insulin stimulation of IGF-1 production and suppression of zzso zzso and zzso production, which may inhibit IGF-1 zzso
