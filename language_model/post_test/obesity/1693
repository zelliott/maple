zzso dysfunction and carotid zzso zzso zzso are currently considered key early events in zzso and markers of zzso zzso We investigated whether zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may influence the vascular response to weight, as measured by zzso in young, healthy zzso 

One hundred young zzso zzso healthy individuals, without zzso traditional cardiovascular risk factors took part in the zzso zzso artery zzso function was assessed by vascular response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso using high-resolution zzso zzso zzso was also zzso 

Participants were grouped as zzso zzso and zzso zzso On zzso analysis, a higher response to zzso was associated with lower zzso baseline diameter zzso and increasing value of zzso zzso cholesterol zzso in zzso but not in zzso Higher zzso correlated with lower zzso baseline diameter zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso but not in zzso Higher zzso showed a similar zzso association with higher zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In individuals with zzso the zzso analysis showed that zzso was the only independent predictor of zzso 

Weight is independently associated with impaired zzso structure in healthy and genetically predisposed young zzso The zzso variation zzso of the zzso gene zzso makes individuals vulnerable to the impact of weight on the development of zzso
