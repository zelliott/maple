zzso disruption of the zzso gene zzso multiple zzso characteristic of human aging, including zzso pulmonary zzso and zzso Moreover, we previously observed that insufficient zzso expression in mice leads to zzso zzso In the present study, we used zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rats, which exhibit hypertension, zzso severe zzso and zzso and are thus considered an animal model of zzso disease, to test the effects of oral administration of zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso blood pressure, body weight, plasma zzso and zzso levels were all significantly higher in zzso zzso rats than in controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso relaxation of the zzso in response to zzso M zzso was significantly attenuated in zzso rats zzso zzso as was zzso expression of zzso zzso Administration of zzso for 10 weeks significantly reduced zzso blood pressure, plasma zzso and zzso levels in zzso rats, while zzso zzso zzso relaxation and zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso protects the vascular zzso against damage caused by the presence of multiple zzso zzso
