zzso is associated with reduced heart rate zzso zzso reflecting zzso changes in cardiac regulation by the zzso nervous system zzso Weight loss reverses this change and zzso dysfunction is thought to have a role in zzso cardiac zzso Few studies have examined the influence of zzso zzso surgery on cardiac zzso zzso This study therefore sought to assess zzso changes in zzso of cardiac zzso control following two types of zzso zzso zzso gastric zzso zzso and zzso diversion zzso 

Eleven zzso obese subjects aged zzso zzso zzso years zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso five received zzso and six received zzso zzso zzso was recorded and zzso was zzso together with a zzso zzso index zzso a complexity index zzso and a zzso zzso index zzso zzso measures zzso compared the zzso for the two groups as a function of time zzso 6 and 12 months zzso 

zzso was reduced by up to zzso zzso zzso despite patients remaining obese at one-year zzso Several zzso showed prompt and persistent improvement with progressive weight loss, zzso being the most sensitive zzso of recovery time zzso zzso zzso zzso responsiveness was functionally normal zzso The zzso procedures induced similar changes in cardiac zzso control, despite their differing mechanisms of zzso 

This pilot study suggests that the mechanism responsible for improving cardiac regulation following zzso surgery might be the weight loss zzso Furthermore, zzso improvement in zzso implies that weight loss reduces the risk of zzso zzso zzso
