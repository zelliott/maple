We previously suggested that, in obese animals and humans, white zzso tissue inflammation results from the death of zzso zzso these are then cleared by zzso giving rise to distinctive structures we denominated zzso zzso Here we present evidence that subcutaneous and visceral zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso obese mice exhibit zzso abnormalities (including calcium zzso and cholesterol zzso many of which are more common in zzso zzso versus zzso zzso mice and in visceral versus subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso whose zzso content zzso in the zzso space were also noted in obese zzso in addition, increased zzso oxygen species zzso expression in obese fat zzso documented by zzso and zzso suggests that zzso changes are accompanied by zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso zzso in the fat pads of both zzso and high-fat diet obese mice, in which formation of active zzso was documented by zzso in the zzso of several zzso zzso zzso zzso was not detected in zzso transgenic mice, where zzso die of zzso Thus, white zzso zzso zzso a stress state that ultimately leads to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso likely zzso obese zzso death by zzso a zzso programmed cell zzso
