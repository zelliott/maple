To evaluate the zzso axis of obese men, we compared the 24-hour mean plasma zzso of total and free testosterone and of zzso zzso and zzso in 21 healthy obese men, aged zzso and 24 zzso healthy zzso zzso In the obese men, we also measured the volume of zzso and the number and zzso of zzso and investigated libido by psychiatric interview, and potency by history and by measurement of nocturnal penile zzso As a group, the obese men had less than two-thirds the normal mean plasma levels of total testosterone, free testosterone, and zzso the difference from normal was highly significant for all zzso 24 zzso zzso levels were normal, which is inappropriately low in view of the zzso testosterone zzso 24 zzso mean levels of zzso and zzso zzso and potency were essentially zzso Taken together, the findings represent a state of mild zzso zzso which thus appears to be characteristic of obese zzso This zzso probably results from partial suppression of the zzso by the elevated plasma zzso levels we and others find in these zzso
