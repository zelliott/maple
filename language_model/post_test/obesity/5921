The zzso and contents of zzso substance P zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso releasing zzso zzso were measured in zzso extracts of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso mice, zzso zzso zzso mice, and their respective lean zzso The zzso concentration of zzso and pancreatic zzso of zzso and zzso were zzso lower in lean zzso mice than lean zzso mice, indicating the influence of genetic background in control zzso zzso zzso of SP and zzso were reduced by zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso compared with their lean controls, but the zzso contents of these peptides were normal or greater than normal due to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso concentration was not altered, but the content was increased by zzso and zzso respectively in zzso and zzso mice, whereas the zzso zzso concentration was reduced by 51% in zzso zzso zzso zzso and contents of zzso zzso and zzso were similar in lean and zzso zzso zzso However, pancreatic zzso and contents of zzso and zzso were reduced by zzso in zzso mice compared with their lean zzso The sensitivity of the present zzso did not permit accurate determination of the low pancreatic zzso of zzso The results suggest that the spontaneous zzso and zzso syndromes of obesity and diabetes in mice are associated with reduced zzso zzso of SP and zzso The zzso mouse also exhibited reductions of zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso and zzso zzso These changes in regulatory peptides may relate to abnormalities of zzso and possibly pancreatic function in obese and diabetic zzso zzso
