Although low circulating zzso D zzso zzso have been associated with insulin resistance and zzso the relations between these 3 variables have not been completely zzso 

The objective was to compare circulating zzso zzso in apparently healthy individuals who were matched for degree of obesity or insulin zzso 

This was a zzso study in which 78 apparently healthy individuals were classified as being normal weight zzso or obese zzso on the basis of their zzso and as being insulin sensitive zzso or insulin resistant zzso on the basis of their steady state plasma zzso zzso concentration during the insulin suppression zzso 

Groups did not differ in terms of age, sex distribution, race, or mean zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso for zzso were 32 zzso 10, 30 zzso 10, and 28 zzso 8 zzso in zzso zzso and zzso groups, zzso These zzso were essentially identical when comparing zzso with IS subjects matched for zzso or when comparing zzso with zzso subjects matched for zzso zzso of zzso zzso 30 zzso were somewhat more common in zzso subjects than in zzso subjects zzso compared with zzso but zzso zzso were not different within either the zzso or IS groups when zzso with zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso 30 zzso were zzso 

In 78 individuals, zzso of whom were vitamin D deficient or insufficient zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso did not vary with differences in insulin sensitivity zzso zzso when matched for zzso zzso compared with zzso Similarly, when matched for zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso were not different in zzso or zzso individuals zzso compared with zzso
