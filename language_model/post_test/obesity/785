In order to study the effect of zzso zzso acid on zzso gamma gene zzso serum zzso blood zzso and blood zzso zzso 

Five groups of male zzso rats were randomly selected and fed with different diets zzso diet, high-fat diet, high-fat with zzso zzso high-fat with zzso zzso and high-fat with zzso zzso for 12 zzso At the end of experiment, the rats were sacrificed, the ratio of lipids to body weight were zzso and the blood zzso serum zzso serum zzso were zzso zzso was used for measuring the expression of zzso gamma zzso in white zzso tissue of zzso 

It was shown that the supplement of zzso could decrease decreased blood zzso serum zzso cholesterol and zzso levels, and increased the expression of zzso gamma in white zzso tissue of obese zzso 

zzso could decrease blood zzso serum zzso and decrease the levels of zzso possibly via zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso resulting in the improvement of zzso resistance of obese zzso
