We hypothesized that zzso zzso treatment would reduce zzso zzso in overweight and obese middle-aged and older zzso Twenty-six (11 men and 15 zzso overweight or obese zzso mass zzso zzso zzso middle-aged and older adults zzso zzso zzso were randomly assigned to receive either zzso zzso zzso or zzso for 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso and pulse wave zzso was measured before and after the zzso At zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso groups did not differ with respect to age, body mass index, blood pressure, serum zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or compliance (all zzso After the zzso treatment period, the zzso group experienced a zzso reduction in zzso zzso cholesterol zzso to zzso zzso and a zzso reduction in zzso zzso protein zzso to zzso zzso both zzso In addition, zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso pulse wave zzso zzso to zzso zzso but not zzso pulse wave zzso decreased (both zzso with zzso In contrast, there were no significant changes in zzso zzso to zzso zzso or zzso pulse wave zzso zzso to zzso zzso both zzso in the zzso zzso There were no relations between the reductions in zzso zzso zzso and any of the baseline zzso risk factors (all zzso However, the reductions in zzso zzso were correlated with the reduction in zzso zzso cholesterol but not zzso zzso protein or any other zzso variables (all zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso reduces zzso zzso in overweight and obese middle-aged and older adults, and these favorable changes occur irrespective of baseline zzso risk zzso
