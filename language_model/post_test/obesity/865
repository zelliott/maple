zzso necrosis factor alpha zzso is expressed primarily in zzso and elevated levels of this zzso have been linked to obesity and insulin zzso Several studies have shown statistical evidence of linkage between obesity and the zzso region encompassing the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso alpha and/or a nearby gene is involved in the zzso of zzso Recently we analyzed the zzso zzso zzso and that of zzso gene in zzso patients with obesity and no significant difference in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was found between obese patients and zzso In contrast, zzso in zzso gene was found to be highly associated with zzso Both zzso and zzso genes have been mapped within the major zzso complex zzso We designated a zzso study to investigate a potential association of genetic variation of the zzso and that of the heat shock protein zzso zzso with type 2 zzso 

We used the zzso chain reaction and restriction zzso to characterize the variation of the zzso promoter region and that of the zzso gene in 280 unrelated zzso patients with zzso diabetes and zzso healthy control zzso 

Analysis of the zzso zzso zzso in patients with type 2 diabetes and in control subjects revealed that the zzso zzso zzso was significantly less frequent in the patient group zzso suggesting that zzso may be considered as a protective marker against type 2 diabetes zzso In contrast, a significant relative risk of type 2 diabetes was found associated with the zzso zzso zzso in non obese diabetic subjects zzso zzso 

These results along with those showing high frequency of zzso zzso in obese zzso suggest that zzso zzso has zzso implications in both obesity and zzso
