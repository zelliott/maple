We measured gene expression of zzso regulators involved in zzso differentiation within the zzso fraction of abdominal subcutaneous zzso tissue from obese individuals with zzso and without zzso type 2 diabetes zzso zzso Despite similar zzso by design, subjects with zzso had larger zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso Gene expression of the zzso marker zzso was lower zzso zzso zzso arbitrary units, zzso whereas the expression of zzso zzso zzso was higher zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The gene expression levels between the zzso and zzso were zzso correlated zzso zzso We conclude that early steps of zzso may be impaired in zzso independently of obesity due, in part, to an zzso of the zzso zzso
