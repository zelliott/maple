To evaluate the effect of body fat composition and distribution on plasma zzso profile and zzso stress in middle-aged zzso 

181 healthy Chinese women (age ranged from 35 to 50 zzso were zzso Their body fat mass and distribution were measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso status were evaluated by determination of serum levels of tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the plasma zzso including total cholesterol zzso and zzso zzso were also zzso 

zzso Plasma zzso and zzso levels and serum zzso levels were significantly higher in overweight and obese women, while serum zzso and zzso activity were significantly in these 2 groups, compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity zzso and zzso level increased with body mass index zzso and abdominal fat mass, as shown by linear correlation zzso No correlation was found between serum zzso zzso lipids and total body and subcutaneous zzso zzso The percentage of abdominal fat mass had positive correlations with the zzso and zzso and negative correlations with zzso Whereas the percentage of subcutaneous fat mass did not have correction relationship with zzso zzso zzso but had negative correlation with zzso and zzso zzso By the partial correlations analysis, abdominal fat mass were found to be zzso correlated with serum zzso and zzso and positively correlated with serum zzso 

zzso fat zzso could be the marker of the zzso stress and would elevate serum zzso and total zzso
