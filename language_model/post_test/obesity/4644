zzso is defined as a spontaneous local zzso in vascular tone whose function is unclear but may have a beneficial effect on tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso and laser zzso zzso provide unique insights into the possible mechanisms of zzso in the zzso zzso through the simultaneous measurement of changes in concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso and mean blood zzso zzso along with blood volume and zzso The effect of zzso at zzso zzso zzso attributed to zzso activity was studied in the zzso zzso skin of 24 healthy zzso zzso analysis identified periodic fluctuations in zzso in 19 out of 24 subjects, predominantly where skin temperatures zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso A consistent minimum threshold in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was seen to zzso a sudden transient surge in zzso inducing a fast rise in zzso The integral increase in flux correlated with the integral increase in zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso P zzso and with little change in blood volume suggests zzso upstream, responding to a low zzso zzso This transient surge in flux was followed by a sustained period where blood volume and flux remained relatively constant and a steady decrease in zzso and equal and opposite increase in zzso was considered to provide a measure of oxygen zzso A measure of this oxygen extraction has been zzso by the mean zzso of the zzso in zzso during this zzso A comparison of the mean zzso in the 8 normal subjects zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso of zzso s and the 11 obese subjects zzso zzso of zzso s was statistically significant zzso Whitney, P zzso The zzso zzso spontaneously in this saw tooth manner by an average of zzso zzso zzso from mean zzso values ranging from 30 to zzso These observations support the hypothesis that red blood cells may act as sensors of local tissue zzso through the zzso status of the zzso and initiate improved local zzso to the tissue through hypoxic zzso
