zzso is an independent risk factor for zzso events among patients with established coronary heart disease zzso The goal of the present study was to identify potential mechanisms underlying this zzso We measured the zzso ratio and body mass index in zzso zzso with stable zzso and followed them for a mean of zzso zzso We used zzso hazards models to evaluate the extent to which the association of obesity with subsequent heart failure zzso hospitalization or cardiovascular zzso events zzso zzso stroke, or zzso zzso was explained by baseline zzso cardiac disease severity, zzso insulin resistance, zzso and zzso Of the zzso participants, 128 zzso were hospitalized for zzso and 152 zzso developed a zzso zzso Each standard zzso zzso increase in the zzso ratio was associated with a zzso increased risk of zzso hospitalization zzso hazard ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso This association was not attenuated after adjustment for potential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso Likewise, each zzso increase in the zzso ratio was associated with a zzso greater risk of zzso events zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and this remained unchanged after adjustment for potential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso The body mass index was not associated with the risk of zzso or zzso zzso In conclusion, abdominal obesity is an independent predictor of zzso hospitalization and zzso zzso events in patients with stable zzso This association does not appear to be zzso by zzso conditions, cardiac disease severity, insulin resistance, zzso zzso or zzso
