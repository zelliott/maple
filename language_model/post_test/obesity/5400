The zzso system coordinates the maintenance of energy balance via the regulation of both food intake and energy zzso zzso a key zzso hormone involved in the regulation of energy balance is thought to act by stimulating production, in the zzso zzso nucleus, of zzso stimulating hormone zzso a potent zzso of zzso zzso receptors located in the zzso nucleus of the zzso zzso zzso zzso release of zzso protein zzso an zzso zzso During periods of caloric zzso weight loss is not sustained because zzso mechanisms, such as reduced resting zzso rate zzso are brought into zzso zzso how these zzso systems operate may provide valuable targets for pharmaceutical therapies to support traditional dieting zzso As circulating zzso is reduced during caloric zzso it may mediate some of the observed zzso zzso In addition to decreases in circulating zzso levels, circulating zzso is increased during zzso in zzso while zzso is zzso As central administration of zzso zzso zzso we zzso that the peripheral rise in zzso might be involved in zzso the depression of zzso during food zzso We zzso that changes in plasma zzso and zzso may coordinate the regulation of changes in energy expenditure acting through central zzso zzso receptors via the sympathetic nervous zzso show here that acute peripherally administered zzso at zzso zzso in both lean zzso and obese zzso zzso mice does not zzso zzso possibly because it crosses the zzso barrier very slowly compared with other zzso However, in zzso zzso can decrease zzso zzso by approximately zzso from zzso into culture medium and may via this axis have an effect on energy metabolism during prolonged caloric zzso In contrast, peripheral zzso zzso produced a large and sustained increase in resting energy expenditure zzso zzso zzso P zzso with a similar response in zzso zzso mice zzso zzso zzso indicating that this effect is independent of the status of zzso production in the zzso In both cases respiratory exchange ratio and the levels of energy zzso on spontaneous physical activity were unaffected by the administration of peripheral zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso that cross the zzso barrier may significantly augment dietary restriction strategies by sustaining elevated zzso
