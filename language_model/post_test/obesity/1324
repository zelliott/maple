To describe the methods used to implement intensive and conventional therapies in the Diabetes Control and zzso Trial zzso and the zzso results that occurred with the different treatment zzso 

The zzso was a controlled clinical trial that demonstrated the beneficial effect of intensive therapy on the long-term complications of zzso diabetes zzso zzso A total of 1,441 volunteers with zzso aged zzso from 29 centers in the zzso and Canada, were randomly assigned to conventional or intensive diabetes zzso zzso therapy, which used multiple daily injections zzso of insulin zzso or zzso 3 zzso or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion zzso was implemented by a team that included diabetes zzso zzso behavioral experts, and zzso Volunteers in the intensive treatment group could use zzso or zzso based on patient and clinic zzso and could switch between therapies over the course of the zzso The volunteers were followed for a mean of zzso years zzso zzso zzso 

A detailed analysis of zzso of the two treatments indicates that intensive and conventional treatment subjects zzso to their respective insulin injection zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to other elements of intensive treatment was similarly high and resulted in median zzso values between zzso and zzso compared with zzso with conventional therapy, over the course of the zzso Severe zzso occurred three times more often in zzso treated zzso Although subjects on intensive treatment were not randomly assigned to zzso or zzso we compared those subjects who used either of these methods zzso or zzso zzso of the study zzso zzso patients maintained a mean zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso subjects during the trial zzso zzso The frequency of zzso with coma and seizure and diabetic zzso was modestly higher with zzso than with zzso 

zzso therapy was implemented successfully in the zzso The detailed description zzso will serve to facilitate translation of the zzso results to the clinical zzso
