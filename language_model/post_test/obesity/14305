Exercise improves zzso tolerance in obese zzso models and zzso however, effects with respect to mechanisms of zzso compensation remain zzso We examined zzso effects during the progression of zzso in male zzso diabetic fatty zzso rats until 19 zzso of zzso At 6 zzso old, rats were assigned to 1) zzso for baseline values; 2) zzso individually for 1 zzso 5 zzso and 3) controls zzso zzso zzso Exercise (13 zzso resulted in maintenance of zzso zzso and prevented increases in fed and zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso and sedentary controls zzso zzso zzso function calculations indicate prolonged zzso adaptation in exercised animals zzso During an zzso zzso tolerance test zzso exercised rats had lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses from baseline for zzso zzso and insulin indicate improved zzso tolerance with exercise was associated with increased insulin production and/or zzso zzso mass increased in exercised zzso zzso zzso however, mass expansion was absent at 19 zzso in controls zzso zzso zzso and replication contributed to expansion of zzso zzso exercised animals had increased zzso size and zzso incorporation rates zzso controls zzso zzso The relative area of zzso and protein zzso B was significantly elevated in exercised zzso sedentary controls zzso zzso zzso we show formation of zzso protein zzso a response to zzso stress, occurred in zzso 19 zzso zzso rats but not in lean, 6 zzso zzso or exercised zzso In conclusion, improved zzso compensation through increased zzso function and mass occurs in exercised but not sedentary zzso rats and may be in part responsible for improved zzso
