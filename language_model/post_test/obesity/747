To assess the effect of the zzso B zzso signal zzso zzso on plasma zzso levels in overweight subjects before and after a low-calorie zzso 

Diet intervention study zzso reduction in energy intake during zzso zzso in relation to genetic zzso 

A total of 231 unrelated patients zzso zzso zzso recruited on the basis of body mass index zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso waist to hip ratio, blood lipids and zzso at entry and after zzso months, determination of zzso B zzso zzso 

On spontaneous diet, subjects carrying the Del zzso had higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When submitted to low-calorie diet, subjects with zzso zzso reduced their zzso zzso more than subjects with zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

In overweight or obese people, the response of plasma zzso levels to low-calorie diet is modulated by genetic variation at the zzso B zzso zzso subjects with the Del zzso of the zzso B signal zzso zzso are predisposed to high LDL cholesterol levels but their LDL cholesterol responds well to zzso These results demonstrate the importance of the interaction between genes and nutritional environment in the determination of the zzso zzso
