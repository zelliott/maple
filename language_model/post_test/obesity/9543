To differentiate peripheral and zzso insulin resistance in zzso overweight Type 2 zzso diabetic patients zzso zzso zzso 143 zzso zzso ideal body zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exchange of zzso zzso zzso zzso fatty zzso zzso and zzso as well as the insulin production rate, were determined before and during oral zzso loads of 25 g or 100 zzso zzso production rate, zzso insulin retention and zzso exchange of zzso and zzso were estimated by means of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso state insulin production rate was greater in overweight Type 2 diabetic patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than in healthy control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso After zzso of 25 g zzso the cumulative insulin production rate exceeded normal values zzso less than zzso but was below normal with 100 g zzso zzso less than zzso Relative insulin zzso by the zzso bed in the diabetic patients was 54 zzso zzso not different from zzso Following a 100 g zzso load, zzso insulin retention fell by zzso in the patients, and less consistently so in healthy zzso zzso zzso output was normal in the diabetic patients both in the zzso state and after zzso zzso although the induced zzso blood zzso levels were greater in the diabetic patients than in control subjects zzso less than zzso zzso output of zzso zzso less than zzso zzso zzso less than zzso and zzso zzso less than zzso were greater in the zzso state in the diabetic patients than in healthy zzso However, no difference in zzso exchange was seen between the two groups in their zzso respective response to zzso zzso These data suggest that obese zzso Type 2 diabetic patients may represent a zzso of diabetic patients with predominantly zzso but compensated zzso insulin resistance being associated with an increased zzso insulin production rate which only zzso after zzso of a large zzso zzso
