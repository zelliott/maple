zzso association studies have shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene locus is strongly associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, data are rather limited to the adult population and zzso zzso So far, little is known whether similar associations are present in overweight and obese children and zzso 

The aim is to investigate an zzso zzso in a sample of 310 overweight and obese children and adolescents zzso body mass index standard zzso score zzso zzso zzso zzso mean age: 14 zzso 2) zzso who participated in a short-term weight-loss program based on energy reduction, physical activity, and behavior zzso 

We investigated an association between zzso and zzso zzso zzso insulin, zzso model assessment of insulin resistance zzso and of zzso function zzso and zzso parameters and their change during zzso 

The minor G zzso of zzso zzso was significantly associated with increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso P zzso zzso the sample into zzso groups, these significant associations were abolished in children with zzso below zzso but remained in those with higher zzso values with stronger zzso The P value for the zzso zzso zzso category interaction was zzso for zzso zzso and zzso for zzso There was no significant association between zzso and zzso parameters and their change during zzso 

This is the first single study, replicating the association between the zzso locus and zzso traits in overweight and obese children and zzso The effect sizes in children and adolescents seem to be stronger than in adults and differed among zzso zzso
