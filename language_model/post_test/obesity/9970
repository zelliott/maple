zzso subjects are at an increased risk of becoming zzso and vice zzso Essential hypertension and obesity are commonly accompanied by insulin resistance zzso as impaired zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the offspring of patients with essential hypertension, insulin resistance and zzso as well as related increases in serum low density zzso and zzso often occur prior to the development of essential hypertension, overweight or central zzso of body zzso Moreover, once zzso and in particular central zzso is present, insulin resistance is more marked in zzso than in zzso obese zzso zzso and/or insulin resistance in turn promote body fat deposition and impaired zzso zzso This cycle helps to explain why a familial predisposition to essential hypertension poses an increased risk of developing not only hypertension but also zzso obesity and zzso zzso 2) zzso It is still unclear whether insulin resistance and/or zzso also promote hypertension per zzso Regardless of zzso exact zzso role, obesity and/or a high dietary intake of zzso salt, zzso can induce several potential zzso zzso 1) higher plasma zzso zzso and adrenaline zzso levels, suggesting a higher sympathetic tone in obese than in zzso subjects, and in zzso obese than in zzso obese zzso 2) similarly, a tendency to zzso with largely normal plasma zzso activity, in obese zzso zzso 3) enhanced sensitivity of blood pressure to zzso 4) increased total blood volume (although it is normal relative to body surface zzso leading to increased cardiac output and eventually eccentric left zzso zzso and 5) increased zzso free zzso levels and reduced zzso zzso levels in the blood cells of obese zzso patients and patients with zzso diabetes, although this finding cannot necessarily be zzso to zzso levels in vascular muscle zzso Total peripheral vascular resistance is usually low in zzso obese subjects and rises with the development of zzso compared with lean patients with essential hypertension, obese zzso patients tend to have a slightly lower level of total peripheral zzso and a slightly higher cardiac zzso Considering the intimate association between essential hypertension and zzso as well as the prevalence and zzso relevance of this zzso the spectrum of accompanying zzso and cardiovascular abnormalities deserves careful consideration in the evaluation of therapeutic care for such zzso
