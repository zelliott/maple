The aim of the study is to determine the effects of short-term high-intensity exercise on zzso function and zzso tolerance in obese individuals with and without the zzso syndrome zzso zzso men and women zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso with and without zzso zzso zzso zzso 13; zzso zzso zzso zzso participated in exercise training consisting of ten consecutive days of treadmill walking for 1 zzso at zzso of peak zzso zzso Changes in zzso capacity, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using central and peripheral pulse wave zzso zzso zzso were assessed zzso and zzso These zzso were obtained zzso and zzso zzso meal while the subjects were zzso zzso capacity improved for both groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso There was no change in body zzso zzso decreased by zzso zzso zzso for both groups during acute zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10), while zzso increased central zzso and not peripheral zzso Exercise training did not change zzso in the zzso or challenged zzso Central and peripheral zzso were not altered with training for either group zzso zzso zzso 13; zzso zzso zzso zzso A 10-day high-intensity exercise program in obese individuals improved zzso capacity and zzso tolerance but no change in zzso function was zzso Acute zzso had a deleterious effect on zzso function, suggesting that persons with impaired zzso zzso may experience more opportunities for attenuated zzso function on a daily basis which could contribute to increased cardiovascular zzso
