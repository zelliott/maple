Central zzso zzso systems have long been studied for their effects on feeding behavior, energy balance, and maintenance of body zzso Those zzso systems that use zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as zzso have been the main targets of zzso A number of zzso medications that affect zzso activity have appeared on the market and/or in clinical zzso Early examples of such agents are the so-called zzso stimulants, zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso These agents release zzso from zzso stores, and their zzso activity seems to be tied most closely to their ability to release zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso or zzso have been shown to reduce feeding and weight gain both zzso and zzso However, the magnitude and zzso of such effects in clinical trials has generally not been great enough to register or label these agents for the treatment of zzso zzso however, is an zzso This compound is zzso in zzso to produce zzso that have varying degrees of zzso of NE, zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso is the only drug affecting zzso systems currently approved for the long-term control of zzso Research continues on zzso and zzso systems to determine if targets such as the zzso and zzso receptors may be suitable for developing zzso zzso Because the clinical zzso effects of zzso drugs have been modest, future directions include looking at combinations of different zzso mechanisms and/or combinations of zzso drugs with zzso zzso
