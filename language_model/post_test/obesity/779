The insulin zzso zzso zzso gene is among the most frequently studied candidate genes for Type 2 diabetes, but findings have been zzso This may have been due to generally small study sizes, or to interaction with body zzso as suggested by studies of insulin zzso The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the zzso zzso zzso increases risk of Type 2 zzso 

We conducted two large zzso studies including a total of 725 cases and zzso control subjects, who were Caucasian Dutch men and women aged zzso zzso We calculated odds ratios adjusted for body mass index, study zzso sex and zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso did not have a higher prevalence of newly detected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or treated zzso zzso zzso Type 2 diabetes in the first study, or a higher prevalence of zzso intolerance zzso zzso zzso in the second zzso The summary odds ratio was zzso zzso for carrying the zzso zzso as compared with the zzso zzso zzso did not differ appreciably by degree of zzso Also, the zzso zzso was not associated with zzso values for body mass index, waist zzso plasma zzso total cholesterol or zzso 

Our findings indicate that the zzso zzso zzso does not substantially increase risk of common Type 2 diabetes, or Type 2 diabetes in obese zzso
