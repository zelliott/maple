zzso of traditional cardiac risk factors is an important goal for patients after an acute zzso zzso zzso zzso factor prevalence and secondary prevention efforts at discharge are well characterized among older zzso however, research is limited for younger and minority zzso zzso particularly among zzso 

Among zzso zzso patients enrolled in a zzso prospective study, we compared the prevalence and cumulative number of five cardiac risk factors zzso zzso current smoking, diabetes, zzso by age, sex, and zzso We also compared secondary prevention strategies at discharge for these risk factors, including prescription of zzso or zzso medications and counseling on preventive behaviors zzso zzso diabetes management, zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of patients had zzso risk factor, zzso had zzso factors, and zzso had zzso zzso The prevalence of multiple risk factors was markedly higher for blacks than for whites within each zzso zzso black women had the greatest risk factor burden of any zzso zzso of older black women and zzso of younger black women had zzso risk zzso Secondary prevention efforts for smoking zzso were less common for black compared with white patients, and younger black patients were less often prescribed zzso and zzso medications compared with younger white zzso 

Multiple cardiac risk factors are highly prevalent in zzso patients, particularly among black zzso Secondary prevention efforts, however, are less common for blacks compared to zzso especially among younger zzso Our findings highlight the need for improved risk factor modification efforts in these high-risk zzso
