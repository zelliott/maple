zzso liver is commonly associated with zzso conditions, often related to increased abdominal visceral zzso Our objective was to zzso the specific roles of zzso type 2 diabetes zzso zzso and abdominal fat zzso 

The study population comprised 13 diabetic obese zzso 10 zzso obese zzso and nine zzso control zzso men aged zzso with normal plasma zzso zzso DO were in good zzso control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with diet zzso zzso 8) or diet + zzso zzso zzso zzso Liver fat content was measured by zzso zzso resonance zzso abdominal fat distribution by magnetic resonance imaging and insulin sensitivity by zzso zzso zzso 

DO and zzso subjects had similar zzso insulin resistance, zzso and waist zzso higher than those of C subjects zzso zzso DO had more liver fat zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and C zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso fat was greater in DO and zzso than in C zzso DO zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso 587 zzso P zzso zzso DO zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso visceral fat being not significantly different between the two obese groups, and subcutaneous fat significantly less in DO than in zzso zzso zzso 

Type 2 diabetes is associated with increased fat zzso in the liver, independent of obesity and zzso insulin zzso The increased liver fat in DO patients may be part of an altered regional fat distribution that includes an inadequate subcutaneous fat storing capacity, rather than simply being a consequence of increased abdominal visceral zzso
