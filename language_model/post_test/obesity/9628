zzso signaling through zzso of the zzso zzso contributes to the zzso of zzso zzso action in obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice zzso zzso were previously generated to study zzso contributions to zzso of zzso zzso young female zzso mice display a lean, zzso zzso while young male zzso are not significantly different from zzso We report here that testosterone (but not zzso determines the zzso of the zzso zzso This provides additional insight into the cellular mechanism by which zzso hormones determine central sensitivity to zzso and may help zzso the zzso sex differences in zzso zzso Additionally, we observed that zzso signaling protects against a zzso switch that zzso obesity with high fat zzso such that the enhanced zzso sensitivity of zzso mice on a normal diet leads to increased zzso in the face of chronic high-fat zzso
