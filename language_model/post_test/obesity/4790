zzso diseases zzso in diabetic patients have zzso dysfunction as a key zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso inhibitor of zzso oxide zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in zzso zzso Different natural zzso have been shown to preserve zzso function and prevent zzso In this study, we assessed the effect of zzso a widely used zzso from milk zzso on zzso levels and zzso dysfunction in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso mice were zzso a 20 zzso zzso daily dose of zzso zzso zzso 6) or vehicle zzso zzso 6) for four zzso zzso lean zzso mice served as zzso zzso zzso and liver zzso levels were determined by zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso and zzso was assessed in isolated zzso zzso in wire zzso 

Plasma and zzso zzso levels were higher in zzso than in control lean zzso zzso administration markedly decreased plasma zzso consistently, zzso zzso was reduced in zzso zzso Plasma and zzso zzso levels exhibited a positive zzso whereas liver zzso was zzso correlated with both plasma and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso was impaired in zzso mice and was restored in the zzso group, in accordance with the observed reduction of plasma and vascular levels of zzso zzso zzso to zzso was not modified by zzso zzso zzso tone induced in isolated zzso from zzso mice by challenging with zzso zzso was not affected by the zzso 

zzso markedly improves zzso dysfunction in zzso mice by reducing circulating and vascular zzso zzso Clinical studies are warranted to assess the efficacy of zzso for cardiovascular zzso
