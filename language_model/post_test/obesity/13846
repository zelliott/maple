Nine novel sugar zzso proteins have been discovered in the past 5 zzso The zzso for three of these, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been detected in human skeletal zzso In the present study, we examined the pattern of expression and zzso of the zzso zzso 8, 11 and 12 in human skeletal muscle using an zzso zzso zzso of human skeletal muscle from sedentary or trained healthy adults, from fetal muscle (24 weeks of zzso from obese zzso diabetic subjects, and from patients suffering from zzso or zzso lateral sclerosis zzso were zzso zzso and 12 zzso was below detection level in both developing and adult muscle zzso zzso zzso however, was present in zzso muscle zzso but not in fast zzso zzso zzso in contrast, zzso was expressed in all investigated muscle zzso the pattern of expression of zzso differs from that of zzso suggesting a specialized function for zzso with a regulation independent from that of zzso zzso zzso diabetes, training, conditions of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso failed to induce zzso or zzso zzso Likewise, the zzso zzso pattern of zzso zzso was zzso However, some slow muscle zzso lose their zzso zzso under zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso in contrast to that of zzso is expressed exclusively in zzso muscle zzso and is unaffected by zzso and zzso conditions except in primary zzso zzso and zzso do not appear to be of importance in human muscle under zzso and zzso zzso
