We investigated the feedback zzso of insulin and zzso zzso during zzso clamp at about 350 zzso in 16 patients with abdominal obesity zzso with normal zzso tolerance zzso 8 with impaired zzso tolerance zzso and 8 zzso subjects matched for age, sex and blood zzso In zzso and zzso zzso plasma zzso levels were twice those in the controls zzso zzso 51 and zzso zzso 85 vs zzso zzso 28 zzso P zzso and their suppression was lower than in the controls, both in absolute terms zzso zzso 19 and 185 zzso 17 vs zzso zzso 18 zzso P zzso and as a percentage decline from zzso levels (16 zzso zzso and 21 zzso zzso vs 63 zzso zzso P zzso zzso plasma zzso levels were similar in the patients and in the controls, but were less suppressed during clamp in zzso and zzso both in absolute terms zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and as a percentage change from zzso levels zzso zzso zzso and 19 zzso zzso vs 44 zzso zzso P zzso These results suggest that the insulin feedback on B and A cells is impaired in abdominal zzso and that this zzso is of similar degree in zzso and zzso These zzso could be implicated in the zzso of zzso in zzso
