The zzso syndrome is strongly associated with insulin resistance and consists of a constellation of factors such as hypertension and zzso that raise the risk for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes zzso There is a growing body of evidence to show that zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso reduce zzso morbidity and mortality in patients with or without coronary artery zzso Recent clinical observations argue for a simple strategy of considering routine zzso therapy for patients with type 2 zzso Furthermore, zzso therapy is also found to be effective in allowing zzso goal achievement in zzso high-risk patients with the zzso zzso However, the effects of statins on the zzso of the zzso syndrome remain to be zzso Several types of statins are commercially available zzso Among them, zzso is unique because it is the only zzso that has been shown to have protective role against the development of diabetes in a large clinical zzso Moreover, a recent clinical study revealed that zzso treatment improved insulin sensitivity in 25 women with the zzso syndrome with impaired zzso zzso These observations let us to speculate that zzso is a promising strategy for the treatment of zzso patients with the zzso zzso It may improve the insulin sensitivity in these patients and subsequently prevent the development of type 2 zzso In this paper, we would like to propose the possible ways of testing our hypothesis as zzso zzso Does zzso treatment improve insulin resistance in patients of the zzso syndrome or in insulin resistant zzso or obese zzso If the answers are yes, are these beneficial effects of zzso superior to those of other zzso statins with zzso properties? zzso Does zzso treatment actually reduce the development of diabetes in these insulin resistant zzso At that time, does zzso treatment increase serum levels of zzso a key zzso with zzso zzso How about the effects of zzso treatment on zzso that could elicit insulin resistance such as tumor necrosis zzso These clinical studies will provide further information whether zzso treatment can improve insulin resistance and subsequently reduce the development of diabetes in insulin resistant patients with the zzso zzso
