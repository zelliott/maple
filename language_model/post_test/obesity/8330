zzso factor family member 2 zzso is a small gut zzso mainly known for its protective and healing zzso As previously demonstrated, high-fat zzso feeding can rapidly and specifically zzso zzso zzso in key zzso of mice, including the zzso and zzso zzso zzso therefore suggesting a novel role for this gene in energy zzso 

To explore whether and how zzso can influence feeding behavior and energy zzso zzso zzso zzso mice were challenged with zzso diet for 12 weeks, hence food and energy zzso body zzso as well as energy zzso and serum zzso and hormonal levels were zzso Finally, energy efficiency was zzso 

zzso zzso mice showed a greater appetite and higher energy intake compared to zzso zzso zzso they presented lower levels of serum zzso and increased zzso of zzso protein zzso in the zzso Though energy and zzso zzso zzso were zzso in zzso zzso mice, zzso energy intake was zzso However, zzso mice were finally protected from zzso zzso zzso and accumulated less weight and fat zzso than zzso animals, while keeping a normal lean zzso Energy efficiency was lower in zzso mice, while energy expenditure and locomotor activity were globally zzso 

The present work demonstrates previously zzso roles for zzso and suggests it to be a mastermind in the control of energy balance and a promising therapeutic target for zzso
