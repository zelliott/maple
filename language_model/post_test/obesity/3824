zzso of zzso fusion surgery have been mixed and procedures are zzso zzso cage zzso fusion zzso has been advanced to improve zzso and clinical zzso however, little attention has been given to zzso costs or potential zzso of these zzso 

To depict medical and compensation costs associated with zzso in a Utah cohort of patients receiving workers' compensation as well as to investigate zzso of zzso

zzso consecutive patients who were compensated by the Workers' zzso Fund of Utah and underwent zzso 

Total accrued compensation and medical zzso

zzso costs were associated with zzso particularly for those who were obese, involved in litigation, or failed to achieve solid zzso With regard to compensation costs, the findings support the importance of assessing zzso factors in spinal fusion zzso
