A decreased zzso of zzso may contribute to fat zzso in zzso leading to zzso However, this hypothesis remains to be zzso In this study, zzso zzso zzso was investigated in zzso in nine markedly obese children zzso ideal body zzso aged zzso zzso during the dynamic phase of fat deposition, compared with six zzso zzso zzso As an in zzso index of zzso we measured zzso flux using a zzso zzso dilution approach, and plasma free fatty acid zzso In the zzso state, the obese children had a zzso lower rate of zzso release per unit fat mass than the lean zzso To study the regulation of zzso zzso was infused zzso at fixed doses of zzso and then zzso 50 zzso in both zzso In lean children, zzso flux and plasma free fatty acid increased to an average of zzso of zzso values, respectively, in response to a mean plasma zzso of zzso zzso The corresponding increase was only zzso in the obese children, although their mean plasma zzso reached zzso zzso All obese and zzso children, except an zzso zzso were zzso for zzso at position 64 of their zzso The resistance of zzso to zzso showed no relationship with the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In zzso in zzso zzso which mostly reflects the zzso of zzso stores from subcutaneous zzso zzso shows a decreased sensitivity to zzso in childhood onset zzso Since our study was carried out in obese children during the dynamic phase of fat zzso the observed resistance to catecholamines might possibly be zzso rather than the result of zzso
