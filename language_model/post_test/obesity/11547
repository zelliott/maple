The main objective of the study was to determine whether risk factors associated with obesity are influenced by genetic variation of zzso E zzso 

81 obese children zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso control group were zzso Body zzso zzso profile, and zzso and insulin levels were evaluated according to international recommendations, and the blood pressure was measured by an zzso zzso 

The calculated zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso in obese children were similar to those of zzso zzso controls zzso zzso and zzso and fitted the range of variation generally observed in southern European zzso Age, zzso zzso body fat mass, and blood pressure were similar in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cholesterol and zzso zzso zzso cholesterol ratios were higher in the zzso group as compared with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso No differences concerning clusters of risk factors were observed among the three zzso No associations were found between zzso zzso and zzso levels zzso and at 2 zzso and between zzso insulin levels and zzso zzso Higher levels of zzso and zzso insulin and higher zzso values were significantly associated with a higher fat zzso 

zzso zzso seems to influence some zzso profile abnormalities associated with obesity in zzso However, zzso of risk factors and insulin resistance seem not to be dependent on zzso zzso
