To explore the hypothesis that sustained weight loss in severely obese patients may have benefits that are independent of their attained zzso 

We conducted a comparison of two zzso groups with zzso in the 30 to 35 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were selected obese patients 3 years after zzso adjustable gastric band surgery, and controls zzso zzso zzso were obese patients seeking weight loss zzso zzso were selected in a zzso manner from our database to best match the control zzso A range of clinical, zzso and questionnaire measures were obtained to assess zzso health status 

zzso maintained a mean weight loss of zzso zzso 18 zzso after zzso The weight loss subjects had significantly lower zzso plasma zzso insulin, and zzso zzso along with higher zzso zzso levels and better indirect measures of insulin sensitivity when compared with controls zzso zzso for zzso In addition, zzso levels, zzso counts, and zzso levels were also significantly lower in weight loss zzso All differences in laboratory variables remained significant after controlling for zzso The subjects also reported better zzso quality of life, fewer symptoms of depression, and greater satisfaction with their appearance than zzso 

These findings suggest that the zzso loss state conveys benefits that are greater than predicted by the attained zzso These findings may have important implications regarding the expectations of weight loss therapy, and mechanisms for this effect should be carefully zzso
