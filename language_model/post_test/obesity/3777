The primary aim of weight loss intervention in obesity is the loss of fat mass zzso zzso zzso of changes in zzso and fat free mass zzso during weight loss are of clinical zzso The authors compared the clinical utility of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso and a body mass index zzso based zzso in determining changes in percentage of fat mass zzso 

Using dual X-ray zzso zzso zzso of zzso as a standard, zzso zzso and zzso were compared in 41 moderately obese women zzso zzso before and after significant weight loss zzso zzso zzso zzso 

When measuring fat mass loss, zzso was precise and accurate with a bias of zzso zzso zzso zzso while the zzso zzso had a systematic bias of zzso zzso zzso % zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso using the zzso formula had a bias of zzso % and limits of agreement that approached the magnitude of the measurement zzso zzso zzso thus providing no zzso In contrast, zzso using the zzso formula had a systematic bias of zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and gave zzso limits of agreement zzso zzso zzso 

For measuring changes in zzso with weight loss, zzso has no clinical value using the zzso formula, and using the zzso formula zzso provided no additional information to that given by zzso We show that zzso instrument variables confound the estimates of zzso achieved by the zzso component of the zzso and zzso zzso
