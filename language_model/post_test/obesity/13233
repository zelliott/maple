Some actions of insulin are zzso by putative zzso zzso and a zzso in zzso zzso zzso may contribute to insulin resistance in women with zzso zzso syndrome zzso Furthermore, similar effects of zzso and zzso an zzso drug, have been demonstrated in zzso zzso To determine whether zzso improves insulin actions by increasing biologically active zzso in women with zzso we analyzed zzso during an oral zzso tolerance test in 19 obese women with zzso before and after zzso zzso of zzso or zzso After treatment, the mean zzso area under the curve zzso during the oral zzso tolerance test of insulin zzso decreased significantly more in the zzso group, compared with the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso P zzso zzso but the zzso of zzso zzso decreased similarly in both groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso However, the ratio of zzso increased by zzso after zzso and decreased by zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso Moreover, zzso seemed to improve the positive correlation between zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso at zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso after zzso and r zzso zzso P zzso zzso after zzso We conclude that in obese women with zzso zzso may improve the action of insulin in part by improving zzso release of zzso zzso as evidenced by increased zzso zzso released per unit of zzso
