zzso is an zzso zzso protein zzso required for polarity in zzso flies, zzso and zzso The zzso zzso family consists of four zzso zzso studies of mice zzso zzso in regulating zzso immune zzso learning, and memory as well as zzso insulin zzso and zzso zzso Here, we report zzso of mice zzso for a second family member zzso that exhibit increased energy zzso reduced zzso with zzso zzso zzso and normal insulin zzso zzso mice were protected against high-fat zzso obesity and displayed attenuated weight gain, complete resistance to zzso zzso and improved zzso handling with decreased insulin zzso Overnight zzso led to complete zzso zzso zzso associated zzso zzso increased zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso levels in zzso but not in control or zzso zzso The zzso of zzso with zzso mice revealed that at least one of the four zzso is necessary for embryonic zzso The severity of zzso followed a rank order, zzso the loss of one zzso zzso in zzso mice conveyed milder zzso than the loss of one zzso zzso in zzso zzso Thus, although zzso and zzso can compensate for one another during zzso their individual disruption gives rise to distinct zzso zzso in adult zzso
