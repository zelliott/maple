The zzso zzso mouse was established as an zzso strain of mouse with spontaneous development of diabetes zzso by selective breeding for zzso intolerance from zzso zzso zzso zzso mice spontaneously develop diabetes zzso in an zzso zzso The cumulative zzso of diabetes is zzso in males and zzso in females at 48 weeks of zzso Neither severe obesity nor extreme zzso is observed at any age in these zzso zzso insulin zzso was markedly impaired in zzso mice after 24 weeks of zzso In contrast, zzso plasma insulin level was higher in male zzso mice than that in male zzso mice zzso zzso 73 vs 350 zzso 40 zzso p zzso at 36 weeks of zzso zzso insulin content was higher in male zzso mice than that in male zzso mice zzso zzso 8 vs 52 zzso 5 zzso wet weight, p zzso at 36 weeks of zzso zzso no abnormal findings, such as zzso or inflammatory changes in the pancreatic zzso were observed in zzso mice at any zzso These data suggest that functional changes of insulin zzso in response to zzso from pancreatic beta cells may contribute to the development of zzso diabetes zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Although insulin sensitivity was not measured, zzso zzso in zzso mice suggests that insulin resistance may also contribute to the zzso of zzso Since these findings are similar to the zzso features of human zzso patients, the zzso mouse is considered to be useful for investigating the zzso and genetic predisposition to zzso
