zzso stress with relative zzso has been associated with zzso disease zzso zzso interventions may therefore hold promise for reducing such chronic disease risk in obese zzso The purpose of this study was to conduct a zzso pilot intervention to determine whether stress-reduction zzso zzso zzso zzso could serve as an acceptable and effective stress-reduction zzso in overweight Latino zzso 

zzso (6 zzso female, ages zzso zzso zzso zzso were randomly assigned to the experimental guided imagery group zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso subjects received four weekly zzso stress-reduction zzso zzso zzso cortisol was assessed immediately before and after each zzso zzso was assessed by compliance and qualitative zzso 

zzso attended all sessions and expressed acceptance of the zzso zzso There were significant zzso reductions in zzso cortisol in the zzso group in three of the four sessions, and no reductions in cortisol in the control zzso For all four sessions combined, there was a significant zzso effect for the change in zzso cortisol in zzso versus C zzso zzso zzso Effect sizes of cortisol change in zzso group were moderate to very high in the four zzso 

We conclude that zzso may be feasible and effective in acutely reducing zzso cortisol levels in overweight Latino zzso Future studies will need to determine whether stress-reduction zzso can result in longer-term reductions in chronic stress and measures of zzso zzso
