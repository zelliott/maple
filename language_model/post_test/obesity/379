The aim of the study was to examine clinical zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene variations in children and adolescents with zzso zzso zzso in order to evaluate their pattern of distribution in zzso 

We enrolled 88 patients, each having at least two zzso zzso above the upper limit of the reference range with normal free zzso hormones and negative zzso zzso 

Clinical characteristics included zzso weight, family history of zzso diseases, zzso volume, and zzso at zzso zzso parameters included zzso free zzso hormones, zzso zzso and adjusted daily urinary zzso zzso zzso zzso variations in the zzso gene were zzso 

The prevalence of zzso positive family history of zzso diseases, and zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso Median zzso was higher in zzso patients than in zzso ones zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and in zzso patients with zzso than in those with normal ultrasound pattern zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso daily zzso was lower in subjects without than in those with a positive family history of zzso diseases zzso zzso 120 zzso P zzso zzso The prevalence of a positive family history of zzso diseases was zzso higher in patients with zzso zzso in the zzso gene than in patients without any zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso A novel zzso at position zzso in zzso 10 zzso was detected in one zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso gene are characterizing features of a large portion of zzso zzso
