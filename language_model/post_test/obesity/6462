zzso protein is an zzso zzso of zzso receptors zzso including zzso and zzso which have been implicated as part of the zzso mechanism that mediates zzso zzso In this experiment we examined the effects of peripheral and central zzso administration in male and female zzso promoter zzso mice that express zzso protein zzso and have a zzso that includes obesity and diabetes which is exaggerated in males compared with zzso zzso infusion of 10 zzso zzso for 13 days caused weight loss and a transient zzso of food intake in zzso mice, with a greater effect in males than zzso Male zzso mice were resistant to zzso infusion whereas female mice lost zzso All of the mice lost body weight following a single zzso injection of zzso but the effect was greater in female zzso mice than any other zzso There also was a delayed suppression of food intake that was the same for zzso and zzso female mice, whereas food intake recovered faster in zzso than zzso zzso The zzso between food intake and body weight loss implies a significant effect of zzso on energy expenditure in zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the effect of zzso on energy balance is not entirely dependent upon the zzso zzso
