The zzso zzso syndrome zzso is associated with obesity and insulin resistance zzso to diabetes zzso type 2 and zzso zzso is a recently discovered zzso with zzso and putative zzso zzso The aim of the study was to zzso zzso of circulating zzso levels and to investigate the potential role of zzso in insulin resistance in zzso zzso 

Plasma zzso and parameters of zzso insulin resistance and zzso were measured In 62 women with zzso and in 35 healthy female zzso 

Both in zzso and controls, zzso levels were lower in overweight or obese women than in zzso women, without any difference between zzso and controls after adjustment for body mass index zzso In zzso and in controls there was a significant correlation of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso model sensitivity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and testosterone zzso zzso zzso P zzso but no correlation with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso or the zzso ratio zzso zzso P zzso zzso Multiple linear zzso analysis revealed that zzso and zzso zzso but not testosterone were independently associated with zzso plasma levels, explaining zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso In zzso patients insulin sensitivity, as indicated by continuous infusion of zzso with model assessment zzso zzso was significantly correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso body fat mass assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and with testosterone zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Multiple linear zzso analysis demonstrated that markers of obesity such as zzso total or zzso fat mass, age and zzso were independently associated with zzso zzso and that circulating zzso accounted for about zzso of the degree of insulin resistance in zzso By contrast, testosterone was not a significant factor, suggesting that zzso per zzso did not affect insulin sensitivity independent from zzso age and zzso zzso treatment for 6 months in zzso zzso women zzso zzso 9) had no effect on plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso despite significant loss of weight and fat mass and improvement in zzso 

zzso per zzso is not associated with decreased levels of plasma zzso However, circulating zzso is independently associated with the degree of insulin resistance in zzso women and may contribute to the development and/or maintenance of insulin resistance independent from zzso
