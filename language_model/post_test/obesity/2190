In zzso patients, lower body mass index and weight loss have been associated with higher mortality rates, a phenomenon sometimes called the obesity zzso This apparent paradox might be explained by loss of muscle zzso The authors thus examined the relation to mortality of changes in dry weight and changes in serum zzso levels (a zzso zzso in a cohort of zzso zzso patients who were followed for up to 5 years zzso In addition to conventional zzso zzso the authors conducted a ranking analysis of joint effects in which the sums and differences of the zzso of change for the 2 measures in each patient were used as the zzso zzso with previous body mass index zzso lower body mass, lower muscle mass, weight loss, and serum zzso decline were associated with higher death zzso Among patients with a zzso change, persons whose weight declined but whose serum zzso levels increased had lower death rates than did those whose weight increased but whose serum zzso level zzso A decline in serum zzso appeared to be a stronger predictor of mortality than did weight zzso Assuming residual selection bias and zzso were not large, the present results suggest that a considerable proportion of the obesity paradox in dialysis patients might be explained by the amount of decline in muscle zzso
