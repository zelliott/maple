Recently, the obese zzso rat zzso an animal model of zzso zzso zzso diabetes, was shown to respond to converting zzso zzso with decreased zzso and a marked zzso of zzso zzso It was hypothesized that the zzso would possess low plasma zzso values and an increased vascular responsiveness to zzso II, and therefore, the zzso system zzso active zzso inactive zzso zzso zzso content, and plasma zzso and vascular zzso in zzso at 10 and 24 zzso of age were zzso zzso and zzso zzso inactive plasma zzso and zzso zzso content were all significantly zzso zzso reduced in zzso when compared with zzso lean zzso The ratio of inactive to total zzso was significantly increased in the zzso zzso zzso ring vascular zzso to zzso zzso and zzso II was zzso Despite essentially equal or increased zzso responses to zzso and zzso at both 10 and 24 zzso of age, the zzso was not more sensitive to zzso II and displayed a significantly reduced zzso response to zzso II at 24 zzso of age, when compared with lean zzso zzso It was concluded that the zzso protective effect of converting zzso zzso in zzso despite significantly reduced zzso and zzso inactive plasma zzso and zzso zzso content, may not be due to a zzso increased vascular zzso to zzso zzso
