It has been proposed that the zzso system zzso and its zzso zzso may be a promising therapeutic target in zzso insulin resistance zzso However, due to the extended zzso of this system, the therapeutic use of specific zzso for zzso may target numerous zzso resulting zzso to collateral deleterious zzso To unravel specific zzso zzso of this system under obesity and zzso conditions, we measured the zzso and zzso level of both zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso of zzso obese female mice fed with a high fat zzso zzso In a preliminary study, we compared between adult male and female mice, the zzso plasma zzso variation and the effect of zzso on zzso No significant differences were found for these parameters suggesting that the zzso is not affected by the zzso Moreover, plasma zzso level was not modulated during the four days of the zzso cycle in zzso In obese and zzso zzso female mice, plasma zzso concentration after zzso was not modified but, the zzso level of the zzso system was zzso in the white zzso tissue zzso and reduced in the brown zzso tissue zzso the liver and in zzso BAT zzso content was reduced in zzso female zzso Our data suggest that the zzso system may be implicated into specific zzso of these zzso under obesity and diabetes and that, zzso zzso of this system may be of interest particularly in the treatment of zzso liver and zzso zzso that occur during these zzso
