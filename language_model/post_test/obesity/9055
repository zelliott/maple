Although obesity is an important risk factor for diabetes and hypertension, the two most common zzso of kidney failure, obesity itself may increase zzso risk by increasing the zzso demands on the zzso which leads to higher zzso zzso pressures and zzso zzso The zzso frequently linked with obesity may also accelerate structural damage by interacting with zzso II and increasing collagen production and zzso The zzso changes in the kidney noted in some obese, especially zzso obese, adults frequently mimic those changes associated with secondary focal zzso zzso which may occur in disease states such as severely reduced zzso mass and zzso zzso Given the presence of genetic zzso and/or reduced zzso mass, obesity may zzso the development and progression of secondary focal zzso zzso 

zzso is an important risk factor for zzso Treatment plans for obese adults with zzso should include weight loss and exercise because these interventions may simultaneously reduce the zzso demands on the zzso lower systemic and zzso pressures, and improve insulin zzso However, more studies are needed to further zzso the treatment and prevention of zzso associated with zzso
