The aims of this study was to review our experience with zzso zzso zzso zzso and to evaluate the impact of zzso index zzso on zzso 

We zzso analyzed 50 zzso zzso Twenty had body mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 18 had zzso between 25 and zzso zzso zzso and 12 had zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso had similar operative times: zzso zzso and 320 minutes, zzso Most patients zzso underwent a total zzso zzso zzso but 9 underwent an initial zzso zzso dissection (5 zzso 2 zzso and 2 zzso Five patients were converted to open and 1 had a planned open zzso The zzso was zzso closed in most but left open in 6 (3 zzso 2 zzso and 1 zzso and a zzso zzso division was performed in 7 (3 zzso 2 zzso and 2 zzso Increased zzso was associated with delayed oral intake zzso zzso zzso No significant cohort differences were observed for estimated blood loss zzso zzso rate, complication rate, surgical margin status, distant zzso or death zzso The obese cohort demonstrated trends toward increased hospitalization and zzso cancer recurrence zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Patients with prior open surgery had longer zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients without prior surgery were more commonly alive with persistent disease zzso zzso zzso zzso was greater for patients who had zzso zzso dissection zzso zzso zzso Patients undergoing a zzso zzso division had delayed oral zzso zzso function, and discharge zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and P zzso zzso 

zzso is an effective surgical treatment for patients with zzso as great as zzso
