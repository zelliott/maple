To dissect the genetic architecture of sexual zzso in zzso traits, we evaluated the zzso interaction, zzso zzso and zzso linkages for seven zzso related to zzso A total of zzso zzso Chinese subjects from the family study of the Stanford zzso Program of zzso and zzso Resistance were used to search for quantitative trait zzso zzso responsible for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso effects from the zzso were also examined using the zzso linkage zzso We found that zzso differences in zzso and the zzso interaction effects were substantially significant for most of these zzso Several zzso with strong linkage evidence were identified after incorporating zzso by sex zzso zzso zzso interactions into the linkage zzso including one zzso for hip circumference zzso zzso score zzso zzso zzso empirical p zzso zzso and two zzso for zzso on zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that these linkage signals all resulted from females rather than zzso Most of these zzso for zzso traits zzso the findings in other ethnic zzso zzso linkage analyses showed several obesity traits were influenced by a common set of zzso All regions with linkage signals were observed in one zzso but not in the whole sample, suggesting the genetic architecture of zzso traits does differ by zzso These findings are useful for further identification of the liability genes for these zzso through candidate genes or zzso association zzso
