Several studies showed that the orphan zzso zzso zzso zzso - member of the zzso zzso family - has an important role in zzso zzso zzso zzso mice developed mild zzso and decreased levels of zzso zzso have been described in muscle from obese zzso and type 2 diabetic zzso zzso In this work, to gain insight into zzso zzso cell signaling zzso and its implication on zzso zzso primary cultured zzso from normal subjects, zzso or zzso patients were tested using high affinity zzso - zzso In muscle cells from all zzso conditions, the compound significantly increased not only zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels, but also zzso zzso moreover, it produced a zzso stimulation of zzso zzso a activity and zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso patients were more sensitive to the zzso than normal, and zzso cells even more than obese zzso These results widen the knowledge of human zzso cell signaling pathways induced by a zzso zzso described its zzso effects on zzso zzso showed the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and also propose the employing of zzso system, as participant in the obese and diabetic zzso
