The acute blood pressure response to physical exertion has been used as an indicator of the risk of developing zzso The factors associated with this response need to be clarified for timely intervention in preventing zzso zzso 

To describe the response of cardiovascular variables to acute physical exertion in overweight adolescents using zzso exercise zzso 

The sample consisted of 104 adolescents zzso boys and 48 zzso divided into two groups: the zzso group zzso and the zzso group zzso The following variables were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso body composition zzso fold zzso as well as zzso variables such as zzso zzso pressure zzso zzso zzso pressure zzso and heart rate zzso at rest and at zzso physical exertion during the zzso zzso 

In the male group, the greatest values of zzso zzso pressure at rest were recorded in the zzso as compared to the zzso zzso zzso 13 vs 106 zzso 8 zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 14 vs 109 zzso 10 zzso p zzso zzso and zzso during zzso exertion conditions zzso zzso 20 vs 146 zzso 14 zzso p zzso zzso In the female group, only zzso zzso was higher in the overweight group as compared to the zzso girls zzso zzso 11 vs 106 zzso 10 zzso p zzso zzso 

The response of zzso blood pressure during physical exercise was most exacerbated in obese adolescents as compared to zzso zzso suggesting greater zzso to physical zzso
