zzso is widely used in zzso programming studies to determine the relative contribution of the in zzso and zzso periods in establishing the adult offspring zzso in response to an environmental zzso We have investigated whether the process of zzso per zzso influences cardiovascular and zzso function in adult offspring of zzso mice in comparison with animals zzso by their biological zzso zzso zzso mice demonstrated juvenile onset zzso and significantly higher body weight (from weaning to 12 weeks: male control zzso zzso zzso P zzso female zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso accompanied by increased abdominal zzso in males only zzso zzso tissue mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 7) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso Both male and female zzso mice demonstrated significantly enhanced zzso zzso A marked increase in zzso blood pressure zzso was observed in male zzso mice zzso zzso day: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso night: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso relaxation was enhanced in male zzso mice, and zzso zzso was increased in female zzso zzso Concentration of serum zzso cholesterol, insulin and zzso were increased in zzso zzso zzso The process of zzso profoundly affects cardiovascular and zzso zzso in zzso The findings have implications for the inclusion of appropriate controls in the design of future studies and in the interpretation of previous zzso studies in zzso
