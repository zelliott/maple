Other workers have reported increased zzso tissue zzso zzso after a weight loss in obese subjects and have suspected that this zzso is a primary factor of zzso zzso In order to determine whether this effect was the consequence of zzso rather than weight loss, six obese females were included in a controlled zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso was measured before weight loss, at the end of 30 days on a diet of 800 zzso zzso weight loss zzso and four times during the 8 days after the initiation of zzso a 1500 zzso mixed diet to insure weight zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso decreased by zzso by the end of the weight loss, and an average zzso increase zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, p less than zzso was shown as early as 2 days after zzso Peak values after zzso did not surpass zzso zzso Changes during restriction and peak zzso values were both positively correlated to baseline zzso It can be concluded that the previously shown increase in zzso zzso during weight stability after a weight loss is likely to be a secondary effect of partial zzso the individual sensitivity of zzso tissue zzso zzso to nutritional induction could be of critical zzso
