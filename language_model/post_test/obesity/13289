zzso plays a central role in the regulation of fatty acid zzso promoting zzso storage in zzso tissue and fatty acid zzso in peripheral zzso Loss of zzso signaling leads to zzso of lipids in muscle and loss of insulin sensitivity secondary to zzso In this study, we examined the direct and indirect effects of zzso signaling on zzso zzso including those essential for peripheral fatty acid zzso We assessed the impact of zzso using the zzso zzso which lacks functional zzso zzso The activities of marker zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were similar between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, several zzso showed variations in the fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso It was not clear if these changes were due to loss of zzso signaling or to insulin zzso zzso we examined the effects of zzso on cultured zzso and zzso zzso zzso (3 days at 0, zzso or zzso zzso had no direct effect on the activities of zzso zzso or fatty acid zzso zzso zzso treatment did not affect zzso reporter genes under the control of zzso factors involved in zzso zzso zzso respiratory zzso zzso nuclear respiratory zzso zzso or fatty acid zzso expression zzso zzso receptors zzso These studies suggest that zzso exerts only indirect effects on zzso gene expression in muscle, possibly arising from insulin zzso
