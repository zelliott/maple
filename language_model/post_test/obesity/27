In search of a practical zzso test that will reflect zzso zzso we assessed the significance of serum zzso activity in 48 patients with zzso fatty liver, 16 obese subjects without fatty liver, 30 cases of chronic persistent zzso 38 cases of chronic active zzso and 20 cases of liver zzso Increased zzso activity was observed in zzso as well as obese patients with fatty liver, whereas obese subjects without fatty liver showed levels in the upper normal zzso When we set a zzso level above the upper normal limit, half of the patients with fatty liver showed values above it, with only a few zzso with other zzso When obese patients with fatty liver took a zzso diet, zzso activity zzso clearly reflecting improvement of zzso zzso Thus, measurement of zzso activity is of diagnostic value and an alternative to zzso zzso in zzso zzso and will provide a practical measure for the assessment of effects during zzso
