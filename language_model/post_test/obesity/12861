The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of zzso obesity on pancreatic zzso blood zzso in normal zzso zzso Furthermore, we investigated to what extent any zzso changes in zzso blood flow could be reversed after zzso to a normal diet with zzso of body zzso Young adult female zzso rats were offered a palatable mixed zzso diet zzso zzso in addition to standard zzso zzso zzso control rats received standard zzso zzso zzso After 4 weeks the zzso rats had a body weight of approximately zzso more than that of the zzso All zzso rats had decreased zzso tolerance and increased serum insulin zzso but zzso blood zzso zzso were similar in zzso zzso and control zzso Whole pancreatic and zzso blood flow rates were measured with a zzso zzso The zzso blood flow as well as fractional zzso blood flow were increased zzso zzso in rats fed the cafeteria diet, while blood zzso of the whole zzso was similar to that of the control zzso In a second experiment, rats received the cafeteria diet for 4 weeks and were then fed standard zzso food alone for another 3 weeks, while controls received standard diet for 7 zzso After this period total body weight, zzso fat pad weight and zzso tolerance were similar to those of the zzso Whole pancreatic blood flow was unchanged as compared with that of control zzso However, both zzso blood flow zzso zzso and fractional blood flow zzso zzso were zzso We conclude that zzso obesity in rats is associated with decreased zzso zzso zzso and a specific increase in absolute and fractional zzso blood zzso This increase persists for at least 3 weeks after the diet is withdrawn despite zzso of body weight and zzso zzso
