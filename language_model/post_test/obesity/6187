zzso fatty zzso protein zzso is a member of the zzso zzso protein family and is predominantly expressed in zzso zzso Emerging evidence suggests that zzso plays a role in some aspects of the zzso syndrome including the development of type 2 diabetes and zzso We have recently reported that zzso products from human zzso directly and acutely depressed cardiac zzso zzso 

The purpose of this study was to identify this zzso zzso zzso 

Through mass zzso and zzso we have identified this zzso factor as zzso zzso represents zzso to zzso of total protein zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso acutely depressed zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso peak zzso in a zzso manner in isolated rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a similar zzso zzso The zzso zzso acids 1 to 20 of zzso could be identified as the most effective zzso zzso We could exclude any effect of zzso on action potential duration and zzso zzso zzso suggesting a reduced zzso gain caused by zzso as the main zzso zzso 

We conclude that the release of zzso from zzso may be involved in the development of cardiac zzso dysfunction of obese zzso
