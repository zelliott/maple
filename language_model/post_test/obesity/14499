To the best of our knowledge, there are only a few previous studies on the effects of overweight on zzso carotid zzso We aimed to investigate the effects of overweight on flow zzso zzso diameters and zzso media thicknesses zzso of the common and internal carotid arteries zzso zzso 

A prospective study on color duplex zzso of the zzso arteries was performed in 71 adults, ages between zzso years zzso The body mass index zzso was found to be normal in 24 zzso 1) and high in 47 zzso 2) subjects of the study zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso diameter and zzso of carotid arteries of all the participants were zzso 

There were significant differences between group 1 and group 2 in the following zzso zzso diameters of the right zzso were significantly larger in group 2, zzso zzso of zzso were significantly lower in group 2 than in group 1 and zzso zzso zzso were significantly lower in group 2 than in group zzso 

The present data shows that there is a correlation among carotid artery zzso diameter, zzso and zzso In the overweight subjects, the increased zzso diameter and decreased zzso can point at the early stage of zzso The influence of zzso on zzso is very complex and varies with gender and age, therefore we need larger series and further zzso
