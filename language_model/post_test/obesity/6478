To characterize the zzso changes in zzso and muscle zzso zzso zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso and to test the hypothesis that zzso abnormalities in zzso activity zzso the establishment of zzso 

zzso zzso and obese zzso male zzso rats were studied at 4, 5 and 8 weeks of age, that is at the onset of zzso and at a time when obesity is well zzso Assessment was made of plasma variables related to zzso and zzso metabolism and of zzso activity in several zzso zzso skeletal muscles and the zzso 

At week 4, body weights were identical in both zzso and began to diverge at week zzso zzso zzso rats weighed zzso more than their lean zzso zzso and zzso zzso depot weights were also identical in both zzso at week 4 and began to increase in zzso rats at week 5, whereas the subcutaneous depot of zzso zzso rats was slightly zzso At week 4, the zzso rats were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared to their lean counterparts, and their liver contained twice as much zzso The zzso zzso rats displayed zzso higher zzso specific activity in the various zzso zzso compared to lean rats, and zzso activity remained higher in obese than in lean rats at all subsequent zzso In contrast, zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso and heart muscles of zzso obese rats was approximately half that observed in lean zzso 

zzso persistent zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso activity are established in the zzso zzso rat prior to the development of frank zzso The increase in zzso tissue zzso activity and its decrease in muscle zzso are likely to be related to the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso in zzso activity may be considered as an integrated adaptation to increased zzso flux aimed at driving lipids toward storage sites and limiting their zzso by zzso zzso
