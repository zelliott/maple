zzso zzso and the response to zzso zzso are significantly diminished in obese zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso selectively stimulates zzso release in normal young men and in the elderly, who also have diminished zzso zzso A zzso zzso study examined the effects of L on zzso release in 12 healthy obese zzso zzso mean zzso zzso age, zzso zzso zzso zzso body mass index, zzso zzso zzso zzso and 10 zzso zzso zzso age, zzso zzso zzso zzso body mass index, zzso zzso zzso young zzso In part A, zzso low dose L zzso zzso or high dose L zzso zzso was administered zzso over 15 zzso on 3 separate occasions after an overnight zzso zzso for zzso zzso and cortisol zzso were obtained every 15 zzso zzso release zzso zzso zzso was significantly increased by both doses of L compared to the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso In a subset of 6 obese men, in samples collected every 5 zzso the zzso response to both doses of L was significantly greater than that to 1 zzso zzso To compare the response to low dose L in the obese and to determine the effects of feeding on this response, zzso zzso L was administered as described in part A to zzso young men after an overnight fast zzso or a standardized breakfast zzso part zzso Low dose L was an effective zzso zzso in zzso young zzso however, this effect was attenuated with feeding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Of note, the response to low dose L in zzso obese individuals was similar to that in fed zzso zzso The administration of L was well tolerated in both zzso We conclude that L is an effective zzso zzso in obese and zzso young men and may have therapeutic benefits when administered to relative zzso or zzso or absolute zzso zzso
