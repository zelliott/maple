zzso is associated with reduced exercise zzso fat zzso rate zzso which is generally assessed by zzso cycling zzso The zzso walking test zzso presents an alternative method in zzso 

The aim of this study was to establish a practical reference equation zzso the prediction of zzso from the 6 zzso in obese children of both zzso 

This study is a zzso study using mixed linear and multiple zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were recorded and zzso cycling test and 6 zzso conducted for 131 zzso obese children, 68 boys and 63 zzso A multiple zzso analysis for zzso including zzso walking distance (6 zzso zzso and cardiac parameters as the dependent zzso was performed for the two genders zzso 

Mean 6 zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso m and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for boys and zzso zzso zzso m and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for girls, zzso The zzso body mass index, zzso zzso mass, waist and hip zzso zzso and zzso rest heart rate, and zzso and zzso blood pressures were highly correlated with zzso for both zzso There was a significant correlation between 6 zzso and zzso in both boys and girls zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that the combinations of 6 zzso with HC for boys and zzso with zzso for girls improved the predictability of the model zzso zzso zzso for boys and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso 

In obese children, the zzso can be used to predict zzso when formal test of exercise capacity and gas exchange analysis are unavailable or zzso It is therefore possible to zzso targeted exercises at zzso without performing indirect zzso just from a field zzso
