Total body electrical zzso zzso is a zzso method for zzso fat free mass zzso in live zzso In this study, we have evaluated the use of the zzso zzso which is claimed by the manufacturers to perform better than earlier zzso Previous studies in rats using these earlier versions of the zzso zzso have always used zzso to zzso movement zzso As repeated zzso also has the potential to induce zzso by zzso food zzso for example, we have also attempted to determine if this zzso zzso can be used to predict body composition in conscious adult zzso female zzso zzso A simplified cafeteria diet was used to produce large variations in body composition zzso g zzso and a full chemical body composition analysis was performed to generate a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was more strongly correlated to zzso zzso than it was to body weight zzso or other body composition zzso Using the zzso zzso equation to predict fat mass on these data, there was an excellent correlation with the value obtained by chemical analyses zzso zzso To determine if the zzso zzso equation derived from this zzso study would then be useful for the routine zzso of body composition an zzso validation study was zzso This validation study was performed 6 months later, used an independent group of obese female zzso rats and was undertaken by different zzso zzso This validation study, again, showed a good correlation between the zzso and zzso fat mass zzso zzso indicating stability of the zzso equation with time and independence from zzso We therefore conclude that it is possible to zzso estimate body fat changes in conscious rats using this zzso analysis zzso
