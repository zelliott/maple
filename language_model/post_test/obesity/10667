zzso often zzso with zzso and may have additive effects on insulin zzso zzso obese individuals could be at increased risk for type 2 zzso We performed a study to determine whether zzso is associated with impairment in insulin sensitivity and zzso zzso in obese and non-obese zzso 

We performed a zzso analysis of National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso III data utilizing subjects of 20 years or older, zzso zzso zzso was identified from zzso zzso measurement of muscle zzso zzso was identified from body mass zzso Outcomes were zzso model assessment of insulin resistance zzso zzso zzso zzso level zzso and prevalence of zzso zzso zzso and not on zzso and type 2 zzso zzso in multiple zzso were age, educational level, ethnicity and zzso 

zzso was associated with insulin resistance in non-obese zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso and obese individuals zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso was associated with zzso in obese individuals zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso but not in non-obese zzso zzso were stronger in those under 60 years of zzso We acknowledge that the zzso study design limits our ability to draw zzso zzso 

zzso independent of zzso is associated with adverse zzso zzso and the association is strongest in individuals under 60 years of age, which suggests that low muscle mass may be an early predictor of diabetes zzso Given the increasing prevalence of zzso further research is urgently needed to develop interventions to prevent zzso obesity and its zzso zzso
