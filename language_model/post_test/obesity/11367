zzso increases risk of many adverse zzso but its early origins are zzso zzso diabetes zzso zzso reflects a metabolically altered fetal environment associated with high birth weight, itself associated with later zzso Previous studies of zzso and offspring zzso however, have been few and zzso The objectives of this study were to examine associations of birth weight and zzso with adolescent body mass index zzso and to determine the extent to which the effect of zzso is explained by its influence on birth weight or by maternal zzso 

We conducted a survey of zzso girls and 6900 boys, 9 to 14 years of age, who are participants in the Growing Up Today zzso a US nationwide study of diet, activity, and zzso In 1996, participants reported zzso weight, diet, activity, and other variables by self-administered mailed zzso We linked these data with information reported by their mothers, participants in the zzso Health Study II, including zzso zzso current weight, and child's birth zzso We excluded zzso zzso zzso gestation and mothers who had zzso zzso We defined overweight as zzso zzso zzso and at risk for overweight as zzso to 95th zzso for age and gender from US national zzso 

Mean birth weight was zzso zzso for girls and zzso zzso for zzso Among the 465 subjects whose mothers had zzso zzso were at risk for overweight and zzso were overweight in early zzso In the group without maternal diabetes, these estimates were zzso and zzso zzso In multiple zzso zzso analysis, controlling for age, zzso and zzso stage, the odds ratio for adolescent overweight for each zzso zzso in birth weight was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso Adjustment for physical activity, television watching, energy zzso zzso zzso mother's zzso and other maternal and family variables reduced the estimate to zzso zzso For offspring of mothers with zzso versus no diabetes, the odds ratio for adolescent overweight was zzso zzso which was unchanged after controlling for energy balance and socioeconomic zzso Adjustment for birth weight slightly attenuated the estimate zzso zzso adjustment for maternal zzso reduced the odds ratio to zzso zzso 

Higher birth weight predicted increased risk of overweight in zzso Having been born to a mother with zzso was also associated with increased adolescent zzso However, the effect of zzso on offspring obesity seemed only partially explained by its influence on birth weight, and adjustment for mother's own zzso attenuated the zzso zzso Our results only modestly support a zzso role of altered zzso zzso metabolism in the genesis of obesity in the zzso zzso zzso may program risk for a zzso insult leading to zzso or it may merely be a risk marker, not in the zzso zzso
