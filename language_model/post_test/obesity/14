The effect of zzso zzso a zzso on zzso zzso tissue distribution and insulin levels of normal and obese mice was investigated using an in zzso zzso zzso Acute doses of zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso levels in zzso muscle and zzso fat and produced a transient zzso of insulin which most likely accounts for the increased zzso levels in muscle and zzso The results demonstrate that the in zzso zzso method produced results consistent with known actions of zzso on in zzso zzso zzso in muscle and zzso zzso treatment (7 zzso with zzso 50 zzso zzso twice daily did not result in increased zzso zzso tissue levels in normal mice when compared to saline treated zzso However, insulin levels were lower in mice treated zzso with zzso compared to saline controls suggesting an enhancement of insulin zzso zzso yellow obese mice represent a model of maturity onset obesity presenting with insulin zzso The insulin resistance of this obese strain appears to reside in the fat tissue as assessed by comparing zzso tissue levels of obese mice with lean zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment had no effect on zzso zzso in fat or muscle tissue of viable yellow obese mice and did not alter their plasma insulin zzso It appears that genetically obese viable yellow mice may be resistant to zzso treatment with zzso
