To study zzso metabolism and insulin sensitivity and zzso in children and adolescents with zzso syndrome zzso compared with zzso obesity zzso zzso 

Seventy-five patients with zzso and 395 controls with zzso were studied by oral zzso tolerance zzso zzso resistance zzso and zzso function were assessed by zzso model assessment zzso insulin zzso index, zzso insulin and insulin sensitivity zzso 

The zzso of diabetes zzso was zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso while zzso intolerance was zzso in the former group and zzso in the latter zzso zzso insulin level (12 zzso zzso vs zzso zzso 25 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso were lower in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively), whereas zzso zzso index was lower in zzso than in zzso zzso zzso 42 vs 102 zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso Composite was higher in zzso compared to zzso (6 zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso presented lower insulin resistance and a zzso between zzso zzso and the degree of zzso
