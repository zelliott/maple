The goal was to examine the associations of zzso at birth and at 6 months with obesity at 3 years of zzso 

We studied 559 children in Project zzso an zzso zzso cohort study of pregnant women and their zzso We measured length and weight at birth, 6 months, and 3 zzso Our main zzso were zzso zzso score at birth adjusted for zzso age and zzso zzso score at 6 months adjusted for zzso zzso score at zzso We used zzso zzso analyses to predict the independent effects of birth zzso zzso score and, zzso zzso zzso zzso score on zzso zzso score, the sum of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and obesity zzso for age and gender zzso or zzso zzso at age zzso 

Mean weights at birth, 6 months, and 3 years were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso lengths were zzso zzso and zzso zzso At 3 years, 48 children zzso were zzso After adjustment for zzso variables and birth zzso zzso score, each zzso in zzso zzso zzso score was associated with higher zzso zzso scores, higher sums of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and increased odds of obesity at age zzso The predicted obesity prevalence among children in the highest zzso of both birth and zzso zzso zzso scores was zzso compared with zzso for children in the lowest zzso of zzso Whereas birth zzso zzso scores were associated with higher zzso zzso scores, the magnitude of effect was smaller than that of zzso zzso scores at 6 zzso 

zzso increases in weight for length in the first 6 months of life were associated with sharply increased risk of obesity at 3 years of zzso Changes in weight status in infancy may influence risk of later obesity more than weight status at zzso
