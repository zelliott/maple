It is well established that the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is closely linked to the presence and duration of overweight and zzso A reduction in the zzso of type 2 diabetes with lifestyle changes has previously been zzso We hypothesized that adding a zzso agent to lifestyle changes may lead to an even greater decrease in body weight, and thus the zzso of type 2 diabetes, in obese zzso 

In a zzso zzso prospective study, we zzso zzso patients to lifestyle changes plus either zzso 120 zzso or zzso three times zzso Participants had a zzso zzso and normal zzso or impaired zzso zzso tolerance zzso zzso zzso were time to onset of type 2 diabetes and change in body zzso zzso were by intention to zzso 

Of zzso patients, zzso completed treatment compared with zzso of zzso recipients zzso zzso After 4 years' treatment, the cumulative zzso of diabetes was zzso with zzso and zzso with zzso corresponding to a risk reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that the preventive effect was explained by the difference in subjects with zzso Mean weight loss after 4 years was significantly greater with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso P zzso and similar between zzso recipients with impaired zzso zzso or normal zzso tolerance zzso zzso zzso at zzso A second analysis in which the baseline weights of subjects who dropped out of the study was carried forward also demonstrated greater weight loss in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso 

Compared with lifestyle changes alone, zzso plus lifestyle changes resulted in a greater reduction in the zzso of type 2 diabetes over 4 years and produced greater weight loss in a clinically representative obese zzso zzso in diabetes zzso was zzso only in the zzso zzso weight loss was similar in subjects with zzso or zzso zzso
