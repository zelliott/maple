The history of zzso drug development is far from zzso with transient magic bullets and only a handful of agents currently licensed for clinical zzso In view of recent progress in our understanding of the zzso of zzso pathways involved in appetite regulation, and the zzso deluge of reports on the zzso efficacy of novel therapies, it seems timely to stress the need to differentiate treatments that suppress intake by primary means from those that only indirectly achieve this zzso The current article reviews the conceptual history of the zzso zzso sequence zzso also known as the zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Early research confirmed that natural zzso produced by a caloric load on the gut, is associated with a predictable transition from feeding through grooming to zzso Although many less zzso zzso are also capable of reducing food zzso very few do so without zzso the normal structure of this feeding zzso Thus, while zzso and zzso reduce intake by accelerating but otherwise maintaining the integrity of the zzso other zzso interventions disrupt the zzso through response competition zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or interference with zzso positive feedback zzso zzso zzso of the zzso A substantial literature now strongly supports the specific involvement of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in the zzso effect of agents such as zzso and zzso Recent zzso analyses have also identified rather selective zzso profiles for the dual zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the broad spectrum zzso zzso zzso zzso However, similar analyses have offered zzso support for the zzso potential of the gut zzso zzso while the acute zzso efficacy of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso appears largely to be secondary to response zzso In contrast, studies with zzso combinations of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have very recently confirmed the potential of drug zzso not only in appetite suppression but also in zzso unwanted zzso In sum, as zzso analysis offers a reliable means of zzso the wheat zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso it should form an integral part of early phase testing in any zzso drug screening zzso
