zzso is an zzso that zzso the final step in zzso zzso zzso knockout experiments in zzso models suggest that zzso of this zzso could be of value in the treatment of obesity and type II zzso The zzso zzso zzso inhibitor 1 was advanced to clinical trials for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, despite of the low passive zzso of zzso Because of questions relating to the potential zzso of distribution and efficacy of a poorly permeable agent, efforts were initiated to identify compounds with improved zzso Replacement of the acid zzso in 1 with an zzso led to the discovery of 52, which possesses substantially improved passive zzso The resulting zzso profile of this neutral zzso inhibitor was found to be similar to 1 at comparable plasma zzso
