zzso is an important risk factor of insulin resistance and type 2 zzso zzso is a cell that can actively zzso a series of factors to regulate the zzso responsible for energy zzso zzso is one of these zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate possible correlation between zzso and certain zzso including body parameters and other parameters of zzso metabolism and roles of zzso in zzso or insulin resistance in obese zzso 

The serum zzso concentration was measured in 34 obese children (18 boys, 16 zzso age zzso zzso and 31 normal subjects (16 boys, 15 zzso age zzso zzso by using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and insulin were measured in all zzso zzso resistance was zzso by zzso model assessment ratio zzso zzso cell function was determined by using zzso model assessment beta cell zzso zzso analysis was performed between zzso and other zzso 

zzso The serum zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso in obese subjects and zzso zzso zzso in normal zzso zzso zzso zzso The serum zzso concentration was not significantly correlated with sex, age, zzso and zzso blood pressures, but was positively correlated with zzso percent body fat zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso and positively correlated with zzso zzso insulin, zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso but not significantly correlated with zzso zzso Multiple linear zzso analysis showed that only zzso was the factor that significantly influenced zzso zzso zzso zzso the standard partial zzso was zzso zzso zzso 

The serum zzso concentration in obese children were higher than that in normal zzso The serum zzso concentration significantly correlated with the degree of obesity and the distribution of zzso zzso is probably related to occurrence of zzso and/or insulin resistance in obese zzso
