During late infancy many infants have a protein zzso which is more than three times as high as the zzso zzso Several zzso studies have shown an association between a zzso intake zzso energy zzso early in life and an increased risk of developing obesity and thereby zzso diseases zzso later in zzso This effect was supported by a recent intervention study with infant formulas with two levels of zzso showing that a higher protein intake during the first year of life resulted in a higher body mass index zzso at age 2 zzso It is also plausible that an important reason for the slower growth in zzso infants is the lower content of protein in zzso but other qualities of zzso could also play a zzso A high intake of zzso especially dairy zzso stimulates the growth factors zzso growth factor zzso and insulin, and it has been suggested that the lower risk of zzso in zzso infants is zzso through a regulation of zzso A low quality of zzso as in zzso diets with no animal foods as often seen in low-income countries, may contribute to zzso which can also result in an increased risk of zzso later in zzso In conclusion, there is some evidence that a high protein intake during the complementary feeding period is associated with increased risk of zzso and that avoidance of a high protein intake could reduce the risk of zzso In low-income countries, emphasis should be on providing sufficient amounts of high-quality protein to improve survival, growth and zzso
