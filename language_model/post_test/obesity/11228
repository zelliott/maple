To determine serum zzso zzso from a sample of zzso population in relation to body mass index, age and zzso 

The zzso comparative study was conducted at the Armed Forces Institute of zzso zzso and Benazir Bhutto Hospital, zzso from August 2008 to December zzso zzso were 100 including healthy obese, overweight and non-obese of both genders aged between zzso zzso zzso was done by zzso convenience zzso Body Mass Index was calculated by formula zzso zzso weight in zzso in zzso non-obese subjects were defined as zzso zzso overweight zzso zzso and obese zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso method and serum zzso by sandwich zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were higher in obese subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso range zzso zzso P zzso than in non-obese subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso range zzso Mean Body Mass Index in obese group was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while it was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Body Mass Index was strongly positively correlated with serum zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso p zzso in the obese zzso The mean serum zzso concentration was much higher in the healthy obese and non-obese women zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso than in men of both categories zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Age had no significant relation with serum zzso level zzso zzso zzso 

In the study sample, serum zzso concentration was positively correlated with Body Mass Index in healthy obese and non-obese subjects of both zzso The levels were higher in women than in zzso Age had no significant relation with serum zzso level in this age zzso
