zzso is believed to increase the risks of zzso stroke or coronary heart zzso however, regarding outcome after established vascular diseases, recent unexpected evidence has suggested that an increased body mass index zzso might have beneficial effects zzso zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the independent association between zzso and long-term mortality after zzso zzso 

A total of zzso consecutive patients with zzso stroke were zzso included through our stroke zzso In this study, the levels of zzso were classified based on guidelines for the zzso zzso zzso neurological severity was estimated by the National Institutes of Health Stroke zzso zzso zzso Information on mortality was collected until the end of 2009, and the median follow-up period was 4 zzso To examine the association between zzso and long-term zzso we used Cox's zzso zzso zzso 

During zzso zzso of patients zzso Linear zzso analysis showed that the level of zzso was zzso related to initial neurological severity zzso zzso zzso In the model of adjustment of age and gender using Cox's zzso zzso analysis, this inverse trend was also significant zzso normal zzso hazard ratio of zzso zzso overweight, zzso zzso zzso However, after adjustment of all zzso including initial neurological severity, only the harmful effect of zzso remained significant zzso zzso zzso zzso however, beneficial effects of overweight and obesity did zzso 

Our study showed that an independent association between zzso and long-term mortality after zzso stroke was found only in zzso zzso The obesity paradox phenomenon seems to be zzso and might not be interpreted as a direct zzso relationship due to a strong association with initial neurological zzso
