The characteristics of zzso zzso precursors from zzso obese patients, whose average body weights were zzso zzso zzso of reference values, were studied in zzso zzso When compared to cells from lean subjects, the zzso precursors from 34 zzso obese patients zzso at a significantly higher rate zzso less than zzso zzso replication persisted throughout the first five zzso Thus, this characteristic is inherent in the cells, and may reflect the operation of genetic factors in this zzso of the obese zzso
