A zzso randomized, zzso zzso crossover trial to compare the zzso and zzso properties of zzso zzso administered insulin zzso zzso and insulin zzso zzso in zzso obese subjects with type 2 zzso 

Thirty subjects zzso zzso mean zzso zzso age: zzso zzso zzso years; body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ; duration of zzso zzso zzso zzso years; zzso zzso zzso zzso were included in the zzso They zzso overnight and then received a zzso zzso subcutaneous dose of zzso or zzso 2 zzso before starting a standardized test zzso 7 days apart, according to a zzso zzso Blood samples were taken every 15 zzso starting 20 zzso before the meal and ending 6 h zzso 

The area under the absolute zzso zzso curve between 0 and 1 h after insulin injection and zzso zzso concentration was significantly lower with zzso than with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, for the total study period, plasma zzso concentration was similar for zzso and zzso Peak insulin concentration was significantly higher for zzso than for insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso events zzso 70 zzso with or without zzso occurred in 13 and 16 subjects treated with zzso and zzso respectively, but there were no cases of severe zzso requiring zzso 

zzso was associated with lower zzso levels during the first hour after a standard zzso the remaining zzso profiles were otherwise zzso with higher insulin levels observed throughout the study zzso
