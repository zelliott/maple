Human zzso gene zzso are associated with body mass index and type 2 zzso Because the zzso zzso are zzso it is unclear whether changes in zzso expression or zzso are the cause of obesity or if regulatory elements within zzso 1 influence upstream or downstream zzso We tested the idea that zzso itself is involved in zzso We show that a dominant point zzso in the mouse zzso gene results in reduced fat mass, increased energy zzso and unchanged physical zzso Exposure to a high-fat diet enhances lean mass and lowers fat mass relative to control zzso zzso studies suggest the zzso occurs in a structurally novel domain and zzso zzso function, possibly by altering its zzso zzso Gene expression profiling revealed increased expression of some fat and zzso metabolism genes and an improved inflammatory profile in white zzso tissue of zzso zzso These data provide direct functional evidence that zzso is a zzso gene underlying zzso Compared to the reported mouse zzso zzso our model more accurately reflects the effect of human zzso zzso we observe a zzso as well as zzso zzso a smaller difference in weight and zzso and our mice do not show zzso zzso or an age-related reduction in size and zzso Our model suggests that a search for human coding zzso in zzso may be zzso and that zzso of zzso activity is a possible target for the treatment of zzso zzso
