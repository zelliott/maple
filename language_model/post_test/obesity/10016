To assess associations of zzso with prevalent coronary heart disease zzso among elderly zzso 

A zzso zzso study conducted between 1991 and zzso 

zzso zzso men from the Honolulu Heart Program who were zzso y of zzso 

zzso included documented zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acute coronary zzso angina zzso leading to surgical treatment identified through hospital zzso and reported history of heart attach or angina zzso requiring hospitalization or surgical zzso zzso was calculated as weight in zzso divided by height in square zzso zzso circumference was measured at the horizontal level of the zzso and zzso was a ratio of waist circumference to hip circumference measured at the horizontal level of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 

An elevated prevalence of zzso was observed in the elderly men with high zzso zzso and waist zzso The significant associations of zzso and waist circumference with zzso persisted after adjustment for zzso zzso physical activity and zzso of cigarette smoking but were no longer significant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence level zzso zzso and OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after adjustment for high density zzso cholesterol zzso Also, the association of zzso with zzso was not found to be independent of abdominal zzso However, the associations of zzso and waist circumference remained significant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after additional adjustment for zzso In addition, the association of zzso with zzso was consistently significant and independent of zzso zzso physical activity, smoking and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is associated with zzso independent of zzso and zzso whereas the relation of zzso and waist circumference with zzso may be zzso through a relation of zzso and waist circumference with zzso zzso
