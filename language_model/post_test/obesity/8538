Notwithstanding some controversy regarding the benefits of screening zzso it is generally assumed that the effects are the same for women of all zzso zzso Yet evidence for its efficacy from clinical trial studies comes primarily from the study of white zzso It is likely that zzso is equally zzso in white and African American women when applied under relatively optimal clinical trial conditions, but in actual practice African Americans may not be receiving equal benefit, as reflected in their later stage at diagnosis and greater zzso 

zzso searches of zzso using search terms related to screening zzso race, and other selected topics were supplemented with national data that are routinely published for cancer zzso zzso that potentially compromise the benefits of zzso as it is delivered in the current health care system to African American women were zzso 

While there have been significant improvements in zzso screening zzso zzso data suggest that African American women may still not be receiving the full zzso Potential explanatory factors include low use of repeat zzso inadequate followup for abnormal zzso higher prevalence of obesity and, zzso breast density, and other zzso factors that contribute to younger age at zzso 

Further study of zzso factors that may contribute to limited zzso efficacy and poorer breast cancer outcomes in African American women is zzso In addition, strategies to increase repeat zzso screening and to ensure that women obtain needed followup of abnormal zzso may increase early detection and improve survival among African zzso Notwithstanding earlier age at diagnosis for African American women, zzso screening before age 40 years is not recommended, but screening of women aged zzso years is particularly zzso
