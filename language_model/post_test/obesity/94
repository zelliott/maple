zzso metabolism was studied in zzso and obese subjects by measurement of zzso and its zzso derivatives in plasma and zzso When first fed an zzso zzso diet, both groups showed a decrease in plasma total zzso primarily due to a decrease in the free zzso zzso zzso free zzso zzso also fell zzso When zzso was zzso plasma total zzso concentration zzso This was the net result of a rapid increase in zzso and zzso zzso and a delayed decrease in free zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso increased parallel to rising plasma zzso whereas free zzso zzso first decreased and then tended to increase zzso Both plasma and urinary zzso zzso correlated with zzso All of these changes were reversed by zzso in the obese even with a zzso zzso zzso zzso subjects also developed zzso significantly more slowly than did zzso subjects, yet demonstrated substantially the same changes in magnitude and direction in zzso and its zzso
