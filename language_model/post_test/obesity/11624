A study of blood pressure levels of zzso rural zzso schoolchildren age zzso years showed that blood pressure increases with zzso The association between age and blood pressure is decreased when growth is controlled for in the zzso Girls tended to have either the same or slightly higher mean blood pressure levels at all ages than zzso The main zzso of blood pressure in the children were age, height and zzso Mean zzso blood pressure zzso values of the children were lower than those for zzso American and worldwide adolescents of comparable age, whereas mean zzso blood pressure values were similar to those of American and worldwide adolescents of comparable zzso The associations between blood pressure and the three zzso commonly used to measure relative zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were only significant for zzso after adjusting for zzso suggesting that the other two zzso may not be appropriate in studies zzso on children and should be applied with zzso The zzso associations observed between blood pressure and the other two zzso zzso may be attributed to the almost zzso of obesity in this sample of zzso 

A researcher used data on zzso zzso year old children from 2 rural primary schools in zzso collected between October zzso 1988 to learn blood pressure levels in health school age children and to see of an association between blood pressure and age, sex, zzso and weight zzso zzso blood pressure increased gradually with age zzso but when the researcher controlled for growth, the association between age and blood pressure zzso zzso blood pressure zzso and zzso blood pressure zzso of girls either remained the same or were higher than those of boys which may be explained by hormonal and other changes during zzso Age, zzso and weight were the leading zzso of blood pressure zzso The zzso children's mean zzso levels stood lower than those of Nigerian and US children of comparable age and those from children worldwide of comparable age, but zzso levels paralleled those of US and worldwide zzso After the researcher adjusted for zzso blood pressure was only significant with weight for length zzso but not with the other zzso used to measure relative obesity zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus these 2 other zzso may not be zzso to studies on zzso Further the zzso of blood pressure with these other 2 zzso may indicate limited obesity among these zzso
