To investigate the risk of cardiovascular disease by measuring carotid zzso thickness zzso and to evaluate the diameters and blood flow volume of zzso arteries using zzso ultrasound and the possible contribution of zzso that exists in these zzso 

We zzso studied 64 Caucasian women aged zzso years zzso with zzso zzso syndrome zzso and 33 healthy zzso Patients were classified according to body mass index into obese zzso 27 zzso zzso All subjects were examined with ultrasound to measure zzso and blood flow volume and diameters of zzso zzso 

A significant difference between the two groups in zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and diameters of zzso arteries zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso and left, zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso were found, zzso zzso and total flow volumes of the zzso arteries zzso were significantly lower in the zzso group than in the control group zzso zzso zzso Compared to the control group, diameters of right and left VA decreased zzso zzso 

The results of this study suggest that zzso in obese zzso patients affects carotid and zzso system arteries wall zzso zzso vascular impairment with zzso excess should determine early examination of zzso system with zzso All patients with zzso must be routinely examined using color zzso ultrasound to measure zzso carotid and zzso zzso and diameters and blood flow volume of zzso zzso
