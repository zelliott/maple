The present study was aimed at evaluating the feasibility and reliability of lower limb skeletal muscle zzso mass estimates obtained by zzso analysis zzso zzso estimates were compared with the estimates obtained by zzso X-ray zzso zzso Ten normal weight and 10 obese women had zzso and zzso zzso Lower limb zzso mass was then derived from zzso zzso lean soft tissue zzso Lower limb zzso mass and zzso distribution were also estimated from zzso modeling that fits measured resistance values along the zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso in normal weight subjects and zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso in obese zzso Mean zzso zzso of the absolute value of the relative error was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the two groups, zzso Similar results were obtained by using five resistance values for the zzso In conclusion, the proposed zzso model provides an adequate means of evaluating zzso zzso zzso
