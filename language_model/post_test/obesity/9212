Recently, there has been an increase in the prevalence of coronary risk factors, such as diabetes and zzso in Japan; however, it is unclear whether this has resulted in an increased zzso of acute zzso zzso zzso We investigated the relationship between risk factors changes and zzso zzso in a Japanese zzso 

Trends in zzso zzso zzso 100,000 zzso were examined using data from the zzso zzso zzso from 1993 to zzso We included zzso patients with a zzso zzso zzso zzso The prevalence of coronary risk factors was investigated in three age groups of zzso patients zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the periods zzso zzso and zzso zzso risk factors were further compared between recently registered zzso patients and zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso of zzso increased significantly in men, but not in zzso Younger men particularly showed a significant increase in the zzso of zzso The prevalence of hypertension and diabetes increased in both zzso however, the prevalence of treatment for risk factors was significantly lower in men than zzso Younger men showed significant increases in obesity and zzso zzso risk factors associated with the zzso syndrome had accumulated among younger zzso We revealed that hypertension, diabetes, zzso and current smoking were independent risk factors for zzso 

The zzso rate for zzso increased significantly in men, especially younger zzso Preventive care for risk factors associated with zzso syndrome, in addition to conventional risk factors, may be required in younger zzso
