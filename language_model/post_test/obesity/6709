The obese zzso rat zzso zzso is a good animal model for zzso zzso zzso neuroendocrine and inflammatory zzso The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of zzso zzso on the release of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso from zzso as well as the effect of habitual exercise zzso zzso for 35 zzso at zzso for zzso all of them using lean zzso rats zzso zzso as reference zzso zzso were determined by zzso in the zzso of zzso cultured for zzso zzso zzso CO2 and zzso zzso in presence or absence of zzso zzso Both the spontaneous and zzso release of zzso and zzso were higher in sedentary obese zzso rats than in healthy zzso rats (a significant lower spontaneous production of zzso was also found in the zzso zzso While the zzso release of zzso was higher in the exercised obese zzso rats, the zzso production of zzso was lower compared with zzso zzso In addition, zzso has an zzso role on the release of zzso and zzso (with respect to the spontaneous zzso in both lean and obese zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso zzso the zzso production by zzso from lean and exercised obese animals, but promotes zzso release in the sedentary obese zzso In conclusion, an altered inflammatory response of zzso zzso by zzso is underlying in zzso and this regulation is improved after regular exercise, particularly on zzso
