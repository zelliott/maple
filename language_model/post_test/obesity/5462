zzso normal and dysfunctional energy regulation and body weight regulation requires neural evaluation of the signals involved in the control of food intake within a zzso as well as signals related to the availability of stored zzso Work from our laboratory has focused on peripheral and central nervous system studies of behavior and physiology designed to improve our understanding of the role of zzso communication in the control of food intake and energy zzso zzso administration of nutrients reduces subsequent meal size, suggesting a potent role for peripheral zzso sensing in the negative feedback control of zzso zzso zzso nerves supply gastrointestinal sites zzso during food zzso and these nerves are responsive to mechanical and zzso chemical properties of zzso zzso In addition, the presence of nutrients in these gastrointestinal sites stimulates the release of peptides that affect energy zzso These gut peptides also zzso the activity of peripheral gastrointestinal sensory nerves in ways that may contribute to their effects on food zzso In the central nervous system, zzso hormones and their downstream zzso have been shown to work at both zzso and zzso sites to affect food intake and zzso zzso recent data has shown that zzso hormones acting in the brain increase the behavioral and neural potency of feeding zzso gastrointestinal zzso These data support the suggestion that zzso to zzso hormones in obesity may be characterized by zzso in their ability to zzso the neural processing of food signals important in determining how much food is consumed during a zzso
