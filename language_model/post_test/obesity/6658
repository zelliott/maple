To evaluate whether the duration of the active phase of labor is associated with maternal body mass index zzso in zzso women with spontaneous onset of zzso 

Historical prospective cohort study including zzso zzso women with a singleton pregnancy and a spontaneous onset of labor, who delivered between January 1, 1995 and December 31, zzso Data were collected from the zzso Revision South registry, a regional zzso database in Southern zzso Women were zzso into six classes of zzso zzso and obese women were compared to normal weight women regarding duration of active zzso zzso were made for year of delivery, maternal age and infant birth zzso 

The median duration of labor was significantly longer in obese women zzso I obesity zzso zzso zzso zzso class II obesity zzso zzso zzso zzso and class III obesity zzso 40) zzso zzso compared to zzso women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The risk of labor lasting more than zzso increased with increasing maternal zzso OR zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso risk of labor lasting more than zzso or emergency zzso section within zzso compared to zzso deliveries within zzso increased with increasing maternal zzso zzso of the second stage of labor was significantly shorter in obese zzso in class III obesity the median value was zzso h compared to normal weight women, zzso h zzso zzso 

In zzso women with a spontaneous onset of labor, duration of the active phase of labor increased significantly with increasing maternal zzso Once obese women reach the second stage they deliver more quickly than normal weight women, which implies that the risk of prolonged labor is restricted to the first stage of zzso It is clinically important to consider the prolonged first stage of labor in obese women, for example when diagnosing first stage labor arrest, in order to zzso management of this rapidly growing zzso group of zzso Thus, it might be reasonable to adapt the considered upper limit for duration of labor, according to maternal zzso
