Physical activity zzso adoption is essential for obesity prevention and control, yet ethnic minority women report lower levels of PA and are at higher risk for obesity and its zzso compared to zzso zzso studies and zzso models of health behavior suggest that built environmental factors are associated with health behaviors like zzso but few studies have examined the association between built environment attribute zzso and zzso and no known studies have examined attribute zzso and PA zzso 

The purpose of this study was to associate the degree of zzso between directly and indirectly measured built environment attributes with changes in PA over time among African American and Hispanic zzso women participating in a PA zzso 

Women (N zzso zzso completed measures of PA at Time 1 zzso and Time 2 zzso environmental data collected at zzso were used to zzso zzso between directly and indirectly measured built environment zzso The association between changes in PA and the degree of zzso between each directly and indirectly measured environmental attribute was assessed using repeated measures zzso 

There were no significant associations between built environment attribute zzso values and change in zzso or zzso measured zzso zzso PA significantly increased over time zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso but this increase did not vary by ethnicity or any built environment attribute zzso zzso 

Built environment attribute zzso may not be associated with PA changes over time among minority zzso In an effort to promote zzso investigators should clarify specific built environment attributes that are important for PA adoption and whether accurate perceptions of these attributes are necessary, particularly among the vulnerable population of minority zzso
