zzso zzso pulmonary disease zzso has been recognized as a zzso component zzso Currently, limited data are available about determining factors of systemic inflammation in zzso in particular zzso protein zzso The aim was to determine whether and to what extent COPD patients with a low, high or obese body mass index zzso are more likely to have elevated zzso levels compared to zzso COPD zzso Furthermore, we aimed to explore the effects of clinically relevant zzso on the likelihood of having elevated zzso zzso 

In 628 elderly patients with moderate to severe COPD zzso zzso lung function and zzso were assessed before entering pulmonary zzso In addition, blood was collected in the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was classified zzso normal, zzso zzso zzso and highly zzso 

zzso COPD patients zzso or zzso zzso were zzso times more likely zzso zzso zzso zzso to have highly elevated zzso levels compared to normal weight zzso zzso zzso COPD patients after taking clinically relevant zzso into zzso In contrast, COPD patients with a low zzso zzso zzso were 2 times less likely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to have highly elevated zzso levels compared to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is associated with highly elevated zzso levels in patients with zzso These findings are suggestive for an zzso systemic inflammation in zzso
