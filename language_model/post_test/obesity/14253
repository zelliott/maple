To examine relationships between speed of eating and insulin zzso 

zzso study of zzso male zzso age and zzso zzso y and zzso zzso and zzso female zzso y and zzso zzso zzso Japanese civil servants, zzso zzso and zzso manual laborers, using a zzso questionnaire on zzso factors and diet history with self-assessment of zzso speed of eating and energy intake over a zzso zzso We measured zzso blood zzso and insulin zzso and calculated insulin resistance using the zzso model assessment of insulin zzso zzso 

zzso correlated with eating rate in both zzso and with daily energy intake in zzso Multiple zzso analysis of log zzso by zzso speed of eating, adjusting for age, energy intake and lifestyle factors showed a statistically significant gradual increase in zzso with increases in relative eating rate in men zzso for zzso and in women zzso zzso for zzso this positive relationship appeared only in men zzso 

Our results suggest that eating fast is independently associated with insulin resistance in middle-aged Japanese men and zzso
