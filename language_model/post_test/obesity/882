We measured plasma zzso acid together with insulin, zzso pancreatic zzso zzso and zzso zzso after the zzso of a protein meal in lean and obese zzso The zzso plasma zzso acid levels were similar in both zzso The zzso increase in the plasma zzso acid levels in the obese subjects was only zzso of that in the lean zzso The mean zzso and peak zzso plasma insulin levels were significantly higher zzso and 165 zzso in the obese group than in the lean group zzso and 115 zzso P less than zzso The zzso rise in plasma zzso was largely attenuated in the obese subjects, and there was no difference in plasma zzso and zzso levels in the 2 zzso To further evaluate the role of circulating zzso acids on pancreatic zzso function in obese and lean subjects, an zzso acid mixture consisting of 15 zzso acids was infused zzso During the infusion the plasma zzso acid levels were comparable in both zzso Plasma insulin rose by 36 zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso (5 zzso 1 zzso in the lean and 129 zzso 22 zzso (18 zzso 3 zzso in the obese subjects, whereas plasma zzso zzso and zzso levels were similar in both zzso In view of the zzso greater insulin responses in the obese subjects, it is likely that circulating zzso acids contribute to their zzso in spite of the reduced zzso rise of zzso acids in this group zzso Thus, under zzso conditions zzso acids have to be considered as an important regulatory component of zzso insulin release in obese zzso
