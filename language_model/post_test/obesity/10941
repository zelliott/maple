Long chain fatty acid transport is selectively zzso in zzso of zzso fatty rats, diverting fatty acids from sites of zzso toward storage in zzso zzso To determine whether this is a general feature of zzso we studied zzso zzso by zzso and zzso from 1) zzso male obese zzso diabetic zzso fat zzso and zzso zzso mice and from 2) male Harlan zzso rats fed for 7 weeks a diet containing zzso of calories from zzso zzso and zzso were compared with controls of the appropriate background strain zzso or zzso or diet zzso of calories from zzso zzso for zzso fatty acid zzso was increased zzso in zzso zzso fat, and tub mice versus controls zzso zzso whereas no differences were seen in the corresponding zzso Similar changes occurred in zzso zzso Of three membrane fatty acid zzso expressed in zzso plasma membrane fatty zzso protein zzso was increased zzso in zzso and zzso which lack a competent zzso zzso system, but was not increased in fat and tub, zzso in strains with normal zzso signaling zzso fatty acid zzso zzso was increased zzso in tub, zzso and fat zzso but not in zzso zzso and only marginal changes in fatty acid transport protein 1 zzso were found in any of the zzso zzso zzso fatty acid zzso is generally increased in zzso obesity models, but zzso of individual zzso depends on the specific zzso zzso may normally zzso expression of plasma membrane fatty acid binding zzso
