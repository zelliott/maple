We previously showed in female rats that administration of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced energy intake by selectively decreasing consumption of a palatable dietary option in comparison to a standard maintenance zzso In the present study we sought to zzso these findings to zzso We presented 6 week old female zzso mice with daily 8 h access to a sugar fat whip dietary option along with ad zzso access to moist zzso Mice were injected daily with either vehicle zzso parts zzso zzso and zzso 2 zzso or one of three doses of zzso zzso 3, or 10 zzso Food intake and body weight were measured daily for 21 zzso Although 8 h access to sugar fat whip did not induce overconsumption in female mice, zzso reduced their energy intake and body weight in a zzso zzso The decrease in energy intake occurred for both zzso and sugar fat zzso This difference from results in rats suggests that the effect of zzso on palatable food intake may only be evident in models that induce overconsumption and/or that rats and mice may react differently to zzso zzso zzso
