zzso zzso the loss of lean body mass that affects a large proportion of patients with chronic heart failure, is associated with increased morbidity and zzso The zzso of cardiac zzso is complex and zzso but recent studies are providing new information that is helping to clarify the zzso and new targets for zzso 

New attention is being paid to developing a definition as well as a clinically relevant way to diagnose this zzso The adverse clinical effects of zzso are being emphasized by new research on the obesity paradox, suggesting that cardiac zzso is such a zzso process that obesity actually zzso a survival zzso This information is useful in developing practical approaches to managing body weight and lean tissue in chronic heart failure patients and may provide therapeutic zzso New mechanisms and pathways that mediate cardiac zzso are being identified and appear to act by increasing energy requirements, reducing energy zzso zzso zzso zzso and causing zzso zzso 

Recent studies have helped to better delineate zzso mechanisms in the zzso of cardiac zzso that may lead to more effective treatments to address this common and important syndrome in patients with chronic heart zzso
