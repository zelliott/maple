zzso plasma activity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and fat and muscle activity of zzso were measured in neutered lean and obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis factor a zzso zzso were measured in muscle and fat tissue with real-time zzso using zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso plasma and fat activity and fat zzso levels were significantly lower zzso 80, and zzso zzso in obese cats than lean zzso whereas the zzso ratio of zzso was significantly higher in obese compared to lean zzso The activity of zzso was not different between the zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were significantly higher in obese than lean zzso The level of fat zzso also was significantly higher in obese cats than in lean zzso whereas the level in muscle was not zzso The lower zzso activity and zzso expression in fat and the higher zzso and zzso zzso expression in muscle in obese cats compared to lean cats zzso favor a zzso of fatty acids from fat to muscle tissue where they can be deposited or used for energy in times of zzso zzso necrosis factor alpha may regulate this zzso process through suppression of zzso zzso
