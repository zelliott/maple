The effect of zzso stimulation by infusion of zzso zzso or zzso blockade by infusion of zzso zzso on insulin and zzso zzso was studied in normal lean subjects during zzso and zzso zzso stimulation led to a slight zzso increase and zzso blockade to a slight, zzso suppression of both zzso and zzso No modification of the insulin zzso pattern was observed under either condition during zzso The effect of zzso infusion on zzso plasma insulin and zzso was subsequently studied in 11 obese patients and 10 lean zzso zzso antagonism by zzso led to a transient zzso suppression of zzso and insulin in lean subjects, but to a zzso sustained suppression of these hormones in obese zzso zzso and zzso levels were however, not suppressed to control values after zzso administration in obese zzso A positive correlation was found between zzso plasma insulin and zzso suppression of insulin attained during the 30 zzso following administration of zzso It is concluded that part of the zzso observed in human obesity is under the control of the zzso nervous zzso An abnormal balance between sympathetic zzso and zzso zzso tones on insulin zzso as observed in the zzso zzso zzso might be present in human zzso
