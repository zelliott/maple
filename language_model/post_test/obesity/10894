We sought to compare zzso and zzso complications among zzso zzso grand zzso and zzso zzso 

One hundred zzso zzso zzso 314 grand zzso and 2195 zzso who were delivered of their infants between 1988 and 1998 were selected for the zzso To facilitate comparison, the patients were zzso years old and had similar socioeconomic zzso 

The zzso of zzso at the time of delivery, maternal zzso zzso zzso delivery, and zzso zzso fluid increased with higher parity, whereas the rate of excessive weight gain and zzso delivery zzso Compared with grand zzso zzso zzso had significantly elevated risks for abnormal amounts of zzso fluid, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but lower rates of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pregnancy, and low zzso scores was significantly higher in grand zzso than in zzso whereas the proportion of zzso zzso delivery, and total labor complications was significantly lower than in the zzso group zzso zzso Similar frequency of maternal diabetes, infection, zzso wall zzso zzso variations in fetal heart rate, fetal death, and zzso mortality was found in the 3 zzso 

Both zzso groups have their own risk factors, but the rate of some complications decreases with higher zzso In addition, zzso mortality remains low in these patients, and therefore, under satisfactory socioeconomic and health care conditions, high parity should not be considered zzso
