zzso consumption as the only zzso source results in little increase in plasma zzso and insulin zzso when compared with zzso Lower insulin might promote zzso zzso during meal zzso which may facilitate fat zzso 

The objective was to test the hypothesis that consumption of an zzso zzso zzso drink will result in higher rates of zzso and fat zzso than consumption of a zzso drink in obese zzso and zzso zzso 

Seven healthy, obese, exclusively zzso women and 7 healthy, obese, zzso women were studied on 2 occasions according to a randomized, zzso zzso zzso zzso received drinks providing zzso of the daily estimated energy requirement, of which zzso was either zzso or zzso The primary outcomes were the rate of appearance zzso of zzso and zzso and the secondary outcomes were zzso zzso milk production, energy zzso and zzso zzso 

Plasma zzso and insulin zzso were lower zzso zzso and those of zzso zzso free fatty zzso and zzso were higher zzso zzso during zzso than during zzso feeding in both zzso and zzso zzso During zzso zzso zzso zzso was lower zzso zzso and zzso zzso and free fatty acid zzso were higher zzso zzso in both zzso During zzso feeding in all women combined, fat zzso was higher zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso was lower zzso zzso Milk production, energy zzso and zzso zzso were similar between zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso consumption is associated with higher zzso fat zzso and zzso during meal zzso zzso studies are required to determine whether zzso as an exclusive zzso source would promote body fat loss in obese zzso
