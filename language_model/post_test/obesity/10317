We have previously shown that skeletal muscle zzso are rapidly recruited by zzso doses of insulin in both humans and zzso This zzso zzso and insulin delivery to muscle, thus zzso zzso zzso In obese rats, both zzso zzso recruitment and zzso zzso are zzso however, this action of insulin has not been studied in obese zzso Here we used contrast ultrasound to measure zzso blood volume zzso (an index of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso muscles of lean and obese adults before and after a zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We also measured zzso artery flow, zzso zzso profile, and zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso insulin (79 zzso 11 zzso 38 zzso 6 zzso P zzso zzso and percent body fat (44 zzso 2 zzso 25 zzso zzso P zzso zzso were higher in the obese than the lean zzso After 2 h of insulin infusion, zzso zzso infusion rate was significantly lower in the obese versus lean group zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, P zzso Compared with zzso insulin increased zzso in the lean zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not in the obese group zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso artery diameter and flow in the lean but not in the obese zzso We observed a zzso negative correlation between zzso and zzso (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso in response to zzso In conclusion, obesity eliminated the zzso muscle zzso recruitment and increased zzso artery blood flow seen in lean zzso
