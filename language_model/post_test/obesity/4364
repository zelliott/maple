A genetic study was carried out among obese and zzso individuals from India to assess zzso association, if any, at three candidate zzso zzso B zzso zzso and two zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso has also been made to find out whether zzso length attrition is associated with hypertension and obese zzso 

zzso blood samples were collected from 37 normal, 35 obese and 47 zzso zzso zzso DNA was extracted from peripheral blood zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso were achieved using locus specific zzso zzso of zzso zzso was performed using zzso zzso gel zzso zzso followed by silver zzso whereas zzso and zzso zzso were zzso using zzso Express DNA zzso zzso length was determined using a recently developed real time based quantitative zzso where the relative zzso length was determined by calculating the relative ratio of zzso zzso and single copy gene zzso zzso products which is expressed as zzso zzso 

All the three zzso are highly zzso display high zzso and conform to zzso equilibrium zzso zzso zzso displayed 14 zzso whereas zzso and zzso zzso zzso were having 9 and 17 zzso zzso Interestingly two new zzso (9 and 11 zzso were detected at zzso locus for the first zzso The zzso at zzso locus were classified as Class I zzso zzso zzso zzso and Class II zzso zzso zzso zzso Higher zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 at zzso and zzso zzso zzso and 224 zzso at zzso zzso have shown zzso association with zzso zzso After adjusting the influence of age and zzso the analysis of zzso zzso revealed the relative zzso length zzso zzso in zzso individuals to be zzso zzso zzso which was significantly different zzso zzso from obese zzso zzso zzso and normal zzso zzso zzso zzso However, no significant difference in the relative zzso length was observed among male and female individuals, although age related decrease in zzso length was observed in these limited sample zzso 

The present study revealed that zzso association at zzso zzso zzso zzso and loss of zzso length may have strong genetic association with zzso zzso However, further study on larger sample size is needed to draw firm zzso
