We conducted a retrospective study of zzso zzso patients and 37 diabetic patients who underwent heart transplantation from July 1982 to May zzso zzso survival was similar for both groups of patients at 1 year zzso versus zzso and at 2 years zzso versus zzso Because we were interested in long-term results, we further analyzed only those patients surviving more than 1 year after transplantation zzso zzso patients and 29 diabetic zzso Mean follow-up for the zzso patients was zzso zzso zzso months and for the diabetic patients, zzso zzso zzso zzso The respective mean age in each group was zzso zzso zzso years and zzso zzso zzso zzso No difference was observed between the zzso patients and diabetic patients regarding the rejection rate per zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso episodes per zzso the infection rate per zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso episodes per zzso or zzso function as evidenced by mean zzso levels at 1, 2, and 3 zzso Twelve patients were zzso before zzso and 1 year after zzso they required an insulin dose zzso times greater than the dose before zzso zzso artery disease developed in zzso of the zzso patients, compared with zzso of the diabetic patients by the fourth year of zzso Despite the need for increased insulin doses, the diabetic patients had similar long-term survival to that of the zzso patients, without an increased risk of zzso infection, zzso dysfunction, or coronary artery zzso Our experience supports the feasibility of heart transplantation in selected diabetic zzso
