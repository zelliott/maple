To investigate whether the zzso agent zzso affected body weight and associated zzso in overweight and obese zzso mass index zzso zzso Type 2 diabetic patients on zzso zzso 

A randomized, zzso trial was undertaken in zzso patients with stable zzso control on chronic zzso zzso Patients were placed on moderate caloric restriction and received treatment with either zzso (15 zzso or zzso for 6 zzso 

zzso of 69 zzso and zzso zzso patients completed the zzso Both groups showed progressive weight zzso At the end of the trial weight loss was two times greater in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso plus minus zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso There was a trend for more patients to zzso zzso of initial body weight in the zzso group than zzso zzso zzso zzso and waist circumference zzso zzso were also decreased to a greater extent by zzso Mean reductions in zzso were commensurate with weight loss in both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso was well tolerated with only two patients withdrawn due to potentially drug-related serious adverse events zzso 

zzso in conjunction with moderate caloric zzso enhances weight loss and reduces waist circumference in overweight and obese Type 2 diabetic patients receiving zzso zzso This is associated with additional improvements in zzso control in a limited number of patients zzso or zzso zzso of their baseline body zzso
