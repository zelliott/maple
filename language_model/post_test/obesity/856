zzso immune function linked to obesity has been shown in both human and animal zzso The purpose of this work was to evaluate the effects of a zzso energy restriction zzso of total energy zzso on immune function in previously zzso zzso overweight zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the number of zzso T helper cells were significantly zzso zzso elevated in control and overweight zzso rats as compared with groups fed ad zzso zzso The zzso response of zzso to zzso and zzso A from overweight rats after energy restriction was significantly zzso zzso higher compared to overweight zzso zzso The zzso activity of natural killer cells tended to be lower in overweight rats compared to zzso Finally, control rats under the dietary deprivation period presented higher levels of zzso protein 2 zzso and lower levels of zzso zzso zzso compared with the reference control zzso These results suggest that energy restriction is able to zzso at least in part, the impaired immune response commonly observed in overweight zzso
