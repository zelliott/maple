The mechanisms by which zzso obesity cause zzso and cardiac dysfunction are still zzso zzso collagen and zzso zzso are important in the development of left zzso zzso and are essential to the zzso and zzso changes associated with zzso Thus, the zzso of collagen and zzso damage may contribute to cardiac dysfunction in zzso The purpose of the present study was to investigate cardiac function in a rat model of zzso obesity and to test the hypothesis that cardiac dysfunction induced by obesity is related to zzso collagen deposition and zzso zzso zzso male zzso rats were fed standard zzso zzso and zzso diets zzso zzso for 15 zzso zzso function was evaluated by zzso and isolated left zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed by zzso and electron zzso Compared with C rats, zzso rats had increased body fat, zzso blood pressure and area under the curve for zzso zzso and insulin plasma zzso zzso indexes indicated that zzso rats had increased left zzso mass, increased zzso stress and depressed zzso zzso Analysis of the isolated zzso muscle was consistent with higher zzso zzso in zzso compared with C zzso The zzso rats had an increase in zzso collagen and marked zzso changes compared with C zzso zzso promotes pathological cardiac zzso with zzso dysfunction and an increase in zzso zzso which, in turn, is probably related to zzso zzso and cardiac zzso zzso also causes damage to zzso zzso but its effect on zzso function needs to be further zzso
