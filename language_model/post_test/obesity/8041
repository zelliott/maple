To estimate the risk of zzso delivery due to excess zzso body mass index zzso in a zzso US zzso zzso 

We analyzed data from the zzso zzso zzso Assessment Monitoring System zzso on zzso zzso women with single, term infants delivered between 1998 and 2000 in 19 zzso We calculated zzso from zzso weight and zzso We assessed interactions between zzso zzso and other risk zzso We estimated weighted relative risks and zzso confidence intervals for the association between zzso zzso and zzso section from multiple zzso zzso models adjusting for demographic and medical risk factors from the zzso questionnaire or birth zzso 

The zzso of zzso delivery increased with increased zzso zzso from zzso zzso standard error zzso for lean women zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso for very obese women zzso or zzso zzso The risk of zzso section differed by presence of any zzso labor and/or delivery zzso Among women with any complication, the estimated adjusted zzso for zzso delivery was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso among overweight women, zzso zzso zzso zzso among obese women, and zzso zzso zzso zzso among very obese women compared with normal weight zzso Among women without any zzso the estimated adjusted zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso among overweight women, zzso zzso zzso zzso among obese women, and zzso zzso zzso zzso among very obese zzso 

Excess zzso weight increases the risk of zzso delivery among zzso women giving birth to single, term zzso especially among very obese women without any zzso
