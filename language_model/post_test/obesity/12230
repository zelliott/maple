To estimate and compare the zzso of overweight, zzso zzso and diabetes among a nationally representative sample of zzso zzso white and black adults, and by zzso for zzso 

The zzso zzso data sets were zzso zzso zzso models were used to zzso prevalence ratios and their respective zzso confidence intervals to assess the relationships of zzso and zzso with zzso overweight, zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

Mexican Americans had a higher prevalence of overweight than white zzso and Black zzso zzso was significantly more prevalent among the most zzso Mexican Americans but not the least zzso In contrast, the least zzso Mexican Americans had the highest prevalence of zzso The prevalence of zzso was higher among Mexican Americans than white zzso and black zzso The most zzso Mexican Americans had a higher prevalence of diabetes and the prevalence of zzso was elevated in less zzso Mexican zzso In both zzso and adjusted models, the less zzso were significantly more likely to be overweight and significantly less likely to be obese, compared to more zzso Mexican Americans, and zzso was not associated with diabetes or zzso in adjusted zzso 

Our results suggest that obesity was less prevalent among the least zzso zzso but overweight was more zzso
