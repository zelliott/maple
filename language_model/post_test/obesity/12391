The impact of zzso gastric bypass zzso and sleeve zzso zzso on obesity and zzso diseases is zzso Up to now, the technical descriptions of these techniques in zzso have not been very zzso 

For zzso and zzso operating time, learning curve, and zzso mortality in relation to weight of the rat and type of zzso were zzso Furthermore, a review of the literature on experimental approaches towards zzso and zzso in rats was carried out, merging in a detailed technical description for both zzso 

The data presented here revealed that the mean operating time for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was shorter than for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There is a learning curve for both procedures, resulting in a reduced operating time of up to zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso However, with increased weight, operating time increases to about 80 zzso for zzso and about 120 zzso for zzso zzso rats have an increased zzso mortality rate of up to zzso After gaseous zzso the mortality can be even zzso The literature search revealed 40 papers dealing with zzso and zzso in zzso 18 articles zzso contained neither photographs nor zzso 14 articles zzso did not mention the applied type of zzso The mortality rate was described in 15 papers zzso 

Experimental obesity surgery in rats is zzso Because of the high mortality in obese rats operated under gaseous zzso exercises to establish the techniques should be performed in small rats using zzso zzso
