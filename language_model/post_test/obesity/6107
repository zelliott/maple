The zzso syndrome has been suggested as a unifying link between a zzso lifestyle and an increased prostate cancer zzso 

We assessed the associations of components of the zzso syndrome with prostate cancer in a prospective cohort based on zzso Norwegian men followed up for prostate cancer zzso and mortality from zzso to the end of 2005 in the second zzso zzso Health Study zzso zzso 

During a mean zzso years zzso 687 incident prostate zzso were zzso and 110 men died from prostate zzso There was little evidence that baseline zzso waist zzso zzso ratio, total or zzso zzso presence of the zzso syndrome, diabetes, zzso use, or cardiovascular disease were associated with incident or fatal prostate zzso There was weak evidence that raised blood pressure was associated with an increased risk: for each zzso (12 zzso increase in zzso blood pressure, there was an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso increased risk of incident prostate zzso 

We found little evidence to support the hypothesis that the zzso syndrome or its components explains higher prostate cancer mortality rates in countries with a zzso diet and zzso The positive association of blood pressure with prostate cancer warrants further zzso
