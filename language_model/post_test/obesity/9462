zzso influence tissue and cell physiology in positive and negative zzso Our aim in this chapter is to briefly present on select zzso and their relationship to disease, zzso risk factors, and physical activity in zzso We discuss the association of zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso with zzso risk factors in youth, and whether circulating zzso of these zzso are different based on being physically active or engaging in exercise zzso zzso from several studies show that zzso zzso are reduced with increased zzso while others show that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso may be elevated with increased zzso zzso from studies link decreased zzso with increased insulin resistance, while some evidence links increased zzso and zzso with increased insulin zzso Several studies relate higher blood pressures to decreased zzso increased zzso and zzso zzso The only lipids associated with the zzso appear to be zzso and HDL zzso Higher levels of habitual physical activity are associated with higher zzso and perhaps decreased zzso and zzso zzso Exercise training also appears to positively influence the zzso of these zzso In conclusion, the role of these zzso is still somewhat unclear as is their associations with zzso risk zzso However, the available evidence indicates that chronic inflammatory states such as obesity in childhood are associated with a zzso profile and the presence of increased risk factors for disease while physical activity or exercise training elicit a protective role relative to this zzso
