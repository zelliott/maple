The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of daily administration of an zzso extract of the dried, immature fruit of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on body weight in zzso 

zzso was used in following zzso zzso measurement of body weight and food zzso in zzso pancreatic zzso activity zzso in zzso zzso concentration study, and measurement of zzso transit zzso 

A high dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso was administered zzso to rats for 10 zzso zzso suppressed body weight gain by zzso However, administration of zzso at a lower dose (20 zzso did not reduce weight zzso Administration of low- or high-dose zzso had no effect on food intake throughout the experimental zzso Additional experiments revealed that the zzso effect of zzso on body weight gain was not related to pancreatic zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso with a zzso emulsion did not reduce plasma zzso zzso Of interest, the high dose of zzso significantly increased the rate of zzso transit, whereas oral administration of the lower dose did zzso Control and zzso groups did not differ in zzso and serum zzso zzso or in relative organ weights after 10 weeks of high-dose zzso zzso 

zzso does not suppress body weight gain by interfering with fat zzso in a pancreatic zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on weight gain is likely due to the increased rate of zzso transit, and the zzso reduction in zzso zzso Moreover, it appears that zzso is relatively safe for long-term zzso Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that zzso daily administration of zzso successfully suppressed body weight zzso due to accelerated zzso transit and not to interference with pancreatic zzso zzso Due to its apparent long-term safety, zzso is a potential therapeutic agent for reduction of body weight in zzso
