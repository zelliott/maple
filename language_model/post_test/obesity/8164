In aged rats, insulin signaling zzso zzso is impaired in zzso that play a pivotal role in zzso zzso such as liver, skeletal muscle, and zzso zzso Moreover, the aging process is also associated with obesity and reduction in zzso synthesis from the zzso zzso and other zzso The aim of the present work was to zzso in male old obese zzso rats, the effect of zzso supplementation in the zzso analyzing the total protein amount and the zzso status zzso and zzso of the insulin cascade components in the rat zzso liver, skeletal muscle, and zzso zzso zzso zzso was administered in the drinking water for 8- and zzso during the night zzso Food and water intake and zzso blood zzso remained zzso The insulin sensitivity presented a zzso increase both after 8- and zzso of zzso zzso Animals supplemented with zzso for zzso also presented a reduction in body zzso The acute zzso zzso of the analyzed zzso proteins increased zzso and zzso after 8- and zzso of zzso zzso The total protein content of the insulin zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso 2) remained unchanged in all investigated zzso except for the zzso increase in the total amount of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso the known age-related zzso synthesis reduction may also be involved in the development of insulin resistance and the adequate supplementation could be an important alternative for the prevention of insulin signaling impairment in aged zzso
