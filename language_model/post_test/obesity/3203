zzso tissue plays a central role in the control of energy zzso through the storage and turnover of zzso and through the zzso of factors that affect zzso and fuel zzso Agents that enhance insulin sensitivity, such as zzso appear to exert their therapeutic effect through zzso zzso but the precise mechanisms of their actions are zzso zzso changes the zzso features and protein profiles of zzso in zzso zzso To examine the relevance of these effects in zzso we studied white zzso from zzso mice during the development of obesity and after treatment with zzso The levels of approximately 50% of gene transcripts zzso zzso proteins were decreased with the onset of zzso About half of those genes were zzso after treatment with zzso and this was accompanied by an increase in zzso mass and changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso mice displayed markedly enhanced oxygen consumption and significantly increased zzso zzso These data reveal zzso zzso and increased energy expenditure in white fat in response to zzso treatment in zzso and suggest that enhanced zzso zzso in this tissue may affect zzso energy zzso and insulin zzso
