zzso is associated with systemic medical conditions in adults but associations have not been well studied in zzso We investigated the association of zzso with diabetes zzso hypertension and obesity among children with and without zzso 

We performed a matched zzso study using the zzso zzso Health Information zzso zzso zzso codes identified zzso cases from 2004 to zzso Four randomly selected controls were matched by age, hospital, patient care setting and year of zzso zzso from all hospital encounters were zzso for zzso zzso zzso and multivariable conditional zzso zzso was used to assess the associations of zzso with diabetes zzso hypertension and zzso 

We identified zzso zzso cases and zzso zzso On zzso analysis stone zzso had significantly higher odds of obesity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and hypertension zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso The odds of type I diabetes zzso was lower among cases compared to controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After adjusting for zzso race, insurance type and number of visits using zzso regression, children with zzso still had higher odds of obesity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and hypertension zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as lower odds of type I diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso 

Among pediatric patients at zzso children's hospitals, zzso is associated with higher odds of obesity and hypertension and lower odds of type I diabetes zzso These findings may be helpful in further zzso the zzso of pediatric zzso
