The literature highlights two possible roles for the zzso relationship in the development of weight concern in young zzso The first is simply as a forum for modeling the mother's own concerns and the second is as an interaction between two individuals, which is either protective or zzso of weight zzso The present study aimed to assess both the modeling and the interactive zzso 

Thirty mothers and their daughters zzso zzso completed a questionnaire concerning their weight concern zzso eating and body zzso and their beliefs about aspects of their relationship zzso zzso mother's zzso projection, intimacy, mother's zzso 

The results found no support for the modeling hypothesis, with no significant correlations between the zzso and zzso aspects of weight zzso However, the results showed support for the interactive zzso In particular, the daughters were more likely to show restrained eating if their mothers reported a low belief in their own autonomy and if both the mother and daughter rated projection as important in their zzso Similarly, the daughters were more likely to show body dissatisfaction if their mothers reported a low belief in both their own and their daughter's autonomy and if they rated projection as zzso 

The results indicate that the role of the zzso relationship may be more complex than simply as a forum for modeling and are discussed in terms of the impact of aspects of the relationship on subsequent zzso
