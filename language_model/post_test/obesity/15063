The number of obese kidney transplant candidates has been zzso However, there are conflicting results regarding to the effect of obesity on kidney transplantation zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the body mass index zzso and graft survival by using continuous versus zzso zzso values as an independent risk factor in zzso zzso 

We zzso reviewed 376 kidney transplant recipients to evaluate graft and patient zzso between zzso overweight, and obese patients at the time of zzso considering zzso as a zzso zzso 

zzso patients were more likely to be male and older than zzso recipients zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso loss was significantly higher among obese compared with zzso zzso zzso patients displayed significantly lower survival compared with zzso subjects at 1 year zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso and 3 years zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso may represent an independent risk factor for graft loss and patient zzso zzso patient selection with zzso weight reduction is mandatory to reduce the rate of early zzso complications and to improve long-term zzso
