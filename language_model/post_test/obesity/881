To test the hypothesis that insulin plays a role in the zzso of obese women with zzso zzso syndrome, we conducted a prospective study in which the zzso status of five obese women with zzso zzso syndrome was assessed on two zzso before and after 10 days of oral zzso zzso zzso three times zzso zzso zzso serum insulin levels decreased from 177 zzso 45 zzso zzso to 123 zzso 43 zzso zzso less than zzso and insulin release in response to 100 g oral zzso administration decreased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso less than zzso after zzso zzso At the same time, serum total testosterone fell from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso less than zzso serum testosterone not bound to sex zzso zzso fell from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso less than zzso and the zzso ratio of serum zzso to serum zzso fell from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso less than zzso zzso sex zzso zzso levels increased slightly but not significantly from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not change, nor did zzso or zzso serum zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso in obese women with zzso zzso syndrome may directly increase serum testosterone zzso
