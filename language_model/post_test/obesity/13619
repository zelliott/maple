To zzso insulin sensitivity in lean and obese zzso zzso and examine the underlying zzso mechanisms responsible for impaired insulin action to characterize a zzso model of insulin zzso 

Twenty zzso received a zzso clamp with skeletal muscle and visceral zzso tissue zzso at baseline and at 30 and 120 zzso after zzso Genes and protein expression of key molecules involved in the insulin signaling cascade zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso changes were zzso 

Overall, zzso show a wide range of insulin sensitivity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and there is a strong inverse correlation between indexes of zzso and insulin sensitivity zzso zzso zzso P zzso for % body zzso r zzso zzso P zzso for waist zzso The genes and protein sequences analyzed were found to have approximately zzso identity to those of zzso zzso changes in key signaling molecules were impaired both in muscle and zzso tissue in obese zzso compared with lean zzso zzso 

The obese zzso is a pertinent nonhuman zzso model to examine the underlying zzso mechanisms responsible for insulin resistance and eventual development of type 2 zzso
