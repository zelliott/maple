This pilot study was designed to 1) identify zzso of difficult zzso exposure in obese patients, 2) develop strategies for efficient zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso and 3) devise zzso protocols for difficult zzso 

We undertook a retrospective study over a zzso period of 14 consecutive patients with a body mass index of more than 30 zzso who underwent zzso direct zzso under general zzso zzso of zzso weight, neck zzso zzso score, and zzso zzso of the airway were zzso zzso encountered during zzso induction and emergence were also zzso The zzso recorded on a visual analog scale the degree of difficulty encountered in obtaining a zzso zzso view and zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso challenges during difficult zzso included decreased neck extension, redundant folds of tissue in the zzso and zzso and upper airway zzso Overall, there was an association between the zzso of difficult zzso exposure and the zzso score zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso but the zzso score was of limited utility to the zzso Neck size in female patients correlated with the zzso score zzso zzso zzso Neither weight nor body mass index were zzso of a difficult zzso zzso Straight blade zzso with a zzso zzso allowed greater depth of zzso and provided the best zzso of the zzso 

An appropriate clinical examination may help predict a difficult zzso However, further studies are warranted to fully characterize the zzso zzso of a difficult zzso zzso
