The zzso protein 1 zzso zzso protein 3, is able to zzso zzso zzso production from zzso zzso thereby dissipating energy as heat and affecting the efficiency of energy zzso zzso protein 3 is expressed predominantly in skeletal muscle, and has been associated with zzso energy zzso However, on the basis of present evidence it has been concluded that the primary function of zzso protein 3 is not in the regulation of energy zzso For example, zzso an energy expenditure attenuating condition, zzso zzso protein 3 zzso and zzso protein 3 knockout mice have a normal zzso zzso The exact function of zzso protein 3 remains to be zzso but at present putative roles for zzso protein 3 include involvement in the regulation of the production of zzso oxygen species, zzso fatty acid transport and the regulation of zzso metabolism in skeletal zzso Because all these putative functions assume that zzso protein 3 affects zzso zzso a secondary effect of the function of zzso protein 3 might still be that it influences (but not zzso energy zzso consistent with observations in linkage and association zzso zzso zzso protein 3 remains an interesting target for pharmacological zzso in the treatment of obesity and zzso
