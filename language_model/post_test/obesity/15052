zzso zzso in 296 genes in regions identified through zzso mapping of hypertension, zzso and lipids were assessed for association with hypertension, blood pressure zzso zzso and zzso zzso cholesterol zzso 

This study identified coding zzso identified from zzso data that were located in genes on zzso 5, 6, 8, and 21, wherein ancestry association evidence for hypertension, zzso or zzso was identified in previous zzso mapping zzso zzso was performed in zzso unrelated African-Americans from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's Family Blood zzso Project, and zzso association analyses were conducted for hypertension, zzso zzso zzso and zzso A gene score based on the number of minor zzso of each zzso in a gene was created and used for zzso zzso zzso adjusting for age, age, sex, local marker zzso and zzso as zzso An zzso African ancestry estimated from zzso zzso markers was also adjusted for to eliminate any zzso due to population zzso 

zzso zzso on zzso 21 was associated with zzso and zzso with or without adjusting for local ancestry zzso zzso zzso on zzso 5 was associated with zzso zzso Local ancestry in these regions was associated with the respective traits as zzso 

This study suggests that zzso and zzso likely play important roles in zzso and obesity variation, zzso and these findings are consistent with those of other studies, so replication and functional analyses are zzso
