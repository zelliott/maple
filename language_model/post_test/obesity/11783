zzso individuals have zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso and zinc have zzso changes in circulating zzso We investigated their possible interaction and examined whether a difference existed between obese men and their lean zzso The results indicated the pattern of zzso change in plasma zinc and zzso did not markedly differ between the obese subjects and the lean zzso However, the obese had higher zzso and lower zinc plasma values at each sampling time than did the lean zzso Because an inverse correlation was found in plasma values between zinc and zzso zzso zzso we further determined the role zinc might play in zzso production by human subcutaneous zzso tissue from female zzso The in zzso study showed that zinc treatment zzso zzso significantly increased zzso production zzso however, this zzso did not surpass that by insulin (10 zzso The data of this study suggest an interactive connection between zinc and zzso
