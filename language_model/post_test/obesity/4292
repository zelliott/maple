We analyzed variations in surgical site infections zzso during 5 years of a prospective surveillance program and investigated possible contributors to zzso in a cohort of patients who underwent surgery for breast zzso 

All breast surgeries performed between January 2001 and December 2005 were zzso Patients were zzso by direct observation for at least 30 days under standardized zzso The main outcome studied was zzso A zzso analysis was conducted to identify zzso risk factors and to evaluate zzso variations by means of a control zzso 

During the study period, a total of zzso breast cancer surgeries were recorded, and zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso frequency varied across the zzso period, with a sharp decline seen after the introduction of preventive zzso After 2002, 3 zzso limits of zzso were observed, 2 related to the use of zzso systems and 1 associated with a group of rotating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso or zzso 58 years zzso zzso zzso to zzso body mass zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and duration of zzso or zzso 160 minutes zzso zzso zzso to zzso were found to be zzso risk zzso 

After 5 years of a continuous prospective surveillance program, we were able to decrease the rate of zzso in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery (from zzso in 2000 to zzso in 2005), identify zzso risk factors, and improve the quality of care delivered to these zzso
