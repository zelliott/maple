To systematically appraise the evidence on measurement properties of zzso outcome measures to assess physical function in young and middle-aged people known to be at high risk of hip and/or knee zzso zzso 

Electronic searches were performed in zzso zzso Scopus and zzso in May zzso Two zzso independently rated the measurement properties using the 4-point zzso zzso Best evidence synthesis was made using zzso quality, consistency and direction of findings and sample zzso 

Twenty of zzso papers were eligible for inclusion and 24 different zzso outcome measures knee or obese populations were zzso No tests related to hip populations were zzso Twenty-five measurement properties including reliability zzso zzso construct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso measurement error (three zzso structural zzso zzso zzso zzso (one zzso and responsiveness (one zzso were zzso A positive rating was given to zzso zzso of all possible measurement zzso Tests were grouped into two categories based on the population zzso The zzso hop for distance, followed by the zzso hop and cross over hop for distance were the zzso tests for the zzso zzso Whereas the zzso walk test was the only included test for the obese zzso 

This review highlights the many gaps in knowledge about the measurement properties of zzso outcome measures for young and middle-aged people known to be at high risk of hip and/or knee zzso There is a need for consensus on which outcome measures should be used and/or combined when assessing physical function in this zzso Further good quality research is zzso
