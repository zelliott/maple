An elevated body mass index zzso has been reported to be associated with a lower rate of death after acute zzso zzso zzso However, waist circumference zzso may be a better marker of cardiovascular risk than zzso We used data from a contemporary French zzso cohort of patients with zzso to analyze the impact of zzso and zzso on death zzso 

We evaluated zzso consecutive patients with zzso Patients were classified according to zzso as normal, overweight, obese, and very obese zzso zzso 25 to zzso 30 to zzso zzso zzso zzso and as increased zzso zzso zzso for zzso or zzso Half of the patients were overweight zzso and one quarter were obese zzso or very obese zzso Increased zzso was present in half of the patients zzso Increased zzso was associated with a reduced death rate, with a zzso risk reduction for each unit increase in zzso zzso ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso In contrast, zzso as a continuous variable had no impact on zzso death zzso After adjustment for baseline zzso of death, zzso was not independently zzso of zzso The group of patients with high zzso but low zzso had increased zzso death zzso 

Neither zzso nor zzso independently predicts death after zzso Much of the inverse relationship between zzso and the rate of death after zzso is due to zzso by characteristics associated with zzso This study emphasizes the need to measure both zzso and zzso because patients with a high zzso and low zzso are at high risk of zzso
