Exposure to zzso was compared between zzso patients with a history of weight loss zzso zzso zzso and those with no weight loss or with weight gain zzso zzso zzso during a zzso follow-up zzso zzso zzso was used to develop odds ratios for weight loss zzso 

zzso who lost weight were more frequently exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso than subjects who maintained or gained weight during zzso The 158 subjects exposed to zzso were older zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso years, P zzso zzso had longer duration zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso years, P zzso zzso had greater prevalence of zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso hypertension zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and cardiovascular disease zzso zzso zzso P zzso than subjects not exposed to zzso In a zzso zzso model for weight change status, zzso exposure was significantly associated with weight status zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso an association that zzso even after controlling for age, sex, baseline body mass index, years since diagnosis, zzso therapy and zzso 

Exposure to zzso more than doubled the odds of weight loss in zzso zzso zzso of this study justify a zzso clinical trial to determine definitively the role of zzso in weight loss in subjects with zzso
