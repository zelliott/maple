zzso coronary heart diseases, zzso diabetes zzso are often present in patients with zzso sleep zzso zzso The aim of the study was to estimate the serum zzso concentration and sympathetic activity in patients with zzso sleep zzso and in control zzso 

51 persons zzso zzso were included into the zzso The control group zzso consisted of 15 zzso person (15 zzso in the age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso study group zzso consisted of 36 patients with zzso zzso zzso in the age 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was measured by zzso methods using the HUMAN zzso zzso zzso zzso Research, zzso adrenaline and zzso were measured in the serum by zzso methods zzso 

The serum zzso of zzso zzso adrenaline and zzso zzso in patients with zzso compared with control group were respectively zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was positive significant correlation between zzso concentration and zzso zzso zzso zzso and serum zzso and zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso The serum zzso concentration was significantly higher in the female zzso In the male group there was tendency to increase zzso concentration together with degree of zzso grade estimated by zzso and zzso zzso zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso vs zzso and zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso 

zzso In the group of patients with zzso the serum zzso of zzso adrenaline and zzso were higher then in control zzso zzso There are positive statistical significant correlation between serum zzso levels and zzso and serum adrenaline concentration in the study zzso zzso The serum zzso concentration was higher in the female zzso zzso There was tendency to increased zzso concentration in the study group together with degree of zzso grade estimated by zzso zzso Our results confirm correlation between zzso and sympathetic activity and their influences on obesity and degree of zzso grade in studied zzso
