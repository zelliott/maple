Type 2 diabetes is increasing at an alarming rate worldwide, and there has been a considerable effort in several laboratories to identify suitable targets for the design of drugs against the zzso To this end, the protein zzso zzso that zzso insulin signaling by zzso the insulin zzso zzso have been actively zzso This is because zzso the zzso would be expected to prolong insulin signaling and thereby facilitate zzso zzso and, presumably, result in a lowering of blood zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso therefore, has the potential to be a significant zzso zzso Several protein zzso zzso zzso have been implicated in the zzso of the zzso These zzso include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In most cases, there is evidence for and against the involvement of the zzso in insulin zzso The most convincing data, however, support a critical role for zzso in insulin zzso zzso knockout mice are not only insulin sensitive but also maintain zzso (in the fed zzso with one-half the level of insulin observed in zzso zzso Interestingly, these mice are also resistant to zzso obesity when fed a high-fat zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso knockout mouse is reproduced when the zzso is also knocked down with an zzso zzso in obese zzso Thus zzso appears to be a very attractive candidate for the design of drugs for type 2 diabetes and zzso
