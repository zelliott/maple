DNA zzso at specific zzso sites within gene promoter regions is known to regulate zzso activity in zzso In human zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene is driven primarily by the zzso promoter however the role of DNA zzso in regulating expression in ex zzso mature zzso is zzso This zzso study reports the correlation of DNA zzso within the zzso promoter region of human mature subcutaneous and zzso zzso with zzso expression and body composition zzso 

zzso and subcutaneous zzso tissue were collected from 25 obese subjects undergoing zzso surgery and the mature zzso fraction zzso DNA zzso status of 5 zzso sites within a 550 base pair region encompassing the zzso start site zzso of promoter zzso was determined using zzso Relative zzso and zzso promoter specific zzso expression was determined by zzso and whole body zzso performed in 25 zzso 

zzso DNA zzso varied from 21 zzso zzso to 81 zzso zzso In zzso zzso percentage zzso at the zzso and zzso zzso sites, but not other nearby sites, was zzso correlated with relative zzso zzso expression (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso and R zzso zzso P zzso zzso In contrast subcutaneous zzso percentage DNA zzso at the zzso and zzso sites were positively correlated with relative zzso zzso expression (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso and R zzso zzso P zzso zzso In a small subset of patients DNA zzso at the zzso site was also positively correlated with whole body lean mass, bone mineral content and zzso 

In conclusion in mature zzso the primary source of zzso after menopause, increasing DNA zzso was correlated with zzso zzso expression and thus zzso zzso These findings support a zzso zzso regulation of the zzso promoter activity in mature zzso the mechanisms influencing this regulation and its zzso role remain to be zzso
