We have studied soluble immune complexes zzso in the zzso of both zzso and zzso diabetics by a variety of zzso techniques and also by a method that detects specifically zzso zzso Our screening studies, detailed in the first section of this work, showed that zzso zzso appear not to be the only type of zzso present in zzso zzso screening tests gave practically identical percentages of positive results in zzso and zzso zzso However, the agreement between different screening tests was zzso We propose the use of zzso zzso zzso expressions of the general trend of several screening tests performed with one given serum zzso for the statistical analysis of correlations between the presence of soluble zzso and clinical evidence of diabetic zzso As expected, the use of zzso minimized false positive or zzso and considerably enhanced statistical correlations between levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso peripheral zzso and peripheral zzso The second section of this report describes our isolation studies, which provided definitive proof for the existence of soluble zzso zzso and allowed us to carry out the first successful studies of the biological properties of soluble zzso zzso from the zzso of diabetic patients, as detailed in the third section of this zzso Such zzso zzso zzso and zzso which in zzso could lead to the development of zzso zzso could explain, at least in part, the abnormalities in zzso function seen in zzso Although the precise mechanisms by which soluble zzso could induce pathological damage in diabetics have not been totally zzso we have obtained sufficient evidence to prove that zzso complexes exist in zzso are associated with higher zzso of zzso and have the capacity to interact with cells in a potentially zzso zzso
