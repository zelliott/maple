zzso is associated with an increased risk of having a pregnancy affected by a neural tube zzso zzso It is not clear whether the amount of zzso acid required by obese women to protect against zzso is the same as that for zzso zzso 

We analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition zzso Survey, representative of the zzso civilian zzso population, to assess whether body mass index zzso normal weight, overweight, and obese zzso modified the association between supplemental zzso acid intake and folate zzso We estimated the geometric mean concentration among zzso women of zzso age zzso zzso during the zzso period of: serum folate zzso red blood cell zzso folate zzso and plasma total homocysteine zzso zzso adjusted for age, race and ethnicity, and total dietary folate expressed as dietary folate zzso for strata of supplement use and zzso 

zzso was zzso associated with serum folate among women who did not use supplements containing zzso zzso no differences between women in different zzso categories were observed among supplement zzso Regardless of supplement use, obese women had the highest zzso folate zzso There were no differences in zzso by zzso regardless of supplement zzso 

These results do not support a straightforward modification of the relationship between supplemental zzso acid intake and folate status by zzso In this population, zzso may affect the body distribution of zzso as reflected by lower serum and higher zzso folate levels in obese women who do not use zzso
