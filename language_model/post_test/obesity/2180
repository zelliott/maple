The risk factor pattern underlying a parental history of zzso zzso zzso is incompletely zzso We examined whether a parental history of clinically verified early zzso may promote development of insulin resistance, obesity and the zzso syndrome zzso 

One hundred and zzso offspring to patients with clinically verified zzso before 60 years of age in the zzso prospective zzso Diet and Cancer zzso study were recruited zzso parental zzso As controls, we included 174 offspring of zzso participants without zzso during 14 years of follow-up in the zzso zzso parental zzso zzso was defined according to the National zzso Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III zzso zzso zzso guidelines, obesity as zzso greater than zzso zzso and insulin resistance as the top zzso of zzso model assessment index in the 348 included offspring zzso age 44 years, zzso zzso 

The odds ratio, zzso confidence zzso for zzso in positive parental history as compared with negative parental history was zzso zzso zzso after adjustment for age, sex, zzso zzso cholesterol zzso and zzso positive parental history was also independently associated with obesity zzso zzso zzso abdominal obesity zzso zzso zzso and insulin resistance zzso zzso zzso whereas there was no association with LDL and zzso All of these relationships were stronger in men than in zzso 

zzso history of clinically verified early zzso is associated with zzso obesity and insulin resistance rather than with traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors such as LDL and smoking, suggesting that primary preventive interventions targeted at weight reduction and improvement of insulin sensitivity may be particularly beneficial in this subset of the zzso
