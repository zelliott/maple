Body mass index zzso weight zzso zzso (in zzso and waist circumference zzso are widely used as proxy zzso measures for total zzso Little is known about what zzso power of zzso in both zzso and zzso is zzso associated with measured total body fat mass zzso zzso values for zzso would provide the information needed to create optimum zzso surrogate measures of zzso 

To estimate the value of zzso that renders zzso and zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso 

Participants of the zzso zzso surveys, zzso by sex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blacks, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We apply a grid search by increasing zzso from zzso by increments of zzso to the simple zzso models, zzso and zzso to obtain an estimate of zzso that results in the greatest zzso taking into account complex survey design features and multiply zzso zzso 

zzso for zzso are zzso for men zzso and zzso for women zzso The optimal powers zzso for weight are zzso zzso for men and zzso zzso for zzso The optimal power zzso for zzso is 0, that is, no zzso of zzso to zzso for men zzso or women zzso The optimal powers for weight across nine combinations of zzso and age groups for each sex vary slightly zzso whereas the optimal zzso powers for zzso are all 0 for both sexes except for zzso black men aged zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso with optimal powers are not independent of zzso they yield more accurate zzso estimates than zzso 

In reference to zzso zzso and zzso are the optimal zzso zzso for men and women, respectively, whereas zzso alone, without zzso adjustment, is the optimal zzso index for both zzso Thus, zzso an index independent of zzso may be less useful when predicting zzso
