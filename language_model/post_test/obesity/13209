Earlier zzso studies of the relation between physical activity and obesity are inconsistent and zzso showing a clear zzso inverse zzso and a prospective association only when physical activity at the time of follow-up is zzso 

To examine the long-term effect of leisure time physical activity zzso on subsequent development of obesity and the effect of body weight on later physical zzso in a zzso zzso setting taking into account the effects of historical changes on future changes as well as pertinent zzso 

The study included zzso women and zzso men aged zzso y selected at random within zzso strata from the general population of zzso At two surveys, 5 y apart, zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso several possible zzso and zzso factors were zzso zzso zzso as zzso or zzso zzso and zzso was assessed at the 3rd survey 10 y zzso zzso ratios (with zzso confidence zzso for developing obesity between the last two surveys were estimated by zzso zzso analysis, taking into account baseline and preceding changes in zzso and zzso A similar analysis of odds ratios for physical zzso as outcome at the 3rd survey was zzso 

Compared to physical zzso the odds ratios of development of obesity among women with medium and high level of activity were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, and among men, the odds ratios were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared to median zzso the odds ratio of later physical zzso among women with high zzso was zzso zzso zzso and among men the odds ratio was zzso zzso zzso The associations were not zzso or modified by age, pre-existing diseases, smoking, alcohol zzso educational level, occupational physical activity or by familial predisposition to zzso 

This study did not support that physical zzso as reported in the freely living adult population in the long term is associated with the development of zzso but the study indicates that obesity may lead to physical zzso
