zzso zzso zzso are persistent environmental pollutants that are zzso in the serum of all American zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 153 has the highest serum zzso zzso have been zzso associated with zzso zzso syndrome and zzso fatty liver disease zzso in zzso zzso 

The purpose of this study is to determine mechanisms by which zzso 153 worsens zzso obesity and zzso in male mice fed a high-fat diet zzso 

Male zzso mice were fed either control or zzso milk fat diet for 12 weeks with or without zzso 153 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tolerance test was performed, and plasma and zzso were obtained at zzso for zzso of zzso levels, zzso and gene zzso 

In control zzso mice, addition of zzso 153 had minimal effects on any of the measured zzso However, zzso 153 treatment in zzso mice was associated with increased visceral zzso zzso zzso and plasma zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Likewise, zzso reduced expression of zzso genes implicated in zzso while increasing the expression of genes associated with zzso zzso Regardless of diet, zzso 153 had no effect on insulin resistance or tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso 

zzso 153 is an zzso that zzso zzso zzso alters zzso and zzso normal zzso zzso metabolism when administered with zzso but not control zzso Because all US adults have been exposed to zzso zzso this particular zzso interaction potentially impacts human zzso
