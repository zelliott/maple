To examine the hypothesis that the higher rates of coronary heart disease zzso in Indians (South zzso compared with zzso and Chinese is at least partly explained by central zzso insulin resistance, and syndrome X (including possible zzso 

Cross zzso study of the general zzso 

zzso 

Random sample of 961 men and women zzso zzso and zzso aged 30 to 69 zzso 

zzso serum insulin concentration was correlated directly and strongly with body mass index zzso zzso ratio zzso and abdominal zzso The zzso insulin concentration was correlated zzso with HDL cholesterol and directly with the zzso zzso zzso blood pressures, zzso zzso inhibitor 1 zzso and tissue zzso zzso zzso but it was not correlated with LDL cholesterol, zzso B and zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso or zzso zzso zzso + zzso This indicates that the former but not the latter are part of syndrome zzso While zzso had the highest zzso Indians had a higher zzso zzso zzso and women zzso than zzso zzso zzso and women zzso and Chinese zzso zzso and women zzso In addition, Indians had higher zzso insulin values and more zzso intolerance than zzso and zzso Indians had lower HDL cholesterol, and higher zzso zzso and zzso but not higher LDL cholesterol, zzso zzso blood pressures, zzso factor zzso or zzso F1 + zzso 

Indians are more prone than zzso or Chinese to central obesity with insulin resistance and zzso intolerance and there are no apparent environmental reasons for this in zzso As a consequence, Indians develop some but not all of the features of syndrome zzso They also have higher zzso zzso All this puts Indians at increased risk of zzso and zzso and must be at least part of the explanation for their higher rates of zzso
