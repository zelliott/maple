This study examined the effect of a bout of zzso zzso exercise on the neural response to pictures of food zzso to index food zzso in zzso and obese zzso Secondary outcomes included energy intake and physical activity zzso over 24 zzso 

Using a crossover design, 18 zzso and 17 obese women completed a zzso zzso exercise bout zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso and were subsequently followed for 24 zzso This was zzso by a control day with no exercise zzso To assess the effect of exercise on food zzso participants were shown pictures of food and flowers zzso after zzso zzso activity was zzso monitored using electroencephalogram for the late positive potential zzso component of the zzso potential zzso and compared with the zzso response on the zzso zzso After testing, weighed food records were kept for the duration of each zzso PA was zzso via zzso over each zzso 

There was not a significant body mass index zzso group zzso exercise condition zzso zzso interaction for zzso zzso however, when participants were zzso the exercise condition resulted in lower zzso zzso zzso in response to food pictures than the zzso condition zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There were no differences in energy or zzso intake zzso zzso The exercise condition resulted in significantly more PA than the zzso condition, and there was a significant zzso group zzso exercise condition interaction for zzso PA zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso with obese women showing less zzso zzso 

A bout of zzso exercise decreases zzso determined food motivation zzso the zzso zzso zzso but the effect of zzso is zzso In addition, a zzso exercise bout significantly increases zzso PA; zzso zzso PA differed according to zzso
