The aim of the current study was to examine to what extent changes in reported energy intake and physical activity predict changes in body fat during a zzso zzso treatment of obesity in zzso 

Total body fat zzso reported energy intake zzso diet zzso and physical activity zzso was measured in 99 children (age zzso years, mean zzso zzso zzso zzso at baseline as well as after 6 months 2 years of zzso zzso measures zzso growth zzso and structural equation modeling zzso were applied in the data zzso 

There was significant decrease in body fat, reported energy zzso and physical activity at both zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso Changes in reported energy intake from baseline to 6 months predicted a decrease in body fat from baseline to 6 months zzso zzso zzso p zzso In addition, changes in reported energy intake had a strong indirect effect on body fat at zzso zzso zzso by changes in body fat from baseline to 6 months zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso Changes in physical activity did not predict changes in body fat during zzso 

Changes in reported energy intake significantly affected body fat at 6 months and indirectly predicted the amount of body fat at zzso zzso The indirect effect was zzso by a decrease in body fat obtained during the first phase of zzso
