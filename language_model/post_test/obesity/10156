To measure left zzso zzso diameter in zzso overweight children and to determine the variables that independently influence LA zzso 

A zzso study on 22 overweight children zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 18 control children zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso LA diameter, left zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso function were measured through zzso Data were compared between the two zzso Multiple zzso analysis, with LA diameter as dependent zzso was zzso 

In the overweight group, zzso zzso dimension, zzso mass index, peak zzso zzso ratio, Am, zzso LA diameter zzso zzso vs zzso zzso middle LA diameter zzso zzso vs zzso zzso and minimal LA diameter zzso zzso vs zzso zzso were increased and zzso ratio was zzso In multiple zzso analysis, body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in respective zzso middle, and minimal LA zzso and zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in respective zzso middle, and minimal LA zzso were significant independent zzso of all three measures of LA zzso 

LA diameter in zzso overweight children is zzso Body mass index and zzso blood pressure were significant zzso of LA zzso
