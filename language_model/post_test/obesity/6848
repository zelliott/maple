The purpose was to determine whether obesity surgery is associated with a long-term increased risk of zzso zzso 

zzso cancer risk after obesity surgery is not well zzso zzso zzso observations and human tissue zzso studies recently suggested an increased risk of zzso cancer after obesity zzso 

A nationwide retrospective zzso cohort study in Sweden was conducted in zzso The long-term risk of zzso cancer in patients who underwent obesity surgery, and in an obese no surgery zzso was compared with that of the zzso zzso and calendar zzso general background population between 1980 and zzso zzso individuals were zzso into an obesity surgery cohort and an obese no surgery zzso The standardized zzso ratio zzso with zzso confidence zzso zzso was zzso 

Of zzso obese patients, zzso constituted the obesity surgery cohort and zzso constituted the obese no surgery zzso In the obesity surgery zzso we observed 70 patients with zzso cancer, rendering an overall zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso for zzso cancer increased with length of time after surgery, with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso after 10 years or zzso In contrast, the overall zzso in the obese no surgery cohort zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and remained stable with increasing follow-up zzso 

zzso surgery seems to be associated with an increased risk of zzso cancer over zzso These findings would prompt evaluation of zzso surveillance for the increasingly large population who undergo obesity zzso
