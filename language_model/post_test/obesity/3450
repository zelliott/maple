zzso surgery using zzso techniques is the most effective treatment for zzso zzso The objective of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of a novel zzso zzso gastric restrictive zzso device in a group of obese zzso An implant was also performed in a zzso to assess implant feasibility in a zzso 

Four obese zzso dogs were subjected to zzso zzso for 3 months followed by recovery for an additional 6 weeks after device zzso Food zzso body weight, zzso zzso imaging, and gastric zzso were used to monitor zzso performance before zzso after zzso and implant zzso An additional zzso zzso zzso procedure was performed in a human zzso 

The implanted obese dogs exhibited a significant decrease in food intake and body weight over 3 months with the zzso zzso The reduction of food intake was sustained at an average of 46 % after implant and the excess weight loss reached an average of 75 % at the end of 12 weeks with recovery to approximately 78 % of baseline after 6 weeks of implant zzso zzso imaging and gastric zzso both confirmed passage for food through the restrictive device channel in the zzso The zzso device was successfully implanted zzso on the zzso stomach in less than an zzso 

The zzso device is zzso deliverable and removable with effective and sustainable weight loss over a zzso period in an obese dog zzso The implant is also technically feasible in zzso
