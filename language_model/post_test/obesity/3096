To study the relationship between childhood zzso weight loss, zzso and the zzso insulin zzso we measured the plasma zzso of zzso insulin zzso and zzso and the binding of zzso to zzso in 12 obese children with a mean age zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso years and a mean relative weight score zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and 12 zzso zzso zzso Eight obese children were re-evaluated after 1 year's participation in a weight reduction zzso The obese children had higher zzso plasma zzso of zzso zzso less than zzso and zzso zzso less than zzso and a lower zzso to zzso zzso ratio zzso less than zzso than the zzso zzso The obese children had in addition a reduced zzso insulin binding zzso less than zzso or less) over the zzso range of circulating insulin zzso There was a negative correlation zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso between the insulin zzso binding and the relative zzso The weight reduction zzso resulted in a decrease of zzso zzso zzso less than zzso in the mean relative weight zzso At the end of the therapy the obese children had lower zzso blood zzso levels zzso less than zzso and lower plasma zzso zzso at 90 zzso zzso less than zzso after an oral zzso load than at the onset of zzso There were no significant differences between the insulin binding characteristics at the zzso and at the end of the zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
