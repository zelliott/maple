zzso is associated with a blunted zzso zzso and fat zzso We investigated whether zzso in zzso 16, 27 and zzso of the beta zzso gene zzso and zzso 10 of the G protein beta zzso gene zzso are associated with zzso in in zzso zzso and fat zzso 

zzso male and 43 female overweight and obese subjects zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Energy expenditure zzso respiratory zzso zzso circulating free fatty acid zzso and zzso levels were determined after zzso infusion of increasing doses of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In women, the zzso zzso of the zzso gene was associated with a blunted increase in circulating zzso zzso and a decreased fat zzso during zzso zzso In men, the zzso zzso was significantly associated with a blunted increase in zzso but not in zzso or fat zzso 

These results suggest that genetic variation in the zzso gene is associated with disturbances in in zzso zzso zzso and fat zzso during zzso stimulation in overweight and obese zzso these effects are influenced by zzso zzso
