Lower levels of child zzso fitness were associated with increased odds of adult obesity zzso odds ratio zzso per unit decrease zzso zzso zzso zzso and insulin resistance zzso zzso A decline in fitness level between childhood and adulthood was associated with increased obesity zzso zzso and insulin resistance zzso zzso per unit zzso 

A decline in fitness from childhood to adulthood, and by zzso a decline in physical activity, is associated with obesity and insulin resistance in zzso Programs aimed at maintaining high childhood physical activity levels into adulthood may have potential for reducing the burden of obesity and type 2 diabetes in zzso
