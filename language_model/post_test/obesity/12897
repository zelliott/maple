To examine if zzso zzso free fatty acid zzso delivery is increased in zzso zzso zzso and to determine the zzso tissue zzso responsible for the greater zzso zzso zzso we measured systemic and regional zzso and release of zzso zzso before and during a zzso zzso mixed meal in eight zzso and eight zzso zzso obese zzso zzso zzso flux and zzso zzso delivery were not different in zzso and LB obese zzso however, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 45 zzso 81 zzso 12 zzso P zzso zzso flux zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso delivery zzso zzso 45 zzso 88 zzso 24 zzso respectively, P zzso and estimated zzso zzso delivery were greater in zzso than LB obese zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso release was greater in zzso than in LB obese women zzso zzso 71 zzso 97 zzso 37 zzso respectively, P zzso and accounted for the greater zzso zzso availability in zzso zzso zzso leg zzso zzso was less in zzso than in LB obese women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leg zzso mass zzso zzso P zzso We conclude that the elevated zzso zzso release observed in zzso obese women originates from the zzso zzso fat, not visceral zzso These results suggest that visceral fat may be a marker for, but not the source of, excess zzso zzso in zzso
