zzso is a highly regulated process that has an important role in the control of a wide range of cellular functions, such as zzso recycling, zzso availability and tissue zzso A recent study has shown an increased zzso activity in the zzso tissue of obese subjects, and a role for zzso in zzso insulin resistance was zzso Body mass reduction is the most efficient approach to tackle insulin resistance in zzso zzso however, the impact of weight loss in zzso tissue zzso is zzso 

zzso tissue zzso was evaluated in mice and zzso 

First, a mouse model of zzso obesity and diabetes was maintained on a zzso zzso caloric zzso At zzso markers of zzso were increased in obese mice as compared with lean zzso Upon caloric zzso zzso increased in the lean mice, whereas it decreased in the obese zzso The zzso of ad zzso feeding was sufficient to rapidly reduce zzso in the lean mice and increase zzso in the obese zzso In the second part of the study, zzso was evaluated in the subcutaneous zzso tissue of nine zzso and six zzso subjects undergoing zzso surgery for body mass zzso zzso were collected during the surgery and approximately 1 year zzso zzso of systemic zzso such as tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso As in the mouse model, human obesity was associated with increased zzso and body mass reduction led to an zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso 

zzso and caloric zzso are associated with the defective regulation of zzso in the zzso zzso The studies in zzso subjects undergoing improved zzso control following calorie restriction suggest that zzso and inflammation are regulated zzso
