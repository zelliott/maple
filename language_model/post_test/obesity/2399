In this article, the most important risk factors that may predict the transition from borderline to established hypertension are zzso zzso prevention has to focus on identifying individuals who are at highest risk and delaying or reversing further zzso of zzso pressure zzso A review of the literature indicates that several environmental and zzso factors can be identified as risk factors for the development of hypertension, including family history of essential hypertension, age, race, zzso alcohol consumption, salt zzso hormonal status, and some stress zzso Of all diagnostic approaches to predict the development of hypertension, zzso of resting heart rate and responses to dynamic exercise have some zzso zzso 

The most important risk factors that may predict the transition from borderline to established hypertension are zzso focusing on those pathological changes that have been investigated for their value as zzso of established zzso A patient commonly is diagnosed as a borderline zzso if several pressure values are somewhere above as well as below zzso zzso zzso Patients in this category generally are regarded as zzso when they are younger than age zzso Studies largely favor the hypothesis of zzso inheritance of essential hypertension, yet the detailed nature of zzso continues to be zzso Several zzso markers reflect the zzso zzso of established hypertension, zzso a variation in the zzso pattern of plasma zzso urinary concentration of zzso and an zzso of cell membrane transport of zzso In Western zzso zzso pressure increases throughout zzso About zzso of the white population and over 50% of the black population over age 65 have hypertension zzso pressure of zzso zzso zzso or zzso or isolated zzso hypertension zzso blood pressure greater than 160 zzso and zzso blood pressure less than 95 zzso zzso Essential hypertension is more prevalent and vascular disease more severe in blacks than in zzso There is a well-documented association between obesity and zzso obesity increases the prevalence of hypertension 3 to 8 zzso Numerous studies have been published about the relationship between zzso hypertension and excessive dietary salt zzso but the results continue to be zzso In a cross-cultural analysis, a strong relationship was observed between salt intake and the prevalence of zzso Also noted was the zzso impact of sodium intake on the increasing prevalence of hypertension with zzso zzso women have a lower prevalence of essential hypertension and its risk factors than men of the same age because of the influence of estrogen, but if these women take oral zzso zzso pressure increases and transient hypertension, often severe or even zzso can be zzso Some behavioral patterns and personality traits appear to be associated with borderline hypertension, but evidence that these factors determine the transition from borderline to established hypertension in later life has not been demonstrated thus zzso zzso of resting heart rate and responses to dynamic exercise have some zzso value in predicting the development of zzso Ambulatory monitoring of blood pressure might allow for differentiation of patients with transient elevated blood pressure from those with more sustained zzso
