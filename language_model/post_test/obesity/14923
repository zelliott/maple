zzso and shorter zzso are commonly associated with elevated risk for age-related diseases and zzso Whether zzso length zzso may be associated with obesity or variations in zzso is not well zzso zzso we set out to test the hypothesis that zzso may be a risk factor for increased zzso using data from a large zzso cohort zzso 

zzso of zzso were assessed in six ways zzso status, body mass index zzso the percentage of body fat or % body fat, zzso visceral and subcutaneous fat zzso in zzso elderly subjects zzso black and zzso zzso zzso between zzso measured in zzso at baseline and zzso traits measured at zzso and three of these traits after 7 years of follow-up were tested using zzso models adjusting for important zzso Additionally, we look at weight changes and relative changes in zzso and % body fat between baseline and zzso 

At zzso zzso was zzso associated with % body fat zzso zzso and subcutaneous fat zzso zzso and positively associated with zzso after adjusting for % body fat zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso or visceral zzso Prospective analyses showed that longer zzso was associated with positive percent change between baseline and zzso follow-up for both zzso zzso zzso and % body fat zzso zzso 

Our study suggests that shorter zzso may be a risk factor for increased zzso zzso with previous reports on their reversed roles, the relationship between zzso and zzso may be complicated and may warrant more prospective zzso
