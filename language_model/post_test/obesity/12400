zzso tissue is responsible for zzso of several zzso that mediate systemic effects on obesity and insulin zzso zzso abdominal zzso tissue zzso and visceral zzso tissue zzso are metabolically different and have differences in their gene expression zzso Our study evaluated the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and SAT of non-obese and class III obese zzso 

The zzso tissue samples were obtained by zzso zzso transcripts of studied genes were determined by quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction zzso 

Comparing the different zzso zzso zzso expression was lower only in zzso of obese individuals zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels were decreased in zzso of both zzso When non-obese and obese were zzso only zzso expression was lower in SAT and in zzso of obese subjects zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso No difference was found with regard to zzso levels in zzso or SAT in both zzso zzso expression in SAT of obese subjects had a negative correlation with age zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso serum levels zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

The decrease zzso expression of this genes in zzso responsible for central zzso may be associated with an increased risk of obesity and zzso
