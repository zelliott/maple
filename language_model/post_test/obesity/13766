Blood flow to five zzso tissue zzso and five other zzso was measured in zzso zzso obese and lean male zzso rats using the zzso zzso zzso zzso output and blood pressure were also zzso zzso rats were significantly heavier and had larger fat zzso characterized by more and larger zzso zzso output and blood pressure were similar in lean and obese zzso Blood flow to zzso tissue was substantially reduced in all five zzso of obese rats when expressed per square zzso of cell zzso When blood flow was expressed per cell, it was reduced in obese rats in the zzso subcutaneous and zzso zzso and significantly elevated in the obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differences in blood flow were observed in both lean and obese zzso zzso organ blood flow was not different between obese and lean rats, but when expressed on a per gram basis, blood flow through zzso zzso muscle, zzso and zzso was elevated in obese zzso These findings suggest that there is a substantial zzso of zzso in obesity that may contribute to or reflect the altered metabolism of zzso tissue in obese zzso Furthermore, zzso differences of zzso tissue blood flow also parallel reported zzso differences in zzso
