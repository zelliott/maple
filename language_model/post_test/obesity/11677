To determine if subcutaneous drain or closure of the subcutaneous layer decreases the zzso of wound complications in obese women undergoing zzso zzso 

zzso obese women undergoing zzso delivery and with at least 2 zzso of subcutaneous fat were zzso to one of three groups: group 1 had zzso closure of the subcutaneous zzso group 2 had placement of a subcutaneous closed zzso zzso and group 3 had neither zzso closure nor zzso 

zzso separation occurred in 12 zzso zzso in 5 zzso and infection in 3 zzso There were no reports of wound zzso The overall zzso of any wound complication zzso zzso zzso zzso was higher in obese women who received neither subcutaneous zzso nor drain as compared to obese women who received either subcutaneous zzso closure or subcutaneous zzso The zzso of major wound complications zzso or zzso was also higher in obese women who received neither subcutaneous zzso or drain compared to obese women who received either subcutaneous zzso closure or subcutaneous zzso 

The use of closed zzso drainage in the subcutaneous space may reduce the zzso of zzso wound complications in obese women who have at least 2 zzso of subcutaneous fat and undergo zzso zzso
