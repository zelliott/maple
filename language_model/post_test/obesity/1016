zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with zzso effects outside the immune zzso Previous studies have indicated that treatment of normal rats with zzso reduces white zzso tissue zzso mass, but it was unclear if these effects were direct or zzso In the present study, the effects of zzso on zzso mass and zzso metabolism were studied in two genetic models of zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso rat and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rats, lean zzso and obese mice zzso responded to zzso with reductions in zzso mass and zzso zzso activity zzso with no decreases in food zzso In contrast, zzso zzso rats did not respond to zzso administration by any of the above measures of fat mass or zzso zzso In addition, zzso protection zzso zzso were used to demonstrate that all three zzso zzso beta and zzso of the zzso zzso complex are expressed by rat and mouse zzso suggesting that the effects of zzso on zzso tissue metabolism could be zzso Additionally, the zzso rats expressed zzso lower levels of the zzso signaling zzso zzso than lean zzso rats, suggesting this decrease may play a role in the lack of zzso tissue response to zzso in the zzso zzso and lending further support for a direct action of zzso on zzso zzso
