zzso food zzso obesity and more importantly, visceral zzso are major risk factors for the onset of type 2 zzso Evidence is emerging that zzso zzso dysfunction could be related to indirect induction of a state of low grade zzso Our aim was to study whether zzso associated obesity could promote an inflammatory response in pancreatic zzso leading to zzso zzso In the zzso obese insulin resistant male zzso zzso we measured the level of circulating zzso zzso and estimated their production as well as the expression of their receptors in pancreatic tissue and zzso Our main findings concern zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressions were zzso zzso was also zzso with a cellular zzso also observed for zzso To get insight into the mechanisms involved in zzso zzso zzso were used to determine the expression profile of proteins implicated in different membrane receptors zzso zzso and cell cycle zzso Despite zzso zzso cell viability was unaffected probably because of decreases in zzso zzso as well as in zzso and zzso involved in the induction and amplification of zzso zzso zzso zzso decreases in important cell cycle regulators zzso zzso zzso and increased expression of zzso probably contribute to counteract and restrain zzso in zzso rat zzso Finally and probably as a result of zzso and zzso increased expressions with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso from zzso rats were found more sensitive to both stimulating and zzso zzso of the zzso this zzso some zzso relevance to a possible zzso regulation of zzso function by zzso These results support the hypothesis that pancreatic zzso from zzso zzso rats undergo an inflammatory zzso That the latter could contribute to zzso zzso and possibly lead to progressive zzso failure in these animals, deserves further zzso
