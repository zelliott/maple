This study was designed to determine risk factors for zzso zzso after zzso zzso 

We performed a zzso retrospective review of all zzso transplants from 1994 to zzso zzso factors studied were donor age, body weight, body mass index, peak serum zzso peak serum zzso need for zzso agents, cause of death, cold zzso preservation time, recipient age, type of dialysis, surgical technique, and peak recipient zzso 

The zzso graft survival rate was zzso Of the 34 patients zzso there were 4 cases of zzso zzso formation zzso zzso donor body weight zzso zzso elevated body mass index zzso zzso and the peak recipient serum zzso in the first zzso week zzso zzso were significant risk factors for the development of zzso zzso 

These data suggest that zzso zzso from obese donors may be more susceptible to zzso injury resulting in zzso zzso
