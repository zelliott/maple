To establish the frequency of zzso in obese Israeli children and adolescents and its association with other cardiovascular disease zzso risk zzso 

zzso of 262 patients zzso zzso with zzso zzso for age and gender were reviewed for zzso and zzso parameters of zzso zzso zzso and hypertension were defined as zzso zzso or zzso zzso of healthy zzso 

Compared to patients with normal zzso profile, zzso patients zzso zzso zzso had significantly higher prevalence of fatty liver zzso zzso higher percent body fat zzso p zzso zzso and higher zzso protein zzso p zzso zzso There was no significant difference in age, zzso or familial zzso zzso The zzso patients zzso zzso zzso were significantly older than the zzso patients zzso zzso had higher percent body fat zzso zzso zzso larger waist circumference zzso zzso and higher zzso zzso zzso There were no significant zzso differences in zzso The most significant factors associated with zzso risk were waist circumference and insulin zzso 

zzso Israeli children have high rates of zzso risk factors, most of them unrelated to zzso or zzso zzso we recommend screening for them in obese children with increased waist circumference of any age to detect those who require more intense zzso
