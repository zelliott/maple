It has been recently reported that blockade of type 1 zzso zzso receptors by specific zzso or genetic manipulation zzso zzso zzso and insulin resistance in animal models of obesity and type 2 zzso However, the precise role of zzso in the zzso effects of the zzso zzso zzso is not zzso 

zzso mice were treated with different doses of zzso and then subjected to an oral zzso tolerance zzso The expression of different zzso in white zzso tissue was zzso by quantitative real-time zzso 

zzso (30 zzso significantly inhibited body weight and fat pad weight gain zzso zzso and improved zzso zzso Gene expression analysis indicated that zzso necrosis zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso were zzso in the zzso tissue of zzso mice treated with zzso compared with controls, whereas zzso was significantly zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso in white zzso zzso may play a role in improving insulin sensitivity in obese zzso
