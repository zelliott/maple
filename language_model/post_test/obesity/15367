Two studies were performed to assess the zzso axis in simple obesity and the possible effect of variations in the level of circulating zzso fatty acids zzso on one of the components of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the first study, we compared the zzso hormone response to oral zzso in obese and lean zzso zzso subjects demonstrated zzso and impaired zzso tolerance but this was not associated with an increased zzso of either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso These findings therefore provide no support for the hypothesis that zzso of the zzso axis contributes to the zzso seen in zzso Indeed, the plasma zzso response to zzso was markedly attenuated in obese subjects, confirming previous zzso In the second study, in which zzso zzso responses were again evaluated in obese and lean women, circulating zzso levels were modulated using either zzso (to increase serum zzso or zzso (to reduce serum zzso Treatment with zzso resulted in complete suppression of zzso levels and in a markedly higher zzso response than the response to zzso alone or to zzso plus zzso We suggest that higher zzso and zzso zzso levels in obesity may zzso inhibit zzso zzso zzso and that this results in zzso of the zzso response to zzso However, although serum zzso levels zzso were similarly suppressed in both lean and obese subjects, the zzso response was again significantly lower in obese subjects, suggesting the possibility of an intrinsic zzso of zzso zzso in zzso The reduction of zzso levels in obesity may be important both in relation to its zzso effect and to its zzso role as a zzso zzso
