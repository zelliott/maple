Increased body mass index has been associated with increased zzso zzso We studied the effect of body mass index in our population, using a modified scale suggested by the World Health zzso 

From January 2006 to December 2008, zzso patients undergoing first-time isolated zzso coronary artery bypass zzso were selected from our cardiac surgery zzso Data were analyzed by zzso and zzso zzso 

Of the zzso zzso coronary artery bypass patients, zzso zzso had a normal body mass index zzso and zzso zzso had a high body mass index zzso There were 921 zzso patients with zzso disease, and zzso zzso had internal zzso artery zzso The 30-day mortality was zzso zzso analysis revealed age, hospital stay, zzso time, and zzso failure were significantly associated with hospital zzso High body mass index was not significantly associated with morbidity or zzso The model had an adequate fit at zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso 

Increased body mass index alone is not a predictor of increased mortality and zzso In fact, these outcomes were associated with advanced age, hospital stay, zzso time, and zzso zzso
