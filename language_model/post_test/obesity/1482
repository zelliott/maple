The optimum diet composition for weight loss in obese women with or without previous zzso diabetes zzso remains to be zzso Weight loss may be especially important for the latter group in terms of preventing future zzso as well as zzso dependent diabetes zzso We studied zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso restricted diets to compare weight loss and zzso zzso 

We performed a zzso zzso zzso zzso crossover study of 25 obese zzso 13 of whom had previous zzso zzso Each woman was allocated to a treatment regimen for 6 weeks and then zzso zzso to the alternative regimen for an additional 6 zzso zzso were provided in the form of nutritional supplement bars except for the evening meal that comprised 1/3 of the caloric zzso All subjects were seen and weighed zzso zzso variables including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and percent body fat were measured at the beginning, zzso and end of the zzso 

Women with previous zzso diabetes zzso were comparable to obese women without a history of previous zzso diabetes except that the former had higher maximum levels of zzso on a zzso tolerance test and higher zzso insulin levels consistent with greater insulin zzso Weight loss was comparable for all groups during the first 6 weeks but attenuated in all groups during the second 6 weeks of the trial regardless of diabetes history or treatment group zzso Women with or without a previous history of zzso diabetes had higher zzso while on a zzso zzso diet than while on a zzso zzso zzso 

A weight loss regimen consisting of zzso zzso results in lower zzso levels than those achieved with a zzso zzso content diet in obese zzso Thus, the zzso diet with the higher fat content produced the more favorable zzso profile in all obese zzso
