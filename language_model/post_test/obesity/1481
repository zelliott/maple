zzso brown zzso tissue zzso zzso in the genetically obese zzso fatty zzso rat is restored to normal by zzso We investigated the role of the sympathetic nervous system in modulating the effects of zzso by studying zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso levels in unilaterally zzso zzso BAT of lean and obese zzso zzso zzso levels were increased by zzso zzso zzso prevented this zzso increase in lean rats but not in obese zzso beta zzso zzso was decreased in BAT of obese zzso zzso decreased and zzso increased beta zzso zzso in lean rats but the opposite response was observed to both of these zzso in obese zzso beta zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso correlated in lean rats but positively correlated in obese zzso zzso increased zzso zzso levels in zzso BAT of both lean and obese rats and decreased beta zzso zzso in lean rats but not obese zzso These data suggest that the regulation of the beta zzso gene in response to sympathetic stimuli and zzso is abnormal in the obese zzso
