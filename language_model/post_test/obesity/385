zzso zzso zzso could be a rate limiting step in zzso zzso synthesis as it is the final step in this zzso As such, between depot differences in zzso activity could influence regional fat zzso zzso activity and in zzso rates of direct free fatty acid zzso storage were measured in abdominal subcutaneous and zzso zzso tissue samples from 12 zzso zzso zzso and 23 obese men and women zzso zzso undergoing zzso zzso zzso activity was greater in zzso than in abdominal subcutaneous zzso tissue from zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, zzso but not from obese patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, zzso zzso activity per unit zzso weight was zzso correlated with zzso size zzso and positively correlated with direct zzso storage in zzso zzso but not in abdominal subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso activity varies as a function of zzso size, but this relationship differs between visceral and abdominal subcutaneous fat in obese and zzso zzso Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso variations in zzso activity may be an important regulatory step in visceral zzso tissue zzso zzso
