There are limited data on the impact of body mass index on outcomes in mechanically zzso zzso 

Secondary analysis of a cohort including zzso patients mechanically zzso Patients were screened daily for management of mechanical zzso complications zzso respiratory distress syndrome, zzso zzso associated pneumonia, zzso organ failure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mortality in the intensive care zzso To estimate the impact of body mass index on acute respiratory distress syndrome and zzso the authors constructed models using zzso zzso equations zzso 

Patients were evaluated based on their body mass zzso 184 patients zzso were zzso 1995 patients zzso normal weight, zzso patients zzso overweight, 792 patients zzso obese and 216 patients zzso severely zzso zzso obese patients were more likely to receive low tidal volume based on actual body weight but high volumes based on predicted body zzso In obese patients, the authors observed a higher zzso of acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute zzso zzso After adjustment, the body mass index was significantly associated with the development of acute respiratory distress zzso compared with normal zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for obese and OR zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for severely zzso There were no differences in outcomes zzso of mechanical zzso length of stay and mortality in intensive care unit and zzso based on body mass index zzso 

In this zzso obese patients were more likely to have significant complications but there were no associations with increased zzso
