zzso effects of calcium zzso such as zzso and zzso have been described in zzso obesity models, but the mode of action of the calcium zzso as zzso agents has not been zzso 

To examine whether the zzso effects of calcium zzso (here zzso could be ascribed to a direct stimulation of brown zzso tissue zzso zzso 

zzso of the ability of zzso to induce zzso zzso rate of oxygen zzso in isolated zzso cells from rats, mice and zzso in intact zzso zzso 

zzso itself, or in combination with any dose of zzso zzso was totally unable to induce or augment zzso in isolated zzso cells of any species zzso However, it markedly induced zzso in intact animals zzso zzso increase over resting zzso zzso This effect could be fully inhibited by zzso 

zzso is itself without zzso zzso The zzso response zzso (and thus presumably the zzso zzso is probably secondary to a previously described general zzso of calcium zzso a release of zzso from sympathetic nerves, here most likely directly from nerves in the zzso The zzso effect of zzso is thus probably not due to its calcium channel blocking zzso 

It is probable that the zzso effects of calcium zzso reported in several models of genetically obese zzso zzso and zzso mice, zzso and zzso zzso are zzso via an indirect stimulation of zzso To what extent calcium zzso may induce similar effects in a clinical situation, is currently zzso
