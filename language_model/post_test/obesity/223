To determine whether a series of new zzso zzso zzso zzso are better diagnostic criteria than the classical zzso zzso A second objective is to propose specific or sensitive threshold values of the most accurate criteria for the occurrence of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and CT scans were performed in 74 obese zzso Fat zzso zzso zzso and areas were zzso Plasma zzso insulin, zzso and fat cell size were zzso A zzso zzso analysis was performed to determine the most accurate predictor index for zzso zzso explaining the highest percentage of zzso 

All the new zzso were highly correlated with body mass index, percentage of fat and fat cell zzso zzso thicknesses were greater in women, while zzso and zzso zzso visceral zzso tissue zzso and internal circumference area were greater in men zzso zzso Those observations were reinforced by the zzso size in both fat zzso zzso parameters showed the strongest correlation with zzso zzso being positively associated with zzso risk in women and zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the best predictor index was the superficial subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso and its relation to visceral area zzso explaining zzso of total zzso for zzso zzso in men and zzso for zzso model assessment in zzso After receiver operating zzso analysis, three threshold values for both sexes were proposed to select the most appropriate depending on the clinical zzso 

For the first time, we have described zzso and the zzso ratio as important zzso in zzso zzso
