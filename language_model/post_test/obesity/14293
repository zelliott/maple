zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have dominant roles in the action of insulin, but other zzso of the insulin zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso are also of zzso zzso Although the protein downstream of zzso zzso zzso is known to function as a zzso adapter zzso in insulin zzso its role in energy zzso has remained zzso Here we show that zzso regulates zzso zzso of zzso in white zzso tissue was markedly increased in mice fed a high-fat diet, whereas zzso lacking this adapter were smaller and showed a reduced zzso response to this dietary zzso zzso mice were zzso and showed improved zzso tolerance and insulin sensitivity compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso mice were impaired in zzso zzso and this zzso was accompanied by an increased activity of the protein zzso zzso and a zzso increase in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso of this negative regulatory site for the zzso activity of zzso blocked development of the lean zzso caused by zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso promotes zzso zzso by zzso the zzso effect of zzso on zzso and may thus zzso predisposition to zzso zzso
