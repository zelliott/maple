zzso zzso syndrome zzso is the most common zzso disorder of zzso zzso These women have insulin resistance independent of zzso and insulin resistance is now recognized as a risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes zzso hypertension and cardiovascular zzso 

We zzso therefore, to assess whether there was correlation between a simple zzso measure of insulin sensitivity zzso zzso and the zzso in this zzso 

zzso zzso women zzso zzso zzso zzso years and body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso underwent frequently sampled zzso zzso tolerance test zzso 

zzso patients zzso had insulin sensitivity zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients with zzso de 27 was more resistant than the zzso zzso zzso de 27 zzso zzso zzso The correlation in zzso between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was found significant for all the group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and those women with zzso de 27 zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso but not significant correlation was found in those with zzso zzso zzso de 27 zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

We conclude that the zzso zzso may be useful as a screening test for insulin resistance in overweight and obese Mexican zzso women but not in the lean zzso
