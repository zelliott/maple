The role of insulin in the regulation of human zzso tissue zzso zzso was zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso to be related to peripheral clearance of plasma zzso was low in zzso zzso zzso diabetic subjects zzso less than zzso and treatment of zzso returned the activity to zzso In chronic zzso represented by zzso zzso activity among control subjects was correlated to percent of ideal body weight zzso P less than zzso and to fat cell size zzso P less than zzso zzso powder zzso zzso activity zzso to reflect total tissue zzso was also related to percent of ideal body weight zzso P less than zzso for zzso zzso P less than zzso for zzso and to fat cell size zzso P less than zzso for zzso zzso P less than zzso for zzso zzso insulin zzso was related to zzso changes in zzso zzso in control zzso both were dependent upon the amount of dietary zzso In contrast, the diabetic patients with low insulin responses, failed to increase zzso zzso activity with zzso The changes in zzso zzso P less than zzso and zzso powder zzso P less than zzso activity during feeding were related to the percent increase in plasma zzso Thus, insulin appears to be important in the regulation of human zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin levels in obesity and increased insulin zzso after eating were associated with increased zzso zzso zzso zzso in insulin zzso both in zzso and zzso states, are associated with low zzso tissue zzso zzso and may lead to zzso in diabetic zzso
