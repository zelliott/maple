zzso factors contribute to the risk of developing zzso syndrome, a disorder associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, diabetes zzso and some zzso 

The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between the intake zzso of certain food groups, eating habits, and the risk of zzso syndrome in a zzso study of Korean zzso 

Study participants were recruited from the National Cancer Center in South zzso A total of zzso men aged 30 years and older were recruited between August 2002 and May zzso zzso syndrome was defined as having three or more of the following conditions: zzso high blood pressure, low zzso zzso cholesterol level, high zzso level, and high zzso blood zzso zzso The association of zzso syndrome and zzso zzso food intake zzso and eating habits assessed by a food frequency zzso was zzso 

The prevalence rate of zzso syndrome for men aged 30 to 39, 40 to 49, 50 to 59, and zzso years was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The study participants with zzso syndrome had significantly higher family history of type 2 diabetes zzso zzso vs zzso zzso and were more likely to be current smokers zzso vs zzso zzso than their zzso Among food group items, participants with zzso syndrome showed significantly higher intake of seaweed zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso and oily foods zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso than participants without zzso zzso In addition, the group with zzso syndrome was more likely to eat quickly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for fast vs zzso and to zzso frequently zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for more than 4 times a week vs less than once a zzso 

The results suggest that high intake of seaweed and oily foods as well as eating habits such as eating faster and frequent zzso are associated with the risk of zzso zzso In contrast, high fruit intake may be associated with a lower risk of zzso zzso The importance of dietary habits in zzso syndrome development needs to be pursued in further zzso
