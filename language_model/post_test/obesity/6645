Two different strains of the spontaneously zzso rat zzso exist, either with or without a zzso zzso In the zzso population derived from a cross between these two zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso was tightly linked to differences in zzso zzso but not to those in fat pad zzso This suggested the existence of another crucial zzso related to zzso zzso analysis of this zzso population showed a significant linkage between the rat zzso 1 region zzso and fat pad zzso By zzso both zzso and expression information, we identified a donor zzso site zzso in the gene for zzso carrier family 22 member 18 zzso in zzso with reduced fat pad zzso This zzso was located at the linkage peak with a maximum zzso of odds score of zzso and caused skipping of the whole zzso 9 that results in a complete loss of a whole zzso region of the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso was abundantly expressed in isolated zzso and in a zzso manner in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso via infection of zzso zzso markedly inhibited both zzso zzso and zzso differentiation in zzso zzso By contrast, zzso of the zzso zzso had the opposite zzso These results reveal a novel link between zzso and fat zzso and suggest that this gene could be a new therapeutic target in zzso
