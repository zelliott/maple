zzso effect of food zzso studies give conflicting answers to research questions and in many cases data from one laboratory to another is not comparable because of the zzso of different experimental zzso Likewise, how weight reduction affects measurement of zzso is zzso Two studies were conducted on how zzso affects energy zzso The first study examined how resting energy expenditure zzso zzso can affect zzso studies and how much zzso variation is found in zzso zzso The zzso of a standard meal was measured in six subjects for zzso h on three different occasions by indirect zzso zzso was measured on each subject for 1 h before the meal was given on each measurement zzso On a separate day, the energy expenditure was measured on each subject during the same time period as the zzso zzso but without any food given to determine if a zzso increase in zzso over the time period of the measurement was zzso We found no zzso increase in energy expenditure during the zzso h of the zzso zzso While the zzso variation in zzso (four zzso had an average zzso of variation of zzso zzso zzso the zzso of variation of the zzso measured (three zzso was zzso zzso zzso In the second study, zzso and the zzso were measured before and after weight reduction in moderately overweight adult zzso Nine women weighing between zzso and zzso zzso lost an average of zzso zzso while on a reduced zzso low fat diet for between 12 and 14 zzso After weight reduction, the average zzso of these subjects decreased by zzso or 515 zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of these nine women was measured for zzso h before and after weight reduction using 16 zzso of zzso 2008 zzso zzso zzso Before weight reduction the zzso effect of zzso was 264 zzso zzso zzso or zzso of calories zzso and after weight reduction it was 251 zzso zzso zzso or zzso of calories zzso We did not find the zzso to be lower than expected in these subjects before weight reduction, since zzso is often reported to be around zzso of energy zzso and it was not changed after weight zzso
