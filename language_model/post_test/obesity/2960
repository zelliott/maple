Adult genetically obese zzso mice which are characterized by adrenal zzso and increased zzso of zzso have considerably increased levels of zzso in the zzso zzso At 5 weeks of age there is no difference in the zzso zzso content of lean and obese animals and dietary zzso sufficient to maintain body weight at normal values, reduces the zzso zzso content of adult obese mice from 14 times the level found in lean zzso controls to almost normal zzso Using an zzso zzso system, the release of zzso from isolated zzso zzso was zzso zzso from lean and obese mice responded similarly to stimulation with a crude extract of zzso tissue containing zzso releasing factor zzso The zzso content of the zzso in both groups appears to be zzso In contrast with the high zzso content, plasma values for zzso in zzso obese mice are not zzso The results are discussed in relation to other evidence for a zzso disorder in zzso zzso
