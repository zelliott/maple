To assess the association between zzso D zzso status and zzso cardiovascular diseases zzso the zzso syndrome, and type 2 diabetes zzso zzso in ethnic zzso 

zzso searched were zzso with full text, Global Health, zzso with full text, and zzso from 1980 through 2010 zzso Studies were included if they 1) targeted immigrants from low- to high-income countries or ethnic minorities, 2) focused primarily on zzso and its relation to zzso zzso and/or zzso and 3) were published in zzso zzso The influences of key zzso such as age, zzso and ethnicity on any observed relations were also zzso Due to the zzso of study zzso only a narrative synthesis was zzso 

zzso minorities had significantly higher rates of vitamin D zzso zzso zzso zzso children zzso versus zzso adults zzso versus zzso than their white zzso None of the studies reported a prevalence of obesity zzso by zzso There was evidence supporting links between vitamin D zzso and zzso chronic diseases, with 14 of 14 studies reporting a statistically significant result with a measurement of zzso four of five for zzso four of five for zzso and one of one for the zzso zzso However, the strength of the association varied across ethnic groups depending on the index used to measure zzso zzso and zzso Because most of the included studies were zzso and there were variations in outcome zzso it was not possible to determine the relative contributions of obesity or vitamin D zzso to zzso risk and risk of zzso or which is the initial driver It is possible both have a role to zzso 

Further research specific to migrant populations using zzso controlled trials are required to establish whether zzso links between zzso and zzso chronic disease exist, and whether vitamin D supplementation could be valuable in the prevention or treatment of zzso zzso
