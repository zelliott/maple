It remains unknown whether the prevalence of silent zzso zzso increases as zzso function declines or what factors known as zzso risk factors are related to the development of zzso zzso 

Fifty-one patients with chronic kidney disease without diabetes zzso and 80 patients with essential hypertension with normal zzso function were included in the zzso The existence of zzso zzso was evaluated on brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso We evaluated the severity of carotid zzso by means of zzso thickness of zzso zzso or greater height in bilateral carotid arteries and by affecting factors, including plasma homocysteine zzso 

zzso prevalence was zzso in patients with a zzso clearance zzso greater than 40 zzso zzso zzso in patients with a zzso less than 40 zzso zzso and zzso in patients with essential hypertension with normal zzso zzso Patients with zzso had significantly lower zzso associated with increased zzso and zzso levels compared with those without zzso Plasma total homocysteine and insulin levels at 2 hours after a zzso zzso tolerance test correlated significantly with zzso zzso heart changes shown by zzso and thickened carotid zzso thickness were significantly more frequent in patients with zzso However, zzso zzso analysis showed that the most strongly contributing factor for zzso zzso was decline in zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso 

zzso zzso function, even without diabetes zzso is a risk factor for silent zzso zzso
