Increased zzso and zzso zzso is one of the cardiovascular risk factors for patients with insulin zzso Since zzso zzso metabolism largely depends on zzso we have investigated zzso zzso changes in patients with and without overweight, focusing on gender zzso 

Twenty-two males and 22 females with overweight zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso measured zzso zzso zzso at six fixed time points on three different zzso zzso zzso profiles were calculated as area under the zzso zzso zzso zzso The control group consisted of 24 males and 21 females who were not overweight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso parameters associated with insulin resistance were zzso 

zzso males and lean females had comparable zzso insulin levels zzso and zzso zzso respectively), but females had a more favorable zzso zzso profile when compared to zzso zzso zzso profiles were lower in lean females than in lean males zzso vs zzso zzso respectively, zzso zzso males and females had comparable zzso insulin levels zzso and zzso zzso respectively), which were higher than in lean zzso zzso females also had a more favorable zzso zzso profile compared to overweight zzso zzso zzso profiles were similar in overweight females and overweight males zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso multiple zzso analysis showed that in both males and zzso waist circumference was the strongest zzso of zzso zzso profiles when zzso zzso zzso were excluded from the model zzso for males and zzso for zzso These results suggest that overweight resulted in a 'male zzso zzso zzso in females due to abdominal fat zzso 

zzso resistance in overweight subjects partly zzso the gender differences of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The significant positive association between zzso zzso and waist circumference supports the view that especially abdominal fat associated with insulin resistance enhances zzso zzso
