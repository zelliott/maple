We have recently demonstrated that insulin activates zzso zzso and thereby increases the amounts of cellular zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and vascular smooth muscle zzso We zzso that zzso might considerably increase the the cellular pool of zzso zzso available for zzso by other growth zzso To examine the role of in zzso zzso in regulating zzso zzso we measured the amounts of zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and skeletal muscle of zzso mice, and mice made obese and zzso by injection of zzso contained greater amounts of zzso zzso than zzso of their lean zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso was increased zzso zzso 35 % in control animals, zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso rats zzso Reduction of zzso by exercise training (2 zzso for zzso weeks) resulted in decreases in the amounts of zzso zzso in these zzso Increased zzso zzso in zzso animals reflected increasing increments in the activity of zzso in zzso mice zzso zzso and zzso zzso rats zzso zzso while the total amounts of Ras proteins remained zzso In contrast to zzso zzso animals, zzso zzso rat zzso muscle (in the presence of zzso showed normal amounts of zzso zzso In zzso these data confirm increased amounts of zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso
