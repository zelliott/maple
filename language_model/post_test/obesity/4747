zzso is associated with an zzso zzso profile characterized by a predominance of small LDL and HDL zzso Weight loss, by dietary restriction or exercise, increases LDL particle zzso Whether these interventions can augment HDL size in conjunction with LDL size remains zzso 

This study compared the effects of alternate day zzso zzso calorie restriction zzso and endurance exercise on LDL and HDL particle size in overweight and obese zzso 

In a zzso zzso trial, adult subjects zzso zzso zzso were zzso to 1 of 4 groups: 1) zzso zzso energy restriction for zzso zzso with ad zzso feeding for zzso 2) zzso zzso energy restriction every zzso 3) exercise zzso intensity training 3 zzso or 4) zzso 

Body weight was reduced zzso zzso by zzso zzso and exercise zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Plasma LDL cholesterol decreased zzso zzso with zzso (10 zzso zzso and zzso (8 zzso zzso whereas HDL cholesterol increased zzso zzso with exercise (16 zzso zzso Integrated LDL particle size was zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso The proportion of small LDL particles decreased zzso zzso zzso with zzso only, and the proportion of large HDL particles increased zzso zzso zzso with exercise zzso 

These results indicate that dietary restriction increases LDL particle size, while endurance training zzso HDL particle size, with minimal weight zzso None of these interventions zzso increased both LDL and HDL particle size, zzso
