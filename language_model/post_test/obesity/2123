zzso zzso may have an emerging role as an adjunct in zzso of zzso zzso zzso optimal US images in obese patients is generally regarded more difficult than for other zzso This study compared the time consumption of bilateral lung US with zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso in obese zzso 

A zzso paired and zzso study performed in the operating zzso zzso adult patients requiring zzso zzso for zzso surgery were zzso During zzso bag zzso bilateral lung US was performed for detection of zzso indicating lung ventilation simultaneous with zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso outcome measure was the time difference to confirmed zzso zzso between US and zzso zzso The secondary outcome measure was time difference between US and zzso combined with zzso 

Both methods verified zzso tube placement in all zzso No significant difference was found between US compared with zzso zzso Median time for zzso by zzso alone was zzso s zzso zzso zzso zzso with a mean difference of zzso s in favor of US zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Comparing US with the combination of zzso and zzso there was a significant difference between the two zzso Median time for zzso by US was 43 s zzso zzso zzso zzso 55 s zzso zzso zzso P zzso 

In obese patients, zzso of zzso tube placement with US is as fast as zzso alone and faster than the standard method of zzso and zzso
