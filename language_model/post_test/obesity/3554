The search for natural agents that minimize zzso disorders is receiving special zzso In this regard, the present study aimed to evaluate the zzso effect of Chlorella zzso zzso on body weight, zzso profile, blood zzso and insulin signaling in liver, skeletal muscle and zzso tissue of zzso obese zzso 

zzso mice were fed either with standard zzso zzso diet or high-fat diet zzso and received zzso treatment with zzso for 12 consecutive zzso zzso free fatty acid, total cholesterol and zzso of cholesterol were measured using commercial zzso zzso and zzso levels were determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso tolerance tests were zzso The expression and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were determined by Western zzso zzso 

zzso we demonstrate for the first time in the literature that prevention by zzso of high-fat zzso insulin resistance in obese mice, as shown by increased zzso and insulin zzso is in part due to the improvement in the insulin signaling zzso at its main target zzso by increasing the zzso levels of proteins such as zzso zzso and zzso In zzso the lower zzso levels of zzso were observed in obese zzso We also found that zzso administration prevents high-fat zzso zzso by reducing zzso cholesterol and free fatty acid zzso 

We propose that the zzso effect of zzso treatment preventing the deleterious effects induced by high-fat diet is a good indicator for its use as a zzso agent against zzso zzso
