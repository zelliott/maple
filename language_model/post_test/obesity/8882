Growth hormone zzso acting through its zzso zzso is essential for zzso growth and development and maintaining zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice exhibit drastically diminished zzso growth zzso zzso levels, zzso growth zzso elevated insulin sensitivity, and reduced zzso zzso zzso Unlike the liver, which is mostly unaffected by changes in zzso level, skeletal muscles express high levels of zzso zzso zzso The net result of a concurrent zzso in the actions of both zzso and zzso which exert opposite influences on insulin zzso has not been zzso We studied zzso early responses in the insulin zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso Upon in zzso insulin zzso skeletal muscles of zzso mice exhibit transient delayed responses in zzso and zzso zzso but normal levels of zzso association with zzso This is in contrast to zzso insulin responses in zzso and indicates zzso effects of zzso gene zzso In addition to stimulating normal zzso cell growth, zzso may participate in zzso cell zzso which compensates for insulin resistance induced by zzso To determine whether the zzso cell overgrowth is dependent on zzso zzso we studied the response of male zzso mice to high-fat diet zzso zzso After 17 zzso on a zzso zzso mice became more significantly obese than zzso mice and exhibited increased zzso mass to a slightly higher zzso These data demonstrate that zzso signaling is not required for zzso zzso zzso Thus, in both muscle insulin responsiveness and zzso growth compensation, normal levels of zzso signals do not seem to play a dominant zzso
