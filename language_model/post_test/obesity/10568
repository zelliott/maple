The contribution of collections of rare sequence variations (or zzso to zzso expression has begun to receive considerable attention within the biomedical research zzso However, the best way to capture the effects of rare zzso in relevant statistical analysis models is an open zzso In this paper we describe the application of a number of statistical methods for testing associations between rare zzso in two genes to zzso We consider the relative merits of the different methods as well as important zzso details, such as the leveraging of zzso zzso and determining zzso
