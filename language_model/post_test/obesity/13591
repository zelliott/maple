We determined zzso associations of elevated zzso zzso zzso as a likely indicator of zzso zzso zzso with body mass index zzso and diabetes among older male, veteran zzso 

zzso files at three, urban Veteran Administration Healthcare Systems were zzso zzso male zzso mean age zzso years, without zzso documented liver diseases or zzso or zzso had the highest of one or more zzso results zzso zzso zzso determined zzso zzso of elevated zzso among groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso diabetes and zzso use were zzso 

zzso zzso patients had their highest zzso greater than the upper limit of normal zzso zzso of all diabetics and zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, had elevated zzso zzso values from 25 to zzso and 30 to 45, compared with those zzso to zzso predicted elevated zzso in the two younger zzso In contrast, among zzso patients, diabetes independently predicted elevated zzso whereas zzso did zzso 

The zzso findings support previous zzso data zzso zzso zzso with obesity and diabetes, and provide new evidence that in elderly male patients, zzso zzso absent other known liver diseases, may selectively associate with zzso
