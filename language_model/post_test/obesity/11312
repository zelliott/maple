The doubly labeled water zzso technique is used to assess zzso rate zzso in zzso zzso We investigated whether differences in the nutritional and body zzso status affect zzso of the assessment of CO2 production zzso by the zzso zzso To serve this purpose, we compared calculated zzso by the zzso method to actual CO2 production zzso measured in an indirect zzso setup over a zzso period in mice fed with a low-fat zzso diet or an zzso zzso zzso zzso To uncover a potential effect of body composition on zzso zzso the zzso group was further subdivided in a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we assessed the influence of different sampling zzso zzso and methodology of zzso An excellent match was found between zzso assessed by the two methods in the zzso mice (least zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, there was a consistent zzso of zzso by the zzso technique in the zzso animals compared with actual CO2 production independent from body mass gain (least zzso DR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The least discrepancies were found when zzso model equations and the intercept method were used to calculate the body water zzso Furthermore, the zzso group presented different zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and a lower dilution space ratio between the zzso We recommend particular caution when using the zzso method for MR assessment in zzso animals and potentially humans because of the zzso of zzso
