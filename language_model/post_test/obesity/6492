zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rat lacking zzso receptors are zzso and zzso Previous work has demonstrated zzso in zzso Y zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression in ad zzso fed zzso rats compared to lean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to determine whether zzso in sensitivity to central peptides involved in overall feeding control may contribute to the zzso and obesity in zzso rats, we assessed zzso and zzso rats feeding responses to lateral zzso infusions of zzso (1 and zzso zzso the zzso 3/4 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso At a zzso time point, zzso increased food intake in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso rats were more sensitive, having significant increases at both zzso doses and a greater increase at the higher zzso The zzso zzso zzso decreased intake in both zzso and zzso zzso At the zzso time point, the magnitude of suppression was greater in zzso zzso zzso increased food intake in both zzso zzso rats were more sensitive with larger relative increase and zzso effects at the lower zzso These results are consistent with demonstrated zzso in zzso gene expression in zzso rats and indicate that zzso in zzso to zzso and zzso signaling are unlikely to contribute to their zzso and zzso
