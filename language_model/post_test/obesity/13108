The zzso gastric bypass and the zzso diversion effectively induce weight loss and long-term control of type 2 diabetes in zzso obese zzso It is unknown whether the control of diabetes is a secondary outcome from the treatment of obesity or a direct result of the zzso exclusion that both operations zzso The aim of this study was to investigate whether zzso exclusion can control diabetes independently on resolution of zzso zzso 

A zzso bypass zzso with preservation of an intact gastric volume was performed in zzso to zzso zzso rats, a spontaneous zzso model of type 2 zzso zzso zzso oral zzso zzso insulin sensitivity, zzso plasma insulin, and zzso zzso as well as plasma levels of cholesterol, zzso and free fatty acids were zzso The zzso was challenged against a sham operation, marked food zzso and medical therapy with zzso in matched groups of zzso zzso were observed for 36 weeks after zzso 

Mean plasma zzso 3 weeks after zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values were 159 zzso 47 zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso improved zzso zzso inducing a greater than zzso reduction of the area under blood zzso concentration curve zzso zzso These effects were not seen in the zzso animals despite similar operative time, same zzso food intake rates, and no significant difference in weight gain zzso zzso resulted also in better zzso control than greater weight loss from food restriction and than zzso zzso 

zzso of our study support the hypothesis that the bypass of zzso and zzso can directly control type 2 diabetes and not zzso to weight loss or treatment of zzso These findings suggest a potential role of the zzso gut in the zzso the disease and put forward the possibility of alternative therapeutic approaches for the management of type 2 zzso
