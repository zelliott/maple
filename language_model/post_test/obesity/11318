To provide a quantitative assessment of the association between body mass index zzso and the risk of gastric cancer, we summarized the evidence from prospective zzso 

zzso studies published up to November 30, 2012, were retrieved via computer searches of zzso and zzso as well as manual review of zzso zzso relative risks zzso with their corresponding zzso confidence intervals zzso were calculated using a zzso zzso 

A total of 24 prospective studies of zzso and gastric cancer risk with zzso cases were included in our zzso Overall, both overweight zzso zzso zzso and obesity zzso zzso zzso were not associated with risk of total gastric cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we found increased zzso was positively associated with the risk of gastric zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso for overweight and zzso for zzso but not with gastric zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso for overweight and zzso zzso zzso for zzso Similar results were observed in a linear zzso zzso 

On the basis of zzso of prospective studies, we find high zzso is positively associated with the risk of zzso but not with zzso 

zzso On the basis of more zzso and quantitative evidence than previously available, we found that increasing zzso was not a clear risk factor for total gastric zzso zzso Increased zzso was positively associated with risk of zzso but not with zzso
