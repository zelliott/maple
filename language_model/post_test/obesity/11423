This study examined the biological effects of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso production was assessed in Chinese zzso lung zzso zzso with human zzso or zzso zzso zzso In zzso insulin release studies were assessed in zzso cells while in zzso zzso and zzso responses were measured in obese diabetic ( zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso production with zzso zzso of zzso and zzso at zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso production with zzso zzso of zzso at zzso zzso whereas zzso had no zzso zzso specifically inhibited zzso insulin release zzso zzso from zzso zzso cells, but had no effect on zzso insulin zzso In contrast, zzso inhibited both zzso and zzso insulin release zzso and zzso zzso zzso Administration of zzso zzso or a combination of both peptides zzso zzso body weight, zzso to zzso zzso mice decreased the plasma insulin responses by zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso to zzso The zzso of zzso zzso mice was decreased by zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso by injection of zzso zzso or combined peptides but accompanying changes of plasma zzso were zzso 

These data show that zzso is a specific zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, feeding studies in one commonly used animal model of obesity and diabetes, zzso mice, suggest that zzso is the major zzso component of the zzso zzso contributing approximately zzso to zzso insulin zzso
