The zzso syndrome is a major risk factor of cardiovascular events, and obese visceral zzso tissue zzso based on chronic inflammation plays a central zzso To assess dynamic interplay between multiple cell types in obese zzso zzso a zzso technique in zzso was zzso By this technique we identified inflammatory cell clusters associated with zzso and zzso in obese zzso zzso We also found increased zzso cell interactions in obese zzso tissue zzso which were indicative of local chronic zzso Moreover, we found that large numbers of zzso zzso T cells infiltrated into obese zzso zzso zzso and genetic depletion of zzso T cells reduced inflammatory zzso zzso zzso and zzso tissue zzso and ameliorated systemic insulin zzso zzso of zzso T cells is essential for inflammatory zzso recruitment into obese zzso zzso and the initiation and development of inflammation zzso Our results clearly demonstrate the power of our imaging technique to analyze complex cellular interplay in zzso especially zzso and zzso cell zzso and to evaluate new therapeutic interventions against conditions arising from these zzso
