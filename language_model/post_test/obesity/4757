To study whether patterns of height growth differ by adult obesity status, and determine the contribution of subcutaneous zzso as an explanatory variable for any zzso 

A zzso prospective zzso cohort assessed in 3rd grade zzso zzso 5th grade zzso zzso 8th grade zzso zzso and 12th grade zzso zzso zzso were young adult obesity status classified by zzso adult zzso categories at 12th zzso zzso were measured in third, zzso and eighth zzso zzso was mean height zzso at the four zzso using zzso zzso for young adult obesity status, and height increments between grades by adult obesity status in sequential models including initial height and, zzso initial zzso 

zzso for age, and zzso young adult obesity status explained a small, but statistically significant amount of height growth among both females and males within each of the three zzso Compared with normal weight young adults, overweight or obese young adults stood taller in childhood, but had relatively less growth in height throughout the teenage zzso There was no association between adult height and weight zzso zzso explained only a small amount of the height patterns in the three weight zzso 

Childhood and adolescent height growth patterns differ between those who become young adults who are normal weight and those who become overweight or zzso Since differences in zzso explain only a small amount of these height growth patterns, research is needed to identify other zzso
