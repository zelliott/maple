Studies of the association between zzso and total mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease zzso have shown contradictory zzso We undertook a systematic review to determine the extent and nature of this zzso 

We selected cohort studies that provided risk estimates for total zzso with or without cardiovascular events, on the basis of zzso or obesity measures in patients with zzso and with at least 6 months' zzso zzso was defined as history of zzso coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass zzso or zzso zzso We obtained risk estimates for five predetermined zzso groups: low, normal weight zzso overweight, obese, and severely zzso 

We found 40 studies with zzso patients that had a mean follow-up of zzso zzso Patients with a low zzso index zzso zzso zzso had an increased relative risk zzso for total mortality zzso zzso zzso zzso and cardiovascular mortality zzso zzso overweight zzso zzso had the lowest risk for total mortality zzso zzso and cardiovascular mortality zzso zzso compared with those for people with a normal zzso zzso patients zzso zzso had no increased risk for total mortality zzso zzso or cardiovascular mortality zzso zzso Patients with severe obesity zzso or zzso did not have increased total mortality zzso zzso but they had the highest risk for cardiovascular mortality zzso zzso 

The better outcomes for cardiovascular and total mortality seen in the overweight and mildly obese groups could not be explained by adjustment for zzso zzso These findings could be explained by the lack of zzso power of zzso to differentiate between body fat and lean zzso
