To investigate associations between maternal diabetes and blood pressure zzso zzso impaired zzso zzso and serum lipids in offspring and whether these parameters correlate with metabolism during zzso 

Body mass index, zzso serum zzso and insulin during an oral zzso tolerance test, and zzso zzso were measured in 99 offspring of diabetic mothers zzso and 80 members of a control zzso 

zzso were more obese zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso and had higher zzso (8 zzso zzso and mean zzso zzso (4 zzso zzso but similar zzso zzso compared with the control zzso zzso had higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso and insulin zzso zzso 544 vs 377 zzso 239 zzso zzso but lower zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso and total cholesterol zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso In both groups body mass index, zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed correlations with zzso zzso zzso insulin was correlated with zzso readings only in the zzso zzso were found between second- and zzso maternal free fatty acid zzso and zzso and mean zzso zzso zzso zzso was correlated with mean zzso zzso 

In zzso abnormalities in weight and zzso tolerance are associated with abnormal maternal zzso Higher zzso is an additional zzso associated with fetal zzso
