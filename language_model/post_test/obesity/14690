zzso syndrome zzso is a rare zzso disorder with the zzso features of abdominal zzso zzso zzso cognitive zzso zzso and cardiac anomalies, hypertension, and zzso zzso is genetically heterogeneous, with nine genes identified to date and evidence for additional zzso In this study, we performed zzso analysis of the coding and zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in 48 French Caucasian zzso Among the 36 zzso identified, 12 were selected and zzso in zzso zzso case subjects and zzso zzso zzso zzso control zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso showed evidence of association with common obesity in an zzso manner, the zzso single zzso zzso zzso being associated with common adult obesity zzso zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso being associated with common zzso childhood obesity zzso zzso zzso and common adult zzso obesity zzso zzso zzso The association of the zzso zzso zzso was found to be supported by transmission zzso testing zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso also showed nominal evidence of association with quantitative components of the zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso a complication previously described in zzso zzso In zzso our preliminary data suggest that variations at zzso genes are associated with risk of common zzso
