zzso reflects both beta cell dysfunction and insulin resistance in zzso studies, but it is not known whether changes in zzso zzso are related to insulin resistance over zzso As zzso zzso zzso acid zzso supplementation zzso insulin resistance in obese men, we used this fatty acid to investigate the effects on plasma zzso insulin, zzso and zzso zzso including their associations with change in insulin zzso 

We zzso zzso 57 zzso zzso obese men to receive either zzso g zzso zzso mixture or control oil for 12 zzso zzso sensitivity zzso zzso intact zzso insulin, the zzso : insulin ratio, zzso zzso and zzso were assessed before and after zzso 

zzso with zzso increased zzso zzso the zzso : insulin ratio zzso and zzso zzso zzso in comparison with control zzso zzso however, did not change zzso The change in zzso but not the zzso : insulin ratio, was related to impaired insulin sensitivity zzso zzso zzso independently of changes in insulin, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the correlation between insulin sensitivity and specific insulin zzso zzso did not remain significant after adjustment for zzso zzso zzso was also correlated to zzso zzso ( zzso zzso zzso 

In obese men, zzso zzso zzso that is related to impaired insulin sensitivity, independently of changes in insulin zzso These results are of clinical interest, as zzso predicts diabetes and cardiovascular zzso The use of weight-loss supplements containing this fatty acid is zzso
