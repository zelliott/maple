We sought to determine if differences in the distribution and characteristics of zzso tissue between South Asians and white Caucasians account for differences in risk factors for cardiovascular zzso 

We recruited 108 healthy South Asians zzso zzso and white Caucasians zzso zzso within three zzso zzso Body zzso zzso size, abdominal fat area, and zzso zzso were assessed and related to zzso zzso insulin, lipids and zzso 

After adjustment for age, sex, and zzso South Asians compared to white Caucasians had higher zzso zzso insulin zzso difference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lower HDL cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso South Asians also had more body fat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso lower lean muscle mass zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso increased waist to hip ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso less superficial subcutaneous abdominal zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso more zzso to superficial zzso tissue ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and more liver fat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso area was increased in South Asians compared to white Caucasians zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso Adjustment for zzso area attenuated the ethnic differences in insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso HDL zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso Adjustment for differences in zzso area and fat distribution attenuated the ethnic difference in liver fat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

South Asians have an increased zzso area compared to white zzso This difference accounts for the ethnic differences in insulin, HDL cholesterol, zzso and zzso fat deposition in the zzso
