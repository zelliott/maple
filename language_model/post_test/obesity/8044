We investigated the effect of short-term feeding of zzso zzso acid zzso on zzso tissue zzso liver weight, zzso zzso zzso and serum zzso profiles in zzso zzso Mice were fed zzso diets containing either zzso zzso zzso oil zzso or zzso zzso zzso for 1 zzso zzso feeding of zzso showed an zzso effect without inducing zzso in zzso In addition to the decline of zzso zzso zzso significant zzso of A9 zzso of fatty acid in the total liver lipids was found in zzso zzso The zzso diet significantly increased the activities of zzso zzso and decreased the activities of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso Moreover, serum zzso profiles of zzso mice showed preferable changes in the zzso zzso However, serum zzso and zzso were drastically decreased by zzso zzso suggesting that prolonged administration of zzso would induce further decrease of serum zzso levels, which may be a cause of zzso in zzso These results show that short-term feeding of zzso does not induce adverse effect in zzso zzso
