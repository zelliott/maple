The objective of the study was to determine the association between child zzso at age 3 years and maternal zzso concentration among women without pre-existing diabetes or a zzso diabetes zzso zzso zzso 

Data are from the zzso zzso and Nutrition and zzso studies and include 263 zzso zzso Measured weights and heights at 3 years were used to calculate zzso and zzso zzso zzso scores and zzso zzso linear zzso models were used to examine associations of continuous zzso zzso scores with maternal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso estimated risk ratios of child zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The mean zzso maternal zzso concentration and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso At 3 years, the mean zzso child zzso zzso score was zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso were zzso In the adjusted model, when compared with zzso concentration zzso zzso a concentration zzso 130 zzso was associated with significantly higher child zzso zzso score at 3 years zzso zzso score difference of zzso zzso zzso zzso With the use of the same reference category, a concentration zzso 130 zzso was associated with an approximate twofold greater risk of child zzso zzso risk ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Fetal exposure to high maternal zzso concentration in the absence of pre-existing diabetes or zzso may contribute to the development of zzso in the zzso independent of maternal zzso zzso
