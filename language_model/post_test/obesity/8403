The prevalence of obesity among pregnant women is zzso Evidence from human cohort studies and experimental animals suggests that offspring cardiovascular and zzso function is compromised through early life exposure to maternal zzso Previously, we reported that juvenile offspring of obese rats develop zzso zzso hypertension associated with zzso zzso We have now addressed the hypothesis that zzso exposure to raised zzso in the immediate zzso period plays a zzso zzso zzso from lean zzso rats were treated either with zzso (3 zzso zzso or with saline twice daily from zzso day 9 to 15 to mimic the exaggerated zzso zzso surge observed in offspring of obese zzso zzso function was assessed by zzso at 30 days, and 2 and 12 zzso In juvenile (30 zzso zzso rats, hearts were heavier and zzso zzso zzso zzso blood pressure was raised zzso zzso mean zzso zzso male zzso 132 zzso 1 versus zzso 119 zzso 1, zzso zzso female zzso 132 zzso 2 versus zzso 119 zzso 1, zzso zzso and the zzso response to restraint stress and zzso challenge increased compared with zzso zzso Heart rate zzso demonstrated an increased zzso frequency ratio in 30-day zzso animals, indicative of heightened sympathetic zzso zzso zzso showed altered left zzso structure and zzso function in 30-day female zzso versus zzso zzso These disorders persisted to zzso In isolated hearts, zzso function was impaired at 5 months in male zzso zzso zzso imposed zzso in zzso rats permanently influences blood pressure and cardiac structure and zzso
