zzso acid zzso is required for neurotransmitter synthesis and zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso to zzso is considered adequate to support brain function in youth, but it is unknown if brain zzso can be maintained in insulin resistant zzso This study investigated brain fatty acid and zzso activities in young insulin resistant zzso rats on diets with and without zzso Male zzso and lean rats were fed diets enriched with zzso zzso zzso zzso fatty zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso oil zzso zzso zzso zzso for 9 weeks, zzso per diet per zzso Compared to lean, the 15 week old zzso rats were obese zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso model assessment of insulin zzso The zzso of zzso rats had higher zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and higher zzso zzso but lower zzso (all zzso zzso zzso than zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso while the zzso zzso (all zzso correlated with insulin zzso The zzso zzso index positively correlated with zzso zzso The percentage of zzso zzso of zzso rats was lower zzso than lean rats when fed zzso diet while there was no difference zzso between zzso and lean rats fed zzso or SO zzso Thus, the zzso in the fatty acid and zzso zzso in the brain were consistent inhibited zzso synthesis of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso may not have potential to effectively serve as a precursor for zzso zzso for youth zzso during insulin resistance since zzso zzso activity is zzso
