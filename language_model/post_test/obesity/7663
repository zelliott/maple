Although zzso and insulin resistance have been hypothesized to be involved in pancreatic zzso studies that have examined zzso load or individual dietary components that influence zzso zzso yielded zzso zzso 

Our objective was to investigate whether dietary insulin load and dietary insulin index are associated with the risk of pancreatic zzso 

We zzso followed zzso women and zzso men who were free of cancer and diabetes at baseline in the zzso Health Study and the Health Professionals zzso zzso During zzso y of zzso zzso pancreatic cancer cases were zzso zzso insulin load was calculated as a function of the food insulin index, and the energy content of individual foods was reported on zzso zzso The dietary insulin index was calculated by dividing the dietary insulin load by the total energy zzso 

zzso insulin load and dietary insulin index were not associated with the overall risk of pancreatic zzso In a comparison of the highest with the lowest zzso the pooled zzso zzso of pancreatic cancer were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for dietary insulin load and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for dietary insulin zzso In individuals with an elevated zzso (in zzso zzso or with low physical activity, a high insulin load was associated with small, zzso increases in the risk of pancreatic zzso in a comparison of the highest with the lowest zzso of zzso the positive association became more apparent in those who were both overweight and inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A diet that zzso an elevated zzso insulin response does not influence the overall risk of pancreatic zzso However, a diet with a high insulin load may increase the risk in individuals with a zzso state of insulin zzso
