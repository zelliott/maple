Women of Asian and South Asian descent are at increased risk of developing zzso diabetes zzso compared with zzso despite lower body mass index zzso Nevertheless, there has been limited study of insulin action during pregnancy in these ethnic zzso 

The objective of the study was to compare insulin sensitivity in pregnancy in Asian, South Asian, and Caucasian subjects and to determine whether the impact of obesity on insulin action is modified by zzso 

A zzso study was performed in zzso undergoing oral zzso tolerance testing in late zzso Participants were zzso into three groups: 1) Caucasian zzso zzso zzso 2) South Asian zzso zzso zzso and 3) Asian zzso zzso zzso 

zzso sensitivity was measured using the oral zzso tolerance test zzso index of zzso zzso and zzso zzso previously validated in zzso 

There were no significant ethnic differences in insulin sensitivity despite variation in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso South zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso overall P zzso zzso On multiple linear zzso analysis, the strongest independent zzso of zzso were zzso diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso both Asian zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and South Asian zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso ethnicity also emerged as negative, independent zzso of zzso Furthermore, Asian ethnicity significantly modified the association of zzso zzso with zzso zzso term, zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Asian and South Asian ethnicity are both independently associated with increased insulin resistance in late zzso zzso zzso has a much greater effect on insulin resistance in pregnancy in Asian women than in zzso Ethnicity thus emerges as a factor that zzso the effect of obesity on insulin resistance in zzso
