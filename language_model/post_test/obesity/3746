We have evaluated the effects on mortality of habitual low zzso diets that are thought to contribute to weight zzso 

zzso zzso 

Adult Greek zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed from 1993 to 2003 in the context of the Greek component of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and zzso Participants were 22 zzso healthy adults, whose diet was assessed through a validated zzso Participants were distributed by increasing zzso according to protein intake or zzso zzso as well as by an additive score generated by increasing zzso intake of protein and decreasing zzso intake of zzso zzso hazards zzso was used to assess the relation between high zzso high zzso and the low zzso protein score on the one hand and mortality on the zzso 

During 113 230 persons years of zzso there were 455 zzso In models with energy adjustment, higher intake of carbohydrates was associated with significant reduction of total zzso whereas higher intake of protein was associated with zzso increase of total mortality zzso zzso mortality ratios zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Even more zzso of higher mortality were high values of the additive low zzso protein score zzso 5 units, mortality ratio zzso with zzso zzso zzso -to zzso Positive associations of this score were noted with respect to both cardiovascular and cancer zzso 

zzso consumption of diets low in carbohydrates and high in protein is associated with an increase in total zzso
