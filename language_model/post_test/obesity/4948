To assess the use of oral zzso tolerance testing zzso to predict efficacy of insulin zzso zzso or suppression zzso because insulin resistance and insulin zzso may impact zzso efficacy in obese zzso 

zzso and 24 obese children, with and without central nervous system zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso sensitivity was expressed as composite insulin sensitivity index zzso and zzso as corrected insulin response zzso Those without zzso insult received zzso zzso zzso for 6 to 16 zzso Those with zzso insult received zzso zzso 15 zzso for 6 zzso Body mass index zzso and zzso responses were modeled using zzso and zzso 

zzso With zzso and zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso in white children declined by zzso over the first 4 months zzso zzso and by zzso over the next year zzso zzso zzso Each zzso increase in zzso or zzso attenuated zzso zzso reduction, but with wide uncertainty zzso zzso zzso Black children exhibited little zzso zzso With zzso and zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso decreased by zzso in the first 4 months zzso zzso zzso zzso was dependent on an interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso was predicted by zzso insulin zzso zzso of zzso was predicted by insulin zzso and zzso
