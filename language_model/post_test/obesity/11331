Children with obesity have a high cardiovascular risk and an impaired zzso status, which may lead to zzso dysfunction and increased carotid zzso media thickness zzso even in zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the circulating oxidized zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of carotid arteries in zzso obese children, and also to search for its possible association with carotid zzso 

zzso zzso obese children zzso zzso years; boys, zzso and 30 healthy children zzso zzso years; boys, zzso were included in the zzso zzso zzso of oxidized LDL, total cholesterol, zzso zzso zzso LDL, and zzso were measured, and carotid zzso was determined by zzso 

zzso oxidized LDL levels were significantly higher in zzso obese children than in healthy children zzso No significant correlation was observed between oxidized LDL levels and carotid zzso zzso However, a significant positive correlation was found between oxidized LDL levels and body mass index, total cholesterol, and zzso 

Our findings revealed that the zzso of LDL starts early in obese children but the carotid zzso is not significantly zzso Also, oxidized LDL levels are more strongly associated with obesity and zzso than the carotid zzso in zzso zzso
