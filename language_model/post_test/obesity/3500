The zzso zzso is poorly understood in vulnerable older hospitalized zzso 

To zzso analyze the impact of body mass index zzso and zzso on early zzso one- and two-year zzso 

Prospective zzso study with a two-year follow-up of old patients participating in the zzso cohort zzso 

Nine university hospitals in zzso 

Patients aged 75 or older hospitalized in medical divisions through the emergency zzso 

zzso characteristics were obtained through a comprehensive geriatric assessment of zzso conducted in the first week of zzso zzso zzso at zzso one- and two-year were determined using zzso and multivariable Cox zzso hazard zzso 

The zzso cohort included zzso patients, aged zzso years, with a majority of women zzso zzso and two-year mortality were zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso while early mortality was not, and positively associated with age, burden of zzso walking disorders, level of dependency and presence of a zzso zzso Survival rates between patients in low zzso zzso and intermediate zzso and zzso zzso zzso categories were not zzso 

While our findings seem to confirm the reality of the zzso zzso in vulnerable older hospitalized population, the exact understanding of underlying mechanisms and even the zzso of this paradoxical relationship are still fraught with considerable zzso zzso and zzso zzso
