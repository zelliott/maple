This study was conducted to evaluate the waist circumference zzso zzso points to predict cardiovascular risk factors in the overweight zzso zzso zzso measures, blood pressure, and zzso analyses were evaluated for the zzso participants of the Tehran zzso and zzso zzso Three thousand zzso subjects aged zzso years with a body mass index of zzso were enrolled in this zzso zzso obesity was defined as zzso or zzso zzso for men zzso or zzso zzso for zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso to detect various cardiovascular risk factors for men aged zzso years was between zzso and zzso and for men aged zzso years, was between zzso and zzso The specificity of this zzso point was between zzso and zzso and between zzso and zzso for corresponding zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso had a sensitivity of between zzso and 41 % for identifying cardiovascular risk factors in women aged zzso zzso zzso tended to increase with age and specificity tended to decrease with age in both zzso These zzso points had the highest positive zzso value for the more prevalent risk factors in both zzso The negative zzso values were different for various risk factors among age zzso The classic zzso points of zzso failed to provide adequate evidence for the use of zzso in detecting cardiovascular risk zzso Further studies should be conducted to determine optimal zzso zzso points for zzso
