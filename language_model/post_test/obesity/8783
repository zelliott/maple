We studied whether zzso is an independent associate of blood pressure in obese children and zzso 102 obese children zzso girls, age: zzso zzso zzso zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso blood zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 54 boys, age: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blood zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and insulin were measured by zzso zzso was determined zzso Fat mass zzso was calculated by zzso zzso zzso was higher in girls than in boys zzso but no significant gender differences were found with respect to zzso of zzso and zzso blood pressure zzso Children were divided into three groups, according to zzso stage zzso 1: zzso 32 zzso zzso Group zzso zzso 17 zzso zzso Group zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso and zzso correlated with body weight in the whole group zzso zzso and zzso zzso In Group 1, zzso showed the highest correlation to zzso in Group 3 no zzso of zzso were related to zzso In no case was zzso significantly associated with zzso after adjustment for zzso In Group 2, zzso was significantly associated with zzso after adjustment for body zzso In Group 3, however, no correlations were found between zzso zzso and zzso zzso perhaps due to small sample zzso zzso multiple zzso revealed that body weight and zzso contributed to the variation in zzso in the whole group zzso zzso zzso accounted for almost zzso of the variation in zzso zzso zzso Body weight contributed significantly to zzso in boys zzso zzso and girls zzso zzso The results imply that body weight contributes independently to the variation in blood zzso zzso and insulin contribute to mean blood pressure to some extent, but our data do not support the assumption that zzso per zzso serves as an independent predictor of blood pressure in obese children and zzso
