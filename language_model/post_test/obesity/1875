zzso is believed to play a role in the regulation of energy balance, but little is known about factors influencing plasma zzso zzso To determine the effect of short-term changes in energy balance, we measured plasma zzso zzso as well as plasma zzso insulin, zzso zzso fatty acid zzso and zzso rate in response to a standard test meal followed by a zzso fast in 21 healthy zzso zzso Plasma zzso zzso decreased by zzso zzso zzso 2-4 h after the test zzso They returned to baseline zzso h after the subjects ate, then subsequently zzso and, by the end of the fast, were an average of 37% below baseline zzso zzso Changes in plasma zzso zzso did not correlate with changes in plasma zzso insulin, zzso or zzso fatty acid zzso or with changes in zzso zzso The results of this study indicate that plasma zzso zzso decrease in response to short-term energy zzso These changes were not due to changes in zzso insulin, zzso or zzso fatty zzso nor did they relate to changes in zzso zzso The decrease in plasma zzso zzso with zzso may be an important zzso response to an energy deficit, stimulating food intake and thus restoring energy zzso
