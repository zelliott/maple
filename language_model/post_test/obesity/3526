zzso cartilage is sensitive to mechanical zzso so increased risk of zzso in older or obese individuals may be linked to changes in the relationship between cartilage properties and zzso joint zzso A positive relationship has been reported between ambulatory loads and cartilage thickness in young individuals, but whether this relationship exists in individuals who are older or obese is zzso This study examined the relationship between zzso cartilage thickness and load, measured by zzso and the peak zzso moment, in young zzso zzso subjects, age: zzso years, zzso zzso middle-aged zzso (27 subjects, zzso years, zzso young zzso (27 subjects, zzso years, zzso and middle-aged zzso (27 subjects, zzso years, zzso zzso On the lateral zzso cartilage thickness was positively correlated with zzso for all groups zzso zzso except the middle-aged zzso On the zzso zzso zzso was significantly correlated only in young zzso subjects zzso zzso as was the case for the correlation between zzso moment and zzso thickness ratio zzso zzso These results suggest that aging and obesity are both associated with a loss of the positive relationship between cartilage thickness and ambulatory zzso and that the relationship is dependent on the compartment and whether the load is generated by body size or zzso gait zzso
