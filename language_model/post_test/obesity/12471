zzso oxygen therapy is known to reduce zzso blood zzso in individuals with Type 2 zzso However, the mechanisms of this effect are not zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether peripheral insulin sensitivity by zzso zzso clamp is increased in patients presenting for zzso oxygen zzso 

Participants were non-obese individuals without Type 2 diabetes zzso or obese patients with Type 2 diabetes zzso Patients were given zzso oxygen at zzso absolute zzso for 2 zzso six sessions per week for 5 zzso 

zzso insulin sensitivity was increased in the whole cohort zzso zzso analysis revealed that this was significant at both treatment 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso and treatment 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly reduced in subjects without diabetes only zzso 

zzso sensitivity increased within 3 days of zzso oxygen treatment and this was maintained for 30 zzso This increase in insulin sensitivity is equivalent to that observed following moderate weight zzso The mechanisms underlying the zzso effect of zzso oxygen require further zzso
