zzso decreases bone mass by zzso the zzso signaling zzso We examined whether zzso bone loss is associated with the expression of zzso zzso male mice were assigned to one of two groups zzso each) and fed either a control diet zzso zzso from zzso zzso or a high-fat diet zzso zzso from zzso zzso for zzso zzso final body weight and whole body fat mass of the zzso mice were higher than those of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso bone mineral density and bone formation rate was lower in zzso mice than in zzso zzso The percent erosion surface was higher in the zzso mice than the zzso zzso The serum levels and zzso zzso protein expression levels of tumor necrosis zzso zzso were significantly higher in zzso mice than in zzso zzso zzso zzso levels and zzso zzso protein levels in zzso zzso were also higher in zzso mice than in zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso increased with zzso treatment, and zzso zzso expression was blocked by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso reporter zzso demonstrated that zzso directly binds to the zzso binding elements on the mouse zzso promoter and stimulates zzso zzso These results support a model in which, in the context of obesity or other inflammatory diseases that increase the production of zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso through zzso signaling pathway, thus contributing to bone zzso
