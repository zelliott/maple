zzso disease mortality has declined and diabetes mortality has increased in high-income zzso We estimated the potential role of trends in population body mass index, zzso blood pressure, serum total cholesterol and smoking in zzso mortality decline in 26 zzso zzso 

zzso data were from national vital zzso Body mass index, zzso blood pressure and serum total cholesterol were from a systematic analysis of zzso zzso We estimated the associations between change in zzso mortality and changes in risk factors, adjusted for change in per-capita gross domestic zzso We calculated the potential contribution of risk factor trends to mortality zzso 

Between 1980 and 2009, zzso zzso mortality declined in all 26 countries, with the annual decline between zzso in Mexico to zzso zzso in zzso Across the 26 countries together, risk factor trends may have accounted for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso mortality zzso zzso factor trends may have accounted zzso of decline among men and women in Finland and Switzerland, men in New Zealand and France, and women in zzso their benefits were smallest in Mexican, Portuguese, and Japanese men and Mexican zzso zzso factor trends may have slowed down mortality decline in Chilean men and women and had virtually no effect in Argentinean zzso The contributions of risk factors to mortality decline seemed substantially larger among men than among women in the USA, Canada and The zzso 

zzso countries have varied widely in the extent of risk factor zzso and its likely benefits for zzso zzso
