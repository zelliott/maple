zzso of gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso action and zzso of zzso zzso receptors represent mechanistically different approaches to the possible treatment of zzso zzso In the present study, we have compared the individual and combined effects of zzso and zzso as an zzso stable zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso injections of zzso alone and in combination with zzso in zzso mice for 34 days significantly decreased the energy intake throughout the entire study zzso to zzso Body weights were significantly depressed zzso to zzso in all treatment groups from day 18 zzso Administration of zzso zzso or a combination of both peptides significantly zzso to zzso decreased the overall zzso excursion in response to both oral and zzso zzso challenge when compared with the zzso Furthermore, oral zzso tolerance returned to lean control levels in all treatment zzso The beneficial effects on zzso zzso were not associated with altered insulin levels in any of the treatment zzso In keeping with this, the estimated insulin sensitivity was restored to control levels by zzso treatment with zzso zzso or a combination of both zzso The blood zzso profile on day 34 was not significantly different between the high-fat controls and all treated zzso 

These studies highlight the potential of zzso and zzso in the treatment of zzso diabetes, but there was no evidence of a synergistic effect of the combined zzso
