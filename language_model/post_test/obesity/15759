To assist in the development of preventive strategies, we studied whether the zzso environment or modifiable zzso zzso including zzso fitness zzso and physical activity zzso are independently associated with obesity and zzso risk markers in zzso 

We carried out a zzso analysis of 502 randomly selected first and fifth grade urban and rural Swiss schoolchildren with regard to zzso PA and the zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso measures included zzso sum of four zzso zzso zzso model assessment of insulin resistance zzso and a zzso clustered zzso risk zzso 

zzso and PA (especially total zzso but also the time spent engaged in light and in moderate and vigorous intensity zzso were zzso associated with measures of zzso zzso and the zzso risk score, independently of each other, and of zzso and nutritional zzso media use, sleep zzso zzso and the zzso environment (all p zzso Children living in a rural environment were more physically active and had higher zzso values and reduced zzso and zzso risk scores compared with children living in an urban environment (all p zzso These differences in cardiovascular risk factors persisted after adjustment for zzso total PA and zzso 

zzso zzso low PA and an urban environment are independently associated with an increase in zzso risk markers in zzso
