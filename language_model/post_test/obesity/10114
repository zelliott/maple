zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso share sequence similarity with the zzso for zzso an zzso zzso involved in body weight zzso We report here that zzso and zzso activate a similar pattern of zzso factors in zzso cells, and that zzso for zzso zzso zzso similarly to the zzso of zzso zzso are localized in mouse zzso zzso involved in the regulation of energy zzso zzso administration of zzso or zzso led to rapid induction of the zzso primary response gene in the zzso nucleus, suggesting that both zzso can signal to zzso zzso zzso zzso with this idea, zzso treatment of zzso mice, which lack functional zzso was found to reduce the zzso zzso and zzso associated with zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso also reduced zzso zzso in zzso mice, which lack functional zzso zzso and in mice with zzso zzso which are partially resistant to the actions of zzso The identification of a zzso zzso mechanism that acts independently of the zzso system may help to develop strategies for the treatment of obesity associated with zzso zzso
