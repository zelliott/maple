zzso is closely associated with chronic diseases such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes zzso zzso and zzso We analyzed the optimal obesity index zzso values for zzso syndrome zzso and identified the obesity index that is more closely associated with these chronic diseases, in a population of northern zzso 

We surveyed zzso adults zzso zzso zzso living in northern China for chronic zzso zzso operating characteristics zzso analysis, relative risk, and zzso zzso were used to develop an appropriate index and optimal zzso values for zzso and zzso chronic zzso 

zzso circumference zzso and body mass index zzso were good markers for zzso zzso was a good marker for zzso and zzso and zzso was a good marker for zzso The optimal zzso zzso value of zzso was 24 zzso and the optimal zzso zzso were 86 zzso and 78 zzso in men and women, zzso Relative risk zzso models showed that zzso was associated with hypertension, zzso and zzso and a higher prevalence ratio zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with zzso hypertension, and zzso with zzso of zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso In zzso zzso models, the standardized zzso zzso zzso of zzso were greater for zzso and zzso and the zzso of zzso was greater for zzso blood zzso zzso zzso blood zzso zzso and total zzso 

Our analysis of a population of northern Chinese indicates that the optimal zzso values for zzso are zzso of 86 zzso in men and 78 zzso in women and a zzso of 24 zzso in both zzso zzso was strongly associated with hypertension, while zzso was strongly associated with zzso and zzso
