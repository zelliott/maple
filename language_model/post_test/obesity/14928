The zzso of obesity remains incompletely understood and the exploration of the role of novel proteins in obesity may provide important insights into its causes and zzso Here, we report a previously unidentified role for zzso in the control of food intake and body zzso zzso a zzso zzso was initially identified as an interaction partner of zzso and has implications in Parkinson's disease zzso related to protein zzso 

To study the in zzso role of zzso we characterized a human zzso transgenic mouse zzso by assessing zzso zzso plasma zzso food intake and spontaneous activity to determine the major behavioral changes and their consequences in the development of the obesity zzso 

zzso of human zzso in brain zzso in zzso mice resulted in increased food zzso body weight and body zzso zzso mice also displayed zzso zzso and impaired zzso zzso zzso zzso mice to amounts consumed by zzso mice prevented the increased body weight, zzso zzso and zzso demonstrating that these were all the consequences of increased food zzso zzso expression of zzso was enriched in zzso zzso involved in feeding control, and zzso elevated zzso zzso levels at these sites, suggesting that zzso is an important player in the zzso energy balance regulatory zzso 

These studies identify a novel function of zzso in controlling food intake and body weight, and may provide a unique obesity model for future studies of obesity zzso and zzso
