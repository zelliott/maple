zzso arises mainly due to the imbalance between energy storage and its zzso zzso active brown zzso tissue zzso has recently been detected in humans and has been proposed as a new target for zzso therapy because of its unique capacity to regulate energy zzso zzso zzso a negative regulator of muscle mass, has been identified as a potential target to regulate overall body zzso Although the beneficial effects of zzso zzso on muscle mass are well known, its role in the regulation of zzso zzso and energy expenditure is not very zzso 

We tested the effects of zzso zzso on the gene regulatory networks that control BAT differentiation using both in zzso and in zzso model zzso zzso and zzso two key regulators of brown fat differentiation were significantly up regulated in zzso zzso and zzso zzso muscles as well as in zzso zzso and subcutaneous zzso fat pads isolated from zzso knock out zzso zzso male mice compared with wild type zzso zzso 

Using mouse embryonic zzso zzso primary cultures obtained from zzso zzso group compared to the zzso group undergoing zzso zzso we also demonstrate a significant increase in select genes and proteins that improve zzso metabolism and energy zzso 

Treatment of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso protein significantly inhibited the gene expression levels of zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso Future studies to extend these findings and explore the therapeutic potential of zzso zzso on zzso disorders are zzso
