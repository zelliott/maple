zzso is accompanied by zzso zzso inflammation of zzso zzso which promotes insulin resistance and zzso zzso These findings raise the question of how fat inflammation can escape the powerful zzso of cells and molecules normally responsible for guarding against a runaway immune zzso zzso zzso T regulatory zzso cells with a unique zzso were highly enriched in the abdominal fat of normal mice, but their numbers were zzso and specifically reduced at this site in zzso models of zzso zzso and zzso experiments revealed that these zzso cells influenced the inflammatory state of zzso tissue and, thus, insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso regulatory and conventional T cells directly affected the synthesis of inflammatory zzso and zzso zzso by cultured zzso These observations suggest that harnessing the zzso properties of zzso cells to inhibit elements of the zzso syndrome may have therapeutic zzso
