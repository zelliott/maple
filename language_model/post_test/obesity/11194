zzso M zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso plays important roles in a variety of biological functions, including inflammatory zzso However, the roles of zzso in zzso diseases are zzso We zzso analyzed the zzso parameters of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice under normal diet zzso At 32 weeks of age, zzso mice exhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and insulin zzso Surprisingly, insulin resistance without obesity was observed in zzso mice at 16 weeks of age, suggesting that insulin resistance precedes obesity in zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were expressed strongly in the zzso tissue and little in some other zzso zzso including the liver and skeletal zzso In addition, zzso is mainly expressed in the zzso tissue zzso zzso but not in zzso In zzso mice, the zzso were polarized to zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso tissue zzso Treatment of zzso mice with an zzso agent, sodium zzso improved insulin zzso In addition, the stimulation of a zzso cell line, zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso resulted in the increased expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, treatment of zzso mice with zzso increased insulin sensitivity and polarized the zzso of zzso to zzso Thus, zzso suppresses the development of insulin resistance at least in part through the polarization of the zzso zzso to zzso and zzso mice provide a unique mouse model of zzso zzso
