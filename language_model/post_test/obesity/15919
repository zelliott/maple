zzso factor zzso zzso or zzso is a zzso zzso zzso primarily associated in plasma with low density zzso zzso especially with small dense LDL zzso zzso Increased plasma zzso levels have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk in large clinical zzso 

To assess the effects of weight loss on zzso activity and to examine the association of zzso activity changes with the zzso of zzso the primary carrier of zzso in zzso 

zzso obese, zzso women participated in a weight reduction zzso zzso parameters were assessed and parameters of zzso zzso zzso profile, zzso activity, and LDL zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined at baseline and after zzso of weight zzso 

A zzso zzso weight loss resulted in significant improvement in most parameters of zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso activity was significantly reduced zzso zzso Mean LDL particle diameter did not change after the weight loss zzso The cholesterol levels of very zzso zzso zzso and zzso LDL particles were significantly reduced, but neither the cholesterol levels of zzso particles nor the % proportion of the zzso over the total zzso were changed after the intervention zzso Interestingly, the changes in zzso activity were correlated with the changes of zzso zzso zzso but not with the changes of zzso or other zzso zzso 

A low-calorie diet associated with weight loss in obese women resulted in the significant reduction of the plasma levels of zzso the potentially new predictor for incident zzso zzso
