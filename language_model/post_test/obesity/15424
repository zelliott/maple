We tested the hypothesis that insulin has effects on large artery zzso in addition to its slow zzso effect on resistance vessels in skeletal muscle, and whether such an effect might be altered in zzso Eight zzso zzso 25 zzso 1 years, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and eight obese zzso 27 zzso 2 years, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso men were studied under zzso zzso zzso insulin infusions of 1 zzso zzso and 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso conditions, and another seven men participated in a saline control zzso Central zzso pressure waves were zzso from those recorded in the periphery using zzso zzso and a validated reverse transfer function every 30 zzso This allowed determination of zzso (the pressure difference between early and late zzso pressure zzso and the zzso index zzso divided by pulse zzso a measure of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was reduced by 48 zzso 1) and zzso zzso 2) zzso zzso in the obese subjects versus the zzso zzso zzso zzso blood flow averaged zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the obese and zzso subjects, respectively zzso zzso induced a significant increase in zzso blood flow after zzso h zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso in the zzso subjects and after 4 h in the obese subjects zzso zzso zzso P zzso In contrast to these slow changes in peripheral blood flow, zzso and the zzso index decreased significantly in the zzso subjects after 1 h zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, P zzso zzso zzso but remained unchanged until 3 h in the obese zzso zzso fat zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso correlated with the change in the zzso index by zzso These data demonstrate zzso zzso in zzso vascular zzso zzso effect to decrease zzso zzso in zzso subjects (a decrease in wave zzso is observed under zzso conditions and precedes a slow zzso effect in the zzso In the obese subjects, zzso normal effect to decrease central wave reflection is severely zzso The degree of impairment in this novel vascular action of insulin is closely correlated with the degree of obesity and insulin action on zzso zzso
