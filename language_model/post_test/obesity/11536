Treating zzso zzso transcript zzso as quantitative traits and mapping gene expression quantitative trait zzso for these traits has been pursued in zzso zzso zzso zzso often serve as a surrogate for classical quantitative traits in that the levels of expression are significantly correlated with the classical traits across members of a segregating zzso The correlation structure between transcript zzso and classical traits has been used to identify zzso zzso for complex diseases such as diabetes and allergic zzso One study recently completed the first comprehensive dissection of zzso regulation in budding zzso giving a detailed glimpse of a zzso survey of the zzso of gene zzso Unlike classical quantitative traits, which often represent gross clinical zzso that may be far removed from the biological processes giving rise to them, the genetic linkages associated with transcript abundance zzso a closer look at cellular zzso zzso Here we describe comprehensive genetic screens of zzso plant and human zzso by considering gene expression values as quantitative zzso We identify a gene expression pattern strongly associated with obesity in a zzso zzso and observe two distinct obesity zzso Furthermore, we find that these obesity zzso are under the control of different zzso
