zzso zzso has been proposed to facilitate regulated zzso and specifically insulin zzso by generating zzso zzso We sought to examine the role of the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso and insulin zzso 

The response of zzso mice to zzso challenge and a type zzso zzso high-fat diet was examined in zzso zzso responses and zzso pancreatic zzso and zzso were characterized in zzso 

We show that zzso mice exhibit increased zzso insulin release and improved zzso zzso and resist high-fat zzso development of type zzso diabetes and zzso zzso pancreatic zzso cultured in zzso exhibited decreased numbers of insulin zzso zzso at the plasma membrane and released less insulin under zzso conditions, but then zzso similar amounts of insulin on zzso zzso zzso zzso depletion occurred on the plasma membrane of the zzso pancreatic zzso accompanied by a zzso loss of cortical zzso which was already decreased in the zzso zzso under resting zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso plays a complex role in restricting insulin release from pancreatic zzso through helping to maintain plasma membrane zzso levels and integrity of the zzso zzso under both zzso and zzso zzso The increased zzso zzso release of insulin observed on the normal diet may zzso the partial protection against the elevated serum zzso and obesity seen in type 2 zzso model zzso
