zzso is an zzso hormone that is produced primarily in the stomach, and stimulates food intake via its receptors situated in the zzso 

The purpose of this study was to characterize zzso zzso zzso and investigate the genetic influence on the variation in plasma zzso levels in zzso 

The sample consisted of 376 zzso zzso zzso 113 zzso from a pedigreed colony at the Southwest Foundation for zzso Research, San Antonio, zzso zzso zzso was cloned by zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso zzso zzso was performed to zzso zzso from the collected zzso zzso contribution to plasma zzso was estimated using a zzso components method implemented in zzso 

The zzso coding region and predicted zzso acid sequence for zzso showed 97 and zzso sequence identity with humans, zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso was detected in zzso and zzso Mean zzso zzso plasma levels of zzso were zzso zzso 99 zzso A significant zzso was observed for plasma zzso zzso zzso P zzso A zzso scan revealed the evidence of suggestive linkage for a locus affecting plasma zzso on zzso zzso (between markers zzso and zzso zzso of the odds zzso score zzso zzso zzso genetic correlations zzso zzso among zzso body weight, and zzso were zzso 

These results indicate a significant genetic component in the variation of plasma zzso in zzso and reveal a high degree of similarity between zzso and human zzso with respect to its zzso and its correlation with other obesity zzso
