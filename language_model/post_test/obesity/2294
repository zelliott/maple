zzso zzso measures designed to explain active travel fail to capture zzso and proximity to healthy zzso These zzso should be considered when measuring potential child zzso zzso 

The aim of this study was to describe the development of zzso zzso physical activity and nutrition environment indicators of child zzso environments in the San Diego and Seattle zzso 

Block zzso zzso zzso zzso residential density, land-use mix, and retail floor area zzso measures were constructed in each zzso Multiple sources were used to zzso parks zzso per zzso and food establishments zzso per zzso Physical activity environments were evaluated on the basis of zzso and presence and quality of zzso Nutrition environments were evaluated based on presence and density of fast-food restaurants and distance to zzso Four neighborhood types were defined using zzso cut points for physical activity and nutrition environments defined through an zzso process dependent on regional counts of fast-food outlets and overall distance to parks and grocery stores from census block groups where youth zzso 

To identify sufficient numbers of children aged zzso years, high physical activity environment block groups had at least one high-quality park within zzso miles and were above median zzso whereas low physical activity environment groups had no parks and were below median zzso High nutrition environment block groups had a supermarket within zzso miles, and fewer than 16 zzso and 31 zzso zzso fast-food restaurants within zzso zzso Low nutrition environments had either no zzso or a supermarket and more than 16 zzso and 31 zzso zzso fast-food restaurants within zzso zzso Income, educational zzso and ethnicity varied across physical activity and nutrition zzso 

These approaches to defining neighborhood environments can be used to study physical activity, nutrition, and obesity zzso zzso presented in a companion paper validate these zzso methods for measuring zzso zzso
