The shape of the association between zzso zzso and mortality has important zzso implications as it partially determines the optimal form for zzso zzso for use in zzso We examined various zzso zzso in relation to mortality from all causes and specific zzso 

A clinical examination with zzso of height and weight was conducted at baseline zzso for zzso working men aged zzso in the total cohort and zzso men in the healthy zzso that is, those who had no unexplained weight loss, no cardiovascular zzso or respiratory disease, were nonsmokers and did not die during the first 5 years of follow-up (the original zzso zzso A mean follow-up of 35 years for mortality gave rise to zzso deaths of which zzso were in the healthy zzso 

There was a zzso relation between zzso and zzso and coronary heart disease zzso mortality in the total cohort and healthy zzso with an increasingly steep slope at the high end of the zzso zzso For zzso cancer, and respiratory zzso an excess risk was also associated with a zzso zzso in the healthy zzso this was true only for respiratory zzso The association between zzso and zzso mortality was zzso in the total cohort and healthy zzso and even after excluding zzso zzso 

For associations with zzso and zzso zzso a linear and zzso term in combination provided a more zzso zzso zzso than the WHO definition, zzso zzso or zzso treated as a continuous linear zzso
