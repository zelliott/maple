zzso acid zzso and zzso play an important role in zzso and whole body zzso zzso We examined the role that key zzso factors played in the control of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Studies with zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso mice establish that zzso was required for zzso induction of fatty acid zzso zzso zzso and all three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Increased nuclear zzso element binding zzso zzso correlated with enhanced expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Only zzso was also regulated independently by liver X zzso zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression required the zzso element binding zzso factor X zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso expression in zzso of zzso diabetic rats and high zzso zzso mice correlated with low levels of nuclear zzso In zzso obese mice zzso increased zzso and zzso nuclear content correlated with the induction of zzso zzso and zzso expression and the massive zzso of zzso fatty acids zzso and zzso in neutral zzso zzso and zzso changes in zzso zzso composition correlated with changes in zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, these studies establish a role for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the control of zzso fatty acid zzso and zzso expression and zzso zzso
