The effects of zzso infusions on urinary and zzso zzso zzso serum zzso and nitrogen balance were examined in seven zzso and three nutritionally depleted adult surgical patients receiving total zzso zzso They were maintained on constant nitrogen and caloric intake for 14 zzso 2 zzso zzso doses ranged from 0 to zzso zzso and were given in varying crossover zzso In both groups, urinary zzso zzso increased as the amount of zzso infused increased but, at comparable zzso zzso depleted patients zzso significantly less zzso Renal conservation was most pronounced in zzso patients on zzso intake and in depleted patients given 70 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso losses were 40 zzso 5 zzso and 33 zzso 8 zzso respectively, in these two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was minimal and ranged from 2 to 38 zzso At each level of zzso zzso serum levels of zzso patients were zzso With infusions of less than 200 zzso serum zzso zzso in depleted subjects averaged zzso zzso zzso urinary zzso zzso as well as borderline serum levels measured in depleted adults suggest that the zzso dosage should be higher than that usually recommended during total zzso zzso In both groups a positive correlation between zzso and nitrogen balance was zzso
