We aimed to determine whether an increased rate of zzso fatty acid zzso transport and/or a reduction in zzso zzso contributes to zzso deposition in hearts, as zzso zzso within cardiac muscle has been associated with heart zzso In hearts of lean and obese zzso rats we zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso content and distribution using transmission electron zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in cardiac zzso and in isolated zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso rates of zzso transport into cardiac zzso Compared to lean rats, in obese zzso rats, zzso zzso size was similar but there were more zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso rates and contents were markedly zzso zzso analyses and zzso zzso showed that SS and zzso zzso in obese animals did not appear to be different in their appearance, area, density and number, nor in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activities, electron transport chain zzso nor in their rates of zzso zzso either in cardiac zzso or in isolated SS and zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso plasma membrane fatty acid binding protein zzso and fatty acid zzso zzso protein and zzso transport rates into cardiac zzso were increased zzso zzso zzso in obese zzso zzso these data indicate that zzso dysfunction in zzso zzso is not responsible for zzso zzso in obese zzso rat zzso Rather, increased zzso zzso transport proteins and rates of zzso transport result in a greater number of zzso droplets within cardiac zzso
