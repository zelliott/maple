zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were investigated in rats 1 week after zzso zzso The zzso activities were measured using zzso zzso as a zzso Two zzso were measured separately using specific zzso prepared against zzso zzso rats fed ad zzso showed an increase in plasma zzso with normal zzso activity and an zzso of plasma zzso There was a positive correlation between zzso activity and insulin levels in zzso zzso When rats were examined after overnight fast, zzso rats again showed an increase in plasma zzso with normal zzso activity and an zzso of plasma zzso There was also a positive correlation between plasma zzso activity and insulin zzso In order to examine the effect of insulin, rats were treated with daily doses of 3 units of insulin for 1 zzso zzso fed ad zzso were insulin treatment showed an increase in plasma zzso with normal zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso which was produced by zzso zzso may increase zzso zzso zzso We speculate that this increase in zzso activity mainly reflects that of zzso zzso The increase of zzso activity can accelerate fat deposition into zzso zzso contributing to one of the factors causing zzso zzso
