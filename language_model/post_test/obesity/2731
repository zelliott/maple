It has been proposed that fetal exposure to environmental zzso such as zzso during critical periods of development may lead to adaptations that permanently change the structure and function of the zzso These adaptations may be important for immediate survival during fetal development, but can zzso to disease in later zzso We designed a pilot study investigating the effect of fetal zzso on the zzso peptides zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels in zzso We also wanted to explore changes in zzso and insulin zzso zzso rats were randomly assigned to three dietary treatment groups on day 4 of zzso The control group was fed ad zzso and the zzso rats received either zzso or 50% of ad zzso food intake until zzso zzso levels of zzso peptides as well as zzso and insulin levels were measured from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were higher in both zzso groups and serum zzso concentration was lower in the 50% zzso group compared to the control zzso zzso total cholesterol levels were significantly higher in both zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso during fetal development may lead to zzso changes in zzso zzso hormones as well as evoking adverse changes in serum cholesterol zzso The observed changes may zzso to insulin resistance and significantly increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease in later zzso
