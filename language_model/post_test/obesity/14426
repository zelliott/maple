zzso a zzso zzso zzso is zzso and zzso by zzso cells and is found in the zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein was analyzed in zzso during zzso zzso and in several experimental models of zzso zzso zzso abundance is increased in zzso tissue during zzso in normal rats and in diabetes due to zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso abundance decreased during the continuous infusion of zzso which zzso a zzso zzso state that is accompanied by an increased zzso zzso it is suppressed zzso than zzso in two strains of genetically obese mice zzso and zzso compared to their zzso counterparts, and is also reduced when obesity is induced chemically by injection of zzso zzso into newborn zzso zzso zzso protein is decreased in these animal models of zzso as determined by zzso with zzso to zzso Little change in zzso expression is observed in a model of obesity obtained by pure zzso of normal rats zzso zzso These data suggest a possible role for zzso in the zzso zzso zzso states, and raise the possibility that zzso expression may be used to distinguish zzso that arise from certain genetic or zzso defects from those that result from pure zzso
