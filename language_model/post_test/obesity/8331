zzso fat may have a local adverse effect on the zzso We evaluated whether zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso a type of zzso fat, and visceral zzso tissue zzso were associated with vascular zzso 

zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso Heart Study participants using zzso zzso vascular function was assessed using zzso artery zzso function, peripheral zzso tone, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean age, 50 years; mean body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso Using multiple linear regression, the relationships between zzso zzso and vascular measures was examined while adjusting for cardiovascular risk zzso 

Mean zzso and zzso volumes were zzso and 1763 zzso zzso zzso and zzso were associated with multiple vascular function measures after multivariable zzso After zzso adjustment, zzso and zzso remained zzso associated with peripheral zzso tone and inverse carotid zzso pulse wave zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso associated with zzso mean flow zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with vascular function were attenuated after zzso adjustment (all zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and visceral fat are associated with zzso function and large artery zzso after zzso zzso These findings support the growing recognition of associations between zzso fat and vascular zzso
