zzso to obesity is highly variable in humans, and rats fed a high fat diet zzso are used as a model of this zzso Energy expenditure components zzso zzso zzso effect of zzso zzso and variations in zzso zzso are possible factors underlying the zzso Unfortunately, in rats as in humans, results have often been zzso and zzso usually made after obesity zzso obscuring if metabolism was a cause or zzso Additionally, the role of high zzso diet zzso has seldom been zzso 

zzso zzso were fed for 3 weeks on zzso and then 3 weeks on zzso Body composition was tracked by zzso and compared to energy expenditure components measured prior to zzso 

1) under zzso as expected, by zzso rats were variable enough to be zzso into relatively fat resistant zzso and sensitive zzso groups, 2) under zzso and again by zzso rats were also variable enough to be zzso into zzso resistant zzso and sensitive zzso groups, the normal body weight of zzso rats hiding zzso fat zzso 3) zzso zzso sensitivity was not related to that under zzso and both zzso and zzso zzso sensitivities were not related to energy expenditure components zzso zzso activity zzso and 4) only zzso to fat zzso in response to an zzso test meal was related to zzso zzso 

The rat model of human obesity is based on substantial zzso in zzso gains under zzso zzso zzso Here, since we also found this phenomenon under zzso where it was also linked to an identifiable zzso difference, we should consider the existence of another model: the zzso resistant zzso or sensitive zzso zzso This new model is potentially complementary to the zzso model due to relatively greater visceral fat zzso on a low fat high zzso zzso
