We have isolated zzso clones that zzso a novel human gene related to zzso zzso analysis of this zzso named zzso for zzso transcript, predicts a zzso protein that is zzso identical to human zzso The highest degree of identity is within the zzso zzso of both zzso Like zzso ART contains a putative signal sequence and a zzso rich zzso zzso but lacks the region of basic zzso and zzso zzso found in the middle of the zzso zzso Both zzso and ART contain 11 zzso and 9 of these are zzso zzso ART is expressed primarily in the adrenal zzso zzso nucleus, and zzso with a lower level of expression occurring in zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso of ART was also isolated and is predicted to zzso a zzso protein that shares zzso zzso acid identity to zzso The mouse was found to have the same expression pattern as human when assessed by zzso zzso by in zzso zzso using mouse zzso showed localized expression in the zzso nucleus of the zzso the median zzso and the adrenal zzso In addition, the zzso expression of ART was elevated approximately zzso in zzso and zzso zzso ART was mapped to human zzso zzso and to mouse zzso zzso The expression pattern and zzso regulation of zzso coupled with the known actions of zzso suggests a role for ART in the regulation of zzso receptors within the zzso and adrenal zzso and implicates this novel gene in the central control of zzso
