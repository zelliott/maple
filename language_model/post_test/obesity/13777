zzso obese zzso rats share several abnormalities with obese zzso inheritance of the zzso zzso zzso Because zzso in membrane fatty acid composition and in zzso synthesis can be involved in the genesis of the cardiovascular complications of zzso cardiac zzso and zzso fatty acid composition were compared in obese and lean zzso zzso cardiac zzso produced smaller amounts of zzso zzso zzso and zzso than lean zzso less than zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso by the calcium zzso A zzso were not zzso zzso fatty acid composition of obese zzso was zzso the amount of zzso zzso zzso and zzso acids was zzso whereas the amount of zzso acid, the precursor of zzso acid, was zzso It is concluded that obesity in zzso rats is associated with zzso of cardiac zzso acid metabolism and that the zzso associated with obesity can be studied in this rat zzso
