We have previously shown that following zzso gold zzso zzso zzso obese mice exhibit zzso weight loss and a pronounced zzso which leads ultimately to their zzso In the present study, we sought to determine whether the increased zzso tissue mass which is characteristic of zzso obese mice exerted a role in the onset and development of anorexia after zzso zzso the effects of zzso on food zzso weight gain, plasma zzso and zzso levels were investigated in normal zzso controls, zzso zzso obese mice and zzso non obese zzso The zzso non obese mice were prepared by restricting their daily intake of zzso zzso to that consumed by normal zzso zzso After zzso all mice were allowed free access to zzso As expected, all zzso zzso obese mice exhibited anorexia and weight loss following zzso In contrast, about half zzso of the zzso non obese mice exhibited anorexia and weight loss after zzso The response of the zzso non obese zzso mice was not due to differences in adrenal zzso since all zzso mice had blood levels of zzso of less than zzso zzso These findings indicate that whereas the increased zzso tissue mass of the zzso obese mice appears to be associated with an increased zzso of anorexia following zzso increased zzso tissue mass alone does not appear to be essential for the occurrence of zzso
