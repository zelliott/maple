To assess how well the zzso a zzso generic quality of life zzso zzso compares with its shorter adaptation, the zzso in capturing differences in zzso among patients with and without zzso 

We compared the correlation between the physical zzso and mental zzso component summary measures of the zzso and zzso among zzso primary care patients using zzso zzso zzso and conducted linear zzso models to see how these summary measures captures the variation across zzso We used model zzso to assess zzso how well each measure explained the variation across zzso 

zzso between zzso and zzso were higher for the zzso in obese zzso zzso zzso compared to overweight zzso zzso zzso and normal weight patients zzso zzso zzso p zzso but were similar for the zzso across zzso Compared to normal weight patients, obese patients scored zzso points lower on the zzso and zzso points lower on the zzso after adjustment for age, sex, and race; the model zzso was higher with zzso zzso zzso zzso than with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not significantly associated with either the zzso or zzso 

The zzso correlated highly with zzso in obese and non-obese patients and appeared to be a better measure of differences in zzso associated with zzso
