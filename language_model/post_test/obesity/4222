The synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso is an extremely potent zzso of zzso zzso In cells undergoing zzso zzso prevents zzso zzso in an zzso zzso However, in zzso evidence for effects of zzso on obesity is zzso The goals of these studies were to determine if zzso can prevent high-fat zzso zzso in the zzso and to zzso the molecular target of drug zzso zzso and zzso zzso female mice were zzso 3 times per week with 30 zzso zzso or vehicle by oral zzso during 95 days of access to a control diet or a high-fat zzso Body zzso organ zzso zzso fat zzso and gene expression were zzso Treatment with zzso effectively prevented high-fat zzso increases in body weight, zzso mass, and zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice but not in zzso zzso zzso mice on a high-fat diet and treated with zzso exhibited higher oxygen consumption and energy expenditure than zzso mice, while food intake was lower in zzso than zzso zzso zzso of gene transcripts for fatty acid synthesis zzso were zzso after zzso treatment in the liver of zzso zzso This zzso effect of zzso on zzso gene expression was significantly reduced in zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso is an zzso potent agent for preventing zzso and identify the zzso zzso as a novel target for management of zzso
