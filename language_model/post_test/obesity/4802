The prevalence of insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease zzso increases with degree of zzso Whether zzso of generalized and abdominal obesity differ in the ability to predict changes associated with increased zzso risk is widely zzso We compared the prevalence of zzso abnormalities in 275 women and 204 men zzso by categories of body mass index zzso and waist circumference zzso and assessed the ability of these zzso zzso in combination with zzso risk variables to predict insulin zzso 

zzso zzso volunteers underwent zzso of zzso zzso blood pressure, zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso and direct zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance was defined as the top zzso of zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were highly correlated zzso zzso in both women and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were associated with increasing zzso by either index in both zzso Among women, abnormal zzso and high density zzso cholesterol zzso zzso were associated with increasing zzso and zzso In men, abnormal zzso was associated with increasing zzso zzso zzso zzso blood pressure zzso was associated with increasing zzso in both zzso The odds of insulin resistance were greatest in women with elevated zzso and zzso zzso In men, the best zzso were zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso is at least comparable to zzso in zzso individuals for prevalence of zzso abnormalities associated with increased zzso risk and predicting insulin zzso
