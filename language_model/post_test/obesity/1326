To examine the contribution of obesity to insulin resistance and abnormalities of zzso zzso and fat metabolism in zzso 

zzso turnover zzso and indirect zzso were performed in 10 obese zzso diabetes zzso zzso and 10 lean zzso subjects zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso in the zzso state and during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and lean zzso subjects demonstrated similar zzso rates of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso During zzso zzso clamp studies, rates of zzso were lower in obese zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso P zzso zzso zzso as were rates of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although absolute rates of zzso zzso were decreased in the obese group, the relative distribution into zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso metabolism zzso was comparable in both groups zzso zzso in obese and zzso in lean zzso zzso zzso in obese and 59% in lean zzso The zzso groups had similar zzso free fatty acid levels that were suppressed equally during zzso zzso However, zzso fat zzso (Fox) was greater in the obese zzso group zzso zzso 11 zzso 73 zzso 8 zzso P zzso zzso zzso and was less suppressed to insulin zzso zzso 13 zzso 16 zzso 3 zzso P zzso zzso zzso 

These results indicate that when obesity is present in zzso subjects with this degree of zzso zzso zzso is lower by zzso zzso zzso in obese zzso subjects leads to decreased zzso zzso availability and lower rates of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso suppression of Fox is also impaired when obesity is present and may contribute to decreased zzso zzso in zzso We conclude that obesity increases insulin resistance in zzso primarily by effects on zzso rather than the zzso pathways of zzso zzso
