The zzso gene has been identified as an energy zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso precursor protein that is processed to yield an incompletely characterized panel of zzso Until now, it was an unproved assumption that zzso peptides could regulate zzso Here, a zzso zzso designated zzso was identified in rat brain extracts by means of zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso and database searching zzso zzso zzso zzso injection of zzso (15 zzso for 14 zzso increased resting energy expenditure zzso and zzso temperature in zzso These effects were paralleled by increased zzso and zzso of brown zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso and white zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein 1) zzso and were independent of locomotor activity and zzso zzso zzso gene expression of zzso and zzso zzso was zzso Furthermore, in mice that were fed a high-fat diet for 14 days, zzso prevented the increase in body and zzso weight as well as hormonal changes that are associated with a high-fat zzso zzso and molecular analyses suggest that zzso exerts its effects by stimulating zzso zzso of adrenal zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, we present here the identification in the zzso of a previously zzso zzso zzso and prove that its chronic zzso infusion zzso an increase in zzso and limited the early phase of zzso zzso
