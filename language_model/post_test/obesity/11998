To establish animal models with zzso zzso disorders similar to human zzso syndrome, 2 zzso dietary habits featuring a high fat content and a zzso zzso zzso alone or in zzso were tested on zzso rats and zzso zzso The 2 dietary habits were, respectively, simulated by feeding a high-fat diet zzso zzso or additionally providing zzso zzso zzso in the drinking water zzso zzso Using a 2 zzso 2 zzso design, 4 groups of animals were fed zzso diet plus plain water zzso zzso high-fat diet zzso zzso zzso plus plain water zzso zzso zzso diet plus zzso in drinking water zzso B), and high-fat diet plus zzso in drinking water zzso zzso for 26 zzso In zzso rats, regimen B caused a significant increase in visceral zzso serum levels of zzso zzso insulin, and zzso zzso insulin zzso and blood pressure, whereas regimen A only caused a significant increase in visceral fat and serum insulin levels zzso zzso In contrast, regimen A induced a full array of zzso syndrome in zzso zzso but regimen B only caused slight obesity and zzso In both zzso rats and zzso mice, there were no additive effects of the 2 regimens, indicated by significant interactions between regimens A and B on the zzso indexes zzso These results show that, in terms of inducing zzso syndrome, zzso rats are more responsive to zzso water regimen, whereas zzso mice are more responsive to the high-fat diet zzso
