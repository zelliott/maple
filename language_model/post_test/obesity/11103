It has been hypothesized that a greater decline in circulating zzso zzso acids zzso after weight loss induced by zzso gastric bypass zzso surgery than after calorie restriction alone has independent effects on zzso zzso possibly by decreased signaling through the zzso target of zzso zzso We evaluated plasma zzso and their zzso and zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso zzso and insulin sensitivity zzso zzso zzso in obese subjects before and after zzso weight loss induced by zzso zzso zzso 10, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso adjustable gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso 10, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Weight loss increased zzso zzso Rd by zzso decreased total plasma zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso and did not alter zzso zzso no differences were detected between surgical groups (all P values for zzso zzso zzso Rd correlated zzso with plasma zzso and with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso values zzso to zzso P zzso These data demonstrate that weight loss induced by either zzso or zzso causes the same decline in circulating zzso and their zzso and zzso zzso zzso Plasma zzso concentration is zzso associated with skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity, but the zzso responsible for this relationship is not zzso
