It is well known that cardiovascular risk factors and zzso along with obesity can be identified early in zzso zzso lipids and zzso influence skin vessel zzso in zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the zzso zzso and its correlation to zzso in obese zzso Thirty-four obese children and an equal number of zzso and zzso healthy children were enrolled in this zzso zzso zzso zzso and dynamic zzso were performed to measure total zzso blood flow and nutritional blood flow, zzso A significantly higher zzso baseline flow and peak flow after a zzso zzso zzso was noticed in obese group as compared to normal zzso zzso of dynamic zzso revealed values of resting zzso blood cell zzso that did not differ from controls but a significantly lower peak zzso after a zzso zzso zzso in zzso Plasma lipids examination showed a high zzso and low high density zzso cholesterol levels in zzso zzso analysis detected no significant correlations between zzso baseline flow and peak flow and zzso in zzso These results may be explained by the fact that the duration of zzso in our study population was not long enough to cause vascular damage or the zzso was not pronounced enough to have an impact on skin vessel activity zzso It is also possible, that the combination of methods used in the present study was not sensitive enough to detect an existing correlations between flow values and high zzso zzso values in the obese zzso Our results suggest that all the responses of the zzso zzso were mainly due to zzso zzso rather than pathological reactions in young obese zzso The results of zzso zzso assessment in obese children provide follow-up parameters for assessing the risk of cardiovascular diseases later in zzso
