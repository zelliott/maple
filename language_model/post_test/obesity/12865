The obese zzso rat is an animal model of genetically inherited obesity demonstrating remarkable zzso In the present study, to try to clarify the relationship between obesity and gastric function including gastric zzso integrity, the gastric acid zzso zzso and zzso resistance against zzso agents were compared in lean and obese zzso zzso Male lean and obese zzso rats were housed at 25 degrees C under zzso lighting cycle (on at zzso zzso The gastric acid output of obese zzso rats was markedly smaller than that of lean zzso rats, whereas there was no significant difference in gastric zzso in both zzso The degree of zzso zzso formation induced by zzso agents was assessed by measuring the total length of all zzso zzso observed zzso zzso zzso The zzso administration of zzso (20 zzso produced zzso zzso zzso in both lean and obese groups of zzso rats, but the zzso index was remarkably smaller in obese zzso rats than that of their lean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso P zzso In addition obese zzso rats exhibited stronger resistance against the zzso challenge of absolute ethanol (1 zzso a zzso agent, with its zzso index being zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with lean zzso rats whose zzso index was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The bilateral zzso zzso decreased both gastric acid zzso and the zzso index of zzso gastric injury observed in both obese and lean zzso rats, whereas there was no significant difference in the zzso index of zzso gastric zzso These results suggest that obese zzso rats exhibit enhanced resistance against zzso and decreased acid zzso It is also speculated that the zzso system might be involved in zzso of acid zzso and formation of zzso zzso in obese zzso zzso
