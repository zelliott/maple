Previous studies have examined the relationship between zzso body mass, and zzso zzso The present study directly compares the relationship of zzso and zzso in 5 groups of girls with different combinations of zzso status and zzso 

We studied girls with idiopathic precocious zzso zzso non-obese zzso girls, zzso obese zzso girls, normal zzso girls, and obese zzso girls zzso 

zzso levels were significantly higher in obese zzso girls zzso zzso than in all zzso zzso levels were significantly higher in obese zzso girls zzso zzso zzso compared to girls with precocious zzso zzso zzso zzso non-obese zzso girls zzso zzso zzso and normal zzso girls zzso zzso zzso zzso level did not correlate significantly with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso level for zzso zzso stage, and zzso was significantly lower in the obese zzso group than in the 3 non-obese zzso 

These findings confirm previous studies that body mass, zzso age and zzso stage are zzso of zzso zzso However, these are not the only factors determining zzso level as evidenced by persistent differences in zzso level between obese and non-obese zzso girls even when correcting for zzso stage and zzso While the present study provides no new answers to the question of zzso regulation, it provides a direct comparison of combinations of weight, zzso stage, and zzso level, as background for future zzso
