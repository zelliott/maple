The zzso sleep zzso syndrome is typically associated with conditions known to increase insulin resistance as hypertension, zzso and zzso We investigated whether zzso sleep zzso itself is an independent risk factor for increased insulin resistance and whether continuous positive airway pressure zzso treatment improves insulin zzso Forty patients zzso zzso zzso were treated with zzso Before, 2 days after, and after 3 months of effective zzso treatment, zzso zzso clamp studies were zzso zzso sensitivity significantly increased after 2 days zzso zzso zzso baseline versus zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and remained stable after 3 months of zzso The improvement in insulin sensitivity after 2 days was much greater in patients with a body mass index less than 30 zzso than in more obese zzso The improved insulin sensitivity after 2 nights of treatment may reflect a decreasing sympathetic activity, indicating that sleep zzso is an independent risk factor for increased insulin zzso The effect of zzso on insulin sensitivity is smaller in obese patients than in zzso patients, suggesting that in obese individuals insulin sensitivity is mainly determined by obesity and, to a smaller extent, by sleep zzso
