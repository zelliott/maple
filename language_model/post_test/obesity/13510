zzso zzso effectively treat zzso bone disease, zzso and zzso zzso exposure, however, may be associated with zzso of the jaw zzso The aim of the present study was to estimate the magnitude of the association between intravenous zzso zzso exposure and zzso and to identify potential zzso 

Using a zzso study design, the investigators identified and adjudicated a sample of cases with zzso and matched them randomly with 5 controls per zzso The controls were matched to cases on age, zzso cancer type, and date of cancer zzso The medical records were zzso and data on zzso exposure, cancer therapy, and zzso were zzso zzso analyses were carried out using conditional zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso College Station, zzso 

Thirty cases of zzso were identified at Massachusetts General Hospital from February 2003 through February zzso zzso was found to zzso significant risk toward development of zzso zzso odds ratio zzso zzso P zzso Although a trend toward increased risk was noted for zzso this association was not significant after controlling for zzso zzso and smoking were associated significantly with zzso development, whereas oral zzso had no zzso 

In this study, cancer patients who had received zzso exhibited a significant zzso increase in their risk to develop zzso More studies are needed to zzso the exact role of obesity and smoking in the development of zzso and the complex interactions of IV zzso with other zzso during cancer zzso
