To test the effect of different doses of zzso training on insulin resistance, zzso visceral fat, and fitness in overweight, sedentary children and to test moderation by sex and zzso 

zzso controlled efficacy trial conducted from 2003 through 2007 in which 222 overweight or obese sedentary children zzso age, zzso years; zzso zzso zzso zzso were recruited from 15 public schools in the Augusta, Georgia, zzso 

Children were randomly assigned to zzso (20 zzso zzso zzso zzso or high-dose (40 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso training (5 zzso mean zzso 13 zzso zzso weeks) or a control condition zzso physical zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso primary outcomes were zzso type 2 diabetes risk assessed by insulin area under the curve zzso from an oral zzso tolerance test, zzso fitness zzso oxygen consumption zzso percent body fat via zzso zzso zzso and visceral fat via magnetic zzso analyzed by intention to zzso 

The study had zzso retention zzso zzso zzso Most children zzso were zzso At zzso mean body mass index was 26 zzso zzso zzso in insulin zzso were larger in the high-dose group zzso mean difference, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the zzso group zzso mean difference, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso than the control zzso zzso trends were also observed for body fat zzso mean difference, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso and visceral fat zzso mean difference, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso P zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso vs control groups, zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso groups vs control were similar for fitness zzso mean difference in peak zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso group effects were similar for these zzso There was no moderation by sex or zzso
