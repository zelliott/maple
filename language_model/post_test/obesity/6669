Growing evidence shows that dietary factors can dramatically alter the gut zzso in ways that contribute to zzso zzso and progression of zzso In this regard, zzso zzso tissue has been implicated in zzso these processes through the zzso of zzso zzso In this study, we examined the relationship of these events by determining the effects of dietary fat content and source on gut zzso as well as the effects on zzso profiles of zzso and peripheral zzso 

Adult male zzso mice were fed milk zzso zzso zzso fatty acid zzso or zzso oil zzso fatty zzso high-fat diets for 4 zzso Body mass and food consumption were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated and analyzed via terminal restriction zzso length zzso as well as variable zzso sequence tags via next-generation zzso zzso and zzso zzso samples were analyzed for both zzso and inflammatory zzso via quantitative real-time zzso chain zzso 

zzso zzso caused more weight gain with zzso increases in caloric consumption relative to low-fat zzso In addition, each of the high-fat diets induced dramatic and specific zzso zzso zzso profiles that were associated with different inflammatory and zzso zzso profiles of zzso and zzso fat zzso 

Our findings support the notion that dietary fat composition can both reshape the gut zzso and alter host zzso tissue zzso zzso They also demonstrate the zzso of dietary fat source, zzso gut zzso and inflammatory profile of zzso fat that can collectively affect the host zzso zzso
