zzso rates of the zzso of low density zzso zzso and cholesterol balance were determined in six obese men and six control zzso The two groups were of similar age and matched for zzso zzso zzso of plasma total cholesterol in obese patients zzso zzso 14 zzso zzso were similar to controls zzso zzso 17 zzso zzso was zzso but not statistically lower in obese subjects zzso zzso 18 zzso compared to controls (145 zzso 13 zzso zzso rates of zzso in contrast were higher in obese patients zzso zzso than in controls zzso zzso zzso less than zzso Three factors could explain the similar zzso of zzso in obese and control subjects, despite overproduction of zzso in the zzso First, LDL was diluted into a larger plasma pool in obese zzso second, fractional zzso rates of zzso were somewhat greater in obese men than in zzso and third, obese patients had higher ratios of zzso in zzso The production of zzso for all patients was not correlated with total body synthesis of zzso The major finding of this study was that obese patients have increased turnover of zzso not necessarily reflected by high zzso of zzso This high turnover rate itself may raise the risk for coronary heart disease in obese zzso
