Fat and muscle areas can be calculated from equations on the basis of upper arm circumference zzso and zzso zzso thickness zzso These equations assume a circular limb and muscle compartment and a zzso distributed fat zzso total upper arm area zzso zzso zzso zzso upper arm muscle area zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso zzso and upper arm fat area zzso zzso zzso - zzso This traditional method zzso the degree of zzso We propose that the unrolled fat rim is a rectangle whose length zzso C and zzso zzso zzso The following new indexes are based on this zzso upper arm fat area estimate zzso zzso C zzso zzso and upper arm muscle area estimate zzso zzso zzso - zzso To validate these zzso areas were measured with magnetic resonance imaging zzso in 28 children aged zzso y (17 control subjects and 11 obese zzso zzso between zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso were similar zzso zzso zzso for both correlations in the control group and r zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in the obese group), but the areas assessed by zzso zzso zzso were closer to zzso zzso zzso than to zzso zzso zzso in the control group as well as in the obese group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The limits of agreement between zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso showing that zzso is not acceptable in most cases, whereas zzso zzso are close to zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso are simple and accurate indexes to assess body zzso French reference values are available from 1 zzso to 17 y of zzso
