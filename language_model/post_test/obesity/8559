To determine maternal parameters with the strongest influence on fetal growth in different periods of zzso complicated by an abnormal zzso tolerance test zzso 

zzso study of 368 women with zzso diabetes zzso zzso or zzso 2 abnormal zzso values, zzso zzso zzso and impaired zzso tolerance zzso one abnormal value, zzso zzso zzso with zzso ultrasound examinations at entry to and during diabetic zzso Both groups were managed zzso zzso circumference zzso or zzso 90th zzso defined fetal zzso zzso historical and clinical zzso and diagnostic and zzso values of zzso profiles divided into five categories of 4 weeks of zzso age zzso zzso weeks, 24 zzso days to 27 zzso days, zzso zzso and zzso zzso to as zzso zzso 24 zzso 28 zzso 32 zzso and 36 zzso categories, zzso were tested by zzso and multiple zzso zzso analysis for their ability to predict an zzso or zzso 90th zzso at each zzso group and zzso zzso zzso Data obtained at entry were also analyzed separately irrespective of the zzso 

zzso weight, zzso after therapy, rates of fetal zzso and zzso were not significantly different between zzso and zzso thus, both groups were analyzed zzso zzso in a previous pregnancy, zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso obesity zzso or zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso independently predicted zzso or zzso 90th zzso at zzso When data for each zzso category were zzso no zzso were found for zzso zzso Independent zzso for each subsequent zzso category were as zzso at 24 zzso zzso history zzso zzso at 28 zzso zzso history zzso zzso and obesity zzso zzso at 32 zzso zzso zzso of 32 zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso at 36 zzso zzso zzso of 32 zzso zzso zzso and for zzso at birth, zzso history zzso zzso and obesity zzso zzso 

In the late second and early third zzso maternal zzso and zzso in a previous pregnancy appear to have the strongest influence on fetal growth, while later in the third zzso zzso with the period of maximum growth described in diabetic zzso maternal zzso zzso
