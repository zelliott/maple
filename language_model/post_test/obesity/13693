Increased tissue activity of cortisol induced by the zzso of zzso zzso to active cortisol through zzso zzso type 1 zzso may play a role in the zzso zzso We recently found that zzso in subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso was lower in lean women compared with lean zzso zzso suppresses zzso and zzso zzso in zzso hence we investigated the in zzso effect of zzso on human and rat zzso and the in zzso effects on rat AT zzso zzso 

zzso rats were divided into four groups of eight zzso One group was zzso zzso and others were zzso zzso One zzso group was left zzso zzso another zzso received zzso treatment, and one received a zzso diet zzso matching the weight gain of the control zzso AT from women undergoing liposuction or surgery and from killed male and female rats were incubated with zzso alone or in the presence of zzso Gene expressions were determined by real-time reverse zzso zzso 

zzso resulted in a zzso increase in zzso zzso expression P zzso zzso expression in the zzso was significantly reduced compared with the zzso group zzso zzso zzso expression in the zzso was reduced significantly zzso zzso when compared with the level of the zzso zzso No significant differences between the control group, the zzso and the zzso were zzso In the in zzso studies, no direct effect of zzso on zzso zzso was zzso 

The zzso of zzso in zzso rats was most likely due to changes in body composition rather than lack of zzso
