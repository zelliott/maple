zzso has been implicated in the zzso of obesity and related zzso zzso Studies on the association between serum zzso acid zzso and zzso syndrome zzso in juvenile obesity are zzso The effect of gender has not been zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were measured in zzso zzso consisting of 113 zzso and 71 lean zzso 

In zzso zzso was significantly elevated in overweight as well as obese zzso zzso was strongly associated with obesity zzso and reflected sexual development, decreases in high density zzso and zzso the number of zzso zzso zzso circumference zzso and zzso stage explained zzso of zzso zzso Controlling for body mass index zzso and other zzso zzso zzso was associated with abdominal zzso explaining zzso of zzso in zzso In zzso zzso was significantly increased in zzso high blood pressure zzso and zzso and corresponded with the number of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso model zzso zzso and high zzso explained zzso of zzso zzso whereas zzso while controlling for zzso age, and other zzso zzso was associated with zzso zzso high zzso and abdominal zzso zzso zzso the associations with high zzso and zzso 

The association between zzso and zzso components in juvenile obesity is zzso with females being related more closely and to more zzso zzso It may explain why, despite its lower zzso zzso is an independent predictor of mortality from all causes and from vascular diseases exclusively in zzso Our findings may help in identifying zzso abnormalities which may possibly be targeted by reducing zzso in males and zzso
