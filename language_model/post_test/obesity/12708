There is conflicting evidence of a link between circulating insulin zzso and blood zzso The aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate this relationship in a representative population sample of different ethnic zzso 

A zzso study was performed, using a random cluster sample of zzso adults aged zzso years from the Indian Ocean island of zzso 

zzso tolerance was assessed with a zzso oral zzso tolerance zzso zzso and zzso tolerance were classified using World Health Organization zzso zzso known to have diabetes before the survey were excluded from these zzso leaving zzso Asian Indian, zzso zzso Creole and zzso Chinese subjects eligible for this zzso 

There were statistically significant linear correlations between zzso and zzso insulin and mean blood pressure in all zzso subgroups, except for Chinese zzso However, after controlling for age and the body mass index, partial correlations were much reduced and remained significant only for zzso insulin in Indian men zzso zzso zzso P zzso and women zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso insulin in Chinese women zzso zzso zzso P zzso After controlling for age and body mass index, mean zzso and zzso insulin zzso were not significantly different between zzso and zzso subjects in any of 36 possible zzso defined by ethnic group, gender or zzso tolerance zzso impaired zzso tolerance or newly diagnosed zzso In both men and women with normal zzso tolerance zzso groups zzso there was no evidence of increasing zzso or zzso blood pressure across zzso of either zzso or zzso serum insulin within any zzso of the body mass zzso By contrast, at any given level of serum insulin there was a clear association between an increasing body mass index and increasing blood pressure, suggesting strongly that insulin is not the final zzso by which obesity influences blood zzso 

This study of three ethnic groups does not support the hypothesis that the circulating insulin concentration is an independent zzso of blood pressure in zzso
