In the same period as the increasing obesity epidemic, there has been an increased consumption of highly processed foods with a high salt content, and a few studies have suggested that a diet with a high salt content may be associated with zzso 

To investigate the association between 24 h urinary sodium zzso and subsequent change in body weight zzso waist circumference zzso body fat zzso and fat free mass zzso among zzso 

A zzso population study based on the Danish part of the zzso project, with examinations in zzso and zzso Complete information on 24 h urinary sodium zzso along with repeated measures of zzso as well as on potential zzso was obtained from 215 zzso Linear zzso was used to examine the association between sodium zzso as a measure of salt consumption, and subsequent changes in zzso zzso zzso and zzso and further evaluated by restricted cubic zzso zzso adjustments were made for selected zzso 

Neither the crude nor the adjusted models showed any statistically significant associations between sodium zzso and change in zzso or zzso Likewise, we found no significant association between sodium zzso and change in zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso However, after adjusting for potential baseline zzso and the concurrent zzso change, we found a significant increase in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso per 100 zzso increase in 24 h urinary sodium zzso zzso to 6 g of zzso during the zzso study zzso Moreover, during the same period, we found a significant association with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

These results suggest that a diet with a high salt content may have a negative influence on development in body composition by expanding zzso and reducing zzso
