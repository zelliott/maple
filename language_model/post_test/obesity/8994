zzso We confront an escalating epidemic of zzso The zzso factors are undoubtedly environmental and include increasingly zzso zzso and technologies and an abundance of food in many zzso This understanding has led to the view that the obesity epidemic is entirely environmental and that obesity should be treated primarily by zzso zzso zzso zzso That is, a prominent view is that common human obesity is an environmental disease and is not, like hypertension and zzso a complex, zzso disease resulting from the interaction of genetic and environmental zzso zzso In the first part of the present article, I argue that this view has obscured a strong zzso contribution to body mass and zzso in zzso This is supported by studies of adopted children and twins and by rare zzso forms of human zzso zzso In the second part of the present article, I argue that zzso therapy for maintenance of weight loss is, overall, a zzso The overwhelming majority of people who lose weight by dieting regain it in several zzso Many have blamed this on patients' lack of zzso and discipline, but there is mounting evidence that biological mechanisms contribute substantially to zzso from weight loss during dietary zzso These include a zzso decrease in energy expenditure during dieting and zzso adaptations that would be expected to increase zzso zzso We live in an era of evidence-based zzso the evidence does not support the efficacy of diet therapy for maintenance of weight loss in zzso This has been true for decades, despite efforts to improve zzso zzso Despite what we want to happen, this will not likely improve, because the failure of diet therapy for the maintenance of weight loss in obesity is probably primarily zzso not zzso zzso In the third part of the article, I argue that drugs will increasingly dominate the treatment of zzso We are in the midst of a revolution in understanding the biological regulation of appetite and metabolism that began with the pioneering discovery of zzso In my zzso this will lead inevitably to the development of safe, effective therapy for zzso zzso This transformation from zzso to pharmacological therapy proved true with hypertension and zzso zzso therapy for hypertension and zzso followed the discovery of the pathways regulating zzso pressure and cholesterol zzso respectively, and zzso therapy for these diseases is now zzso Despite the skepticism, I predict that the same transformation will occur in the treatment of zzso This is not to argue against the need for environmental modification to slow the escalating epidemic of zzso but it is to suggest that future effective treatment of common human obesity should recognize the limitations of dietary therapy for maintenance of weight loss and the promise of pharmacological zzso
