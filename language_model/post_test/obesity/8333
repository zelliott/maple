zzso which zzso zzso tissue and zzso zzso zzso may be responsible for zzso insulin zzso However, the reason why zzso migrate into zzso tissue and become activated remains unknown though some studies suggest that this may be regulated by T and B zzso In this study, it has been tested whether T and B zzso and natural killer zzso cells were necessary for the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso knockout zzso mice, which lack mature T and B zzso and zzso cells, were made obese by selectively reducing litters and weaning onto a high-fat zzso Mice were then maintained on the diet for zzso zzso 

zzso tissue from obese zzso mice had more activated zzso than zzso zzso These zzso were found in zzso zzso surrounding zzso and expressed higher levels of the inflammatory zzso zzso However, obesity did not impair zzso tolerance in the zzso zzso 

These studies demonstrated that T and B zzso and zzso cells are not necessary for zzso tissue zzso zzso in obese zzso T and B zzso and/or zzso cells may be necessary for the development of zzso impaired zzso zzso
