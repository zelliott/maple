Clinical evidence indicates that fat is zzso zzso to bone mass in elderly obese zzso However, it remains unclear whether obesity zzso bone zzso In this report we present evidence that increased visceral fat leads to inflammation and subsequent bone loss in zzso zzso mice that were fed zzso corn oil zzso diet and a control lab zzso zzso for 6 zzso As expected from our previous work, zzso mice demonstrated increased visceral fat and enhanced total body fat mass compared to zzso The zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso zzso were increased in zzso zzso In correlation with those zzso inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly elevated in zzso mice compared to zzso zzso This inflammatory zzso zzso resulted in increased zzso production in zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso mice, the increased number of zzso per zzso bone length and the increased zzso assessed zzso suggest that CO diet zzso bone zzso Additionally, the zzso of zzso zzso k and zzso expression and zzso of zzso zzso supports this bone zzso in zzso zzso Also, zzso mice exhibited lower zzso bone volume in the zzso zzso zzso and had reduced zzso zzso zzso our results suggest that increased bone zzso in mice fed a zzso diet is possibly due to increased inflammation zzso by the zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso This inflammation may consequently increase zzso while reducing zzso development in zzso zzso
