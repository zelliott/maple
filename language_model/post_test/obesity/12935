The prevalence of cardiac zzso zzso demonstrated by zzso in patients who took zzso medication for weight loss has been assessed at zzso We studied 86 patients who had zzso before treatment with appetite zzso to determine the zzso of new cases and to evaluate the clinical implication of the zzso zzso 

We studied 69 men zzso zzso zzso age zzso and 17 women zzso age zzso who had 233 zzso before, zzso and after a weight-loss program that used predominantly zzso (or zzso with zzso (or zzso Mean drug exposure was 17 zzso zzso zzso readings were performed to identify and grade zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 

Seven of 86 patients zzso had pre-existing zzso with five zzso meeting our case zzso Thirteen zzso of initially normal patients developed zzso zzso and were new zzso Of the new cases, 12 were grade zzso zzso and one was both grade zzso MR and zzso zzso All 13 patients were zzso and only two zzso zzso murmurs could be zzso There was significantly greater risk for developing zzso for those who took medications longer than 6 months zzso zzso zzso and no new cases were observed in patients exposed for less than 8 zzso No increased risk associated with age, presence of hypertension, or exposure to zzso combination was zzso Although there was a higher zzso of new zzso in women zzso zzso zzso for zzso this was not statistically significant zzso zzso zzso 

Some patients who had normal zzso at baseline developed cardiac zzso zzso after exposure to zzso or zzso with zzso or zzso The development of zzso was significantly correlated with duration of zzso The clinical implications of zzso demonstrated zzso are uncertain, since there were only two audible murmurs and no other clinically relevant signs or symptoms among the zzso
