zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a nuclear zzso central to zzso and zzso zzso zzso role in zzso fatty liver disease is controversial because zzso zzso is a general property of zzso zzso but its zzso by zzso reduces zzso zzso Here, we investigated zzso zzso function by using zzso technology to generate zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso deletion of zzso in zzso and to a lesser extent in zzso protected mice against high-fat zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of genes involved in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso transport zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso was observed in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso mice showed improved zzso tolerance and reduced zzso expression without changes in zzso zzso and zzso expression and zzso and zzso zzso In zzso liver slices zzso and zzso zzso either alone or in combination with zzso acid increased zzso zzso an effect that was blocked by the zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso mice showed blunted responses to zzso and zzso acid, whereas the response to these compounds remained intact in zzso from zzso zzso zzso these findings establish zzso expression in zzso as a zzso factor in fatty liver zzso
