zzso zzso zzso a novel protein zzso mainly by zzso zzso has been associated with insulin resistance in obese subjects and in individuals with type 2 diabetes zzso zzso We examined the relationship between plasma zzso levels, expression of zzso in skeletal muscle and zzso zzso and insulin sensitivity in Mexican Americans with varying degrees of obesity and zzso zzso zzso subjects zzso lean zzso zzso 17 obese zzso and 39 subjects with impaired zzso zzso zzso zzso received an oral zzso tolerance test zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured as zzso index during zzso In a subset of subjects, zzso zzso production was measured by zzso infusion, zzso of the zzso zzso muscle and subcutaneous zzso tissue were obtained under zzso conditions, and quantitative zzso was performed to measure the zzso zzso gene zzso Plasma zzso was significantly elevated in impaired zzso zzso compared with zzso lean or obese zzso Plasma zzso levels correlated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso There was no association between zzso levels and whole body insulin sensitivity measured with either the zzso insulin clamp or zzso zzso zzso zzso production rates, and the zzso insulin resistance zzso There was no correlation between plasma zzso levels and indexes of insulin zzso zzso zzso expression in skeletal muscle was similar in lean zzso subjects, obese zzso subjects, and zzso zzso There was no difference in zzso zzso expression in zzso tissue between lean and obese zzso subjects or between zzso and zzso zzso Plasma zzso levels are elevated in zzso and associated with impaired zzso zzso but not associated with obesity or insulin resistance or impaired insulin zzso in Mexican zzso
