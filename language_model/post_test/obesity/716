Previous studies have demonstrated that obesity can increase the risk of stone formation as well as recurrence rates of stone zzso Yet appropriate medical management can significantly decrease the risk of zzso stone zzso zzso we analyzed our obese patient population, assessing the risk factors for stone formation and the impact of selective medical therapy on zzso stone zzso 

A retrospective chart review was performed to identify obese patients with stone disease from our Stone zzso zzso risk factors for stones were identified as well as patient response to medical zzso A similar analysis was performed on a group of age and sex matched zzso stone zzso 

Of zzso patients 140 zzso were identified as obese zzso mass index greater than zzso Of these patients complete zzso evaluations were available in 83 with an average followup of zzso zzso The most common presenting zzso abnormalities among these obese patients included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which presented at levels that were significantly higher than those of the zzso stone zzso zzso zzso Stone analysis was available in 32 obese patients with zzso having zzso acid zzso After initiating treatment with selective medical therapy obese and zzso patients demonstrated zzso of zzso zzso resulting in an average decrease in new stone formation from zzso to zzso new stones formed per patient per year in both zzso 

zzso as a result of dietary zzso probable zzso zzso and possible type II diabetes, appears to have a significant role in zzso stone zzso zzso zzso zzso institution of medical therapy and dietary recommendations to decrease animal protein intake can significantly improve the risk of zzso stone formation in these often difficult to treat zzso
