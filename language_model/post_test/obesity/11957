Patients with type 2 diabetes zzso have an increased risk of fracture that can be further exacerbated by zzso A new class of zzso agents control zzso through reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso however the importance of zzso for the control of bone quality has not been extensively zzso We compared the effects of the zzso zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso on bone quality in high-fat diet zzso zzso zzso In complementary studies, we examined bone quality in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produced yellow bones with greater bone zzso zzso and significantly reduced zzso bone mechanics in male, female, and zzso zzso zzso fed female zzso zzso zzso affected zzso zzso bone mineral density, zzso architecture, and mineral zzso rate in male zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso mice significantly improved zzso zzso bone mineral density and zzso architecture in female mice, but these improvements were lost in females after zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not produce a major bone zzso in male and female zzso zzso however, zzso zzso mice exhibited significantly reduced zzso size and zzso These findings delineate the skeletal consequences of pharmacological and genetic reduction of zzso activity and reveal significant differences in the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso genetic zzso zzso on bone mechanics in zzso
