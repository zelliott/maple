Treatment of zzso mice with large, repeated doses of zzso zzso zzso produces a syndrome of obesity and zzso dysfunction generally attributed to a zzso zzso We have used single injections of zzso administered on zzso day four, to explore the lower end of the zzso curve for this zzso Major features of the zzso syndrome including zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso protein content, decreased zzso weight, delayed zzso and elevated plasma zzso levels were obtained at the highest zzso Of the variables measured, feeding disturbances and reduced zzso and zzso weights were the most sensitive indicators of zzso The extent of damage produced in the zzso nucleus of the zzso increased with increasing zzso A prominent zzso was also detected in the zzso zzso area of animals receiving the highest zzso zzso was not evident in other zzso structures associated with body weight zzso Since little is known about the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso a second study examined the contribution of zzso hormones to obesity in zzso treated zzso zzso increased the body weights of animals injected with low but not high doses of zzso suggesting that a reduction in zzso function may contribute to the zzso obesity syndrome in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in these mice indicated that as with repeated doses of zzso single injections of the toxin reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso
