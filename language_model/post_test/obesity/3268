Although previous studies have generally reported increased zzso pressure values with zzso none of these studies has classified the zzso Our aim in this study was to compare the zzso pressure distribution in obese and control adults during standing and zzso 

This study was performed on 100 feet of 50 study zzso The subjects gathered in two groups, each containing 25 study participants, as non-obese and class 1 obese according to their body mass index zzso zzso and dynamic zzso evaluations were performed during standing and zzso The findings were compared between the groups and also the correlation of body mass index with the zzso parameters was zzso 

The zzso zzso evaluation revealed significantly higher values in terms of zzso peak pressure, total zzso force and total contact area in the feet of class 1 obese subjects when only middle foot peak pressure was found to be higher in class 1 obese subjects than controls as a dynamic zzso zzso Among the zzso parameters body mass index was found to have positive correlation with total zzso force zzso zzso and total contact area zzso zzso Only middle foot peak pressure zzso zzso among the dynamic zzso parameters had positive correlation with body mass zzso 

This study may be a first step to evaluate the effect of different obesity categories on the zzso pressure zzso Further studies are needed to investigate the effect of different obesity zzso
