This study investigated the relationship between the direction of lateral eye shifts evoked by bilateral visual zzso on the one hand, and verbal vs zzso performance, on the zzso In males a negative correlation was found between verbal relative to spatial accuracy and the ratio of zzso eye zzso No such relationship was found in zzso Additionally, in males body mass index was smaller for those who displayed a greater ratio of zzso eye zzso It was concluded that visually evoked lateral eye shifts might reflect zzso zzso similarly as lateral eye movements obtained during the widely used questioning zzso However, the procedure used in this study for evoking lateral eye shifts seems to be free of some zzso problems of the traditional procedure and is more easy to zzso
