This analysis explored the effect of timing, sequencing, and change in zzso health across adolescence and young adulthood on zzso disparities in birth weight in a diverse national cohort of young adult zzso 

Data came from Waves I zzso III zzso and IV zzso of the National zzso Study of Adolescent zzso zzso was restricted to all singleton live zzso to female zzso White, zzso Black, zzso zzso or zzso zzso participants zzso occurring between the Wave III zzso zzso and IV zzso zzso zzso Birth weight was zzso into low zzso normal zzso and zzso zzso zzso health indicators were cigarette smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, overweight or zzso and inadequate physical activity, measured in adolescence zzso I, ages zzso and early adulthood zzso zzso and combined into zzso variables to capture the timing and sequencing of zzso 

zzso of zzso health did not explain the zzso disparity in low birth weight, which increased after adjustment for zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and effect modification by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A positive association between zzso zzso and zzso was modified by race zzso zzso zzso zzso for Black zzso 

This zzso analysis provides new evidence on zzso health and zzso disparities in birth zzso Specifically, it indicates that interventions focused on prevention of zzso and maintenance of healthy weight during the transition to adulthood, especially among Black zzso may be zzso
