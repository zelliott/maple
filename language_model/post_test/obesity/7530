zzso insulin requirement in patients with type 2 diabetes is difficult to determine because of individual zzso in insulin sensitivity and zzso We aimed to identify factors that influence zzso insulin requirement in zzso patients with type 2 zzso 

We studied 50 zzso patients with type 2 zzso Their zzso insulin requirement was calculated by zzso overnight intravenous insulin zzso Patients underwent abdominal zzso zzso subcutaneous and visceral fat areas were zzso 

The zzso insulin requirement was zzso zzso zzso zzso and it varied widely from zzso to zzso zzso It was positively correlated with visceral fat area zzso zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, body weight, waist circumference and total fat mass were not related to zzso insulin zzso Multiple linear zzso analysis showed that visceral fat area, zzso and zzso are independent zzso of zzso insulin zzso 

zzso obesity was a better predictor than generalized obesity for zzso insulin requirement at the initiation of insulin therapy in patients with type 2 zzso
