This study estimated the lifetime health and economic benefits of sustained modest weight loss among obese zzso 

We developed a dynamic model of the relationship between body mass index zzso and the risks and costs of 5 zzso zzso hypertension, zzso type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease zzso and zzso We then calculated the lifetime health and economic benefits of a sustained zzso reduction in body weight for men and women aged 35 to 64 years with mild, moderate, and severe zzso 

Depending on age, zzso and initial zzso a sustained zzso weight loss would zzso reduce the expected number of years of life with hypertension, zzso and type 2 diabetes by zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso reduce the expected lifetime zzso of zzso and stroke by 12 to 38 cases per 1000 and 1 to 13 cases per zzso zzso zzso increase life expectancy by 2 to 7 zzso and zzso reduce expected lifetime medical care costs of these 5 diseases by zzso to zzso 

zzso modest weight loss among obese persons would yield substantial health and economic zzso
