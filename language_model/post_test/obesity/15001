To investigate the correlations between obesity index such as waist zzso hip zzso zzso zzso body mass index, waist to hip ratio, waist to height ratio zzso and blood pressure among zzso children living in zzso of zzso 

In zzso 2009, zzso zzso children aged 7 to 14 at primary schools in zzso of zzso were zzso zzso zzso hip zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure were measured to calculate the body mass index, waist to hip ratio and waist to height zzso Analysis on the differences in age and zzso blood pressure zzso between zzso or normal zzso group under the standard set for zzso zzso zzso software was used for statistical analysis on its zzso 

The total prevalence of hypertension was zzso in zzso ethnic school-age children in zzso with zzso in the boys and zzso in zzso Data from waist zzso hip zzso zzso zzso ratio, zzso and zzso blood pressure showed gender and age differences zzso zzso zzso Average zzso blood pressure was correlated to waist zzso hip zzso zzso zzso body mass index and waist to hip ratio zzso zzso zzso with hip circumference the most zzso r zzso zzso female: r zzso zzso The average zzso blood pressure was correlated to waist zzso hip zzso zzso zzso body mass index and waist to hip ratio zzso zzso zzso with hip having the strongest relation zzso zzso zzso for male and r zzso zzso for zzso zzso differences were seen between zzso group and normal blood pressure group on waist zzso hip zzso zzso zzso body mass index and zzso ratio zzso zzso 

In zzso of zzso the prevalence of hypertension was at the low level in zzso ethnic zzso children when comparing to data from national and foreign zzso zzso related to obesity as waist zzso hip zzso body mass index and waist to hip ratio were positively correlated with blood pressure, with hip in zzso
