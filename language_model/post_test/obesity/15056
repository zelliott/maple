To understand the chronic effects of zzso genetically engineered mouse models would be zzso Early studies, however, suggested that it was challenging to generate zzso zzso models by standard zzso Although several groups have been trying to generate transgenic zzso mice zzso zzso almost all these animals produced only zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso zzso to zzso the mechanism for the fatty acid modification in zzso many researchers have been seeking an zzso that would catalyze the zzso of zzso with an zzso zzso In 2008, zzso zzso zzso was identified at last, and thereafter zzso mice zzso zzso and zzso were generated by zzso et zzso On the other hand, we have succeeded in generating zzso mice zzso zzso a zzso analog that does not require zzso modification with zzso for zzso These zzso zzso models are useful tools for evaluating the long-term zzso and/or pharmacological effects of zzso or zzso zzso and provide insight into the zzso roles of zzso zzso
