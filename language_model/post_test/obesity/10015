To determine the relationship between zzso zzso at fatigue and earlier onset of fatigue in the obese rat subjected to intense zzso 

zzso were subjected to a short, intense exercise protocol on a zzso Blood was drawn from hind leg vein and artery during exercise and up to 1 h zzso Assuming an exercise respiratory zzso of zzso the extra carbon dioxide released was zzso and assumed to be displaced by zzso amounts of zzso acid produced by the rat during zzso 

zzso female adult zzso lean and zzso obese zzso 

zzso consumption and carbon dioxide zzso zzso and zzso levels in hind leg zzso and zzso zzso balances were estimated by measuring blood flow with fluorescent zzso zzso levels in zzso white zzso tissue were also zzso 

Muscle released, during exercise and post exercise roughly zzso zzso zzso in lean rats and zzso zzso in obese zzso Of these zzso hind leg zzso release accounted for zzso zzso in lean rats and only zzso in the obese ones, which showed a release of acid zzso zzso elsewhere in the rats zzso about zzso zzso CO2 in lean rats and zzso in the obese zzso that is both hind quarters accounted for only zzso of all zzso produced in the lean rats and zzso in the obese zzso The amount of zzso produced by the rats was roughly zzso White zzso tissue zzso levels (in the zzso state and after zzso were much higher than could be expected from blood sources alone, indicating an active production of zzso 

zzso appears earlier in the obese rats than in lean ones because of loss of zzso ability caused by massive zzso zzso (probably in zzso zzso and zzso production triggered by zzso zzso zzso
