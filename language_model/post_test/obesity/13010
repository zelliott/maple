In this study we compared zzso use at zzso zzso of a zzso graded exercise test zzso with that derived from equivalent zzso during continuous zzso zzso exercise in obese and zzso zzso zzso obese zzso zzso 20, body zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 15, body fat zzso zzso women performed three treadmill tests with concurrent zzso zzso zzso oxygen consumption zzso was determined using the Bruce zzso followed by two, randomly zzso continuous zzso zzso exercise zzso on different zzso one bout at 50% and one bout at zzso zzso Analysis of zzso revealed no significant differences between groups for blood zzso or respiratory exchange ratio zzso values at any point during zzso zzso obese and zzso group data were combined for subsequent zzso The R at 50% zzso from the zzso zzso zzso was significantly zzso zzso lower than at 8 zzso zzso zzso and 15 zzso zzso zzso of zzso exercise, whereas at zzso zzso the zzso R zzso zzso was similar to that seen at 8 zzso zzso zzso and at 15 zzso of zzso exercise zzso zzso Blood zzso values at 50% zzso were similar between the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exercise zzso zzso zzso but at zzso zzso the zzso blood zzso values zzso zzso zzso were lower than after 15 zzso of zzso exercise zzso zzso zzso Total exercise fat zzso was greater at 50% compared to zzso zzso There was no difference in zzso use between sedentary obese and zzso women either at rest or during zzso exercise at the same relative zzso Total fat zzso was greater during low- zzso zzso compared to high-intensity zzso zzso zzso Data from a zzso cannot be used to predict R or zzso zzso values for the purpose of exercise zzso
