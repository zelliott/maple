zzso flux has been shown to mediate aspects of zzso sensing in insulin sensitive zzso and has been hypothesized to represent a zzso signal that results in zzso of fuel toward storage as zzso It has been recently reported that in zzso treatment of fat and muscle cells with zzso and acute zzso infusion in intact rats stimulate zzso zzso In order to investigate the effects of zzso zzso increases in zzso flux on zzso we have examined zzso zzso and serum zzso in mice zzso the zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso in muscle and zzso Increased levels of zzso the principal zzso of the zzso zzso were seen in transgenic fat, consistent with the zzso of zzso After overnight zzso the transgenic mice were zzso compared to zzso controls zzso zzso in zzso zzso in control, p zzso zzso despite equal body zzso In the zzso state, the zzso levels of control mice increased to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso levels in the zzso did not increase any further zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were also increased in transgenic fat zzso in transgenic compared to zzso in control, arbitrary units zzso to zzso p zzso Despite increased zzso the transgenic animals did not have lower body fat zzso We conclude that zzso flux in fat regulates zzso synthesis and zzso
