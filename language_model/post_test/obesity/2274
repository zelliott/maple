The zzso of zzso disorders is common in obese animal zzso The mechanism behind this effect is zzso We zzso that a high-fat zzso diet zzso zzso in neuroendocrine mechanisms resulting in zzso in zzso obese zzso zzso Adult female zzso and zzso zzso rats were fed either zzso or a zzso diet zzso calories from zzso for 6 zzso zzso zzso and body weight were monitored zzso At the end of treatment, rats were implanted with a jugular zzso to monitor zzso hormone zzso levels on the day of zzso zzso were sacrificed on the next zzso and their brains and zzso were zzso Plasma from trunk blood was zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso were fixed and zzso for zzso zzso zzso were removed, frozen and zzso and zzso zzso zzso in discrete zzso areas were measured using zzso liquid zzso with zzso zzso A zzso diet exposure affected zzso zzso in both zzso and DR rats, with the effect being more pronounced in zzso zzso zzso diet exposure increased zzso levels in both zzso and DR zzso zzso levels were low in the zzso zzso zzso levels in the zzso were unaffected by zzso diet or zzso A normal zzso surge was observed in zzso rats and zzso levels were low in the remaining zzso These results lead to the conclusion that zzso rats have an inherently reduced zzso capacity and exposure to a zzso diet decreases it zzso A reduction in zzso and zzso surge levels could contribute to this zzso however, the underlying mechanisms need to be investigated zzso
