The objective of this investigation was to examine the prevalence of abdominal zzso and its association with the prevalence of hypertension among African descent populations in Nigeria, zzso Jamaica, zzso Lucia, zzso and the United States zzso 

The data for this investigation were obtained from the International Collaborative Study on zzso in zzso zzso was defined as mean zzso blood zzso or zzso zzso zzso blood zzso or zzso 140 zzso or current treatment with prescribed zzso zzso zzso overweight was defined as waist circumference zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso for men and women, zzso zzso obesity was defined as zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso for men and women, zzso We estimated the zzso prevalence of abdominal overweight and obesity across age and body mass index zzso We also calculated the population attributable fraction zzso of hypertension due to abdominal zzso 

The prevalence of hypertension in these populations was tightly linked to abdominal zzso zzso in abdominal overweight accompanied an increasing degree of zzso rising from zzso and zzso in Nigeria, zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in Jamaica, zzso and zzso in zzso Lucia, zzso and zzso in zzso to zzso and zzso in the US for men and women, zzso The corresponding values for abdominal obesity were zzso and zzso in Nigeria, zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in Jamaica, zzso and zzso in zzso Lucia, zzso and zzso in zzso to zzso and zzso in the US for men and women, zzso Body mass zzso estimates of zzso suggest that in most of these zzso especially in zzso avoidance of abdominal overweight or obesity would help to curb the development of zzso 

An important public health challenge is to clarify how lifestyle factors influence risks of abdominal zzso and ultimately the increased risk of cardiovascular zzso
