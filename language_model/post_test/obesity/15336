Almost one-third of adult Canadians are at increased risk of zzso disease and premature death because of being zzso In order to allocate limited health care resources rationally, it is necessary to zzso the economic burden of zzso 

To estimate the direct costs related to the treatment of and research into obesity in Canada in zzso 

The prevalence of obesity zzso mass index of 27 or zzso in Canada was determined using data from the National zzso Health Survey, zzso Ten zzso of obesity were identified from the medical zzso A population attributable fraction zzso was calculated for each zzso with data from large cohort studies to determine the extent to which each zzso and its management costs were attributable to zzso The direct cost of each zzso was determined using data from the Canadian Institute of Health Information (for direct expenditure zzso and from Health Canada (for the proportion of expenditure category attributable to the zzso This zzso approach identified the direct costs of hospital care, physician services, services of other health professionals, drugs, other health care and health zzso For each zzso the cost attributable to obesity was determined by zzso the zzso by the total direct cost of the zzso The overall impact of obesity was estimated as the sum of the zzso costs of treating the zzso A sensitivity analysis was completed on both the estimated costs and the zzso 

The total direct cost of obesity in Canada in 1997 was estimated to be over zzso zzso This corresponded to zzso of the total health care expenditures for all diseases in Canada in zzso The sensitivity analysis revealed that the total cost could be as high as zzso billion or as low as zzso million; this corresponded to zzso and zzso respectively of the total health care expenditures in zzso When the contributions of the zzso to the total cost were considered, the 3 largest contributors were hypertension zzso million), type 2 diabetes zzso zzso million) and coronary artery disease zzso zzso 

A considerable proportion of health care dollars is devoted to the treatment and management of zzso zzso in zzso Further research into the therapeutic benefits and zzso of management strategies for obesity is zzso It is anticipated that the prevention and treatment of obesity will have major positive effects on the overall cost of health zzso
