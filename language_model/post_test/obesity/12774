The zzso mouse is genetically deficient in zzso and exhibits both an obese and a mild zzso diabetic zzso To test the hypothesis that correction of the obese zzso by zzso gene therapy will lead to the spontaneous correction of the diabetic zzso the zzso mouse was treated with a zzso zzso expressing the mouse zzso zzso Treatment resulted in dramatic reductions in both food intake and body weight, as well as the zzso of serum insulin levels and zzso zzso The subsequent zzso in serum zzso levels resulted in the rapid resumption of food intake and a gradual gain of body weight, which correlated with the gradual return of zzso and insulin zzso These results not only demonstrated that the obese and diabetic zzso in the adult zzso mice are corrected by zzso gene treatment but also provide confirming evidence that body weight control may be critical in the long-term management of zzso diabetes zzso in obese zzso
