To better understand risk factors for the development of obesity in early childhood, we examined the association between children's zzso and their parents' eating behavior and body mass index zzso 

Parents of 85 white children 36 months of age zzso boys and 36 zzso completed the zzso Eating zzso measuring three dimensions of parent eating behavior: zzso eating, cognitive restraint of eating, and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso was calculated using zzso height and zzso The children's percentage body fat was assessed by dual energy X-ray zzso zzso 

Twenty-six percent of parents were obese zzso or zzso 30 zzso Both maternal and paternal zzso were associated with higher scores for zzso zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso p zzso and maternal zzso was also associated with higher scores for hunger zzso zzso zzso p zzso There were no significant relationships between children's percentage body fat and parent eating scores, and the correlation between children's percentage body fat and parent zzso was significant only between mothers and daughters zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso parents were no more likely to have a child who was zzso zzso zzso of percentage body fat for zzso 

Among 36 month-old white children, parent eating behavior was related to parent zzso but not to children's zzso There was only a weak relationship between parent zzso and child zzso Despite the zzso of zzso within families due to shared genes and zzso children may not express differences in zzso to obesity by 3 years of zzso
