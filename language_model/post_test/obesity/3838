zzso is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and zzso in part through development of zzso zzso promotes weight loss by reducing food intake and increasing energy expenditure through sympathetic zzso It also zzso the zzso suppression of zzso hormone by zzso the expression of zzso On the other hand, it is known that the zzso zzso system zzso in cardiovascular function modulating sympathetic system zzso In order to challenge the testable hypothesis that obesity may raise zzso blood pressure zzso through zzso system zzso we zzso analyze the participation of the zzso system in the zzso of zzso in the obese zzso yellow zzso These mice are characterized by resistance to the weight reducing effect of zzso although they show a preserved sympathetic response to zzso along with a mild hypertension compared with the control strain zzso vs zzso zzso p less than zzso zzso We report here that zzso zzso mice showed a zzso zzso of zzso zzso content compared with controls, and we demonstrate that a long lasting specific zzso of zzso system by zzso treatment with zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso independently of the zzso zzso These results suggest that the interaction zzso zzso may be one of the mechanisms involved in the mild hypertension of the obese zzso zzso
