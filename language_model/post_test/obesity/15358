We monitored zzso individuals from zzso years of age with repeated measures of zzso weight, and zzso blood pressure zzso until zzso years of age, when blood samples were obtained for zzso of insulin and zzso zzso childhood weight, body mass index zzso and height were significantly correlated with young adult weight, zzso and height and with zzso insulin, zzso and zzso The increases in weight and zzso but not height during childhood were significantly related to the young adult levels of insulin, zzso and zzso 

These data suggest that weight gain in excess of normal growth during childhood is a zzso of adult cardiovascular zzso The finding in multiple linear zzso analysis that weight gain during childhood rather than the childhood weight at zzso years of age is significantly related to young adult risk factors suggests that a reduction in weight gain could reduce subsequent levels of cardiovascular zzso
