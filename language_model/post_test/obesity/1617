Although there are putative zzso links between obesity and zzso diseases, obesity is not considered a risk factor for most zzso zzso 

Using the zzso Hospital Discharge Register we defined a cohort of zzso patients hospitalized for obesity since year zzso The patients were followed for hospitalization for any of 34 zzso or related conditions through year zzso zzso zzso ratios zzso were calculated for zzso diseases in obese individuals compared to those who had not been hospitalized for zzso 

Among 22 immune diseases diagnosed after hospitalization for obesity and in at least 5 patients, the overall zzso was zzso Of the individual diseases zzso the risk of 16 was significantly zzso none displayed a decreased zzso zzso zzso and zzso disease zzso exhibited the highest risks, followed by zzso zzso zzso and asthma zzso Small but significant increases in zzso were also noted for the common zzso diseases zzso zzso zzso and zzso arthritis zzso 

The present population of obese individuals, subsequently diagnosed with a number of zzso diseases and related conditions, was hospitalized at a relatively young zzso Further studies are needed to describe the morbidity in the obese population at zzso
