In this study, we simultaneously characterized genetic and lifestyle factors zzso smoking, and alcohol zzso in determining variation in body mass index zzso fat mass, percentage of fat mass zzso and lean mass while adjusting for the effects of age and zzso Six hundred zzso Caucasian individuals from 48 zzso were studied for zzso Among these individuals, zzso from 38 zzso were studied for fat mass, zzso and lean mass measured by dual X-ray zzso zzso After adjusting for age, sex, and lifestyle factors, the zzso zzso of zzso fat mass, zzso and lean mass ranged from zzso to zzso with associated standard errors ranging from zzso to zzso After accounting for significant sex and age effects, exercise had significant effects for all the zzso zzso and the effects of smoking and alcohol consumption were not zzso zzso significant proportions of variation in zzso fat mass, zzso and lean mass were under genetic control, and exercise had a significant effect in reducing zzso fat mass, and zzso and in increasing lean zzso This study warrants further genetic linkage analyses to search for genes for the zzso zzso measured by zzso in our zzso
