zzso levels of zzso and total zzso have been reported in zzso It has been hypothesized that increased free zzso zzso zzso levels generated from zzso protein zzso zzso activity could be the mechanism for the low zzso release in dieting obese zzso However, no published data exist on free zzso levels, acid zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso activity in relation to zzso release during a zzso zzso The main purpose of this study was to determine free zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity in relation to zzso zzso release before and after a short-term very low-calorie diet zzso 

Six obese subjects before weight loss, five after an average weight loss of zzso zzso and five zzso zzso lean controls underwent a zzso zzso All subjects were studied on two occasions, once during normal basic diet and again during the last day of the zzso zzso zzso 

Free zzso was determined by a zzso zzso zzso 

Free zzso levels decreased in concert with increased ALS and unchanged blunted zzso release after a zzso in the obese zzso zzso zzso activity was found to be unchanged by zzso diet in all zzso 

We conclude that free zzso decreases after a short-term zzso diet in obese subjects with no zzso change in zzso zzso zzso zzso free zzso per zzso cannot be the main mechanism of the attenuated zzso release in dieting obese zzso
