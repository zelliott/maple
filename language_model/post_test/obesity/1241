To examine the contribution of the substitution of zzso for zzso at zzso acid position 64 zzso of the beta zzso zzso to body weight and zzso factors in healthy, zzso zzso 

Five hundred and five healthy, zzso women zzso zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso

Two women were zzso zzso 75 women were zzso zzso and zzso women were zzso zzso The frequency of the zzso substitution was zzso When subjects with and without the zzso substitution were zzso no significant differences were found on measures of weight or zzso risk zzso 

The results confirm previous studies suggesting that the zzso substitution of the beta zzso zzso is not related to weight or zzso zzso in healthy, zzso zzso
