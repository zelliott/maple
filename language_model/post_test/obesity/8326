zzso has been associated with cognitive decline in zzso studies of older zzso We hypothesized that the cognitive zzso of obesity may be zzso in the zzso zzso In addition, we explored the hypothesis that these associations may be zzso by the hormonal zzso 

Of 49 young healthy lean and overweight women aged zzso we investigated the association between performance on a battery of cognitive tests, body composition parameters zzso mass index, total fat, abdominal zzso zzso and total) zzso zzso and zzso and hormone levels zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor 1 zzso estrogen, testosterone, and vitamin zzso

These preliminary findings suggest a possible association between obesity and cognitive function in healthy young women of zzso zzso More research is warranted into the potential zzso effect of insulin resistance on this zzso
