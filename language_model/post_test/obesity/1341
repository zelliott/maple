It has been suggested that relative heart rate reserve zzso zzso relative oxygen zzso zzso zzso and rating of perceived exertion zzso can be used zzso to prescribe exercise zzso The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between % zzso % zzso and zzso in obese females prior to and following substantial weight zzso 

122 obese females zzso Body fat zzso zzso zzso zzso who participated in a weight loss intervention zzso 

zzso zzso capacity was measured at baseline and following 12 weeks of exercise training and weight loss using a zzso zzso zzso treadmill zzso The zzso heart rate zzso and zzso were measured at each stage, with zzso and zzso data converted to the percentages of the peak levels zzso These zzso data were then analyzed using zzso zzso procedures to examine the relationship between % zzso % zzso and zzso 

With zzso as the dependent zzso results indicated that % zzso and % zzso corresponded to zzso values consistent with existing guidelines zzso zzso zzso zzso and this was true for analyses performed at baseline and following weight zzso Further, baseline results indicated that % zzso and % zzso corresponded to similar levels of exercise intensity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, following weight loss, % zzso represented a higher level of intensity than its corresponding % zzso 

The results of this study suggest that zzso can be used as zzso marker of exercise intensity in an obese female zzso However, despite adhering to existing guidelines prior to weight loss, there may be a zzso in the relationship between % zzso and zzso following severe weight loss, possibly due to the decrease in resting zzso following exercise training and weight zzso These findings directly impact the prescription and monitoring of exercise intensity for obese zzso
