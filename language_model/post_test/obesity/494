Emerging evidence suggests that zzso during fetal life affect adult zzso We assessed the relationship between recalled maternal zzso body mass, zzso weight gain zzso and zzso in the zzso 

zzso cohort study among zzso daughter zzso in the zzso Health Study II and the zzso zzso zzso Mothers of participants completed questionnaires regarding their nurse daughter in zzso 

zzso zzso daughter zzso born between 1946 and zzso 

Body mass index zzso of the nurse daughter at age 18 and in zzso 

At age 18, zzso zzso daughters were obese zzso and in 2001, zzso zzso were zzso zzso for zzso women whose mothers had a recalled zzso zzso of 29 had a zzso increased risk of obesity at age 18 and a zzso risk of obesity in 2001, compared with women whose mothers had a zzso zzso of zzso We found a zzso association between recalled zzso and offspring zzso Compared with a maternal weight gain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with a significant increase in obesity risk at age 18 zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and in 2001 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso High weight gain zzso was also associated with obesity risk at age 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in 2001 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These associations were stronger among mothers who were overweight before pregnancy zzso for zzso and they persisted with adjustment for birth zzso 

A high recalled zzso zzso and extremes of recalled zzso are associated with an increased risk of adolescent and adult obesity in zzso particularly when the mother is zzso zzso weight and zzso may be modifiable fetal origins of overweight and obesity in zzso
