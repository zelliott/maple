The influence of zzso zzso on zzso metabolism in later life was studied in male rats reared in small nests (2 zzso per zzso At an age of 3 months zzso overfed rats differ from normally bred rats (12 zzso per zzso by a significant higher zzso and lower zzso concentration in zzso zzso data of zzso metabolism point out a lower fractional turnover rate and a lower zzso clearance rate per 100 g body mass corresponding with a reduced zzso by the zzso zzso A lower energy intake per zzso mass unit and a lower energy need for maintenance in zzso overfed rats calculated from intake and body mass development are discussed in respect of correlations between changes of zzso hormone metabolism and efficiency of energy zzso
