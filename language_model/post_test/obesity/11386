To determine whether plasma homocysteine zzso levels were related to insulin resistance and obesity in subjects without diabetes or vascular zzso 

We studied zzso of plasma zzso in 26 subjects covering a wide spectrum of obesity and insulin sensitivity zzso The measurement of in zzso insulin sensitivity was performed using the minimal model analysis of the frequently sampled intravenous zzso tolerance test zzso 

There was no relationship between zzso and body mass zzso There was a significant relationship between plasma zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrating that the more insulin sensitive subjects had higher levels of zzso On log transformation of the plasma insulin values, log insulin correlated zzso with plasma zzso zzso zzso None of the subjects were deficient in vitamin zzso and zzso Plasma vitamin zzso was significantly related to plasma zzso zzso zzso although we found no significant relationship between plasma folate and zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated significantly with vitamin zzso zzso zzso zzso we found no significant relationship between zzso and plasma folate zzso zzso On multiple linear zzso using zzso as the dependent zzso zzso and vitamin zzso remained significant zzso of plasma zzso zzso age and plasma folate were not zzso of zzso 

We conclude that in vitamin replete lean and obese individuals, insulin sensitivity zzso significantly with plasma zzso This relationship may need to be considered when evaluating the role of plasma homocysteine as a risk factor in patients with obesity and type 2 zzso
