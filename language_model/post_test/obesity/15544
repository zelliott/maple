The level of zzso zzso obese zzso gene zzso zzso is markedly elevated in zzso male zzso The administration of zzso zzso to zzso rats resulted in a zzso decrease in zzso zzso at 8 zzso This decrease in zzso zzso was associated with a parallel decline in circulating zzso levels of about 50% at 24 zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso levels were markedly decreased in zzso zzso tissue from zzso zzso zzso administration resulted in a zzso increase at 12 h in beta zzso zzso zzso There was a corresponding increase due to zzso in the zzso response to the specific beta zzso zzso zzso zzso that paralleled the increase in beta zzso zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso and beta zzso zzso zzso were blocked by zzso suggesting the involvement of short-lived proteins in these zzso The present results indicate that zzso has opposite effects to those of insulin on the white zzso tissue of rats with respect to zzso zzso zzso
