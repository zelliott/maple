The sympathetic nervous system regulates zzso and energy zzso in zzso When activated it increases energy zzso particularly resting energy zzso Most human studies used acute infusion of zzso as a model to eliminate sympathetic stimulation and to examine the contribution of the sympathetic nervous system to energy metabolism and zzso zzso however, it is also important to assess the effect of chronic sympathetic zzso on energy zzso In this context, we hypothesized that resting energy expenditure is decreased in patients with zzso failure who, by definition, have low sympathetic zzso We measured 24-hour energy expenditure using zzso indirect zzso in 10 adults with chronic zzso failure (6 zzso age, zzso years; body mass index, zzso zzso and 15 sedentary healthy controls of similar age and body composition (8 zzso age, zzso years; body mass index, zzso zzso In 4 patients, we eliminated residual sympathetic activity with the zzso blocker zzso We found that, after adjusting for body zzso resting energy expenditure did not differ between patients with zzso failure and healthy zzso However, resting energy expenditure significantly decreased when residual sympathetic activity was zzso Our findings suggest that sympathetic zzso support of resting energy expenditure is zzso at least in part, in zzso models of chronic sympathetic zzso
