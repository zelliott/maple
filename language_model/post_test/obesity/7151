To identify the proportion of weight lost as zzso mass zzso by various weight loss zzso 

zzso and zzso were systematically searched for reliable zzso of zzso before and after weight loss zzso zzso and eligible data were zzso In a fixed effect model of % zzso zzso loss zzso linear zzso analysis was used to determine the influence of degree of caloric zzso exercise, magnitude of weight loss, initial body mass index zzso and type of zzso 

Data were included from 26 zzso treated with dietary and behavioral interventions and 29 zzso of zzso surgery zzso The degree of caloric restriction was positively associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and in three zzso controlled trials exercise was shown to decrease zzso Compared with zzso adjustable gastric zzso zzso zzso diversion zzso and zzso en Y gastric bypass zzso caused greater zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso between surgical procedures were independent of initial zzso and magnitude of weight zzso 

The degree of caloric zzso exercise and rate of weight loss influence the proportion of weight lost as zzso after zzso zzso For surgical interventions, zzso and zzso result in greater zzso than zzso
