In addition to its interaction at zzso sites to affect feeding and energy zzso zzso has been shown to exhibit a zzso response in zzso zzso The functional zzso zzso is also present in pancreatic zzso and we now demonstrate that a commonly used zzso insulin zzso zzso line, zzso expresses high levels of the zzso zzso zzso causes an increase in zzso zzso of a number of zzso proteins and a dose related (10 zzso zzso increase in expression of the zzso zzso zzso This precedes a zzso induced zzso response in zzso zzso cells, which suggests that zzso might be involved in the complex regulation of proliferation of the pancreatic zzso
