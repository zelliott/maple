The zzso axis was assessed in 26 women with essential obesity using a zzso test, insulin zzso and oral zzso zzso zzso values of zzso and cortisol were similar in obese subjects and controls, whereas peak zzso values following zzso administration were significantly lower in obese zzso The net integrated areas under zzso and cortisol zzso after zzso injection were lower in obese subjects but not statistically zzso zzso inhibited cortisol levels in controls but not in obese zzso zzso zzso provoked a zzso and cortisol response in obese women which was significantly higher than that provoked by zzso The lesser response of zzso to zzso in obesity might be the result of an altered zzso response to zzso zzso by other zzso in addition, the increased zzso and cortisol response to the insulin stimulus compared to zzso observed in obese subjects leads to suppose that the zzso stimulus involves the release of other zzso
