zzso obese zzso fatty rats require two zzso zzso genes zzso to express the obese zzso The obese zzso rat zzso has decreased total and free serum zzso zzso but normal serum T4 zzso compared to those in their lean zzso To zzso the mechanism of these differences, we measured the zzso and production rate zzso of T4 and zzso in the three zzso of zzso male zzso rats zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso activity in liver, zzso and brown zzso tissue zzso was zzso T4 zzso were equivalent in all three zzso but a decreased zzso zzso was seen in zzso and zzso zzso An additive effect of the zzso gene was noted with respect to the decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso Whole body T4 zzso were equal in all three zzso but the zzso zzso was decreased in the zzso rat by zzso compared to that in the zzso lean rats zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso Liver and kidney zzso activities were decreased in the zzso rat by zzso zzso less than zzso and zzso zzso less than zzso zzso Brown zzso tissue and zzso zzso activity were similar in all three zzso These results show a reduction in zzso but not zzso zzso in obese zzso zzso Whole body zzso production and type I zzso activity were decreased in the obese zzso zzso These results suggest that decreased T4 to zzso conversion is responsible for the decreased zzso production rate in the fatty rat and may contribute to its zzso
