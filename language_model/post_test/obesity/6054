zzso in adolescents is increasingly prevalent and its impact on cardiovascular risk important to zzso zzso zzso of cardiovascular risk markers in obese adolescents are not zzso 

Our objective was to examine whether relative zzso zzso and cortisol excess are zzso of increased cardiovascular risk markers in obese teenage zzso 

A zzso study was conducted at a clinical research zzso 

Thirty girls (15 obese girls and 15 zzso zzso zzso years old matched for maturity and zzso 

zzso markers of cardiovascular risk including zzso zzso protein zzso zzso receptors 1 and 2, zzso soluble zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso urine free cortisol zzso were also zzso A zzso stimulation test was zzso 

The zzso levels were higher in obese girls than controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso after log zzso as were other markers of cardiovascular zzso Eight of the 15 obese girls but no zzso girl had zzso higher than 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso Body mass index zzso score was higher than zzso in zzso of girls with zzso higher than 3 zzso and no girls with zzso less than 3 zzso Girls with zzso higher than 3 zzso had higher zzso and lower peak zzso compared with those with zzso less than 3 zzso Peak zzso was an important negative predictor of most markers of increased cardiovascular zzso In addition to peak zzso zzso and zzso independently predicted zzso 

Relative zzso zzso and cortisol excess are significant contributors to increased levels of markers of cardiovascular risk in obese adolescent zzso
