We aimed to study circulating zzso zzso factor zzso in zzso in association with insulin resistance and in zzso in human zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso profile were assessed in 125 Caucasian zzso zzso levels were also assessed in an independent cohort of subjects zzso zzso zzso to study the effects of changing insulin zzso zzso gene expression and zzso were measured during differentiation of human zzso 

In all subjects, zzso was positively associated with body mass index zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso with insulin sensitivity zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso levels were significantly increased in subjects with altered zzso tolerance and type 2 zzso Of the inflammatory markers measured, zzso levels were positively associated with serum soluble zzso zzso 1 and zzso in obese zzso Interestingly, weight loss led to significantly decreased zzso concentration from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Multiple linear zzso analyses revealed that insulin sensitivity contributed independently to explain zzso of the zzso in zzso levels after controlling for the effects of body mass index, age, and log zzso zzso zzso in zzso observed after weight loss were related to changes in zzso insulin resistance, and blood pressure zzso zzso gene expression and zzso increased during differentiation of human zzso 

zzso zzso is associated with insulin zzso The findings show, for the first time in humans, that zzso zzso decrease significantly after weight loss in association with blood zzso zzso seems to be involved in human zzso zzso
