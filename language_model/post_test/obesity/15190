zzso zzso and visceral zzso tissue zzso differ in zzso and zzso properties, especially when obesity is zzso We submitted paired SAT and zzso samples from six zzso obese patients and six non-obese persons to two-dimensional differential gel zzso and zzso laser zzso mass zzso Compared with non-obese subjects, obese patients presented with increased zzso zinc finger protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B chain, zzso retinal zzso and zzso protein zzso and decreased zzso complement zzso zzso zzso chain, zzso zzso and zzso irrespective of the zzso tissue depot zzso SAT and zzso differed in protein species of zzso and zzso whereas zzso tissue depot and obesity zzso on the protein abundance of zzso zzso 1, one protein species of zzso retinal zzso and zzso protein zzso Our zzso zzso approach identified novel protein species that may be involved in the development of obesity in zzso
