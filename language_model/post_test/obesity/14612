To understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the effect of exercise training, we examined zzso zzso profiles using zzso zzso in zzso and untrained mice with zzso zzso zzso male mice zzso zzso zzso were fed with a normal diet, high-fat diet zzso or zzso with exercise training for 12 zzso The expression level of approximately 10,000 transcripts in liver zzso from each group was assessed using zzso zzso zzso Exercise training improved zzso profiles and zzso zzso and decreased body fat mass induced by the zzso zzso genes were zzso expressed in the zzso and/or zzso with exercise zzso groups, compared with the normal zzso and zzso groups, zzso Interestingly, the expression profiles involved in zzso such as zzso of very long chain fatty zzso 2, zzso and zzso zzso were changed by exercise zzso In addition, expression of genes altered by exercise training related to defense and stress response, including zzso 1 and 2 and heat shock zzso showed interesting zzso Our study showed beneficial effects of exercise training in preventing the development of obesity and zzso disorders in mice with zzso zzso
