The cloning of the obese gene and the characterization of its protein product, zzso has permitted the study of a new hormone potentially involved in the regulation of zzso tissue zzso The present study examined the gender differences in zzso plasma zzso concentration and its relationship to body zzso zzso tissue distribution and the zzso profile in samples of 91 men zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 48 women zzso zzso zzso zzso Plasma zzso zzso were strongly associated with body fat mass measured by underwater weighing zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso r zzso zzso p zzso In both zzso plasma zzso levels were also strongly correlated with waist zzso as well as zzso areas of abdominal subcutaneous and visceral zzso tissue measured by zzso zzso Women had, on average, plasma zzso zzso that were three times higher than zzso Furthermore, this gender difference remained significant when comparing men and women matched for similar levels of body fat zzso The associations between plasma zzso and zzso zzso were dependent of zzso In both men and women, elevated zzso plasma zzso levels were associated with higher plasma insulin zzso but only in women was the association maintained after correction for fat zzso Thus, results of the present study show that women have higher plasma zzso levels compared to men, independent of the zzso variation in total body fat zzso Furthermore, our results also suggest that, in women, the association between plasma zzso and insulin zzso is independent of zzso a finding which provides further support to the observation that zzso tissue zzso zzso may be zzso by zzso
