zzso zzso beverages zzso has been proposed in high-income countries to reduce obesity and type 2 zzso We sought to estimate the potential health effects of such a fiscal strategy in the middle-income country of India, where there is zzso in zzso consumption, patterns of substitution between zzso and other beverages after tax increases, and vast differences in chronic disease risk within the zzso 

Using consumption and price variations data from a nationally representative survey of zzso Indian households, we first calculated how changes in zzso price alter per capita consumption of zzso and substitution with other zzso We then incorporated zzso sales trends, body mass index zzso and diabetes zzso data zzso by age, sex, income, and zzso residence into a validated zzso of caloric consumption, zzso load, zzso zzso and type 2 diabetes zzso among Indian zzso facing a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso tax was anticipated to reduce overweight and obesity prevalence by zzso zzso zzso zzso and type 2 diabetes zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso among various Indian zzso over the period zzso if zzso consumption continued to increase zzso in accordance with secular zzso However, acceleration in zzso consumption trends consistent with industry marketing models would be expected to increase the impact efficacy of zzso averting zzso of prevalent zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of incident type 2 diabetes from zzso Given current consumption and zzso zzso our results suggest the largest relative effect would be expected among young rural men, zzso our a zzso hypothesis that urban populations would be isolated beneficiaries of zzso zzso Key limitations of this zzso approach include the assumption that consumer expenditure behavior from prior years, captured in price zzso will reflect future behavior among consumers, and potential zzso of consumption in dietary recall data used to inform our zzso 

zzso zzso taxation at a high tax rate could mitigate rising obesity and type 2 diabetes in India among both urban and rural zzso
