zzso in the zzso factor zzso zzso gene have been associated with an increased risk for type 2 diabetes in zzso To evaluate whether the five reported risk zzso zzso a higher risk for obesity and early impairment of zzso metabolism in children, we zzso these risk zzso of the zzso gene in a representative cohort of zzso Caucasian children and an independent cohort of 283 obese zzso 

zzso a case control design, we observed a significantly lower prevalence of the zzso and zzso risk zzso in the obese zzso zzso zzso compared with lean zzso zzso zzso children zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was, however, no statistically significant relationship between these zzso and quantitative traits of obesity in either a normal representative cohort zzso zzso zzso or an obesity zzso zzso children were significantly taller than lean zzso This increase in height was independently associated with risk zzso of the zzso zzso whereas in the normal representative cohort height appeared to be decreased in carriers of the minor zzso In the obese zzso three risk zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly associated with higher zzso and zzso blood zzso levels independent of sex, age, zzso stage, and body mass zzso zzso and peak insulin levels and zzso appeared with a similar tendency but were not statistically zzso 

Our data indicate for the first time that zzso gene zzso zzso an increased risk for early impairment of zzso metabolism in obese children, which is consistent with adult studies identifying zzso as a major diabetes zzso zzso
