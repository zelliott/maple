To date, several different equations to predict the zzso zzso rate zzso in patients with zzso zzso have been developed for different patients zzso Our aim was to determine the zzso factors of zzso in our zzso patient group of obese, zzso patients with Type 2 diabetes and zzso zzso since we assumed that the zzso zzso clearance zzso alone may not be an accurate method to predict zzso 

We recruited 46 obese patients zzso zzso with Type 2 diabetes and zzso zzso in our zzso center in zzso zzso However, two male patients were excluded from the analysis due to an outlying insulin level or low zzso zzso The zzso clearance as a measure of zzso function performed by the single shot method was compared with the zzso estimated by zzso zzso C, and zzso zzso Several multiple zzso models were built to test the impact of the zzso factors age, sex, body mass index zzso insulin resistance according to the zzso model assessment zzso body water zzso brain zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso zzso In the main zzso model to predict the zzso clearance by zzso only the statistically significant zzso factors of these models were selected, as well as the interaction between zzso predicted by zzso zzso and zzso 

The zzso factors zzso age, zzso zzso and zzso had a statistically significant impact on the zzso clearance (the gold standard of the zzso in our patient population zzso zzso However, the interaction of zzso and zzso was not significant zzso zzso zzso in our zzso The model was validated and considered zzso with a zzso of determination zzso of zzso 

The independent zzso factors to determine zzso in obese, zzso diabetic patients are zzso age, zzso zzso and zzso However, our model should be zzso and tested in a larger sample size to probably detect an interaction between zzso and zzso as an additional zzso zzso
