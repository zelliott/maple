zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso production has been studied in 33 zzso A broad and relatively continuous spectrum of zzso plasma zzso zzso was produced in 31 of the 33 subjects during 3 zzso of a high zzso zzso liquid formula zzso Two patients developed plasma zzso zzso in excess of 2000 zzso zzso and these were the only patients we have studied in which zzso induction of zzso seemed to be associated with a zzso in zzso plasma zzso removal zzso In the remaining 31 patients the degree of zzso was highly correlated with the insulin response zzso by the zzso of the high zzso formula zzso zzso No significant correlation existed between zzso plasma zzso concentration and either plasma zzso or free fatty acid zzso after the high zzso diet, nor was the degree of zzso related to degree of zzso It is suggested that zzso in most subjects results from an increase in zzso zzso zzso rate secondary to exaggerated zzso increases in plasma insulin zzso
