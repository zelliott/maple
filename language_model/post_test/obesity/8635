To test the hypothesis that the zzso of zzso insulin resistance and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso also known as type C insulin resistance, is caused by zzso in the gene for zzso zzso activated zzso gamma zzso a zzso for the zzso drugs that enhance sensitivity to zzso To investigate possible correlations between zzso in zzso and the degree of insulin zzso 

A candidate gene approach to study the molecular basis for a syndrome of zzso a comparison of zzso with in zzso zzso 

Fifteen unrelated patients with zzso syndrome and zzso zzso for the gene analysis: 25 unrelated zzso non-obese zzso zzso for the zzso zzso six unrelated patients with type 2 diabetes zzso and nine unrelated zzso non-obese zzso 

Analysis of zzso chain reaction zzso products of the 7 zzso that constitute the entire coding region of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso with zzso zzso restriction zzso length zzso zzso zzso and, where relevant, direct zzso zzso of insulin resistance using the insulin zzso clamp zzso 

A synonymous substitution in zzso 477 zzso zzso zzso was found in one zzso A zzso zzso in zzso 12 of zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in another patient, but not in any of 25 zzso non-obese control zzso The patient with the zzso zzso had the highest steady state zzso infusion rate zzso and most marked suppression of zzso zzso production rate zzso of all of the patients zzso 

zzso in the zzso gene are unlikely to be major contributors to zzso syndrome with zzso The zzso zzso may correlate with a lesser degree of insulin resistance in these zzso
