zzso and insulin resistance are both associated with an zzso zzso zzso We examined the effect of insulin sensitivity and central zzso on zzso in 196 individuals (75 men and 121 zzso with an average age of zzso zzso zzso were subdivided into three groups based on zzso and their insulin sensitivity index zzso lean insulin sensitive zzso zzso zzso lean insulin resistant zzso zzso zzso and obese insulin resistant zzso zzso zzso This categorization revealed that both obesity and insulin resistance determined the zzso zzso In addition, the zzso groups had increased central zzso zzso zzso fat zzso area, zzso by zzso zzso scan and decreasing zzso were important zzso of an zzso profile, marked by increased zzso LDL cholesterol, and zzso B and decreased HDL cholesterol and LDL zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that in subjects who had more zzso and were more insulin zzso the cholesterol content was increased in zzso zzso zzso zzso and dense LDL zzso whereas it was reduced in HDL zzso Multiple linear zzso analysis of the relation between the cholesterol content of each zzso fraction as the dependent variable and zzso and zzso as independent variables revealed that the cholesterol concentration in the zzso corresponding to zzso zzso dense LDL, and HDL was associated with zzso and that zzso additionally contributed independently to zzso but not to zzso LDL, or zzso Thus an zzso zzso profile appears to be the result primarily of an increase in zzso perhaps via insulin zzso
