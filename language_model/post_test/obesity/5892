At present in childhood there is only few information about the importance concerning circulating zzso zzso We therefore investigated the plasma zzso response to a mixed zzso an oral zzso load, zzso injection and insulin zzso in normal weight and obese children and patients with growth hormone zzso zzso in normal weight children: zzso Following a 800 zzso mixed meal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso peak values of plasma zzso were reached within zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso in 6 zzso zzso In response to oral zzso load of zzso zzso zzso zzso no zzso of plasma zzso levels were observed in 13 children zzso zzso of 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso in 10 children resulted in zzso increase of zzso zzso between 5 and 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso insulin in 7 children induced zzso and zzso peak values of plasma zzso within zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso - zzso in obese children: Following mixed meal zzso in 7 obese children plasma zzso response was comparable to zzso Although integrated insulin response over 180 zzso was higher in this group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 651 zzso p less than zzso the integrated zzso response zzso zzso zzso zzso did not differ from controls zzso zzso 876 zzso After oral zzso load no changes in circulating zzso zzso were zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
