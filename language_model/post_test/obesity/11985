zzso dysfunction is a hallmark of, and plays a pivotal role in the zzso of zzso diseases, including type II diabetes, zzso and zzso It has been well established that zzso acids zzso act as an zzso derived zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rapidly zzso certain zzso zzso zzso to less zzso zzso zzso thereby attenuating the evoked zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to examine if zzso of zzso can restore impaired zzso function in three animal models of zzso zzso zzso vessel rings of the zzso and/or zzso artery from mice or rats were zzso using zzso or zzso zzso and independent zzso to zzso and sodium zzso zzso were measured using wire zzso in vessels isolated from zzso or zzso obesity zzso mice, and zzso zzso zzso rats treated chronically with zzso zzso zzso or zzso or with zzso zzso to zzso but not to zzso was severely impaired in all three animal zzso zzso administration of zzso or zzso abolished whole blood zzso activity, elevated zzso zzso ratio, and zzso zzso dysfunction in all three zzso zzso the zzso artery of zzso mice with zzso and zzso to block zzso oxide zzso and zzso formation did not affect zzso improvement of zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso of zzso ameliorates zzso dysfunction and that effects in the zzso model are independent of the presence of NO and zzso derived zzso Thus, preserving zzso zzso by zzso of zzso may be of therapeutic benefit by improving zzso function in zzso zzso
