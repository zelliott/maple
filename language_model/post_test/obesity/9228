The aim of this study was to assess the zzso of insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance zzso indexes in a group of obese adolescents with Type 2 diabetes zzso zzso in comparison to obese adolescents without diabetes and normal controls, zzso to compare these parameters with the cardiac zzso zzso Seven zzso obese zzso zzso zzso zzso 18 obese without zzso and 10 zzso control adolescents age matched were zzso In all subjects we performed oral zzso tolerance test zzso with insulin and zzso determination, zzso zzso zzso blood pressure monitoring, zzso 

serum lipids were significantly higher in obese and zzso zzso sensitivity was significantly reduced in zzso and obese vs zzso zzso showed a more pronounced oral zzso insulin sensitivity zzso reduction vs zzso Both obese and zzso presented an higher zzso zzso showed an impaired zzso function, with insulin areas under the curve and disposition index significantly reduced in comparison to controls and obese who showed similar zzso A progressive reduction of zzso indexes and an increase of sympathetic indexes were found in obese adolescents and were more pronounced in zzso These parameters were correlated with zzso and zzso function parameters in both obese and zzso zzso zzso showed a significant relative wall thickness increase suggesting a trend toward concentric zzso In conclusion, zzso adolescents are characterized by a more marked zzso reduced zzso function in comparison to zzso zzso These modifications may lead to an early impairment of the zzso zzso
