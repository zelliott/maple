To assess vitamin D status and the influences of race, sun exposure and dietary vitamin D intake on vitamin D levels, and to evaluate two vitamin D zzso regimens in extremely obese patients awaiting zzso zzso 

A zzso analysis of dietary vitamin D, sun exposure, zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso D zzso differentiated zzso and zzso in 56 obese zzso mass index zzso 35 zzso men and women (age zzso zzso In a pilot clinical trial, 27 subjects with zzso levels zzso zzso were zzso to receive zzso or zzso for 8 zzso 

zzso zzso was low zzso 45 zzso 22 zzso and was zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso Each zzso increase of 1 zzso was associated with a zzso zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso sun exposure, African American race and zzso predicted zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly increased at 4 and 8 weeks in both treatment groups zzso zzso whereas zzso declined significantly in subjects treated with zzso zzso zzso and tended to decrease following zzso zzso zzso 

In severely obese individuals, those who are African American, have higher zzso and limited sunlight exposure are at greatest risk for vitamin D zzso These demographic factors can help to identify zzso patients who require vitamin D zzso prior to zzso zzso zzso prescribed doses of zzso and zzso are effective in raising zzso Further investigation is needed to evaluate whether these regimens have differential effects on zzso and to determine the optimal regimen for vitamin D zzso in the extremely obese zzso
