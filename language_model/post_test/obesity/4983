The association between plasma zzso protein zzso and the extent of coronary artery disease zzso in patients with stable angina remains zzso zzso is strongly associated with elevated zzso levels, potentially zzso the relationship between zzso and zzso zzso 

We studied 830 subjects without zzso and 218 patients with zzso undergoing zzso coronary zzso Geometric means of zzso were zzso in a zzso analysis of zzso model in which study participants were zzso into nine groups according to zzso status (no zzso zzso disease or zzso disease) and zzso of zzso There was a significant interaction between zzso and categories of zzso with regard to zzso level zzso In the lower zzso of zzso patients with zzso had markedly higher zzso concentration compared to control subjects zzso zzso and zzso zzso in subjects without zzso patients with zzso disease and patients with zzso disease, zzso zzso However, the relationship between zzso and zzso became weaker for patients in the second zzso zzso zzso whereas no significant relationship was observed for patients in the third zzso zzso zzso In patients undergoing coronary zzso zzso zzso was independently related to the magnitude of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The level of obesity is essential to the interpretation of the relationship between zzso and severity of zzso The production of inflammatory zzso with increasing levels of obesity becomes the dominant zzso of plasma zzso levels and masks the vascular contribution due to zzso
