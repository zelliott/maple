Patients with diabetes and other zzso conditions have increased zzso to cardiovascular zzso The zzso zzso is decreased in patients with zzso zzso Here, we found that pressure overload in zzso mice resulted in enhanced concentric cardiac zzso and increased mortality that was associated with increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and diminished zzso protein zzso zzso signaling in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso attenuated cardiac zzso in response to pressure overload in zzso zzso and diabetic zzso zzso In cultures of cardiac zzso zzso activated zzso and inhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with a zzso form of zzso reversed these effects, suggesting that zzso zzso zzso signaling in the zzso through zzso of zzso zzso zzso may have utility for the treatment of zzso zzso associated with diabetes and other zzso zzso
