We have evaluated the effect of acute administration of zzso zzso a zzso zzso on the zzso zzso rise in 11 obese children and in 8 zzso zzso The zzso response to zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso evaluated both as maximum zzso peak and as integrated area under the curve, was significantly lower in the obese children than in the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso orally 60 zzso before the zzso zzso significantly increased both baseline zzso levels and the zzso response to zzso in all the obese subjects, so that their mean baseline zzso peak zzso levels and integrated area under the curve after zzso zzso plus zzso were similar to those of the control children after zzso Also in control children zzso zzso increased (though not zzso baseline zzso zzso and caused a significant zzso of the zzso response to zzso Mean peak zzso levels and mean integrated area under the curve after zzso zzso plus zzso were significantly higher in the controls than in the obese children given the same zzso Mean baseline zzso levels were significantly higher in the obese than in control zzso These data show that enhancement of zzso zzso likely in the zzso zzso the blunted zzso response to zzso present in the obese children, and that in simple obesity the potential of the zzso to make a zzso response to a direct zzso zzso is zzso
