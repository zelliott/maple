The genetic architecture of zzso traits such as obesity has been poorly zzso zzso trait locus zzso analysis is widely used to zzso zzso affecting zzso traits on zzso zzso However, large confidence intervals and small zzso effects of identified zzso and closely linked zzso are zzso the identification of zzso genes that zzso the zzso Here we developed five zzso mouse strains with overlapping and zzso zzso zzso regions from an zzso zzso of a previously developed zzso strain, zzso and its genetic background strain, zzso zzso The zzso strains developed were zzso on low-fat standard zzso and a high-fat diet to zzso a previously identified obesity zzso zzso analysis was performed with zzso zzso to search for candidate genes of the zzso 

The obesity zzso was physically mapped to an zzso region of mouse zzso zzso The zzso zzso significantly decreased white fat pad weight, body weight and serum levels of zzso and zzso It was also resistant to the high-fat zzso Among 29 genes residing within the zzso region, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed great differential expression in zzso and/or zzso fat pads between zzso and B6 zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso prevented obesity in both mice fed a low-fat standard diet and mice fed a high-fat zzso This finding will pave the way for identification of zzso genes for zzso A further understanding of this unique zzso effect at genetic and molecular levels may lead to the discovery of new biological and zzso pathways associated with zzso
