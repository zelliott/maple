zzso plasma zzso zzso from zzso fat tissue zzso of zzso obese subjects possess specific binding sites for zzso zzso zzso This binding was independent of zzso E as zzso isolated from plasma of an zzso zzso individual was bound to a level comparable to that of normal zzso To examine the importance of zzso zzso the major zzso zzso in the specific binding of zzso to human zzso zzso modified to contain varying proportions of zzso zzso and zzso was prepared by zzso normal zzso particles with different amounts of zzso zzso zzso As the zzso zzso ratio in zzso zzso the binding of these particles to zzso plasma zzso was zzso Compared to control zzso a 92 zzso zzso reduction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) in maximum binding capacity was observed along with an increased binding affinity for zzso particles in which almost all of the zzso zzso had been replaced by zzso The zzso of HDL zzso zzso by intact zzso as monitored by zzso zzso labeled zzso was also significantly reduced (about zzso reduction, P less than zzso by substituting zzso zzso for zzso in zzso These data suggest that HDL binding to human zzso zzso is zzso primarily by zzso zzso and that optimal delivery of zzso zzso from HDL to human zzso is also dependent on zzso zzso
