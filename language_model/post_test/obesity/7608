This study, which is based on two cross zzso zzso data, aims to establish any effect of parental obesity sex distribution of offspring and to replicate the results that led to the hypothesis that obesity may be associated with zzso zzso lethal zzso A representative sample of zzso couples living in zzso Scotland was surveyed zzso A total of zzso offspring from zzso of the couples screened in zzso living in zzso were surveyed in zzso In this study, males represented zzso among the total offspring of the couples screened in zzso In the first survey there was a higher male proportion of offspring zzso p zzso from parents who were both obese, yet this was not significant after adjustment for age of zzso Also, there were no other significant differences in sex distribution of offspring according to body mass index, age, or social class of zzso The conditions of the original 1949 study of Angel ( 1949 ) (which proposed a zzso lethal zzso zzso were simulated by selecting couples with at least one obese zzso In this zzso zzso zzso zzso obesity in fathers and mothers was associated with zzso of offspring being male compared with zzso of offspring from a non-obese father and obese zzso Finally we conclude that families with an obese father have a higher proportion of male zzso These results do not support the long-established hypotheses of a zzso zzso lethal gene in the zzso of zzso
