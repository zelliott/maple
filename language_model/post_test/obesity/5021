zzso and insulin resistance are associated with increased serum free fatty acids zzso Thus, a reduction in circulating zzso may increase insulin zzso This could be achieved by increasing zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso mice with increased zzso tissue zzso caused by zzso of zzso zzso zzso show increased zzso zzso and develop obesity but are insulin zzso Here, we examined whether these transgenic mice were protected from zzso insulin zzso Surprisingly, when fed a high-fat diet for a short period (6 weeks), transgenic mice developed severe obesity and were more zzso zzso zzso and insulin resistant than zzso The high zzso zzso prevented white zzso tissue from zzso the flux of lipids in circulation and led to increased serum zzso levels and fat deposition in zzso Furthermore, circulating zzso and zzso zzso increased to similar levels in transgenic and control mice, while zzso levels decreased in transgenic mice compared with zzso In addition, transgenic mice showed fat zzso in brown zzso zzso which decreased zzso zzso zzso suggesting that these mice had impaired zzso zzso These results indicate that increased zzso expression in the presence of high-fat feeding may have deleterious effects and lead to severe insulin resistance and type 2 zzso
