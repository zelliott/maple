Using a classical candidate gene approach, we have described a common zzso zzso in the gene zzso which encodes the zzso expressed zzso zzso of zzso G zzso The zzso zzso is associated with alternative zzso of the gene and the formation of a truncated but functionally active zzso zzso which is referred to as zzso zzso of the zzso zzso results in an enhanced G protein zzso on stimulation of G zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso show an increased risk for hypertension and left zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso carriers respond with a stronger decrease in blood pressure to therapy with a zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso carriers appear to have an increased risk for obesity which appears sensible given the established role of G protein signaling in zzso The highest zzso of the zzso zzso are found in zzso with the highest zzso risk for zzso zzso black Africans and East zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso fulfills the criteria of a thrifty zzso
