zzso zzso techniques include zzso weighing zzso zzso X-ray zzso zzso measurement of total body water zzso by isotope zzso measurement of total body zzso and zzso zzso Although these reference methods are used zzso each has inherent practical zzso zzso zzso zzso is a new practical alternative to these more traditional zzso zzso We reviewed the principal findings from studies published between December 1995 and August 2001 that compared the zzso zzso method zzso zzso zzso Concord, zzso with reference methods and summarized factors contributing to the different study zzso The average of the study means indicates that the zzso zzso and zzso agree within zzso body fat zzso for adults and children, whereas the zzso zzso and zzso agree within zzso zzso for adults and zzso zzso for zzso Few studies have compared the zzso zzso with zzso zzso those that have suggest a similar average zzso of approximate zzso zzso by both the zzso zzso and zzso Individual variations between zzso models compared with zzso and 4 zzso models are partly attributable to zzso from the assumed chemical composition of the zzso Wide variations among study means, zzso to zzso zzso for zzso zzso - zzso and zzso to zzso zzso for zzso zzso - zzso are likely due in part to differences in laboratory equipment, study design, and subject characteristics and in some cases to failure to follow the zzso recommended zzso Wide zzso variations between methods are partly attributed to technical precision and biological error but to a large extent remain zzso On the basis of this review, future research goals are zzso
