Recent work shows that zzso zzso helps maintain normal liver function as chronic zzso zzso results in spontaneous development of zzso and zzso zzso The mechanisms by which these nontraditional functions of zzso occur are zzso Here, we use knockout mice deficient in zzso zzso synthesis zzso to study the zzso of the liver during the development of zzso One hundred and zzso protein spots, zzso expressed during the development of zzso were selected and identified by zzso mass zzso Among them, 12 proteins were found to be affected from birth, when zzso expression is switched on in zzso mouse liver, to the rise of zzso zzso which occurs at approximately 8 zzso Of the 12 zzso 4 zzso 1 zzso zzso c zzso I and II, and zzso zzso have known roles in zzso zzso We show that the zzso in expression of zzso zzso with a loss of zzso zzso zzso in isolated rat zzso indicate that zzso regulates zzso content, thus suggesting ways by which zzso may be zzso zzso we found the expression of these zzso proteins was abnormal in zzso mice and obese patients who are at risk for zzso zzso
