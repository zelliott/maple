Studies indicate a correlation between obesity and zzso zzso stress is involved in the progression of zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of obesity on zzso zzso stress in a rat zzso zzso 

The obese zzso rats zzso zzso zzso and their lean zzso zzso zzso zzso were each divided into two groups of seven zzso In one of each group, zzso was induced by zzso for 4 weeks, whereas the other group was left zzso The level of zzso and the ratio of zzso zzso were determined to examine zzso zzso zzso The serum level of zzso oxygen zzso and the zzso zzso pattern related to zzso stress, zzso and cell behavior were also zzso 

The obese rats weighed more than the lean rats at 4 zzso Compared to lean rats, obese rats had enhanced zzso zzso levels and a decreased ratio of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso with increasing serum zzso oxygen zzso However, there were no significant differences in the degree of zzso bone loss between lean and obese rats, except for teeth with and without zzso in both zzso In addition, the zzso zzso in obese rats showed higher zzso levels and zzso zzso zzso than the inflamed ones in lean rats, with zzso of multiple zzso zzso gene zzso 

zzso induced zzso zzso stress with increasing serum zzso oxygen zzso in zzso In the zzso zzso gene expressions related to a capacity for zzso zzso were zzso in the obese zzso
