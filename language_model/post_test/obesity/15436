The authors estimated abdominal fat distribution on the basis of zzso at zzso zzso zzso The zzso range for fat tissue was defined as the zzso within the mean plus or minus 2 zzso considered to be individual zzso Fat areas found with this method were closely correlated with those obtained by means of the zzso zzso method or with a fixed zzso range from zzso to zzso zzso as the standard of zzso Although the average CT numbers obtained with different scanners were distributed widely, the calculated fat areas were almost zzso This method might be a practical and standardized method at zzso
