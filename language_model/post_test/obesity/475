zzso In the present study, we determined the role of hypertension, zzso stress and inflammation on kidney damage in a zzso model of obesity and zzso zzso was induced in male obese zzso mice and lean zzso mice by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and mice were allowed to drink water containing zzso zzso Mice were divided into six groups as zzso obese and lean control, obese and lean zzso salt zzso and obese and lean zzso plus zzso salt zzso zzso Blood pressure was significantly increased in lean and obese zzso groups relative to their respective zzso however, there was no difference in blood pressure between the lean and obese control and salt zzso zzso zzso was increased in obese control compared with lean control mice zzso zzso 267 vs 493 zzso 53 zzso zzso zzso and this zzso was further increased in the obese zzso treated mice zzso zzso 312 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were also increased in both obese and lean zzso groups compared with their respective zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment increased collagen IV zzso in both obese and lean mice compared with controls, but there was no difference between obese and lean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly increased in the obese compared with the lean zzso mice zzso zzso 160 vs 202 zzso 48 zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that obese zzso zzso mice exhibit greater zzso injury than lean zzso zzso mice in a manner independent of blood pressure and that this zzso injury is associated with obesity related pre-existing zzso zzso zzso
