Exercise represents an effective zzso strategy to improve zzso control in type 2 diabetes zzso However, the impact of exercise intensity on the benefits of exercise training remains to be zzso In the present study, we compared the clinical benefits of 6 months of continuous low- to zzso exercise training with those of continuous zzso to high-intensity exercise training, matched for energy zzso in obese type 2 diabetes zzso 

Fifty male obese type 2 diabetes patients (age 59 zzso 8 years, zzso 32 zzso 4 zzso participated in a 6 month continuous zzso exercise training zzso All participants performed three supervised exercise sessions per week, either 55 zzso at 50% of whole body peak oxygen zzso zzso zzso to moderate zzso or 40 zzso at zzso of zzso zzso to high zzso zzso zzso zzso blood zzso zzso zzso profile, body zzso zzso workload capacity, whole body and skeletal muscle zzso capacity and skeletal muscle zzso type composition were assessed before and after 2 and 6 months of zzso 

The entire 6 month intervention zzso was completed by 37 zzso Continuous zzso exercise training reduced blood zzso zzso levels, zzso zzso body weight and leg fat mass, and increased zzso lean muscle mass and skeletal muscle zzso c zzso and zzso zzso activity zzso zzso No differences were observed between the groups training at low to moderate or moderate to high zzso 

When matched for energy cost, prolonged continuous low- to zzso zzso exercise training is equally effective as continuous zzso to high-intensity training in lowering blood zzso zzso and increasing whole body and skeletal muscle zzso capacity in obese type 2 diabetes zzso
