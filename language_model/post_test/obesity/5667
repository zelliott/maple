zzso zzso zzso levels were significantly lower in obese than lean zzso In zzso incubation in the presence of 100 zzso insulin significantly increased zzso zzso levels in both groups of zzso However, even in the presence of 100 zzso the zzso zzso content of obese patients was lower than that of control zzso The in zzso zzso curve of the effect of insulin on zzso zzso zzso was shifted to the right when the red cells of obese were used, with a highly significant reduction of the zzso zzso Such reduction of the zzso effect of insulin suggests that the impairment of zzso zzso zzso zzso observed in obese patients results essentially from a zzso zzso In obese patients, net increase in zzso zzso levels zzso as the difference between zzso and 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso correlated with zzso plasma insulin levels zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso and with body mass index zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso while it was positively correlated with the zzso disappearance rate after zzso load zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso and zzso zzso clearance rate zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso is impaired in patients with obesity and that such zzso is correlated to impaired -- zzso zzso disposal in the zzso
