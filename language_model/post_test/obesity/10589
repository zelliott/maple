The zzso S zzso is a putative zzso for serum zzso A, and recent studies have suggested that zzso may be a link between type 2 diabetes zzso and zzso zzso studies of zzso zzso have revealed associations with circulating levels of inflammatory markers and hard end points of cardiovascular zzso In this study, we analyzed zzso expression in subcutaneous zzso tissue and zzso zzso in relation to zzso risk zzso DNA zzso expression analysis was used to study the expression of zzso in lean and obese siblings from the Swedish zzso zzso zzso Pair zzso zzso zzso was used to analyze 3 zzso previously found to be associated with circulating levels of inflammatory zzso in the zzso zzso study of zzso zzso and unstable angina zzso zzso associations between zzso zzso and/or expression with zzso and measures of zzso status were zzso zzso zzso chain reaction was used to analyze the zzso expression in isolated human zzso incubated with zzso In lean subjects, we found correlations between zzso gene expression in subcutaneous zzso tissue and measures of obesity zzso P zzso zzso zzso diameter, P zzso zzso and blood pressure zzso P zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and in obese subjects, we found correlations with measures of obesity zzso mass index, P zzso zzso zzso diameter, P zzso zzso and zzso control zzso model assessment of insulin resistance, P zzso zzso insulin, P zzso zzso after adjusting for age and zzso The zzso zzso was associated with serum levels of insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso model assessment of insulin resistance zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso increased after insulin stimulation in isolated human zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we found an association between both zzso gene expression in zzso tissue and zzso zzso with measures of zzso zzso In zzso studies demonstrated that the zzso gene is regulated by insulin in human subcutaneous zzso This study further supports a role for zzso in the development of zzso disease, especially in the context of insulin zzso
