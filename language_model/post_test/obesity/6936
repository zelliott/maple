We have investigated whole body protein turnover in the zzso state in five normal men, five male Type 1 diabetic patients off insulin therapy, and five obese women, using IV zzso as a zzso In diabetic patients, there was, as expected, a greater net loss of protein in the zzso state than in normal zzso However, contrary to animal and studies in zzso our diabetic patients in the zzso state showed a greater rate of protein synthesis than normal subjects zzso less than zzso The increased net loss of protein in diabetic patients compared with normal subjects arose because, in the diabetic patients, protein breakdown was increased even more than protein synthesis under the conditions of this zzso Plasma zzso concentration was higher in diabetic and in zzso obese patients than in normal subjects zzso less than zzso and higher in diabetic than in obese patients zzso less than zzso The rate of protein synthesis per zzso lean body mass was also higher in diabetic patients than in obese or normal subjects zzso less than zzso and higher in obese than normal subjects zzso less than zzso We conclude that, in human subjects, whole body zzso and protein metabolism are very sensitive to the action of zzso
