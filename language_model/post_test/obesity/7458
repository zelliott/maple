zzso is a serious health issue for many patients with zzso There is a lack of zzso for and understanding of the development of obesity in the early phase of the zzso Therefore we investigated a set of routine zzso variables in blood as zzso of the development of obesity and weight gain over 5 years in an zzso cohort study of patients with zzso schizophrenia zzso Twelve percent of the patients were obese at baseline and 37% were obese at the zzso zzso The mean body mass index zzso change over 5 years was a zzso zzso increase zzso zzso zzso was predicted by baseline zzso levels zzso ratio per standard zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso red blood cell count zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso After adjustment for baseline zzso the associations were attenuated for zzso and zzso Low baseline zzso was associated with a greater zzso zzso The major conclusion is that easily available routine zzso markers can be useful in predicting the development of obesity in zzso zzso The mechanisms underlying the observed associations are unknown, but the zzso identified in this study could signify zzso or insulin zzso These observations open a new window to future research on the mechanisms underlying the development of obesity in zzso
