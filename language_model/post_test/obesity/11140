We aimed to test the fetal zzso hypothesis by comparing the associations of maternal and paternal zzso zzso of zzso with zzso and cardiovascular risk factors in zzso 

Children from a prospective birth cohort had zzso fat percentage zzso plasma zzso insulin and zzso zzso and blood pressure measured at zzso years of zzso zzso zzso zzso were recorded for mothers (at zzso zzso zzso and fathers (5 years following the index zzso 

zzso Memorial Hospital, zzso zzso 

Children zzso zzso born to mothers with normal zzso tolerance during zzso 

zzso per cent of mothers and 38% of fathers were zzso obese zzso zzso but only zzso of the children were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso sum of zzso fat percentage and waist zzso zzso insulin concentration and insulin resistance increased with increasing maternal and paternal sum of zzso adjusted for the zzso sex, age and zzso zzso zzso and paternal effects were zzso The associations with zzso insulin and insulin resistance were attenuated after adjusting for the zzso current zzso 

In this population, both maternal and paternal zzso equally predict zzso and insulin resistance in the zzso This suggests that shared family environment and lifestyle, or zzso factors, influence child zzso Our findings do not support the hypothesis that there is an zzso zzso effect of maternal zzso in zzso zzso although we cannot rule out such an effect in cases of extreme maternal zzso which is rare in our zzso
