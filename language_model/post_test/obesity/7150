To compare expression of zzso zzso zzso coding for the cortisol zzso zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso in paired zzso of subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso and zzso zzso tissue zzso from zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso were obtained from 54 children (age zzso years, body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso standard zzso score zzso zzso and 16 adults (age zzso years, zzso zzso zzso undergoing open abdominal zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso were measured using quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction zzso 

zzso zzso level was higher in zzso than in SC zzso whereas zzso zzso was higher in SC than in zzso zzso There was no difference in the zzso zzso level between SC and zzso These results were consistent in children and zzso In children, zzso zzso in SC was positively associated with zzso zzso zzso whereas in zzso it was positively associated with age zzso The association between zzso expression and age remained significant after adjustment for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was positively associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not with age in zzso In multiple zzso zzso including zzso variables and age, zzso zzso was independently associated with zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso When normal weight and overweight children were analyzed zzso zzso zzso levels were positively associated with zzso in zzso in the overweight group zzso 

There are zzso differences in zzso levels of zzso and zzso in children and zzso The positive association of zzso zzso in zzso with age may reflect a zzso role in visceral fat zzso during zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in SC with increasing zzso zzso could suggest that the risk of zzso consequences of obesity may be established early in zzso
