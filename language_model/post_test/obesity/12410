Three zzso A zzso molecular species, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in 13 types of zzso rat tissue were zzso A relatively larger pool size of total zzso consisting of zzso zzso and zzso was observed in the zzso zzso liver, heart, and brown zzso zzso Focusing on changes in the zzso pool size in response to the zzso composition of the diet given, total zzso pools in rats continuously fed a high-fat diet for 4 weeks were significantly higher in the zzso zzso and zzso and significantly lower in the liver and skeletal muscle than those of rats fed a zzso or zzso zzso In particular, reductions in the liver were remarkable and were caused by decreased zzso zzso zzso the total zzso pool size was reduced by approximately one-fifth of the zzso contents of rats fed the other zzso In the zzso which monitors energy balance, all three zzso molecular species measured were at higher levels when rats were fed the high-fat zzso Thus, it was of interest that feeding rats a high-fat diet affected the behaviors of zzso pools in the zzso liver, and skeletal muscle, suggesting a significant relationship between zzso pools, especially zzso and/or zzso pools, and zzso metabolism in zzso
