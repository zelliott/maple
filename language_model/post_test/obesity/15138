To verify whether sleep quantity and quality at baseline predict the magnitude of fat loss in adults subjected to moderate caloric zzso 

A total of 123 overweight and obese men and women zzso zzso zzso zzso years; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso underwent a weight loss intervention consisting of a targeted zzso zzso decrease in energy intake supervised by a zzso The length of the intervention varied between 15 and 24 zzso Body fat mass zzso X-ray zzso sleep quality zzso Pittsburgh sleep quality index zzso and sleep duration zzso zzso from the Pittsburgh sleep quality zzso were assessed at both baseline and at the end of the weight loss zzso 

The mean weight loss over the dietary intervention was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of which came from fat zzso Using a multiple linear zzso analysis, we observed a significant positive relationship between sleep duration and the loss of body fat, both in absolute zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso as well as in relative terms zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso after adjusting for age, sex, baseline zzso length of the intervention, and change in total energy zzso Furthermore, we observed that a better sleep quality at baseline was associated with greater fat mass zzso 

This study provides evidence that sleeping habits can influence the success of a weight loss intervention and should be taken into consideration when one decides to start a zzso
