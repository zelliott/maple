zzso syndrome zzso and zzso zzso systemic inflammation zzso are very common findings in the older zzso Although zzso and zzso have been associated in adults, it is not known what is the real contribution of zzso and its single zzso to zzso in older zzso due to the potential zzso effect of zzso and zzso We investigated the relationship between increased zzso protein zzso plasma levels, a marker of zzso and zzso in zzso older zzso or zzso zzso community dwelling Italian individuals enrolled the zzso zzso zzso syndrome was defined by the zzso zzso zzso High sensitivity zzso zzso levels were measured by zzso zzso zzso and defined as high zzso The overall prevalence of zzso was zzso The prevalence of high zzso was zzso in subjects with, and zzso in those without zzso zzso zzso was associated with high zzso levels after adjustment for age, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared to subjects with zzso and no zzso individuals with zzso and zzso were characterized by higher waist zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed the association between waist circumference and high zzso levels in subjects with zzso zzso circumference III zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso independent of age, zzso and important zzso variables including zzso Additional zzso conducted with and without zzso of zzso levels, confirmed the central role of waist circumference in the zzso phenomenon, independent of gender and diagnosis of zzso We conclude that in older individuals, zzso is associated with zzso but the association is mainly supported by a strong independent correlation between waist circumference and high zzso zzso In the absence of this specific zzso zzso it seems that the contribution of zzso to zzso would be modest at zzso
