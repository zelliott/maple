This study evaluated the effects of acute and chronic consumption of higher dietary protein on energy zzso zzso use, zzso and zzso hormones during weight loss in zzso 

zzso women chronically consuming a 750 zzso zzso diet with a protein content of zzso zzso zzso diet, zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso diet, zzso zzso zzso 17) for 9 weeks were zzso On separate days, zzso zzso and hormonal responses were measured over 4 hours when the women consumed a higher zzso meal zzso zzso of energy as zzso or a normal zzso meal zzso zzso of energy as zzso 

With chronic diet groups combined, zzso led to lower respiratory exchange ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso lower zzso zzso zzso zzso and higher fat zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso also led to reduced zzso zzso hunger zzso zzso and desire to eat zzso zzso and lower zzso zzso zzso zzso 16 zzso zzso zzso 18 zzso zzso 240 minutes, p zzso compared with zzso No differences in zzso energy expenditure zzso occurred between zzso When combining acute meals, respiratory exchange ratio was lower zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso was higher in the zzso zzso zzso An acute zzso diet interaction was observed with zzso such that zzso led to greater zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 195 minutes; p zzso
