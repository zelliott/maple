The zzso or zzso zzso zzso is crucial for energy zzso and regulation of food zzso zzso is a 16 zzso hormone that is mainly zzso by fat cells into the zzso Under normal circumstances, circulating zzso levels are zzso to the fat body zzso zzso of elevated zzso levels by the zzso zzso activates a negative feedback loop resulting in reduced food intake and increased energy zzso zzso zzso zzso lead to opposite zzso zzso rational design of zzso zzso could be an appealing challenge in the battle against zzso The zzso interactions have been studied in several works by means of different molecular zzso approaches, spreading from zzso zzso to manual zzso No small molecules have ever been proposed as zzso of the zzso zzso but zzso efforts focused only on zzso synthetic peptides as zzso zzso and on zzso In this review we try to track a timeline of obtained in zzso information to clarify the mechanism of interaction between zzso and its zzso together to zzso the more recent efforts to propose new drugs usable in zzso zzso Final considerations could be useful starting points for the rational drug design of new lead zzso
