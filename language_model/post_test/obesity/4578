Acute zzso is a substantial clinical problem accounting for zzso hospital admissions yearly in the United zzso zzso is epidemic and is clearly an independent risk factor for increased severity of acute zzso zzso zzso tissue is an zzso organ that zzso a variety of metabolically active substances termed zzso However, the role of zzso in modulating acute zzso severity remains incompletely zzso zzso fish oil is rich in omega-3 free fatty acids and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we hypothesized that feeding obese mice diets rich in fish oil would alter the zzso milieu and zzso the severity of zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and obese zzso mice were fed either a soybean zzso or fish oil-rich diet for 4 zzso zzso was induced by six hourly zzso injections of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were measured, and zzso severity was assessed zzso and by measuring pancreatic zzso of zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso mice developed more severe zzso than lean zzso Fish oil significantly decreased serum zzso zzso and zzso and increased serum zzso zzso zzso Fish oil did not alter the baseline pancreatic inflammatory zzso nor did it change zzso or zzso zzso zzso 

These data demonstrate that a diet rich in fish oil altered the zzso milieu in lean and zzso obese zzso however, fish oil did not improve zzso severity induced with zzso zzso
