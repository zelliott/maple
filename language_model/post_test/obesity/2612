Previous published studies have identified a class of women, zzso Weight zzso women zzso with normal zzso and high fat zzso An important role of zzso zzso has been documented in zzso muscle proliferation and promoting fat zzso zzso the presence of three types of zzso zzso zzso in fat tissue suggests a direct effect on zzso zzso We studied three single zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene and investigated their relationship with zzso zzso We considered two classes of women according to their zzso and percent fat mass zzso zzso class 1: including 72 zzso women zzso zzso fat zzso and class zzso including 36 zzso zzso zzso high fat zzso Three sites of zzso zzso zzso zzso gene were zzso located respectively in zzso zzso zzso border and zzso zzso of the identified zzso was performed by restriction zzso length zzso zzso frequency zzso was performed by using the zzso of Chicago zzso zzso ratio analyses were calculated by zzso zzso zzso significant differences were observed for zzso 7- zzso zzso border and zzso zzso 7 zzso distribution between class 1 and class 2 zzso These results strongly support the hypothesis that genetic zzso of the zzso zzso has an important role in body fat zzso Our data underscore previous findings that suggest a potential role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
