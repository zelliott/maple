zzso zzso disease zzso is a growing health burden for global zzso which has generated keen interest in interventions to prevent or delay the progression of its zzso chronic kidney disease zzso There are biologically plausible mechanisms that link increased zzso to pathways of kidney injury, animal models of zzso kidney disease and specific zzso disease that is observed in extremely obese zzso Further, individuals with progressive kidney disease and incident zzso are more obese than their counterparts in the general zzso These observations raise the consideration that zzso policies targeted at delaying progressive zzso should recommend interventions for treatment of obesity in these zzso We examine this proposition first by describing the public health infrastructure that exists to translate zzso public health policy, illustrating it by examples familiar to the practicing zzso Next, we suggest that, despite the evidence supporting an association between increased body weight and progressive zzso it is premature to zzso public health recommendations for weight reduction in zzso zzso This zzso reflects the lack of strong evidence that reduction in body weight delays or prevents the progression of zzso and persistent uncertainty about the direction of the association between obesity and mortality in individuals with advanced kidney zzso We conclude by noting that this position is not that of therapeutic nihilism but rather a caution to approach weight management in zzso on an individual, zzso basis, and an emphasis for further zzso clinical trials to resolve these zzso
