zzso zzso zzso and zzso plasma proteins were determined by affinity zzso using zzso B in animal models with diabetes or inappropriate zzso Adult zzso zzso mice and zzso zzso mice exhibited zzso fold increases of body weight, zzso fold zzso of plasma zzso and zzso fold zzso of plasma zzso zzso zzso and zzso plasma proteins were raised zzso fold and zzso fold zzso In adult zzso rats, administration of zzso or zzso of zzso zzso fragments produced zzso changes in insulin and zzso zzso either resulting in the onset of insulin zzso zzso fold zzso and zzso zzso fold zzso by 2 days, or zzso zzso fold zzso and zzso zzso fold zzso by 6 and 8 days, zzso zzso plasma proteins were increased zzso zzso rapidly after zzso treatment followed by zzso zzso zzso fold zzso after 8 zzso In contrast, the decreases in zzso plasma proteins and zzso zzso zzso fold and zzso fold, zzso in zzso rats preceded the demonstration of zzso by 5 and 2 days, zzso zzso plasma proteins in zzso rats returned to zzso values at zzso zzso Good correlations were observed in mice and rats between zzso and both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso zzso and zzso plasma proteins zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso and between the zzso blood proteins themselves zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso The results show that the measurement of zzso blood proteins by affinity zzso using zzso B provides a sensitive and reliable indicator of the recent zzso zzso
