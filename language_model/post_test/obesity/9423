The impact of obesity on development of zzso complications after gastrointestinal surgery remains zzso This may be due to the fact that obesity has been calculated by body mass index, a measure that does not account for fat zzso We hypothesized that waist zzso a measure of central zzso would better predict complications after high-risk gastrointestinal zzso 

zzso review of an institutional cancer database identified consecutive cases of men undergoing zzso zzso zzso zzso circumference was calculated from zzso zzso 

From 2002 to 2009, 152 patients with mean age zzso zzso zzso years and body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso body mass index was not significantly associated with risk of zzso complications including infection, zzso and zzso Greater waist circumference independently predicted increased risk of superficial infections zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso and a significantly greater risk of having one or more zzso complications zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso 

zzso zzso a measure of central zzso is a better predictor of short-term complications than body mass index and can be used to identify patients who may benefit from more aggressive infection control and zzso
