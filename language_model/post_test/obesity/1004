The purpose of this study was to determine if long-term zzso treatment zzso zzso signal zzso and the subsequent downstream zzso and zzso responses in normal and zzso age-related obese zzso To this end, we zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso rat zzso zzso zzso or control virus into young and zzso rats and after 9 or 46 days, examined food zzso oxygen consumption, body weight, serum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso expression and protein level in brown zzso tissue zzso In young rats, zzso depleted body fat and both zzso and zzso mechanisms contributed to this zzso Moreover, zzso signal zzso was not zzso and there were persistent zzso zzso Similarly, in the zzso rats, there was unabated zzso signal zzso however, both the zzso and zzso responses completely attenuated sometime after day zzso This zzso downstream of the zzso zzso may be contributing to the zzso and age-related weight gain in these zzso zzso Finally, in young rats, although the initial responses to zzso were dominated by zzso responses, by 46 days, the zzso response was zzso rather than zzso suggesting that energy expenditure may be an important component of long-term weight zzso
