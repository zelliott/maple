To evaluate the influence of breast-feeding on the body mass index zzso growth trajectory from birth through 13 years of age among offspring of diabetic zzso zzso and offspring of zzso zzso zzso participating in the zzso zzso Outcomes Among Children zzso 

There were 94 zzso and 399 zzso who had multiple zzso measures obtained from birth throughout zzso A measure of breast zzso was derived from maternal self-report to categorize breast-feeding status as adequate zzso breast zzso or low zzso breast zzso Mixed zzso models were constructed to assess the impact of breast-feeding on the zzso growth zzso during infancy zzso to 27 zzso and childhood (27 months to 13 zzso 

zzso who were adequately zzso had a slower zzso growth trajectory during childhood zzso and slower zzso growth zzso with significant differences between 4 and 6 years of age zzso and 6 to 9 years of age zzso compared with zzso with low zzso A similar pattern was seen in the zzso with adequate breast-feeding associated with lower average zzso in infancy zzso and childhood zzso and a slower growth trajectory in childhood zzso zzso zzso growth zzso was seen among the zzso associated with adequate breast-feeding with significant differences between zzso months zzso 4-6 years zzso zzso years zzso and zzso years of age zzso 

Our study provides novel evidence that breast-feeding is associated with long-term effects on childhood zzso growth that extend beyond infancy into early and late zzso zzso these effects are also present in the high-risk zzso exposed to zzso during zzso zzso in the early zzso period may represent a critical opportunity to reduce the risk of childhood zzso
