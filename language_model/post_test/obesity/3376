Plasma zzso zzso insulin zzso and zzso responses during oral zzso tolerance testing zzso were evaluated in 10 non obese women with zzso zzso disease zzso and 10 obese women with zzso zzso disease zzso Mean plasma zzso response at 120 minutes in zzso showed impaired zzso zzso Also in this group, 1 patient had frank diabetes zzso whilst 3 other patients had impaired zzso tolerance 1 zzso patient had impaired zzso zzso Mean plasma zzso levels and mean incremental zzso areas were higher in the zzso at all time intervals and reached statistical significance at 60 and 90 zzso Mean plasma zzso levels were also higher in zzso at all time zzso and reached statistically significant higher levels at 0, 60 and 90 zzso Mean serum zzso valves were also higher at all time intervals in zzso The relationship between zzso zzso obesity and zzso was also zzso It is evident from this study that obesity has a significant negative impact on the overall zzso status in women with zzso
