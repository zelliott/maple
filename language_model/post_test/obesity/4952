The aim of the study was to determine whether zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso release from zzso cells zzso is altered in obese zzso women in response to zzso Six obese and 8 zzso zzso women zzso zzso underwent a zzso zzso oral zzso tolerance zzso zzso necrosis factor alpha release was measured from zzso cultured in the presence of zzso after isolation from blood samples drawn zzso and 2 hours after zzso zzso zzso resistance was derived by zzso model assessment of insulin zzso Total body fat zzso and zzso fat zzso were determined by zzso zzso zzso women had a higher zzso zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso percentage of total body fat zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso and percentage of zzso fat zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso model assessment of insulin resistance was greater in the obese group zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso plasma zzso protein zzso zzso zzso vs 236 zzso 79 zzso P zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso were both elevated in obese zzso zzso resulted in a suppression of zzso zzso release from zzso of zzso subjects zzso zzso 21 vs 57 zzso 28 zzso P zzso but no change in obese women zzso zzso 36 vs 173 zzso 49 zzso The zzso response was different between groups zzso zzso 21 vs zzso zzso 22 zzso P zzso There was also a positive association between the incremental change in zzso zzso and percentage of zzso fat zzso zzso zzso P zzso In conclusion, these data suggest that there is an absence of the zzso suppression of zzso in zzso after zzso in obese women, and this response may contribute to impaired zzso disposal and insulin zzso
