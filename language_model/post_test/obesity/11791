Recent data from this laboratory demonstrate that increasing zzso zzso zzso results in a coordinated stimulation of zzso and zzso of zzso We have also noted that increasing dietary calcium of obese patients for 1 year resulted in a zzso zzso loss of body fat zzso zzso we tested the possibility that zzso hormones may act on zzso to increase zzso and zzso metabolism by measuring the effects of 1, zzso in primary cultures of human zzso and found zzso sustained increases in zzso zzso and a corresponding marked zzso of zzso zzso approximately 50 zzso zzso suggesting that dietary calcium could reduce zzso mass by suppressing zzso To test this hypothesis, we placed transgenic mice expressing the zzso gene specifically in zzso on a low zzso zzso zzso zzso diet either zzso or with 25 or 50% of the protein replaced by zzso dry milk or supplemented to zzso zzso with zzso for 6 zzso Weight gain and fat pad mass were reduced by zzso by the three high calcium diets zzso The high calcium diets exerted a corresponding 51% zzso of zzso fatty acid zzso expression and activity zzso and stimulation of zzso by zzso zzso to zzso zzso This concept of calcium zzso of zzso was further evaluated zzso in the zzso III data zzso After controlling for energy zzso relative risk of being in the highest zzso of body fat was set to zzso for the lowest zzso of zzso intake and was reduced to zzso zzso and zzso for the second, third, and fourth zzso respectively, of calcium intake for women zzso a similar inverse relationship was also noted in men zzso zzso Thus, increasing dietary calcium suppresses zzso zzso zzso and thereby zzso energy metabolism and zzso obesity zzso
