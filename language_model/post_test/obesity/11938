To assess the long-term clinical effectiveness and zzso of zzso weight management schemes for adults in terms of weight loss and maintenance of weight zzso 

zzso databases were searched from inception to December 2009, including the Cochrane Library, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso & Other zzso zzso zzso of related papers were screened, key conferences and zzso were searched and experts were contacted to identify additional published and unpublished zzso 

For the clinical effectiveness review, two zzso independently screened titles and abstracts for zzso zzso criteria were applied to the full text of retrieved papers by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer using a zzso inclusion flow zzso The studies were long-term zzso controlled trials zzso of adult participants who were classified by body mass index as overweight or zzso zzso were zzso weight management zzso (including diet, physical activity and zzso change zzso that assessed weight zzso zzso that involved the use of over-the-counter medicines licensed in the UK were also zzso For the zzso review two zzso independently screened studies for zzso zzso zzso cost-benefit or zzso analyses were zzso Data were extracted using a zzso and zzso data extraction zzso The quality of included studies was assessed using standard zzso Studies were zzso through a narrative review with full zzso of zzso 

A total of zzso references were identified, of which 12 were included in the clinical effectiveness zzso Five zzso compared zzso interventions with zzso zzso zzso In general, weight loss appeared to be greater in the intervention groups than in the zzso zzso Two zzso compared zzso interventions that focused on the diet zzso In these studies there were no statistically significant differences in weight loss between zzso Four zzso compared zzso interventions that focused on the physical activity zzso There was little consistency in the pattern of results seen, in part zzso to the differences in the zzso In one zzso the intervention focused on the zzso zzso and it appeared that weight loss was greatest in those given daily goals compared with weekly zzso Overall, where measured, it appeared that most groups began to regain weight at further zzso Of the zzso studies identified in the zzso searches, none met the full inclusion zzso Two economic evaluations are described in our zzso however, caution is required in their zzso as they did not meet all inclusion zzso Lifetime chronic disease models were used in these studies and the models included the costs and benefits of avoiding chronic zzso Both studies found the interventions to be zzso with estimates varying between zzso and zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from these studies were apparent and caution is therefore required in the interpretation of these zzso 

zzso zzso weight management interventions were generally shown to promote weight loss in overweight or obese zzso Weight changes were small however and weight regain was zzso There were few similarities between the included zzso consequently an overall interpretation of the results was difficult to zzso There is some evidence that weight management interventions are likely to be zzso although caution is required as there were some limitations in the two zzso studies zzso
