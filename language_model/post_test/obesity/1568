Conduit artery function in obese humans is frequently assessed at rest, but very little is known about resistance artery function in response to muscle zzso We tested the hypothesis that obese adults will exhibit reduced zzso rapid onset zzso Single and brief zzso zzso were used to isolate the local effects of muscle contraction on the zzso zzso response, independent of systemic zzso and sympathetic neural zzso 

We measured zzso blood flow zzso zzso blood pressure zzso zzso and heart rate zzso on a zzso basis in 14 obese zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 14 lean zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso young zzso zzso zzso zzso changes from baseline in zzso vascular zzso zzso ) were calculated in response to single, brief zzso zzso performed in random order at 15, 20, 25, 30, 40 and 50% of zzso voluntary contraction zzso 

In both groups, each single contraction evoked a significant zzso zzso immediate zzso one cardiac zzso and graded zzso increase from one up to six cardiac cycles zzso Immediate zzso zzso peak zzso zzso and total zzso under the curve, zzso zzso zzso responses were reduced with zzso The degree of impaired zzso increased with increasing zzso 

These novel findings demonstrate a blunted zzso rapid onset zzso with obesity that is exercise intensity zzso zzso rapid onset zzso may zzso impact zzso responses to everyday intermittent activities performed by obese zzso
