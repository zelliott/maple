On the basis of literature values, the relationship between zzso mass zzso fat mass zzso and resting energy expenditure zzso zzso zzso was determined for zzso adults zzso zzso zzso zzso The objectives were to develop a mathematical model to predict zzso based on body composition and to evaluate the contribution of zzso and zzso to zzso The following zzso equations were zzso 1) zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso 2) zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and 3) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso explained only a small part of the variation remaining after zzso was accounted zzso The models that include both zzso and zzso are useful in examination of the changes in zzso that occur with a change in both the zzso and zzso To account for more of the zzso in zzso zzso will have to be divided into organ mass and skeletal muscle mass in future zzso
