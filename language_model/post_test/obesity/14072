zzso an innate immune protein with zzso properties, shows considerable zzso activity in animal zzso We investigated the relationship between circulating zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso in the context of zzso status in zzso 

We evaluated 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and measured circulating zzso zzso by zzso under zzso conditions in healthy Caucasian men zzso zzso zzso and male patients with an altered zzso tolerance zzso zzso zzso We also studied the association of zzso concentration with vascular zzso via high-resolution ultrasound analysis of the zzso artery in a zzso of study zzso 

zzso zzso concentration was zzso associated with zzso zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and directly correlated with HDL cholesterol concentration zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Control AG zzso for zzso had significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, control individuals who were G carriers for zzso had significantly lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and significantly higher HDL cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso than AA zzso These associations remained significant after controlling for age, zzso zzso ratio, zzso zzso zzso smoking status, and alcohol zzso zzso zzso concentration was not significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso in the individuals studied zzso zzso zzso however, zzso was positively associated with zzso in obese participants with an altered zzso tolerance zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

We have identified associations among zzso zzso circulating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso in zzso
