zzso is markedly associated with abnormal bone density indicating the importance of zzso in bone zzso However, the specific function of zzso remains zzso with marked discrepancies in observations of previous zzso In the present study, the effect of zzso on zzso was zzso A mouse model of obesity was established and an in zzso zzso system was zzso containing zzso and zzso zzso cells in a zzso zzso Compared with control mice, obese mice exhibited low body weight and bone mineral density of the zzso and fat cells were observed to accumulate in bone zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso and the zzso and protein expression of alkaline zzso and zzso was found to be decreased in zzso cells and zzso and protein expression of zzso acid zzso and zzso K was significantly increased in zzso zzso zzso In addition, the effect of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso of nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso system indicated that the zzso ratio zzso by zzso increased and zzso expression by zzso increased, leading to increased zzso These results indicate that bone metabolism is impaired in obese mice leading to decreased zzso and marked increases in zzso and low bone zzso
