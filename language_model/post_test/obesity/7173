Traditionally, zzso zzso zzso zzso placement in the obese patient has been considered a relative zzso due to the zzso of gastric zzso and inability to approximate the abdominal and gastric zzso The aim of this study was to determine the overall success rate, zzso and zzso mortality in overweight and obese zzso 

Three hundred zzso consecutive patients were zzso evaluated over a zzso period at the Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso One hundred zzso patients were considered overweight zzso mass index zzso or zzso 27 zzso Of those, 80 patients were found to be obese zzso or zzso 30 zzso with a zzso ranging zzso zzso 

zzso placement was successful in 130 of zzso zzso overweight patients zzso zzso The overall zzso mortality was zzso The rate of significant complications in overweight and obese patients remained zzso when compared with those patients with a normal zzso Out of zzso patients, 14 failed to receive a zzso 3 of these were obese and 1 was zzso These 4 procedures were aborted due to a paucity of anatomical landmarks and failure to zzso the abdominal zzso 

We believe that zzso placement in the overweight and obese patient can be a technically safe procedure according to our success rate of zzso with a zzso mortality rate of zzso In those overweight and obese patients who require specialized long-term zzso nutrition support, zzso placement should be considered earlier and more zzso
