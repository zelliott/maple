A controversial area in understanding the contribution of obesity to skeletal muscle insulin resistance is the distribution of control of zzso metabolism across zzso steps of zzso delivery, zzso zzso and zzso zzso via zzso Dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging of skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso provides an in zzso method for assessment of these steps in zzso In the current study we have examined the application of a zzso skeletal zzso model for assessment of zzso metabolism that takes zzso zzso zzso into account and compared this to the classic zzso model in lean and obese zzso We assessed the effects of insulin infusions at three rates zzso 40, and 120 zzso In comparison with the classic model, the skeletal zzso model reveals more clearly zzso effects of insulin on zzso zzso transport and an impairment of this response in zzso Compared with the classic model for assessment of zzso zzso both the skeletal zzso and the classic model indicate that, with respect to distribution of control, zzso zzso has an important effect at low to moderate levels of insulin stimulation in both lean and obese zzso
