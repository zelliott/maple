It is currently unclear how physical activity and diet interact within the ranges of activity seen in the general zzso This study aimed to establish whether a small, zzso increase in physical activity would lead to zzso change in energy intake and zzso balance, and to provide power analysis data for future research in this zzso 

Twelve participants were studied over 7 days of habitual activity and 2 weeks after instruction to increase physical activity by 2000 steps per zzso Physical activity was assessed using a diary, the zzso activity monitor and a zzso zzso analyses from prospective food zzso were compared between the first and third zzso 

Participants increased zzso zzso steps per day, P zzso zzso and estimated energy expenditure zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but did not significantly change their energy zzso dietary composition or number of meals per zzso From reverse power analysis 38 participants would be needed to exclude a change in energy intake of 400 zzso zzso with zzso power at P zzso 400 zzso zzso would compensate for a 2000 steps per day increase in physical zzso 

These results did not demonstrate any zzso increase in food consumption when physical activity was increased by walking an average of zzso additional steps per zzso Power analysis indicates that a larger study zzso zzso zzso will be necessary to exclude such an effect with zzso
