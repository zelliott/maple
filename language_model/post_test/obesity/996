The objective of the study was to determine the effects of short-term exercise on zzso tolerance and insulin response to a zzso load in centrally obese zzso 

75 g oral zzso tolerance tests zzso were performed prior to participation and 24 hours after the last exercise zzso Exercise bouts were 40 minutes in duration and consisted of treadmill walking and cycle zzso at zzso of zzso maximum heart rate zzso 

Eleven zzso centrally obese men zzso zzso Mass, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso were studied before and after 10 days of zzso exercise zzso 

No significant change zzso in body mass was noted following 10 days of exercise as compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso concentration was significantly lower zzso zzso following 10 days of exercise as compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso No significant change zzso zzso in zzso plasma insulin zzso however, was observed following 10 days of exercise training as compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso Plasma insulin zzso at 60 minutes and 120 minutes were significantly decreased zzso zzso when comparing the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso Plasma zzso concentration at 120 zzso was also significantly reduced zzso zzso after 10 days of exercise as compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso Area under the zzso curve was significantly zzso zzso reduced after 10 days of exercise as compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso Area under the insulin curve was also significantly decreased zzso zzso following 10 days of exercise training as compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These data suggest that short-term exercise may improve zzso tolerance and insulin response to a zzso load in centrally obese zzso
