Aging can be defined as a progressive decline in the ability of the zzso to resist stress, damage, and zzso Although there are currently over 300 theories to explain the aging phenomenon, it is still not well understood why organisms age and why the aging process can vary so much in speed and quality from individual to zzso The zzso stress hypothesis is one of the prevailing theories of zzso This theory states that free zzso produced during cellular zzso damage zzso zzso and DNA thereby accelerating the aging process and increasing disease zzso Under normal conditions, the electron transport chain is the primary producer of the zzso zzso which is precursor to other highly zzso species such as hydrogen zzso and the zzso zzso zzso stress accumulates when zzso overwhelm the zzso defense zzso This is dependent on a number of factors including free radical production, zzso of tissue to stress, and strength of the defense and repair zzso zzso stress has been implicated in a number of chronic disease states usually grouped under the umbrella of the zzso syndrome and is thought to contribute to the aging zzso It has been hypothesized that the production of free zzso is dependent on resting zzso rate and this may have an impact on the aging zzso However, other factors, such as zzso function, may be important in the production of free zzso and the subsequent effect on aging and disease zzso
