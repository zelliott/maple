zzso obesity in man is followed by several abnormalities in zzso secretions, including an elevated cortisol zzso as well as zzso in women, and a relative zzso in men, suggesting a central neuroendocrine zzso A pronounced insulin resistance is a main symptom of this condition and may be at least partially following these zzso zzso For example, mimicking zzso in women by administration of testosterone zzso in moderate doses to female rats is followed by severe muscular insulin resistance, as well as a low type zzso II muscle fiber ratio, and a low zzso density in zzso These findings are identical to those in visceral obese women with zzso and insulin zzso Studies of details of function and zzso in the muscles in this rat model have revealed that insulin stimulation of zzso zzso zzso synthesis and the insulin sensitive part of the zzso zzso is diminished at zzso insulin zzso However, insulin zzso number and function, as well as the total number of zzso zzso 4 appear to be normal, supported by observations that the insulin resistance is overcome by elevated insulin zzso These observations suggest that normal cellular mechanisms for zzso metabolism in muscle in this model are zzso and that the explanation to apparent insulin resistance may be found zzso to the machinery of the muscle zzso The zzso changes of the muscles may provide a clue to the understanding of the zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
