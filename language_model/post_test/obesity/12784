To investigate serum zzso of zzso growth factors zzso and zzso proteins zzso in obese adolescent girls before and after weight reduction and to examine their associations with hormonal and zzso zzso 

73 girls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso participated in this 6 w intervention zzso 

zzso Compared to 100 zzso girls of same age the obese subjects had increased levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and normal levels of zzso zzso After weight loss zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased and zzso zzso zzso and the ratio zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso insulin levels of the patients were positively correlated with zzso but zzso with zzso and zzso zzso was associated with several zzso zzso it showed an inverse correlation with zzso acid and zzso zzso The ratio zzso to zzso was zzso correlated with total cholesterol and zzso In addition, zzso was zzso correlated with the zzso ratio of the zzso 

These studies of a homogeneous group of patients give further insight into possible zzso regulations and roles of zzso and zzso The main conclusion is that obesity has to be considered for interpretation of serum zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, out results suggest that zzso the decrease in zzso after weight loss could be partly responsible for the impaired growth zzso seen in obese children during zzso feeding and zzso low zzso and high zzso levels are associated with an zzso zzso risk factor zzso
