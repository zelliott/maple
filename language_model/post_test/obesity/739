We examined the zzso zzso zzso gene expression in the zzso nucleus zzso and zzso zzso zzso in 6- and zzso male obese zzso zzso zzso zzso in the ARC in zzso rats was significantly decreased in 6- and zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso in zzso rats was significantly increased in zzso compared to lean zzso zzso zzso treatment in zzso zzso rats partially reversed those zzso These results suggest that the zzso gene expression in zzso rats might be regulated in part by zzso zzso
