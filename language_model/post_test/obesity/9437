In Japan, the number of obese patients with gastric cancer is zzso This study aimed to evaluate the advantages of zzso assisted zzso zzso zzso for obese patients relative to those of conventional zzso zzso zzso 

Between January 2004 and June 2009, a total of 197 consecutive patients with gastric zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso with zzso 1 reconstruction in the zzso University zzso The patients were assigned to undergo zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso according to the depth of tumor invasion and zzso zzso zzso A body mass zzso of 25 zzso or higher was defined as zzso and the amounts of blood loss, the operating time, the number of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso complications experienced by obese and zzso patients were zzso 

None of the patients in the zzso group required conversion to zzso In the zzso group, significantly fewer zzso zzso were retrieved from the obese patients zzso zzso zzso than from the zzso patients zzso zzso zzso P zzso However, among the obese patients, the number of zzso zzso retrieved did not differ significantly between the zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso group, the obese patients had a longer operating time zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and a greater estimated blood loss zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso than the zzso zzso The estimated blood loss correlated the surgical procedures and zzso No significant difference in zzso complications was noted between the obese and zzso groups after each zzso 

Relative to zzso zzso did not affect the zzso of the procedure for the obese patients, and there is no significant difference in the operating zzso The estimated blood loss was significantly less for zzso than for zzso Surgeons should elect to perform zzso for obese patients with gastric zzso
