We tested the hypothesis that early enrollment in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, zzso and Children zzso is associated with a reduced risk of rapid infant weight gain zzso 

We used a zzso cohort of zzso pairs zzso enrolled in zzso in New York State from 2008 to 2009 and estimated the odds of zzso defined as a 12-month change in zzso zzso score of more than zzso comparing infants of mothers enrolled during the first, second, or third zzso of pregnancy with those who delayed enrollment until the zzso zzso 

After adjusting for potential zzso the odds of zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso were significantly lower for infants of women enrolling during the first zzso versus zzso Birth zzso zzso score zzso zzso zzso zzso attenuated the estimate of prenatal versus zzso enrollment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The results demonstrate that prenatal zzso participation is associated with reduced risk of zzso between birth and age 1 zzso zzso birth weight for zzso age may be the mechanism through which early prenatal zzso enrollment protects against zzso
