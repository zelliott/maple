The present study examined the association between body composition zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso with serum zzso D levels in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso D, intact zzso hormone, zzso growth factor I levels, zzso zzso zzso zzso of fat and zzso mass, zzso and zzso strength zzso dietary intake zzso ultraviolet B radiation exposure, and physical activity levels were collected from 112 zzso zzso women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso body mass index, zzso zzso zzso zzso 

At a zzso level, serum zzso D levels were zzso associated with regional and total body fat mass zzso zzso whereas positive associations were observed with regional and total body zzso mass zzso zzso After controlling for age, serum intact zzso hormone, zzso growth factor I levels, ultraviolet B radiation exposure, and physical activity levels, most of the associations observed at a zzso level between serum zzso D levels and body composition zzso (as obtained by zzso zzso zzso remained zzso No significant associations were observed between zzso zzso of body mass and serum zzso D zzso 

An independent inverse association between serum zzso D levels and zzso zzso zzso zzso of total body and regional fat mass was observed in zzso overweight, zzso zzso Further clinical trials are required to come to safe conclusions on whether it is the fat mass that affects serum zzso D levels or vice versa and whether there is a need to also take into account body composition when providing recommendations for vitamin D intake in zzso zzso
