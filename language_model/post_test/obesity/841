zzso protein zzso is a member of the zzso inner membrane carriers that zzso zzso entry in the zzso zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso zzso which enhances its zzso activity, was associated with enhanced risk for type 2 diabetes in obese zzso We addressed the question of whether the zzso zzso contributes to variation in insulin sensitivity by zzso 181 zzso offspring of type 2 diabetic zzso zzso sensitivity, assessed by the zzso zzso was reduced in zzso carriers compared with zzso or zzso carriers zzso zzso zzso To directly investigate the correlation between zzso expression and insulin resistance, zzso zzso levels were measured by real-time zzso in subcutaneous fat obtained from 100 obese subjects who underwent zzso adjustable gastric zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly correlated with insulin resistance as assessed by the zzso model assessment index zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso We examined the association of the zzso zzso in a zzso study including zzso type 2 diabetic subjects and zzso control zzso The zzso zzso was associated with diabetes in women zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not in zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso of the zzso gene may contribute to diabetes zzso by affecting insulin zzso
