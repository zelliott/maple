zzso increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and premature zzso However, not all obese subjects develop the zzso abnormalities associated with zzso The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanisms that induce zzso in obese zzso 

zzso isotope zzso were used to zzso the zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso obese men (with comparable body mass index and visceral fat zzso and in zzso zzso men zzso Liver fat was determined using zzso magnetic resonance zzso and subcutaneous abdominal and visceral fat were measured by magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso in obese subjects were increased by the combination of increased zzso and severely impaired clearance of zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, increased liver and subcutaneous abdominal fat were linked to increased zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso whereas increased plasma levels of zzso zzso were associated with impaired clearance in obese zzso zzso 

zzso zzso defects are required to produce zzso in obese subjects with similar levels of visceral zzso The results emphasize the clinical importance of assessing zzso waist in obese subjects to identify subjects at high zzso zzso
