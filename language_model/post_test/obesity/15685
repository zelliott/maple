The cardiac implications of obesity in kidney transplant recipients are not zzso 

We examined associations of body mass index zzso at transplant with zzso cardiac risk among zzso zzso zzso recipients at a single center in 1991 to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso heart failure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a composite of these cardiac diagnoses were estimated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso hazards zzso relationships of zzso increments with cardiac risk were modeled by Cox's zzso We also systematically reviewed the literature on zzso and cardiac events after zzso 

In the local data, zzso cumulative zzso of any cardiac diagnosis rose from zzso to zzso across the lowest to highest zzso zzso zzso driven primarily by increases in zzso and zzso In contrast, the rate of zzso zzso did not differ by zzso zzso zzso Each 5 U zzso increase predicted zzso higher risk of the cardiac composite zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a relationship that persisted with significance after zzso adjustment zzso hazards ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso independently predicted cardiac risk in zzso with zzso heart disease and with zzso zzso zzso Data from 26 original articles support zzso as a risk factor for zzso zzso and zzso whereas findings for zzso outcomes are inconsistent and predominantly zzso 

High zzso at transplant predicts increased cardiac risk, especially of zzso and zzso Further research should examine whether obesity treatment zzso cardiac risk after kidney zzso
