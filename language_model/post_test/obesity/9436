In applications such as medical statistics and zzso we encounter situations where a large number of highly correlated zzso explain a zzso For example, the response may be a disease indicator and the zzso may be treatment indicators or single zzso zzso zzso zzso a good zzso model in such cases is well zzso Less well understood is how to recover the zzso zzso zzso that is finding which zzso have direct effects on the response, and indicating the statistical significance of the zzso Restricting attention to zzso zzso and response, we study the recovery of the true zzso pattern using a zzso method that separates establishing the presence of effects from zzso their exact relationship with the zzso zzso and a real data application demonstrate that the method discriminates well between associations and direct zzso Comparisons with zzso methods demonstrate zzso performance of the proposed zzso
