Human zzso DNA zzso variations have been implicated in a broad spectrum of zzso With over zzso zzso variations reported across databases, establishing zzso of variations in zzso is a major zzso We have designed and developed a comprehensive weighted scoring system zzso for identification of zzso variations that can impact zzso and would likely be associated with zzso The criteria for zzso include information available in the literature, predictions made by various in zzso tools and frequency of variation in normal and patient zzso The scoring scheme also assigns scores to patients and normal individuals to estimate the cumulative impact of zzso The method has been implemented in an automated pipeline and has been tested on Indian zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in this study, and other publicly available zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of Japanese individuals from six different groups, zzso patients with Parkinson's disease, patients with Alzheimer's disease, young obese zzso young non-obese zzso and zzso diabetes patients with or without severe vascular zzso zzso for analysis can extract information from variation data or from zzso DNA zzso It has a zzso zzso that provides flexibility to zzso the parameters for zzso zzso 

Analysis of zzso and zzso data suggests that rare zzso comprise the largest part of disease associated zzso zzso predicted possible role of eight and 79 novel variations in zzso and zzso zzso respectively, in disease zzso Analysis of cumulative scores of patient and normal data resulted in Matthews zzso zzso zzso of zzso and accuracy of zzso suggesting that the method may also predict involvement of zzso variation in zzso 

We have developed a novel and comprehensive method for evaluation of zzso variation and their involvement in zzso Our method has the most comprehensive set of parameters to assess zzso variations and overcomes the zzso bias generated as a result of zzso diseases and zzso These variations can be zzso for functional zzso to confirm their zzso zzso
