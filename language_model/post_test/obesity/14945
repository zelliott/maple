The purpose of this paper is to provide a general framework for thinking about pathways and potential mechanisms through which complementary feeding may influence the risk of developing zzso diseases zzso 

To provide a context for the lack of clear and consistent evidence relating complementary feeding to zzso risk, zzso challenges faced in trying to develop an evidence base are zzso Potential pathways through which complementary feeding may influence zzso zzso risk are described and illustrated with zzso 

Numerous aspects of complementary zzso including diet composition as well as patterns of feeding have the potential to influence the early development of zzso which in turn predicts later obesity and zzso zzso zzso dietary zzso during the period of complementary feeding also have the potential to program future disease risk through pathways that are independent of zzso These factors all require consideration when making recommendations for optimal complementary feeding practices aimed at prevention of future zzso
