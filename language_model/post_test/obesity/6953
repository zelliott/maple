The subcutaneous zzso tissue of genetically obese mice zzso differs from that of lean zzso not only by virtue of its larger cells but also in its fatty acid zzso it contains a higher proportion of zzso acid and a lower proportion of zzso zzso To determine whether these differences in fatty acid composition were inherent in fat cells, subcutaneous zzso tissue from obese and lean mice was transplanted under the kidney capsules of lean and obese host mice and the fatty acid composition of the neutral lipids of the graft and of the host zzso and subcutaneous fat was determined 1 or 2 months zzso The fatty acid composition of zzso from lean donors in obese mice resembled that of the zzso zzso tissue of the obese hosts after 1 month, with a lower proportion of zzso acid and a higher proportion of zzso acid than in lean zzso zzso from obese mice in lean mice had fatty acid compositions which were either zzso partially changed or which completely resembled that of the zzso The use of zzso zzso by feeding the donor zzso acid indicated that total lack of fatty acid zzso rather than selective zzso zzso was responsible for the failure of some zzso from obese mice in lean mice to acquire the fatty acid composition of the zzso zzso tissue of the zzso
