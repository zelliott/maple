During insulin resistance, sympathetic nerve activity is zzso However insulin resistance is a common feature of obesity and essential hypertension, it is unclear if chronic zzso per zzso contributes to sympathetic zzso The purpose of our study was to zzso the relationships between chronic zzso and heart rate zzso zzso a zzso tool to assess zzso function, in obese and zzso zzso 

24 hours zzso zzso for zzso time and frequency domain analysis was performed in 77 patients, mean age 53 zzso 10 years, 52 men and 25 women, free of diabetes, without zzso divided in four groups according to three zzso body mass index zzso 27 zzso in man zzso 25 zzso in woman defined zzso zzso pressure and zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso defined zzso 27 patients obese, zzso with zzso 28 patients obese, zzso without zzso 12 patients non obese, zzso without zzso 10 patients obese, zzso without zzso 

In comparison with the three other groups, patients with zzso showed a significant decrease zzso zzso of zzso and the power of total spectrum zzso zzso band, which are indexes of global zzso and a significant decrease zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso power of the low frequency zzso zzso band, both indexes reflecting sympathetic zzso of zzso In contrast, no significant difference was observed between the four groups for indexes of zzso reflecting zzso zzso These relations were independent of mean zzso zzso zzso was significantly zzso zzso related with zzso in time domain zzso r zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso and spectral domain zzso zzso r zzso zzso low zzso r zzso zzso 

zzso zzso appears to be an important zzso of zzso particularly for the indexes reflecting sympathetic influence, independent of obesity and zzso
