Since knee zzso zzso is one of the common diseases, identification of its associated risk factors is of preventive zzso This investigation was designed to investigate the prevalence of zzso in zzso and identify the associated risk factors of zzso 

A population sample was surveyed of zzso adults aged from 35 to 64 years, living in zzso buildings without zzso The protocol of Asia Pacific League of zzso for zzso zzso Community zzso Program for Control of zzso Diseases zzso core questionnaire was zzso The data on knee pain and zzso were collected and zzso zzso such as sex, age, body mass index zzso waist circumference zzso education level, and smoking history, were included in zzso zzso zzso model for further zzso
