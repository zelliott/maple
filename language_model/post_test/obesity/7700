It is well known that resting state regional cerebral blood flow is abnormal in obese when compared to zzso subjects but the underlying zzso mechanisms are poorly zzso To address this issue, we tested the hypothesis that zzso of resting state cortical zzso zzso rhythms differ among zzso zzso and zzso subjects as a reflection of the relationship between cortical neural synchronization and regulation of body zzso zzso resting state zzso data were recorded in 16 zzso subjects, 25 zzso subjects, and 18 zzso zzso All subjects were zzso healthy (no eating disorders or major zzso zzso rhythms of interest were delta zzso zzso zzso alpha 1 zzso alpha 2 zzso beta 1 zzso beta 2 zzso and gamma zzso zzso cortical sources were estimated by zzso brain electromagnetic zzso zzso zzso results showed that zzso and zzso alpha 1 sources fitted the pattern zzso zzso whereas zzso alpha 1 sources fitted the pattern zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso alpha 2 sources was stronger in the zzso subjects than in the zzso and zzso subjects zzso These results suggest that abnormal weight in healthy zzso subjects is related to abnormal cortical neural synchronization at the basis of resting state alpha rhythms and fluctuation of global brain zzso
