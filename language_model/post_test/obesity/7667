zzso processes reported in undernourished women during pregnancy are a recognized strategy for providing the energy required to support fetal zzso Women who are obese before zzso arguably have sufficient fat stores to support the energy demands of pregnancy without the need to provoke zzso zzso 

We tested the hypothesis that obese women would show behavioral adaptation zzso a decrease in self-selected walking zzso zzso but not zzso compensation zzso a decrease in resting zzso rate zzso or the zzso cost of zzso during zzso 

zzso zzso speed, zzso cost of walking, and zzso variables were measured in 23 women aged 31 zzso 4 y with a zzso (in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso and 30 zzso of zzso zzso was also measured in 2 zzso of zzso control subjects matched for the age, weight, and height of the pregnant cohort at 15 zzso zzso zzso and 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso weight gain varied widely zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the women gained more weight than is zzso zzso increased significantly by an average of 177 zzso 176 zzso (11 zzso zzso P zzso however, the zzso zzso was zzso Both the zzso cost of walking and zzso speed decreased significantly zzso zzso Whereas zzso increased zzso of the zzso the net oxygen cost of walking decreased in the same proportion of zzso 

Although the increase in zzso was greater than that explained by weight gain, evidence of both behavioral and biological compensation in the zzso cost of walking was observed in obese women during zzso The trial is registered with the Australian Clinical Trials zzso as zzso
