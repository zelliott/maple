It is unclear whether elevated spontaneous physical activity zzso very zzso physical zzso positively influences body composition long zzso We determined whether zzso and caloric intake were zzso related to the growth curve zzso of body weight, fat mass zzso and zzso mass zzso between obesity resistant and zzso rats at specific age zzso 

Body zzso zzso and caloric intake were measured in zzso zzso and zzso zzso rats from 1 to 18 zzso Data from development throughout maturation were analyzed by zzso growth curve modeling to determine the rate and acceleration of body weight, zzso and zzso 

zzso rats had a lower rate of zzso gain overall, a lower acceleration in body weight early in life, significantly greater zzso and lower cumulative caloric zzso Greater zzso in zzso rats was significantly associated with a lower rate of zzso gain overall and lower acceleration in body weight early in zzso zzso resistant rats lost less zzso compared with zzso rats despite that zzso rats had a lower acceleration in zzso gain early in zzso zzso rats gained less zzso and more zzso per gram body weight and were less energy efficient than zzso zzso zzso intake was significantly and positively related to body weight, zzso and zzso gain in both zzso zzso patterns of caloric intake were group and zzso Our data demonstrate that elevated and sustained zzso during development and over the lifespan are related to the reduced the rate of zzso gain and may preserve zzso 

These data support the idea that zzso level is a zzso marker that reliably predicts propensity for obesity in rats, and that elevated levels of zzso maintained during the lifespan promote a lean zzso
