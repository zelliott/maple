zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso improve insulin sensitivity in zzso but it is still unclear whether inflammatory signals zzso their zzso zzso In this study, we tested whether targeted disruption of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso a key inflammatory zzso in zzso zzso the zzso effects of zzso in obese zzso 

zzso and zzso were subjected to a high-fat diet or standard diet for 18 weeks and were then treated with zzso for 2 zzso zzso insulin sensitivity and zzso tolerance were determined and zzso zzso harvested to assess zzso of insulin and zzso protein zzso zzso signaling pathways and the levels of inflammatory zzso 

zzso was found to similarly improve zzso insulin sensitivity and insulin signaling to zzso in skeletal muscle of obese zzso and obese zzso zzso However, zzso further improved zzso tolerance and liver insulin signaling only in obese mice lacking zzso This zzso effect of zzso on zzso tolerance was linked to a markedly increased ability of the drug to raise plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso in muscle and liver only in obese zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was increased in zzso tissue of zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso with a NO donor blunted zzso zzso 

Our results identify the zzso zzso as a critical zzso of zzso zzso and circulating zzso levels and show that zzso of this key inflammatory zzso improves the efficacy of zzso zzso in an animal model of obesity and insulin zzso
