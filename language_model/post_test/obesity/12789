Mice fed a high-fat diet develop zzso and zzso Using zzso diabetes zzso zzso model mice, we investigated the effects of seven different dietary oils on zzso zzso palm oil, which contains mainly zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso oil, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso oil, 59% zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso soybean oil, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso oil, zzso zzso zzso zzso oil, zzso zzso zzso and tuna fish oil, zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso zzso mice received each as a high-fat diet zzso of total zzso for 19 weeks zzso zzso 6 to 11 per zzso After 19 weeks of zzso body weight induced by the diets was in the following order: zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso fish zzso zzso levels 30 minutes after a zzso load were highest for zzso oil zzso zzso zzso modest for zzso oil, soybean oil, and zzso zzso zzso zzso mild for zzso fish, and palm oil zzso zzso zzso and minimal for zzso meals zzso zzso zzso Only palm zzso mice showed zzso zzso zzso zzso By zzso multiple zzso analysis, body weight (or white zzso tissue zzso zzso and intake of zzso acid (or zzso zzso were chosen as independent variables to affect zzso zzso By zzso analysis, the zzso acid intake had a positive correlation with blood zzso level zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not with obesity zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso blood insulin levels vary among fat zzso and a higher zzso blood insulin level in palm zzso mice may explain their better zzso control irrespective of their marked zzso zzso a favorable zzso response induced by fish oil feeding may be zzso by a decrease of body zzso and zzso obesity and a higher intake of zzso acid are independent risk factors for zzso of zzso zzso
