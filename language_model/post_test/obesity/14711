We hypothesized that the loss of zzso zzso in zzso mice is associated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to impaired zzso insulin zzso zzso Changes in zzso zzso in lean and zzso mice from 5 to 16 weeks were assessed by zzso blood zzso plasma insulin, oral zzso zzso and tissue insulin zzso In zzso zzso and zzso content were zzso in isolated zzso while zzso expression was determined by quantitative real-time zzso and zzso zzso reduction of zzso expression was achieved through zzso of zzso with specific small interfering zzso zzso resistance was detected in 5-week-old zzso mice, but zzso and blood zzso levels remained zzso By 8 weeks of age, zzso mice displayed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and also had elevated zzso fatty acid concentration in zzso In zzso zzso and zzso generation were impaired in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was elevated at 5 and 8 weeks of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso increased zzso in zzso of lean mice, but had no effect in zzso from zzso zzso Loss of zzso zzso and impairment of insulin zzso from isolated zzso at 8 weeks in zzso mice is preceded by an increase in zzso expression in zzso Moreover, the zzso conditions observed are predicted to increase zzso activity, contributing to lower zzso zzso and zzso
