Various inflammatory zzso related to obesity might be closely related to insulin zzso zzso zzso are involved in inflammatory zzso However, there are few reports regarding the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso we investigated the role of zzso B4 zzso zzso zzso signaling in mouse zzso zzso zzso differentiation to mature zzso 

Mouse zzso zzso were treated with zzso zzso zzso BLT zzso and small interfering zzso zzso for zzso and zzso to block the zzso signaling pathway, then the zzso differentiation such as zzso zzso and the increase in zzso was zzso 

zzso of BLT signaling by treatment with a zzso inhibitor or a BLT zzso suppressed zzso differentiation into mature zzso In addition, zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso dramatically inhibited zzso These results indicate the zzso signaling zzso may positively regulate zzso differentiation and be a zzso system to control zzso zzso 

The zzso signaling zzso provides a potent regulatory signal that zzso the differentiation of mouse zzso zzso Further investigations are necessary to confirm the exact role of zzso and zzso signaling pathways in zzso zzso
