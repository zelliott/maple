To develop an internationally acceptable definition of child overweight and zzso specifying the zzso the reference population, and the age and sex specific cut off zzso 

International survey of six large nationally representative cross zzso growth zzso 

Brazil, Great Britain, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, Singapore, and the United zzso 

97 876 males and 94 zzso females from birth to 25 years of zzso 

Body mass index zzso 

For each of the surveys, zzso zzso were drawn that at age 18 years passed through the widely used cut off points of 25 and 30 zzso for adult overweight and zzso The resulting zzso were averaged to provide age and sex specific cut off points from zzso zzso 

The proposed cut off points, which are less arbitrary and more internationally based than current alternatives, should help to provide internationally comparable prevalence rates of overweight and obesity in zzso 

This study aimed to develop an internationally acceptable definition of child overweight and zzso specifying the zzso reference population, and age and sex specific cut off zzso Data on body mass index zzso were obtained from 6 large nationally representative cross zzso surveys on growth from Brazil, Great Britain, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, Singapore, and the zzso The study included zzso males and zzso females from birth to 25 years of zzso For each of the surveys, zzso zzso were drawn that at age 18 years passed through the widely used zzso points of 25 and 30 zzso m for adult weight and zzso The resulting zzso were averaged to provide zzso and zzso zzso points from 2 to 18 zzso The proposed cut off points, which are less arbitrary and more internationally based than current alternatives, should help to provide internationally comparable prevalence rates of overweight and obesity in zzso
