zzso a zzso zzso zzso delays the zzso of zzso thus reducing zzso blood zzso level, zzso zzso zzso and insulin resistance in patients with diabetes zzso and in subjects with impaired zzso zzso The effect of zzso in subjects with normal zzso tolerance zzso has zzso not been zzso The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of zzso in obese zzso subjects with zzso 

A zzso parallel group study was performed on 56 male subjects with hypertension, body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso blood zzso zzso zzso zzso and a normal oral zzso tolerance zzso Blood pressure, zzso zzso profile and insulin resistance zzso model assessment zzso zzso were determined initially and following 24 weeks of zzso 150 zzso or zzso The primary end point was the change in insulin zzso zzso treatment and diet were kept constant during the zzso 

zzso resistance decreased in zzso users but not on zzso zzso index declined from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso the corresponding values on zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A decrease in serum zzso values zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso took place on zzso with no change on zzso There was no change in zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso values in either zzso Blood pressure declined equally in both the groups, probably due to better patient zzso 

zzso may reduce insulin resistance and zzso also in obese zzso subjects with normal zzso zzso
