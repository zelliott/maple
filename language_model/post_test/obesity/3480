In zzso cancer, visceral zzso as a risk factor, is associated with a chronic inflammatory process, confirmed by the zzso of serum inflammatory markers in obese zzso The aim of the present study was to evaluate the correlation between visceral fat, assessed by zzso and the systemic levels of zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso This study also evaluated the usefulness of abdominal zzso in assessing the visceral fat correlated with systemic inflammatory status, as an alternative method to identify patients at risk of zzso zzso 

The study was a zzso analysis including two groups of zzso Group I: 44 patients diagnosed with zzso zzso group II: 44 patients with no zzso zzso The diagnosis of zzso cancer was performed following zzso examination that evaluated the tissue material obtained through zzso zzso These patients underwent ultrasound examination by which zzso fat was zzso zzso levels were determined for each zzso The zzso zzso was used for the comparison of the means and the zzso test for rank comparison of two independent zzso 

In patients diagnosed with zzso cancer, the visceral fat area evaluated by ultrasound was significantly larger zzso compared to that of the control zzso The plasma levels of zzso in the zzso cancer group were significantly elevated zzso compared to the control zzso A positive linear correlation was also found between the visceral fat area and plasma levels of zzso 

The plasma levels of zzso are positively zzso correlated with visceral zzso zzso of visceral fat in association with zzso levels may be a zzso factor for zzso zzso
