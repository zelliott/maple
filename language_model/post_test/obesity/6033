zzso risk factors, such as zzso as well as abnormalities in zzso and zzso zzso have been shown to have an increased prevalence in patients with zzso especially in those treated with antipsychotic zzso However, studies looking at these abnormalities in zzso patients have been few in number and have yielded mixed zzso The aim of our study was to look at the prevalence of some of the cardiovascular risk factors, such as obesity and zzso and zzso zzso in zzso patients with zzso psychosis compared to healthy controls matched for age, zzso and zzso 

One hundred sixty patients aged between 18 and 40 years who presented to the Early zzso zzso zzso in Singapore with a diagnosis of zzso psychosis according to the zzso Clinical zzso for zzso Axis I zzso Edition were assessed for their body mass index zzso and plasma levels of zzso zzso and zzso The results of this assessment were compared to similar data from 200 controls matched for age, zzso and ethnicity, collected as part of an annual workplace health zzso The study was conducted from June 2002 to March zzso 

There were significant differences in the mean baseline weight, zzso and plasma levels of total and LDL zzso all of these values were significantly higher in the controls compared to patients zzso zzso for zzso zzso were significantly more likely to have high zzso zzso 23 zzso and high LDL cholesterol level zzso zzso zzso as compared to patients zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso However, patients compared to controls were significantly more likely to have diabetes zzso zzso zzso 

The link between diabetes and psychotic illness previously reported in relatives of patients with schizophrenia and in zzso patients implies a possible genetic link between schizophrenia and abnormal zzso zzso However, the finding of low prevalence of obesity and zzso at the onset of illness suggests that the increased frequency of these abnormalities in patients is an effect of their antipsychotic zzso
