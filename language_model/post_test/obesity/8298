Feeding a Western high-fat diet zzso to zzso mice zzso zzso associated with a chronic inflammatory state, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and organ system effects that particularly prominent in the zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso zzso zzso mice are highly resistant to obesity as well as these other features of zzso syndrome caused by zzso The normal increase in zzso and zzso markers associated with zzso induced obesity in zzso zzso mice was broadly and nearly completely zzso in zzso zzso This is a particularly striking finding because chemical markers of zzso stress including zzso zzso and zzso were significantly higher in zzso zzso Whereas zzso caused marked suppression of zzso in zzso zzso mice, zzso mice had baseline zzso of zzso protein zzso which was not further affected by zzso The baseline zzso function was reduced in zzso mice as compared with zzso but was unaffected by zzso in marked contrast to severe zzso impairment and zzso in the zzso mice given zzso Our findings confirm a fundamental role of zzso in regulating the function of zzso zzso zzso and provide a novel mechanism for targeted therapy of obesity and zzso zzso
