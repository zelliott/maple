To examine the independent associations of zzso measured physical activity zzso zzso fitness zzso and zzso with zzso inflammatory markers in zzso 

zzso study in zzso 

A sample of 192 adolescents aged zzso zzso 

PA was assessed with an zzso for 7 zzso A zzso zzso test was used to assess zzso zzso thicknesses at six sites and zzso were zzso zzso was calculated from measured height and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and complement factors zzso and C4 were zzso The zzso model assessment of insulin resistance zzso was calculated from zzso and zzso zzso analysis adjusted for potential zzso and zzso was used to determine the associations between zzso zzso and zzso with zzso inflammatory zzso 

Total zzso vigorous PA and zzso were positively associated with zzso zzso whereas vigorous PA was zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso was zzso associated with zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and positively associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso PA variables were not independently associated with inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and positively associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso Only body fat explained a relevant amount of the zzso of the model in zzso zzso and C4 zzso whereas zzso and body fat jointly explained the zzso in zzso zzso All these observations were independent of zzso 

These findings support the key role of zzso and zzso on zzso zzso as well as the possible indirect role of habitual PA through zzso and body fat in zzso
