In addition to regulate body growth and development process, growth hormone zzso also involved in zzso zzso decreasing fat mass and improving zzso To normal mice, zzso could reduce their fat content, but events turned uncertain coming to the pattern of feeding zzso In order to investigate the role of zzso in zzso of mice with zzso the zzso feeding mice were randomly assigned into three groups and treated with zzso human growth hormone zzso and the zzso analogue zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that both zzso and zzso could reduce the body weight but the trends diminished in the zzso zzso level was increased in zzso treated groups but the activity of zzso was increased significantly in both two zzso zzso remarkable increased the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso decreased the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in subcutaneous fat zzso In visceral fat zzso all genes were increased except zzso zzso zzso at the same time the visceral fat mass was zzso The protein zzso of zzso and zzso which were treated with zzso were increased in subcutaneous fat, visceral fat and liver zzso zzso and were increased significant in visceral fat by zzso treated zzso zzso In liver, only zzso protein zzso was raised zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso could decrease the whole body mass before 6 zzso the trend was weaken in later period with zzso zzso could increase the subcutaneous fat mass and reduce the visceral fat mass, and zzso might be involved in regulation of the mechanism through zzso signaling zzso
