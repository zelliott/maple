The zzso and zzso extraction of insulin were compared in 14 normal volunteers and 15 obese subjects using a previously validated mathematical model of insulin zzso and rate zzso for zzso derived from analysis of individual zzso zzso after intravenous zzso injections of zzso human zzso zzso zzso rates were substantially higher than normal in the obese subjects after an overnight fast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso P less than zzso mean zzso zzso over a zzso period on a mixed diet zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per 24 zzso P less than zzso and during a zzso intravenous zzso infusion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per 180 zzso P less than zzso Linear zzso analysis revealed a highly significant relationship between insulin zzso and body mass zzso zzso zzso insulin extraction was not significantly different in the normal and obese subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the normal subjects, zzso insulin did not correlate with zzso zzso insulin zzso but a significant negative correlation between zzso insulin and zzso insulin extraction was seen in obesity zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso This finding reflected a higher extraction in the six obese subjects with zzso insulin levels within the range of the normal subjects than in the nine subjects with elevated zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso 45 zzso zzso P less than zzso During the zzso zzso the insulin zzso rate increased to an average maximum of zzso over baseline in the normal subjects and zzso in the obese zzso Over the same time, the peripheral insulin concentration increased zzso over baseline in the zzso and zzso over baseline in the obese, indicating a reduction in the clearance of zzso zzso zzso Although the fall in insulin clearance tended to be greater in the obese subjects, the differences between the two groups were not statistically zzso Thus, under zzso zzso conditions and during zzso of a mixed diet, the zzso of obesity results predominantly from increased insulin zzso In patients with more marked zzso zzso and during intense stimulation of insulin zzso a reduction in insulin clearance may contribute to the greater increase in peripheral insulin zzso that are characteristic of the obese zzso
