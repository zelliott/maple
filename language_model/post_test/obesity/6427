Several studies have shown the association between obesity and zzso The zzso mechanisms of zzso hypertension remain zzso Clinical and experimental studies have shown that obesity is associated with enhanced sympathetic nervous zzso Thus, sympathetic nerve zzso seems to play a major role in zzso zzso However, the factors responsible for this zzso have not been zzso zzso is an zzso hormone that promotes weight loss by reducing appetite and food intake and by increasing energy expenditure through sympathetic stimulation to brown zzso zzso zzso also produces zzso to zzso zzso and adrenal zzso indicating that the zzso increase in sympathetic nerve activity could be due in part to these sympathetic effects of zzso However, obesity is associated with zzso resistance, since high circulating levels of zzso were observed in obese zzso Recent zzso indicate that this zzso resistance could be selective with preservation of sympathetic effects despite the loss of zzso action of zzso This suggests divergent central pathways underlying zzso and sympathetic effects of zzso Several zzso have emerged as potent candidate zzso of zzso action in the central nervous system, including the zzso system, zzso Y, and zzso releasing zzso A detailed understanding of the multitude and complexity of integrated zzso circuits and zzso pathways in zzso action will help in understanding the zzso of obesity and related zzso
