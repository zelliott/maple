We recently showed that zzso zzso may mediate the central zzso zzso zzso Here, to study the role of zzso in zzso hypertension zzso we used a model of zzso produced by a high-fat diet zzso 45 zzso in male zzso zzso After 4 zzso body weight and zzso zzso blood pressure zzso increased in zzso zzso Plasma zzso was correlated with zzso zzso zzso Then, we treated zzso animals with an zzso zzso and small interfering zzso against the zzso zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso content and zzso at 24 and 48 h zzso Similar effects were observed with zzso against zzso but for up to 4 zzso zzso vehicle, an zzso zzso sequence and zzso against green zzso zzso produced no zzso zzso decrease seems to be zzso to an zzso of the zzso sympathetic zzso but not to an zzso in zzso zzso Using a simple zzso model we demonstrated, for the first time, that central zzso zzso in the hypertension induced by body weight gain probably through its well-known action on sympathetic zzso Thus the zzso interaction may contribute to the strong association between hypertension and zzso
