The role of energy expenditure in energy regulation remains a subject of continuing zzso New data have emerged from studies conducted over the last decade demonstrating that energy expenditure is a critical factor contributing to successful energy regulation in normal individuals, as well as to the zzso of energy balance that characterizes zzso zzso energy expenditure appears to facilitate weight gain in individuals susceptible to obesity and also appears to reduce the extent of body energy loss during zzso in both lean and obese zzso The magnitude of the reduction in energy expenditure zzso and perhaps after, weight loss is greater than expected on the basis of the reduction in body weight and appears to occur in response to undefined underlying zzso of energy zzso In addition, exercise intervention studies and zzso investigations of the relationship between energy expenditure for physical activity and body composition demonstrate an apparent zzso between physical activity and body fat zzso This zzso is suggestive of a direct influence of physical activity on the underlying zzso zzso of energy zzso
