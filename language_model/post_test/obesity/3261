Although it is widely accepted that weight gain results when energy intake exceeds energy expenditure zzso how reduced zzso contributes to the development of obesity remains zzso 

We tested the hypothesis that reduced zzso in the zzso period in girls constitutes a risk factor for an increase in relative weight zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso and percentage of body fat zzso during zzso 

We measured zzso at study entry in 196 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rate zzso was measured by indirect zzso Total energy expenditure zzso was measured by the doubly labeled water zzso zzso energy expenditure zzso was calculated from zzso and zzso After the baseline study, girls were followed annually until 4 y after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At each visit, zzso weight, and zzso by zzso zzso were zzso Girls also completed annual zzso and activity zzso Linear mixed effects modeling was used to evaluate the zzso relation between zzso zzso score and zzso and measures of baseline zzso 

We found no significant relation in change in zzso with zzso zzso or zzso We observed a small positive relation between zzso zzso score and zzso and zzso zzso zzso but no significant relation with zzso When we zzso by parental overweight, the findings were unchanged for zzso zzso and zzso were positively related to zzso zzso score in girls of overweight zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso in the zzso period is not a risk factor for increases in zzso or zzso zzso score in girls during zzso
