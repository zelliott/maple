To examine early zzso abnormalities in obesity prior to the development of zzso zzso we studied 14 lean and 37 obese subjects with normal zzso zzso All subjects underwent a standard 75 g oral zzso tolerance test zzso with the addition of zzso zzso As expected, there was a positive relationship between zzso insulin and body mass index zzso zzso P less than zzso In addition, even though the subjects had normal zzso zzso both zzso zzso and sum of zzso during zzso showed significant positive associations with zzso zzso zzso correlated significantly and positively with obesity zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso When incremental areas during zzso were zzso zzso area during zzso was positively associated with zzso and insulin area was positively associated with both zzso and sum of zzso zzso the incremental area of zzso decreased as zzso increased zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso despite the increasing zzso zzso The results indicate that even prior to frank zzso zzso progressive changes in zzso levels of zzso insulin, and zzso as well as sum of zzso accompany the expansion of zzso mass in zzso Two different aspects of zzso metabolism have been examined in zzso First, the association of increased zzso zzso levels with increased obesity may reflect increased zzso production from enlarged zzso and an increased fat zzso zzso the inverse association between acute zzso generation following zzso zzso and zzso despite the increased sum of zzso in obese subjects, may reflect a decreased ability of zzso and/or zzso zzso to convert zzso to zzso due to insulin zzso
