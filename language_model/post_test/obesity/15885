The biological role of zzso zzso into zzso tissue in obesity remains to be fully zzso We zzso that zzso may act to stimulate zzso in the zzso zzso This possibility was examined by determining zzso expression of zzso factor zzso zzso growth zzso and regulation of tube formation of zzso cells by zzso The data suggest that zzso cell density was reduced in the zzso tissue of zzso zzso zzso of zzso marker zzso was decreased in protein and zzso The reduction was associated with an increase in zzso zzso In the obese mice, zzso concentration was elevated in the zzso and its zzso expression was increased in zzso zzso zzso were found to be a major source of zzso in zzso zzso as deletion of zzso led to a significant reduction in zzso zzso In cell culture, zzso expression was induced by zzso and tube formation of zzso cells was induced by zzso The zzso activity was dependent on zzso as zzso of zzso in zzso cells led to zzso of the zzso zzso We conclude that, in response to the reduced vascular density, zzso may express zzso in zzso tissue to facilitate zzso formation in zzso Although the zzso level is elevated in zzso zzso its activity in zzso is dependent on the availability of sufficient zzso zzso The study suggests a new function of zzso in the zzso tissue in zzso
