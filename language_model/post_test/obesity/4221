zzso and type 2 diabetes zzso are characterized by insulin resistance, reduced zzso of the zzso signaling zzso zzso oxide zzso and accelerated zzso zzso the principal zzso zzso which shares many of the effects of insulin, may, like insulin, also be involved in zzso and vascular zzso We examined the effects of zzso on NO zzso and the effect of zzso 2 diabetes zzso on zzso actions at a zzso level and in the zzso In zzso rings zzso blunted zzso zzso and relaxed rings zzso with zzso an effect blocked by zzso zzso zzso increased NO zzso activity to an extent similar to that seen with insulin and zzso zzso led to zzso zzso of zzso NO zzso zzso Mice rendered obese using a high-fat diet were less sensitive to the zzso effects of insulin and zzso zzso increased zzso zzso levels in lean mice, an effect that was blunted in obese zzso zzso activity in zzso of lean mice increased zzso in response to zzso compared with obese zzso zzso zzso was blunted in obese zzso These data demonstrate that zzso increases zzso zzso zzso increases zzso activity, and leads to zzso relaxation of zzso zzso zzso is associated with resistance to zzso at a zzso level and in the zzso zzso zzso resistance may represent a novel therapeutic target to prevent or slow the accelerated zzso seen in humans with obesity or type 2 diabetes zzso
