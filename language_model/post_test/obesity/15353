We have recently shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso dependent zzso zzso factor in the zzso In the present study we confirm and extend our previous observations by showing that zzso zzso administered zzso zzso zzso zzso food intake in food restricted rats with a lowest effective dose of zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso food intake in zzso rats as well as nighttime food intake in free feeding zzso To identify brain areas potentially involved in zzso the zzso effects of zzso the zzso expression pattern of the immediate early gene zzso was examined in the central nervous system by zzso in rats receiving zzso zzso Compared to vehicle, zzso induced zzso expression in several zzso and zzso structures implicated in the central control of food zzso In the zzso high numbers of zzso zzso zzso cells were observed in the zzso zzso part of the zzso nucleus and in the zzso part of the zzso zzso Lower numbers of zzso positive zzso were found in the zzso and zzso zzso A relatively high number of zzso cells was found in the central nucleus of the zzso In the zzso zzso zzso were found in the zzso nucleus, and in the nucleus of the solitary zzso zzso both the area zzso and the zzso motor nucleus of the zzso were virtually devoid of zzso zzso The present experiments suggest that zzso zzso exerts its zzso effects on appetite by zzso zzso and zzso zzso implicated in the central control of feeding zzso and zzso
