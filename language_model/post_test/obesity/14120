We examined the relationship between the expression of zzso zzso an zzso factor and regulator of transforming growth zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso and insulin zzso 

zzso gene expression was zzso in subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso of 86 zzso subjects covering a wide range of zzso and insulin sensitivity, from visceral zzso zzso and SAT from 14 surgical patients and from 38 subjects with impaired zzso tolerance zzso to receive either zzso or zzso for 10 zzso An zzso culture system was also used to assess the effects of zzso and zzso with zzso on zzso gene zzso 

zzso zzso was significantly associated with obesity zzso and insulin resistance zzso insulin sensitivity zzso Relatively strong positive associations were seen with markers of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso for each), that remained significant after controlling for zzso and zzso However, zzso zzso was zzso expressed in zzso zzso whereas inflammatory markers predominated in zzso vascular zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene expression and zzso from both cell zzso zzso (not zzso treatment resulted in a zzso decrease zzso zzso in zzso zzso gene zzso as did in zzso zzso treatment of zzso 

zzso is a true zzso that is highly expressed in obese, zzso zzso is highly correlated with zzso zzso and is decreased by zzso zzso is an important link between zzso and zzso zzso tissue inflammation and may mediate the zzso of zzso that promotes a zzso zzso
