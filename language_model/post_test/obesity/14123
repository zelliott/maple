We examined the associations of zzso measured sedentary time and physical activity with continuous indexes of zzso risk in Australian adults without known zzso 

An zzso was used to derive the percentage of monitoring time spent sedentary and in zzso and zzso activity, as well as mean activity intensity, in 169 Australian zzso zzso and zzso Study zzso participants zzso age zzso zzso zzso with waist zzso zzso HDL cholesterol, resting blood pressure, zzso plasma zzso and a clustered zzso risk score were zzso 

Independent of time spent in zzso activity, there were significant associations of sedentary time, zzso time, and mean activity intensity with waist circumference and clustered zzso zzso Independent of waist zzso zzso activity time was significantly zzso associated with zzso 

These findings highlight the importance of decreasing sedentary time, as well as increasing time spent in physical activity, for zzso zzso
