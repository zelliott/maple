To test the hypothesis that obesity is an independent risk factor for zzso hospital admission or zzso among patients scheduled for ambulatory surgery in a zzso medical zzso 

zzso databases were used to identify 235 obese patients zzso mass index zzso scheduled for ambulatory surgery from January 2, 2002, through December 31, 2003, at Mayo zzso site in Rochester, zzso Each patient was matched to a zzso control zzso zzso by age, sex, surgical zzso type of zzso and date of surgery, and the medical records of all patients were zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed to assess whether obesity is an independent risk factor for zzso zzso hospital zzso In all cases, zzso tests were zzso zzso was considered statistically zzso 

zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were matched with control patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was more frequent in the obese zzso The frequency of zzso hospital admission did not differ between groups: 61 obese patients zzso and 52 control patients zzso were admitted zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is not a significant independent risk factor for zzso admission after ambulatory surgery, suggesting that obesity per zzso should not prevent ambulatory surgery from being zzso
