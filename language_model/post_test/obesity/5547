The zzso is a candidate gene for obesity because of its role in zzso energy zzso A common zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown in zzso cells to influence zzso zzso 

To investigate the effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso in native human fat cells obtained by subcutaneous zzso 

zzso and zzso apparently healthy male and female subjects with a wide variation in body mass index zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso sensitivities and maximum zzso action of zzso and the selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were determined in isolated subcutaneous zzso and related to zzso zzso binding zzso 

No differences in the sensitivity or maximum zzso capacity of the zzso were found between the zzso This was true both when all subjects were analyzed together and when zzso zzso obese, men, zzso were analyzed zzso zzso binding to zzso or zzso was also similar between zzso The zzso had no important influence on either zzso or the distribution of obese and non-obese subjects between the zzso 

The distribution of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is similar in lean and obese subjects and has no apparent effect on the zzso response to zzso stimulation in native human zzso This suggests, despite the altered zzso properties reported in zzso cells, that the zzso zzso zzso zzso has no important influence on human zzso
