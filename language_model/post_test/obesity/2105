To search for genetic and environmental zzso of zzso we compared the zzso and the impact of obesity in three populations from two zzso Mexican Americans zzso zzso zzso and zzso whites zzso zzso zzso from San Antonio, Texas, and zzso from Mexico City zzso zzso zzso In the age range zzso zzso years, only Mexican men and women showed a significant increase in the prevalence of obesity with zzso On the other hand, genetic zzso especially in women, made significant differences in the rates of zzso Mexican Americans showed relatively high, and zzso whites low, rates of zzso To discriminate between genetic and environmental influences zzso the impact of obesity on a set of zzso and zzso zzso we compared this impact between Mexican Americans and both zzso whites zzso zzso different gene zzso and zzso zzso gene pool, different zzso We found that obesity always worsens the zzso and zzso profiles of individuals, but the magnitude of the effects may be zzso We showed that the levels of insulin zzso for a given level of obesity were similar in zzso and Mexican Americans, suggesting that genetic influences predominate in determining insulin zzso the levels of zzso and HDL for a given level of obesity were similar in Mexican Americans and zzso zzso suggesting zzso environmental influences on zzso zzso On the other hand, the levels of zzso and zzso blood pressure for a given level of obesity were usually different between Mexican Americans and either of the other two zzso suggesting that these levels may result from zzso zzso
