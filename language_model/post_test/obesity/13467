High dietary fat intake and obesity may increase the risk of zzso to certain forms of zzso To study the interactions of dietary fat, zzso and zzso zzso cancer, we created a population of zzso mice zzso obesity zzso and the zzso zzso We fed the zzso mice either a very high-fat or a zzso diet, and we measured growth, body zzso age at zzso tumor zzso tumor number and severity, and formation of pulmonary zzso zzso zzso across the zzso facilitated analyses of zzso and zzso zzso diet interaction zzso Here we describe effects of diet on zzso tumor and zzso zzso mapping of zzso modifier zzso and the interaction between dietary fat levels and effects of cancer zzso zzso demonstrate that animals fed a high-fat diet are not only more likely to experience decreased zzso cancer zzso but increased tumor growth and pulmonary zzso occurrence over an equivalent zzso We identified 25 modifier zzso for zzso cancer and pulmonary zzso likely representing 13 unique zzso after accounting for zzso and novel zzso zzso diet interactions at a majority of these zzso These findings highlight the importance of accurately modeling not only the human cancer characteristics in mice but also the environmental zzso of human zzso
