zzso pancreatic injury is a serious liability in zzso toxicity zzso However, its relevance to humans should be cautiously evaluated because of zzso zzso To highlight such variations, we evaluated the zzso and zzso pancreatic responses and progression caused by zzso a novel zzso 1 zzso zzso investigated by GlaxoSmithKline for the treatment of zzso Acute (up to 2,000 zzso zzso as single zzso and zzso studies in mice and/or rats zzso zzso for 7 days to 26 weeks) showed wide-ranging zzso changes in the zzso that were dose and duration dependent, including zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso focal zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to zzso pancreatic changes were not observed in zzso monkeys given zzso zzso zzso with higher systemic exposure than zzso for up to 52 zzso Similarly, no zzso zzso abnormalities in pancreatic structure were noted in a zzso clinical trial with obese patients zzso mass zzso zzso zzso as assessed by abdominal ultrasound or by magnetic resonance zzso zzso for zzso variations in the pancreatic response to zzso among zzso zzso and humans and their relevance to human risk are zzso
