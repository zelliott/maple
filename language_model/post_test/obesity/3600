zzso and diabetes are potentially zzso risk factors for pancreatic zzso zzso factors that modify the associations of obesity and diabetes with pancreatic cancer have previously not been examined at the zzso zzso 

Using zzso association studies zzso zzso and risk factor data from the zzso Cancer Case Control zzso we conducted a discovery study of zzso cases and zzso controls to examine zzso and zzso interactions in relation to pancreatic cancer risk by using the zzso test zzso in zzso zzso models and zzso zzso Analysis zzso 

After adjusting for multiple zzso a significant interaction of the zzso signaling zzso with obesity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a near significant interaction of calcium signaling zzso with diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso the risk of pancreatic cancer were zzso These findings were supported by results from zzso analysis of the top genes with nominal zzso The major contributing genes to the two top pathways include zzso zzso zzso and zzso None of the individual genes or zzso zzso zzso except one zzso remained significant after adjusting for multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene showed an interaction with diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at a false discovery rate of zzso 

zzso variations in inflammatory response and insulin resistance may affect the risk of zzso and zzso pancreatic zzso These observations should be zzso in additional large zzso 

A zzso interaction analysis may provide new insights into the genetic zzso and molecular mechanisms of zzso and zzso pancreatic zzso
