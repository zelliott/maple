To determine the differential zzso zzso of zzso by exercising muscle and in the fatigued state in lean and obese zzso 

The rats were zzso until zzso when their oxygen consumption increased by zzso zzso zzso Blood and hind leg tissue zzso and zzso were sampled at intervals during exercise and zzso 

zzso and obese adult zzso female zzso 

Three series of rats were used to determine zzso zzso zzso and oxygen zzso balances, blood flow and muscle levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and skin zzso The rates of zzso unit flow during exercise and recovery were then zzso 

In obese rats, exercising muscle showed higher zzso zzso increased zzso zzso and lower zzso production than in the zzso In the obese zzso muscle, there were more zzso units available for zzso zzso Excess zzso (or zzso units were used probably for zzso zzso zzso rats managed their zzso units more zzso stretching the available zzso thus zzso the zzso During recovery, obese rats zzso zzso zzso and lowered zzso zzso which left only a few zzso units to zzso zzso probably the rest of zzso energy was derived from zzso 

In lean rats zzso is the main source of muscle energy during exercise and recovery, whereas obese rats use zzso during exercise, and probably zzso zzso during zzso zzso rats rely more on lipids for energy during zzso
