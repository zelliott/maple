A combined analysis of zzso scans for obesity was undertaken using the interim results from the National Heart, zzso and Blood Institute Family Blood zzso zzso In this research project, four zzso networks of investigators conducted eight individual zzso Data were available on zzso individuals from four ethnic groups zzso black, Mexican American, and zzso The sample represents the largest single collection of zzso scan data that has been analyzed for obesity and provides a test of the zzso of linkage analysis for a complex zzso Body mass index zzso was used as the measure of zzso zzso linkage analyses were first performed separately in each of the eight ethnic groups in the four networks, through use of the zzso zzso Only one region in the analyses of the individual studies showed significant linkage with zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso network black zzso Six additional regions were found with an associated zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Among these findings, the linkage at zzso zzso and zzso has been reported zzso A modified zzso omnibus procedure was then used to combine the P values from each of the eight zzso zzso A complimentary approach to the zzso was zzso combining the average zzso identity by descent zzso for zzso blacks, and Mexican zzso Using this approach, we found strong linkage evidence for a zzso locus at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The same location has been shown to be linked with zzso traits and diabetes in at least two other zzso These results zzso confirm the previously reported zzso locus on zzso 3, 7, and 17 and zzso demonstrate that combining samples from different studies can increase the power to detect common genes with a zzso effect, so long as the same gene has an effect in all samples zzso
