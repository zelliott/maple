To define the roles of mechanical zzso respiratory zzso control, and sleep zzso in the zzso of obesity zzso respiratory muscle drive and zzso assessed by zzso zzso zzso and mouth zzso pressure zzso zzso respectively, were determined during CO2 zzso in zzso volunteers who were subjected to abdominal mass zzso and in three groups of markedly obese zzso zzso obese without sleep zzso zzso zzso obese with sleep zzso zzso and zzso obese with sleep zzso zzso The zzso responses were decreased in zzso and OH, but the zzso responses were not significantly different from those in control zzso In O patients zzso responses were significantly greater than those in control subjects as well as those in zzso and OH zzso zzso and zzso responses increased in all zzso subjects when they were subjected to mass zzso We conclude that both zzso and OH patients were equally unable to develop the expected increase in respiratory muscle drive and zzso The presence of sleep zzso possibly by causing nocturnal zzso and/or sleep zzso may result in impaired mass load compensation and zzso obese patients to develop zzso
