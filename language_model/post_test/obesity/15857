The aim of this study was to analyze zzso zzso zzso levels in abdominal subcutaneous zzso tissue in two zzso and type 2 zzso share common inflammatory and zzso features, and to assess their relationship with selected inflammatory and zzso zzso 

This is a zzso study involving 52 zzso and 54 type 2 diabetes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and inflammatory zzso were performed, and zzso expression was determined using real-time zzso 

zzso A and C zzso are expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were increased in obese and in type 2 diabetes zzso We also observed a strong relationship between both zzso (B zzso zzso P zzso and among zzso C zzso expression and zzso zzso element binding zzso zzso and inflammatory zzso zzso markers (B zzso zzso P zzso zzso and B zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

These data suggest that zzso zzso may be involved in the zzso gene profile observed in obesity and type 2 zzso
