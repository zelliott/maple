One of the most robust observations in the biology of aging is that caloric restriction zzso extends life in a variety of zzso Although zzso results in a zzso decrease in fat mass zzso the role of fat on life extension was considered to be zzso Two main reasons accounted for this zzso First, although increased zzso is associated with changes in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso in part through the effects of free fatty acids zzso and zzso several studies have suggested that longevity is determined independent of zzso Second, zzso has systemic effects on a range of functions including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso none of which have been historically linked to zzso In the last few years, an explosion of evidence has demonstrated that fat tissue is a very active zzso zzso which zzso a variety of peptides (such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso (such as tumor necrosis zzso and complement factors (such as D, zzso and zzso This is in addition to the presence of zzso such as zzso and zzso which are stored and released by fat cells and are known to have a major role in zzso and peripheral zzso zzso We propose that many of the systemic effects of zzso can now be explained by the chronic effects related to decreased plasma levels of zzso zzso complement factors, and zzso In fact, all of the benefits of zzso on the neuroendocrine system and those related to the improvement in zzso zzso can be attributed to decrease in zzso cells and their zzso Other evidence from zzso data in human obesity supports the role of fat mass and its body distribution as a risk factor for morbidity and mortality in humans due to impaired zzso metabolism zzso to zzso for cancer zzso to zzso and for the development of zzso vascular disease (in zzso If all or most of the zzso benefits of zzso can be attributed to decreased fat stores, the expression of specific candidate proteins may be explored and manipulated in the search for the most powerful zzso signals that zzso life zzso
