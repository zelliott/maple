zzso and obesity likely cause zzso zzso zzso and zzso heart disease zzso however, whether zzso zzso syndrome is a necessary condition is zzso 

To test the hypothesis that overweight and obesity with and without zzso syndrome are associated with increased risk of zzso and zzso 

We examined zzso individuals from the Copenhagen General zzso Study and zzso them according to body mass index zzso as normal weight, overweight, or obese and according to absence or presence of zzso zzso 

zzso ratios for incident zzso and zzso according to combinations of zzso category and absence or presence of zzso zzso 

During a median of zzso years' zzso we recorded zzso incident zzso and zzso incident zzso zzso For zzso multivariable adjusted hazard ratios vs normal weight individuals without zzso syndrome were zzso zzso zzso zzso in overweight and zzso zzso zzso zzso in obese individuals without zzso syndrome and zzso zzso zzso zzso in normal weight, zzso zzso zzso zzso in overweight, and zzso zzso zzso zzso in obese individuals with zzso zzso For zzso results were similar but zzso zzso weight vs overweight vs obesity and presence vs absence of zzso syndrome did not interact on risk of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso Among individuals both with and without zzso syndrome there were increasing cumulative zzso of zzso and zzso from normal weight through overweight to obese individuals zzso trend P zzso zzso to P zzso Although the multivariable adjusted hazard ratio for zzso in individuals with vs without zzso syndrome was zzso zzso zzso zzso across all zzso categories, addition of zzso syndrome to a multivariable model including zzso and other clinical characteristics improved the zzso zzso only slightly for risk of zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not for zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that overweight and obesity are risk factors for zzso and zzso regardless of the presence or absence of zzso syndrome and that zzso syndrome is no more valuable than zzso in identifying individuals at zzso
