Although the majority of evidence in zzso does not support the view that weight cycling zzso of bouts of food restriction and zzso promotes zzso the effects of weight cycling on body weight regulation remain zzso We have previously demonstrated that some rats within a strain are more susceptible to develop obesity than others when given free access to a high-fat zzso In this study, we tested the hypothesis that rats most susceptible to weight gain on a high-fat diet would also be most susceptible to weight gain as a consequence of weight zzso 

zzso were provided a low-fat diet zzso corn zzso for 2 weeks, then given a high-fat diet zzso corn zzso for 2 weeks to identify those most zzso zzso and least zzso zzso susceptible to weight zzso Half of each group was then subjected to three 30-day cycles of food restriction (10 zzso and zzso (20 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The other half were allowed free access to the high-fat diet zzso zzso zzso All rats were then followed for an additional 10 weeks, with free access to the high-fat zzso 

When considering the entire 160 days of the study, we found no evidence that zzso rats relative to CO rats had increased body weight, increased body fat content, or elevated energy zzso We found no evidence that rats most prone to dietary obesity were also prone to weight gain after weight zzso During the weight cycling phase zzso 1 to zzso weight zzso groups consumed less energy and gained less weight than zzso During the follow-up phase, zzso and CO rats did not differ significantly in weight gain or energy zzso 

In this study, weight cycling did not exacerbate the obesity produced by high-fat diet zzso
