To determine the prevalence of diabetes and impaired zzso tolerance zzso and to investigate their associated cardiovascular risk factors in zzso zzso 

We performed a zzso zzso study with zzso and zzso sampling of residents aged zzso zzso A sample of zzso subjects (427 men and 508 zzso was zzso All except those with a previous history of diabetes underwent an oral zzso tolerance test zzso and World Health Organization zzso criteria were used for diagnosis of zzso diabetes and zzso Plasma zzso levels, blood pressure, zzso and zzso ratio were also zzso 

The prevalence of diagnosed and zzso diabetes and zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the age range of zzso years, the zzso prevalence of diabetes zzso the world population of zzso was zzso in men and zzso in zzso Both diabetes and zzso were associated with high blood pressure, high zzso levels, low HDL cholesterol levels, and overweight and zzso fat zzso Only zzso fat distribution in women was significantly higher in subjects with diabetes than in subjects with zzso 

The prevalence of diabetes in zzso was moderately high zzso and comparable with that reported in other white populations around the zzso The proportion of unknown cases of diabetes was nearly zzso zzso risk factors associated with diabetes and zzso supported the existence of an insulin resistance or zzso syndrome, but there were not sufficient differences between diabetes and zzso to suggest a possible zzso relation of zzso and associated risk zzso
