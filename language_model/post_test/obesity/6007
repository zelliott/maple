South Asians are susceptible to cardiovascular disease zzso especially after migration to affluent zzso zzso factors include high prevalence of diabetes, and possibly insulin zzso Excess zzso centrally may zzso such zzso zzso The thrifty zzso thrifty zzso zzso tissue compartment and variable disease selection hypotheses are among the explanations zzso 

Data from individual studies and review articles known to the authors were zzso A zzso zzso database search was also zzso zzso lists were reviewed to identify additional relevant data zzso Key references were examined by both zzso 

We zzso and zzso the evidence for a zzso efficiency zzso zzso that ancestral changes in zzso zzso efficiency enhanced the successful adaptation of South Asians to environmental zzso by maximizing the conversion of energy to zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso This adaptation may be zzso when South Asians are physically inactive and consume zzso zzso There is evidence that common zzso zzso vary zzso zzso including those affecting the function of zzso zzso proteins zzso may influence the balance of energy and heat zzso These may influence zzso zzso rate zzso energy efficiency, the tendency to gain weight and hence zzso zzso zzso gene zzso are related to differences in zzso between African-Americans and zzso Similar data for South Asians are lacking but the few studies comparing zzso indicate that South Asians have a lower zzso which is explained by a lower lean body mass, and higher fat zzso Once adjusted for body zzso zzso is zzso A high fat mass, per se, is a strategy for reducing energy use while zzso body zzso Indians in the USA had higher zzso zzso capacity than Northern European zzso 

The evidence justifies full exploration of this zzso efficiency hypothesis in South zzso which may also be relevant to other zzso adapted zzso
