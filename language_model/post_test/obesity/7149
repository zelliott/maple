zzso experiments with different mouse strains have successfully been used by many groups to identify genetic zzso that zzso for zzso In order to provide a statistical assessment of these quantitative trait zzso zzso as a basis for a systematic investigation of candidate zzso we have performed a zzso of zzso linkage scans for body weight and body zzso 

From a total of 34 published mouse zzso experiments, we compiled a list of 162 zzso zzso for body weight and 117 zzso for fat weight and body fat zzso zzso these studies include data from 42 different parental mouse strains zzso individual zzso 

The results of the studies were analyzed using the truncated product method zzso 

The analysis revealed significant evidence zzso of odds zzso zzso for linkage of body weight and zzso to 49 different segments of the mouse zzso The most prominent regions with linkage for body weight and body fat zzso scores zzso on zzso 1, 2, 7, 11, 15, and 17 contain a total of 58 zzso for body weight and body zzso At least 34 candidate genes and genetic zzso which have been implicated in regulation of body weight and body composition in zzso and/or humans, are found in these regions, including zzso protein alpha zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso factor 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso delta zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso Our results demonstrate the presence of numerous distinct consensus zzso regions with highly significant zzso scores that control body weight and body zzso An interactive physical map of the zzso is available online at zzso
