Using the Princeton School Family Study zzso our specific aim was to determine whether, and to what degree, zzso and sibling associations for measures of body zzso outlast the period of shared common household environment in a single well characterized zzso zzso associations of measures in body zzso were assessed in two and three generation zzso in parents and their pediatric offspring (less than zzso parents and their adult offspring (less than or equal to zzso and in pediatric and adult zzso The cohort included 177 randomly recalled zzso and 202 zzso from a zzso recall group zzso zzso plasma cholesterol and/or zzso In randomly recalled zzso significant associations of body mass zzso in parents and pediatric offspring and in pediatric siblings, and the absence of significant correlations in parents and adult offspring and in adult siblings, emphasize the potency of common household environmental effects relative to zzso similarities for shared body zzso In whites from the zzso recall group, only the zzso and adult offspring correlations for body mass zzso were zzso We speculate that mothers and their offspring from zzso selected by zzso zzso are more likely than fathers and their offspring to share eating habits and relative zzso with these communal behaviors zzso the period of common household zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso recall group, zzso for zzso may be shared more by mothers and their offspring than by fathers and their zzso Particularly in the random recall group, zzso associations of body mass zzso primarily reflect shared common household zzso and probably zzso the outcome of genes held in zzso
