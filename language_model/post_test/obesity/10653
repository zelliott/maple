In the human gastrointestinal zzso dietary zzso including zzso that reach the colon are fermented principally to zzso fatty zzso hydrogen, and carbon zzso zzso disposal of the hydrogen generated during zzso zzso in the human colon is critical to optimal functioning of this zzso However, our understanding of microbial zzso is fragmented and, at least as it occurs in the zzso is mostly theoretical in zzso zzso investigation and integration of knowledge on the diversity of zzso zzso their zzso variation and activities as a functional group, as well as the nature of their interactions with zzso bacteria, are necessary to understand hydrogen metabolism in the human zzso Here, we review the limited data available on the three major groups of zzso zzso found in the human colon zzso zzso bacteria zzso and zzso as well as evidence that end products of their metabolism have an important impact on zzso zzso
