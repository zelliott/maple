We have previously shown an association between a zzso zzso in the muscle zzso zzso gene zzso and both Type II zzso diabetes zzso and zzso Association studies are, however, hampered by the selection of the control zzso To circumvent these problems we addressed the same question using a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We identified 122 zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso among a new set of 743 Finnish subjects from 227 families with Type II diabetes and paired analyses were done by zzso test of symmetry and by zzso zzso 

zzso analysis showed that siblings with the zzso zzso had more hypertension zzso zzso zzso obesity zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but not significantly more Type II diabetes zzso zzso zzso than siblings with the A1 zzso zzso with the zzso zzso were more often treated by insulin zzso zzso zzso or zzso medication zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso carriers had higher zzso zzso zzso zzso and lower HDL cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso and an earlier age at onset of diabetes zzso zzso zzso than diabetic siblings with the A1 zzso In zzso zzso the presence of the zzso zzso was associated with higher zzso zzso zzso zzso blood zzso Finally, the zzso frequency of the zzso zzso differed between 216 randomly chosen unrelated Type II diabetic patients and 115 unrelated healthy control spouses without a family history of Type II diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso an increased zzso to different features of the zzso syndrome and Type II zzso
