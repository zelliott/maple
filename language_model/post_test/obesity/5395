The measurement of fat balance zzso input minus fat zzso involves the accurate zzso of both zzso fat intake and total fat zzso This is possible mostly under laboratory conditions and not yet in zzso zzso In the latter situation, net fat zzso can be estimated based on precise and accurate sequential body composition zzso In case of positive balance, lipids stored in zzso tissue can originate from dietary zzso lipids or from zzso zzso mainly from carbohydrates zzso but also from ethanol, through a process known as de zzso zzso zzso Basic equations are provided in this review to facilitate the interpretation of the different zzso of fat balance zzso vs zzso under different nutritional zzso One difficulty is zzso total zzso is difficult to measure zzso in zzso for example, indirect zzso only tracks net zzso not total zzso Although the numerous factors zzso zzso influencing zzso have been zzso in particular the effect of zzso zzso there is little information on the rate of zzso in habitual conditions of life, that is, large day-to-day fluctuations of zzso zzso different types of zzso zzso with different zzso indexes, alcohol combined with excess zzso zzso zzso Three issues, which are still controversial today, will be zzso zzso Is the increase of fat mass induced by zzso zzso explained by zzso only, or by decreased zzso fat zzso or zzso zzso Is zzso different in overweight and obese individuals as compared to their lean zzso zzso Does zzso occur both in the liver and in zzso zzso Recent studies have demonstrated that acute zzso zzso influences zzso tissue zzso gene expression and that zzso may stimulate zzso in skeletal muscles, at least in zzso The role of zzso and its importance in health and disease remain to be further zzso in particular the putative effect of zzso on the control of energy intake and energy zzso as well as the occurrence of zzso in other zzso (such as in zzso in addition to zzso and zzso
