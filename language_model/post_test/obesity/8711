The zzso for zzso the gene product of the obese zzso is expressed in zzso stem zzso zzso stimulates normal zzso and zzso development, and is zzso from bone zzso zzso which occupy most of the zzso cavity in zzso zzso might thus play an important role in the control of the expansion and differentiation of primitive zzso cells through zzso interaction in the bone zzso zzso zzso cells of some patients with acute zzso zzso acute zzso zzso and chronic zzso leukemia zzso also express the zzso zzso In cases of zzso higher expression of zzso zzso is observed during blast crisis than in chronic zzso zzso alone and in combination with other zzso has zzso effects on proliferation of leukemia cells as well as zzso zzso These findings suggest the possibility that zzso plays roles in the zzso of zzso
