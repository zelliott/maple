Although obesity and zzso syndrome have been associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes zzso zzso it is unclear whether obese or overweight people without zzso syndrome are at increased risk for zzso 

Clinical and laboratory data were assessed in zzso subjects without diabetes zzso men, zzso zzso age zzso zzso who underwent voluntary medical zzso at a zzso zzso The subjects were zzso by body mass index zzso and zzso syndrome status at zzso and the zzso of diabetes over 5 years was zzso 

Of the zzso subjects, 308 zzso developed zzso over 5 zzso Compared with normal weight zzso zzso individuals without zzso syndrome, the adjusted odds ratios zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso for overweight zzso zzso and obese zzso zzso individuals without zzso syndrome, respectively, and zzso zzso and zzso zzso for overweight and obese individuals with zzso syndrome, zzso Using the lower zzso zzso points for Asian zzso compared with subjects with zzso zzso without zzso syndrome, the adjusted zzso for subjects with zzso zzso and zzso zzso without zzso syndrome were zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, for those with zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso syndrome both are significant risk factors for development of zzso in Koreans, and overweight or obesity without zzso syndrome should not be considered a harmless zzso The lower zzso zzso for Asian populations can be useful in predicting risk of zzso in zzso
