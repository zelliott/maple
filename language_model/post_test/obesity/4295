We examined fatty acid zzso zzso and metabolism in hearts and red and white muscles of lean and zzso zzso 6) and type 2 diabetic zzso 24) zzso diabetic fatty zzso zzso zzso fatty acid transport was similar in lean and zzso hearts at week 6 but was reduced at week 24 zzso in lean but not zzso zzso Red muscle of zzso rats exhibited an early zzso to zzso zzso of fatty acid transport at week 6 that was increased by 50% in lean and zzso rats at week 24 but remained zzso greater in red muscle of zzso zzso In white muscle, no differences were observed in fatty acid transport between groups or from week 6 to week zzso In all zzso zzso and red and white zzso zzso protein and zzso content paralleled the changes in fatty acid zzso zzso content in red and white muscles, but not heart, in lean and zzso rats correlated with fatty acid transport zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Red and white muscle fatty acid zzso by isolated zzso was not impaired in zzso rats but was reduced by zzso in red muscle of lean rats at week zzso Thus, in red, but not white, muscle of zzso and type 2 diabetic animals, a marked zzso in fatty acid transport and intramuscular zzso was associated with increased levels of zzso expression and zzso zzso In heart, greater rates of fatty acid transport and zzso in zzso rats zzso 24) were attributable to the zzso of age-related reductions in these zzso However, intramuscular zzso did not accumulate in hearts of zzso zzso Thus insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes are accompanied by zzso differences in zzso and fatty acid transport and zzso zzso of fatty acid transport increased red muscle, but not zzso zzso zzso White muscle zzso metabolism zzso was not zzso
