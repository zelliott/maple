zzso is a newly discovered zzso found in abundance in visceral zzso It lowers plasma zzso in humans and zzso In this study, we explored the relationships between the plasma level of zzso and genetic single zzso zzso zzso and Type 2 diabetes zzso zzso and zzso and zzso parameters in Chinese zzso 

zzso zzso tolerance tests zzso and zzso zzso for plasma insulin, zzso profiles and serum zzso were performed in zzso newly diagnosed zzso patients, subjects with impaired zzso regulation zzso and normal zzso tolerant subjects more than 40 years of zzso zzso for three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were performed using the zzso real-time zzso zzso 

zzso levels were similar in zzso patients, zzso and normal zzso tolerant zzso However, zzso levels were significantly lower in obese than zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was suggestively significant correlation between zzso level and body mass index zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in male subjects, but not in female zzso zzso and common zzso zzso of the three zzso zzso were similar in zzso patients, zzso and normal zzso tolerant zzso However, significant associations were found between these three zzso zzso and plasma zzso concentration at 0 and 120 zzso during zzso the area under the response curve for plasma zzso and zzso and total cholesterol zzso 

zzso zzso levels may be related to visceral obesity in men, and the zzso gene may account for variation of zzso and zzso parameters in Chinese zzso
