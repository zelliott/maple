The past decade has seen great progress in the understanding of the molecular zzso zzso function and therapeutic potential of zzso receptors zzso Free fatty acids zzso have been demonstrated to act as zzso of several zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We have recently shown that zzso acts as a zzso zzso of zzso fatty acids in zzso and zzso which mediate potent zzso and insulin zzso zzso The important role zzso plays in the control of inflammation raises the possibility that targeting this zzso could have therapeutic potential in many inflammatory diseases including obesity and type 2 zzso In this review paper, we discuss zzso zzso and highlight potential outcomes of targeting such receptors in zzso zzso
