zzso diabetes, and prior abdominal surgery are generally considered to increase the risk of liver zzso The aim of the present study was to define the effects of these factors on the immediate outcome after zzso Two hundred zzso consecutive liver transplants were zzso zzso patients were zzso In the remaining 193 patients zzso age zzso 52 zzso 19 years, body mass index zzso zzso zzso Model for zzso Liver Disease zzso score at listing zzso zzso the risk from obesity was graded as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 30, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso The presence of diabetes and prior abdominal surgery were each given 1 zzso All the individual scores for zzso diabetes, and prior surgery were added to produce a composite risk score for each zzso Patients were zzso into 6 risk groups, group 0 having the least risk and group 5 having the highest risk zzso of the patients were in group zzso The outcome measures were death, zzso zzso within 90 days of zzso intensive care unit length of stay zzso hospital zzso and packed red blood cell requirement in 48 zzso The 5 risk score groups with patients were similar in demographics and calculated zzso zzso The outcome measures in high-risk groups were similar to those in the lowest-risk group zzso zzso zzso In the Cox zzso model for LOS and survival, the composite risk score was not associated with poor survival or prolonged LOS zzso zzso zzso survival zzso with log rank testing failed to show any difference in survival among different risk zzso In conclusion, patients with multiple risk factors for poor surgical outcomes can undergo successful transplantation with zzso outcome and mortality comparable to those of low-risk zzso
