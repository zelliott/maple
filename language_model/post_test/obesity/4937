As obese zzso rats zzso zzso the zzso syndrome exhibit enhanced vascular zzso zzso and potentially an enhanced zzso activity zzso lean zzso rats zzso this study tested the hypothesis that zzso exhibit an improved tolerance to progressive zzso zzso experiments indicated that, corrected for body mass, total blood volume was reduced in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had a zzso muscle prepared for in zzso zzso and had zzso zzso zzso and skeletal muscle zzso monitored with flow zzso zzso pressure, zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso were monitored after either infusion of zzso or successive withdrawals of zzso total blood zzso zzso infusion indicated that regional zzso tone under control conditions differs substantially between zzso and zzso whereas with zzso zzso exhibit zzso in zzso pressure before zzso zzso zzso zzso and skeletal muscle zzso decreased more rapidly and to a greater extent in zzso zzso zzso after zzso In contrast, zzso reductions in zzso zzso in zzso lagged behind those in zzso although a similar maximum reduction was ultimately zzso With increasing zzso zzso zzso tone increased more in zzso than zzso and this increase in active tone was entirely due to an elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was greater in zzso zzso zzso under control conditions and during zzso with zzso from zzso demonstrating early closure zzso zzso These results suggest that a combination of reduced blood volume and elevated peripheral zzso zzso contribute to impaired zzso tolerance in zzso
