Over the last 20 years, obesity and associated zzso diseases have emerged as major global health zzso Among zzso populations of developing regions of the world, childhood zzso often coexists with adult zzso a phenomenon known as the zzso nutritional zzso A recent work zzso zzso Am J zzso zzso zzso suggests that linear growth zzso in early childhood may contribute to adult obesity by reducing the body's ability to zzso zzso We test central aspects of this model drawing on data from 112 adult zzso zzso zzso zzso 59 zzso from Southern zzso The results are consistent with the predictions of the model, but only for zzso zzso zzso women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have significantly lower zzso fat zzso levels compared to their taller zzso zzso women are also significantly heavier and fatter, and have higher serum zzso zzso Among all zzso women, reduced fat zzso is significantly correlated with percent body zzso serum zzso levels, and serum zzso levels, after controlling for relevant zzso Additionally, zzso women with high dietary fat zzso and low fat zzso are significantly zzso and have higher zzso and zzso levels than those with low fat zzso and high fat zzso These results suggest that zzso changes in fat zzso may play a role in the origins of obesity among populations with high rates of linear growth zzso Further zzso research is necessary to zzso the pathways through which zzso zzso may increase risks for adulthood obesity and cardiovascular zzso
