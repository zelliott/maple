The number of patients with both hypertension and obesity has been increasing in zzso Many of these patients may also have insulin zzso zzso an zzso II zzso blocker zzso selectively activates zzso zzso zzso zzso and this effect is considered to markedly improve insulin resistance in obese patients with zzso We compared the zzso and insulin zzso effects of zzso with those of zzso and zzso in this patient zzso 

zzso elderly patients with an average body mass index zzso of zzso zzso were enrolled in this zzso zzso Patients were randomly selected to either switch from zzso or zzso to zzso or to continue with their current zzso A 75 g oral zzso tolerance test zzso was performed before and after zzso and the effect of zzso on the insulin response to zzso loading was zzso 

There was no significant difference in blood pressure between the two groups after drug administration, but zzso tolerance significantly improved in the zzso zzso The zzso response to zzso loading also significantly improved in those taking zzso as well as zzso model assessment of insulin resistance zzso These changes were not observed in the control zzso 

In patients with hypertension and obesity showing insulin resistance, treatment with zzso significantly improved the zzso response to zzso zzso zzso may therefore be beneficial in these zzso
