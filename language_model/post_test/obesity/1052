Weight loss may be associated with zzso changes in body composition not compensated for by subsequent weight zzso 

We examined the composition of weight change in relation to zzso previous weight changes, weight-loss attempts, and physical zzso 

Part of the Danish zzso zzso Trends in zzso zzso project, this was a zzso population study of changes in weight and body zzso with examinations in zzso zzso and zzso A total of zzso men and 1200 women aged 35, 45, 55, or 65 y in zzso zzso Changes in fat and zzso mass were measured by zzso zzso 

Before adjustment for age-related changes, zzso mass made up zzso of weight lost and zzso of weight gained in zzso In women, loss of zzso mass zzso was more than double that of gains zzso After adjustment, the zzso of weight gained as zzso mass were not significantly different from the zzso zzso These zzso were independent of age, zzso and weight changes in the previous 5 zzso successful weight-loss zzso and physical zzso Independent of age and degree of zzso weight changes were associated with greater changes in zzso mass in men than in zzso 

These data do not support the theory that weight loss or weight cycling may lead to an zzso body zzso nor do they provide a biological explanation for why long-term weight loss is often zzso However, the zzso and health consequences of weight change may differ in men and zzso
