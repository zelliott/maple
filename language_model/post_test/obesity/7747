zzso supplementation of zzso rats during the zzso period protects against being overweight in adulthood and ameliorates the control of food zzso This was associated with changes in the expression of zzso genes involved in the central action of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso The purpose of the present study was to determine the zzso status within the promoter regions of these genes and to assess whether the observed changes in the expression levels of these genes could be explained by changes in their zzso zzso Male rats were treated daily with an oral zzso dose of zzso or vehicle during the zzso zzso After zzso animals were fed with a zzso or a high-fat zzso diet until aged 6 zzso DNA was extracted from the zzso and zzso within the promoter regions of the gene panel was measured by zzso zzso promoter zzso increased in control animals fed the zzso diet but decreased in zzso zzso In addition, there was a weak negative correlation between DNA zzso and zzso zzso levels zzso zzso zzso There were no changes in the zzso status of the zzso sites studied within the promoter regions of zzso and zzso in response to zzso or zzso zzso This is the first demonstration that zzso treatment during zzso may zzso zzso of an zzso gene in the zzso of animals fed zzso zzso with possible implications for gene expression and protection against the development of zzso
