We have examined the concentration of zzso in the fat of isolated abdominal subcutaneous zzso obtained from lean zzso zzso non-obese with higher zzso zzso zzso obese zzso zzso and from a group of obese subjects with type 2 zzso The concentration of zzso was 50% lower in the zzso from the obese and zzso groups compared with the lean and non-obese zzso Interestingly, the total amount of zzso in the zzso stores of each subject was constant among all zzso zzso constituted zzso (by zzso of the zzso lipids in the lean group and this was increased to zzso in the obese group with diabetes zzso The concentration of zzso zzso was in all cases zzso g per 100 g of total zzso demonstrating that mature human zzso have negligible stores of zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso are reduced in obese zzso The lower zzso in zzso from subjects with type 2 diabetes apparently reflect subjects zzso Our finding that zzso stores of zzso in zzso are constant raises new questions regarding what function it zzso as well as the mechanisms for maintaining constant levels in the face of varied zzso tissue mass among individuals over a period of zzso
