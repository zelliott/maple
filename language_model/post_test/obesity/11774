Body zzso is partly under zzso control with zzso zzso which include the zzso system and the zzso nervous system zzso In previous studies we have zzso in both obese and zzso subjects, that weight increase leads to increased sympathetic and decreased zzso activity, whereas weight decrease leads to decreased sympathetic and increased zzso zzso We now report on the involvement of such zzso mechanisms in the action of zzso drugs, independent of change in zzso 

zzso weight males zzso 22 to 38 zzso were fed a solid food diet, carefully measured to maintain body weight, for at least 2 weeks, as zzso at the Rockefeller University General Clinical Research zzso In a zzso zzso design, eight subjects received zzso seven zzso zzso and seven zzso zzso zzso measures of zzso and sympathetic activity zzso determination of amount of zzso control zzso and sympathetic control zzso of heart period zzso zzso using sequential pharmacological blockade by intravenous administration of zzso and zzso These zzso controls of heart period are used to estimate the overall level of zzso and sympathetic zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels in 24-hour urine collections were measured and also resting zzso rate zzso 

zzso food intake maintained constant body weight in all zzso zzso and zzso produced significant increases in SC but no change in PC or in zzso In contrast, zzso produced marked decreases in zzso PC, and zzso For all three drugs, the effects on urine catecholamines directly paralleled changes in cardiac measures of zzso 

zzso responses to zzso and zzso were zzso The large, and zzso response to zzso suggests further study to determine whether there could be any relation of these zzso changes to the adverse cardiovascular effects of treatment with zzso
