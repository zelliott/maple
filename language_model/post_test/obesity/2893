To evaluate the role of zzso in the zzso and decreased protein zzso of prolonged zzso Na zzso was administered as a primed continuous zzso infusion in zzso subjects and in obese subjects in the zzso state and after 3 days and 3-5 1/2 zzso of zzso An additional obese group received zzso zzso infusions on 2 consecutive days after zzso zzso of zzso The zzso infusion in zzso and obese subjects studied in the zzso state resulted in total blood zzso acid levels of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso decrease in plasma zzso and unchanged levels of insulin, zzso zzso and zzso Plasma zzso fell by zzso zzso smaller than zzso in 3 zzso In contrast, other zzso acids were stable or varied by less than zzso zzso lasting 6 h reduced plasma zzso by zzso reaching levels comparable to those observed in prolonged zzso zzso infusions of zzso and/or administration of zzso failed to alter plasma zzso zzso During prolonged zzso plasma zzso which had fallen by zzso below zzso levels, fell an additional zzso in response to the zzso zzso In association with repeated prolonged (12 zzso infusions in subjects zzso zzso zzso urinary nitrogen zzso fell by zzso returning to base line after zzso of zzso and zzso the changes in plasma zzso zzso zzso resulted in two- to fourfold greater increments in blood zzso acids in zzso as compared to zzso zzso It is concluded that increased blood zzso acid levels induced by infusions of Na zzso result in zzso and in nitrogen conservation in zzso These data suggest that zzso may be a zzso factor in the decreased availability or circulating zzso and reduction in protein zzso characteristic of prolonged zzso
