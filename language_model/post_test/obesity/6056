It is unclear whether the pattern of zzso delivery to peripheral zzso has important zzso 

The aim of the study was to compare the effects of zzso zzso continuous administration of zzso upon zzso and zzso parameters in obese zzso 

The study was conducted at the General Clinical Research Center at the University of Michigan Medical zzso 

Four men and five women with abdominal obesity zzso mass index, 33 zzso 3 zzso body fat, 40 zzso zzso participated in the zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was given zzso for 3 d zzso 1) continuous infusion zzso and 2) zzso zzso zzso zzso of the dose at zzso zzso and zzso h and zzso at zzso zzso These trials were preceded by a zzso period zzso when subjects received normal zzso 

Rate of zzso and zzso zzso production were evaluated using stable isotope zzso zzso The composite index of insulin sensitivity zzso zzso was assessed using oral zzso tolerance zzso 

The increase in plasma zzso zzso was greater zzso zzso with continuous zzso infusion zzso zzso 31, 423 zzso 38, and 309 zzso 34 zzso for B, C, and zzso zzso Muscle zzso zzso was significantly increased zzso zzso only after the continuous zzso infusion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso arbitrary units, for B, C, and zzso zzso Only zzso zzso zzso the rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for B, C, and zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso production, but both modes of zzso administration were equally effective in zzso insulin zzso 

These findings indicate that, in obese subjects, discrete components of zzso zzso pattern may zzso affect zzso generation and zzso zzso
