zzso zzso balance, weight loss and resting zzso rate were measured in zzso obese zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso diets over 3 zzso zzso All subjects were fed on zzso zzso in three zzso for the first zzso zzso In weeks 2 or 3, using a zzso design, ten subjects were fed on 15 or zzso zzso as three zzso zzso subjects were fed on five or one zzso with zzso zzso and zzso subjects were fed on zzso zzso as five zzso or zzso zzso as one zzso zzso N loss was least on the zzso week and zzso week: the largest difference was found when these effects were combined zzso less than zzso zzso When zzso was held constant at zzso N loss decreased significantly zzso less than zzso between week 2 and 3, but when the zzso was manipulated there was no significant N conservation in the third zzso This suggests that the zzso value is more important than meal frequency in the preservation of lean zzso zzso Weight loss was also least on the zzso week and zzso week, but this result reached significance only when the effects were combined zzso less than zzso zzso zzso zzso rate decreased with time but was not significantly altered by the dietary zzso zzso zzso during the first 3 weeks at an intake of zzso zzso a diet with a zzso zzso fed as frequent small meals, is associated with better preservation of lean tissue than an zzso diet with zzso concentration fed as fewer zzso There was no evidence that meal frequency or protein concentration affect the rate of fat zzso
