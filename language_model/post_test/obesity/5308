zzso zzso zzso zzso in blood donors can be related to many variables such as viral zzso overweight and ethanol zzso 

This study aims to define factors associated with zzso zzso in candidates for blood donation, to evaluate zzso levels during zzso and to establish a zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso drug-induced liver disease, diabetes, zzso and alpha zzso zzso were investigated in 119 subjects zzso zzso six zzso aged zzso zzso who were zzso B surface zzso C virus negative and had been rejected as blood donors as a result of elevated zzso zzso times the upper normal limit zzso in two zzso During zzso zzso was determined every 8 weeks and liver biopsy recommended in cases with persistently elevated zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and alcoholism zzso were most frequently associated with zzso zzso and in zzso of cases no association was zzso zzso levels decreased significantly, regardless of the associated zzso Liver zzso in 40 patients showed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso normal liver zzso of zzso and alcoholic zzso zzso and zzso portal zzso in three zzso 

zzso levels usually dropped during follow-up and although severe zzso zzso can be found in zzso blood donors, mild zzso damage is the zzso
