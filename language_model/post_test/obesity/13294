Being overweight is a risk factor for zzso breast cancer and is associated with an increased zzso and shortened zzso of spontaneous and chemically induced zzso tumors in zzso However, zzso obese zzso female mice have reduced zzso of spontaneous and zzso zzso zzso Of interest, zzso enhances the proliferation of human breast cancer cell lines in which zzso receptors are zzso which suggests that zzso signaling plays a role in tumor zzso We evaluated zzso zzso tumor development in obese zzso mice that exhibit a zzso in zzso which is considered to be the major signaling zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso mice were crossed, and the offspring were zzso for zzso expression and the determination of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice and obese zzso mice were monitored until age 104 zzso Body weights of zzso zzso mice were significantly heavier than those of the lean zzso No zzso tumors were detected in zzso mice, whereas the zzso of zzso tumors in zzso and zzso zzso mice was zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso tissue whole mounts indicated an absence of duct formation and branching for zzso zzso Both age at zzso tumor detection and tumor burden zzso and tumor zzso were similar for the lean zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso mice were zzso higher than levels of lean zzso Thus, despite elevated serum zzso levels, zzso zzso zzso mice do not develop zzso zzso This study provides additional evidence that zzso and its zzso zzso may be involved in zzso zzso
