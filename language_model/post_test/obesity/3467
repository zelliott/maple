Growth parameters during infancy and early childhood might predict zzso levels later in zzso This study investigates the association between peak growth zzso body mass index zzso and age at zzso rebound zzso with zzso and zzso levels at age 10 zzso 

Peak height zzso and weight zzso zzso were calculated from height and weight zzso obtained between birth and age 2 years from zzso children participating in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plus environmental and genetic influences on zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso on the zzso System and the Development of zzso in Childhood plus Air Pollution and zzso birth zzso zzso and age at zzso were calculated using zzso zzso between age zzso and 12 zzso Blood samples were collected during a physical examination at age zzso zzso and zzso levels were measured by zzso Linear zzso models were fitted after adjustment for potential zzso factors and results are presented per zzso range increase in the zzso 

Age at zzso was zzso associated with zzso in males and females zzso difference zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For both males and females zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were positively associated with zzso zzso zzso showed a positive effect on zzso in females only zzso zzso zzso zzso Growth parameters were not significantly associated with zzso except for age at zzso among females zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso among males zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Growth patterns in early life may be associated with zzso levels at age 10 zzso
