We investigated whether zzso oxygen enhances the zzso zzso capacity of the skeletal muscle and zzso zzso zzso in type 2 diabetic rats with zzso zzso male zzso zzso zzso fatty zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso rats were used as diabetic animals and zzso controls, respectively, and assigned to control and zzso oxygen zzso Animals in the zzso oxygen group were exposed to an atmospheric pressure of zzso with an oxygen concentration of zzso for zzso zzso The zzso level at 27 weeks of age was significantly higher in zzso rats than in zzso rats, but the zzso was inhibited in zzso rats exposed to zzso zzso The zzso fiber transition in the skeletal muscle was observed in zzso rats, but the shift was inhibited in zzso rats exposed to zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso activity of muscle fibers was increased by zzso zzso The zzso size was larger in zzso rats than in zzso rats, but zzso zzso were not observed in zzso rats exposed to zzso zzso zzso oxygen enhances zzso and zzso metabolism in the skeletal muscle, indicating that zzso oxygen can prevent zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in diabetic rats with zzso
