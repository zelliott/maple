Limited information is available concerning the effects of obesity on the functional outcomes of patients requiring major lower limb zzso because of peripheral zzso disease zzso The purpose of this study was to examine the zzso ability of body mass index zzso to determine functional outcome in the zzso zzso To do this, 434 consecutive patients zzso age, zzso zzso zzso 59% male, zzso zzso undergoing major limb zzso zzso zzso zzso 27 zzso zzso 132 zzso zzso and 50 zzso as a complication of zzso from January 1998 through May 2004 were analyzed according to zzso zzso zzso was classified according to the zzso Center for Disease Control system: zzso 0 to zzso zzso normal, zzso to zzso zzso overweight, 25 to zzso zzso and zzso or zzso 30 zzso zzso parameters measured included prosthetic zzso maintenance of zzso survival, and maintenance of independent living zzso The zzso test for association was used to examine zzso zzso zzso zzso were constructed to assess maintenance of zzso survival, and maintenance of independent living zzso zzso analysis using the multiple zzso zzso model and a Cox zzso hazards model were used to predict variables independently associated with prosthetic use and zzso survival, and independence, zzso zzso prosthetic usage and zzso zzso survival, and independent living status for the entire cohort was zzso per zzso zzso per zzso zzso per zzso zzso per zzso and for patients with normal zzso was zzso per zzso zzso per zzso zzso per zzso and zzso per zzso zzso There was no statistically significant difference in outcomes for overweight patients zzso zzso zzso and zzso or obese patients zzso zzso zzso and zzso when compared with normal zzso Although there were significantly poorer outcomes for zzso patients for the parameters of prosthetic usage when compared with the remaining cohort zzso P zzso zzso and maintenance of zzso when compared with overweight patients zzso P zzso zzso zzso analysis adjusting for medical zzso and level of zzso showed that zzso was not a significant independent predictor of failure for any outcome zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso failed to correlate with functional outcome and, specifically, obesity did not predict a poorer zzso
