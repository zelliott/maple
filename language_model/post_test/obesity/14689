zzso and zzso are the alternatively spliced gene products of the zzso zzso whose product zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso zzso causes zzso fatty liver, and insulin resistance in mice, whereas zzso tissue zzso zzso results in increased zzso but improved insulin zzso To assess zzso expression and its relation to insulin resistance in humans, we examined zzso and zzso zzso levels in subjects with normal or impaired zzso zzso We found higher expression levels of both zzso zzso in lean, zzso zzso When compared with normal zzso subjects, individuals with impaired zzso tolerance were more insulin zzso demonstrated higher levels of zzso lipids zzso and expressed approximately 50% lower levels of zzso and zzso In addition, there was a strong inverse correlation between zzso tissue zzso expression and muscle zzso but no evidence for an increase in muscle zzso zzso After treatment of the impaired zzso subjects with insulin zzso for 10 weeks, zzso (but not zzso resulted in a zzso increase in the insulin sensitivity index zzso and a zzso decrease in zzso (both P zzso along with an increase in zzso (but not zzso expression by zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in skeletal muscle, however, was not related to obesity or insulin zzso zzso high zzso tissue zzso expression is found in zzso subjects, and zzso expression increases following treatment with zzso These results suggest that increased zzso and/or zzso in subcutaneous fat, zzso by the zzso zzso may prevent zzso in muscle, leading to improved insulin zzso
