The zzso efficiency, minute ventilation zzso dioxide production zzso slope consistently provides valuable zzso information in patients with heart failure zzso Patients with a higher body mass index zzso have demonstrated an improved prognosis in the zzso population, a phenomenon that has been termed the zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the zzso ability of the zzso slope according to zzso in patients with zzso zzso four patients with zzso zzso men, 149 women, mean age zzso years, ejection fraction zzso with a zzso zzso underwent zzso exercise zzso zzso were divided into 3 zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso Each subject was tracked for major cardiac events zzso zzso left zzso assist device zzso for 2 years after zzso There were 86 major cardiac events (71 deaths, 10 zzso 5 left zzso assist device zzso during the zzso tracking period zzso annual event rate zzso The zzso slope was the strongest zzso marker in each zzso zzso zzso in the highest zzso group had the lowest mean zzso slope and the lowest rate of major cardiac events of the 3 zzso zzso Cox zzso analysis showed that peak zzso did not add additional zzso value to the zzso slope and was removed from the zzso for each zzso zzso In conclusion, the findings of the present study indicate that zzso slope maintains zzso value irrespective of zzso in patients with zzso
