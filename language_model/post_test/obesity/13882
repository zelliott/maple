To evaluate zzso whether an active weight reduction strategy based on the zzso approach and an initial zzso diet might lead to zzso and long-term weight loss and zzso of zzso and zzso whether the results of this intervention could be enhanced by combining it with zzso continuous positive airway pressure zzso treatment during the first 6 zzso 

Thirty-one obese male symptomatic sleep zzso patients underwent a zzso weight reduction program with total follow-up of 36 months from zzso The mean age zzso was zzso years, body mass index zzso and oxygen zzso index zzso zzso The patients were zzso to zzso (17 zzso and zzso groups zzso zzso 

The mean weight loss was zzso zzso zzso of the original zzso for the whole group at 6 months, zzso zzso at 12 months and zzso zzso zzso at 24 zzso Excellent or good treatment results, as defined in terms of an zzso zzso number of oxygen zzso events zzso from zzso reduction of at least 50% from the zzso were seen in zzso of patients at 6 months and were still zzso in zzso of patients at 24 zzso The correlations between changes in weight and in zzso were zzso zzso at 6 months, zzso zzso and zzso zzso at 24 zzso Adding zzso treatment to the weight reduction therapy for the first 6 months did not result in greater weight loss or diminution of zzso zzso (without zzso at any time zzso One year after the termination of the program the mean weight loss was zzso zzso and zzso of patients still showed at least zzso weight loss as compared with their original zzso 

zzso weight loss associated with improvement of zzso could be achieved by means of a zzso weight loss zzso Adding zzso in the initial phase of the weight reduction program did not result in significantly greater weight zzso
