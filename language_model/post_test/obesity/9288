Early markers of diabetic zzso zzso zzso in an zzso zzso include elevated R wave zzso widening of zzso intervals and decreased heart rate zzso zzso The severity of DAN has a direct relationship with mortality zzso zzso exercise training is a common recommendation for the delay and possible reversal of cardiac zzso Limited research exists on zzso measures for the evaluation of zzso exercise training in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a model of type 2 zzso The objective of this study was to assess whether zzso exercise training may zzso diabetes induced zzso zzso 

Male zzso zzso zzso and control zzso zzso zzso rats were assigned to 4 groups: sedentary control zzso sedentary diabetic zzso exercised control zzso and exercised diabetic zzso The exercised groups began 7 weeks of treadmill training after the development of diabetes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso and termination zzso included body weight, heart weight, blood zzso and zzso zzso levels and zzso zzso One way repeated measures zzso zzso analyzed within and between subject differences and zzso zzso zzso and descriptive statistics described variable relationships and animal zzso 

Diabetes caused crucial changes in R wave zzso zzso zzso heart rate zzso zzso zzso zzso intervals zzso zzso and zzso intervals zzso zzso R wave zzso zzso in zzso rats from baseline to termination was ameliorated by exercise, resulting in R wave zzso changes in zzso animals similar to control zzso zzso exercise training neither attenuated zzso or zzso zzso zzso nor restored decreases in zzso in diabetic zzso 

This study revealed zzso in R wave zzso zzso zzso and zzso intervals in zzso zzso Of these changes, zzso exercise training was able to correct R wave zzso zzso In addition, exercise has beneficial effect in this diabetic rat model in regards to zzso zzso of left zzso zzso
