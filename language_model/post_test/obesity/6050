We have determined the systemic zzso of the hormone zzso by PET zzso PET imaging using zzso and zzso zzso revealed that, in zzso the hormone was rapidly taken up by zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso localized in zzso zzso In addition, in zzso zzso zzso of labeled zzso localized to red bone zzso which was consistent with hormone zzso in zzso zzso These data confirm a zzso mechanism for zzso zzso in zzso The significant binding to immune cells and blood cell precursors in bone zzso is also consistent with prior evidence showing that zzso zzso immune zzso These experiments set the stage for similar studies in humans to assess the extent to which zzso of zzso zzso might contribute to zzso they also provide a general chemical strategy for zzso labeling of proteins for PET imaging of other zzso zzso
