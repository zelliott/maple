zzso zzso zzso are emerging as a zzso family with important roles in the regulation of signaling by zzso hormones related to energy zzso The treatment of zzso rats with zzso zzso zzso is known to produce a selective damage on the zzso nucleus with development of zzso This study investigates the relationship among zzso zzso IV zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso and zzso model of obesity in 2 areas of the central nervous zzso zzso zzso IV and zzso were, respectively, evaluated by zzso and zzso zzso zzso and reverse zzso zzso chain reaction in soluble zzso and zzso zzso zzso from the zzso and zzso of zzso and normal rats, submitted or not to food deprivation zzso zzso zzso IV in both areas was distinguished zzso as insensitive zzso and sensitive zzso to zzso zzso Compared with the controls, zzso and/or zzso decreased the activity of zzso in the zzso and zzso from the zzso as well as the activity of zzso in the zzso from the zzso and in the zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso increased the activity of zzso in the zzso from the zzso The zzso protein expression of membrane zzso by zzso zzso zzso decreased in the zzso and increased in the zzso of zzso and/or zzso relative to the zzso The existence of zzso activity with different sensitivities to zzso A and the identity of insensitive with zzso were demonstrated for the first time in the central nervous zzso Data also demonstrated the involvement of zzso zzso activity in the energy balance probably through the regulation of zzso Y and zzso levels in the zzso and zzso
