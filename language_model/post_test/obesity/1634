Clinical obesity is an epidemic problem in the United zzso The impact of this disease upon traumatic lower zzso vascular injuries zzso is as yet zzso We hypothesized that clinical obesity adversely affects outcome in patients with traumatic zzso 

All adult patients admitted over a zzso period with a traumatic zzso were zzso Clinical obesity was defined as body mass index zzso zzso and non-obese patient groups were compared for surgical management and zzso 

A total of 145 patients were zzso zzso data were available for 115 zzso of these patients zzso zzso non-obese zzso zzso and non-obese groups were zzso zzso patients underwent more vascular repairs but the zzso rate and mortality were not significantly zzso 

While obese body zzso can increase the complexity of evaluation and management of patients with zzso we have demonstrated that equivalent outcomes to the non-obese population can be achieved for the clinically obese patient with a zzso However, patients with a zzso did reveal a significantly higher chance of zzso and death after zzso Due to the small number of patients in this zzso one should use caution when interpreting this zzso
