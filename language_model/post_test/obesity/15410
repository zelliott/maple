The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of zzso an zzso converting zzso zzso on blood pressure, zzso blood flow and insulin sensitivity in comparison with zzso gastrointestinal therapeutic zzso 

This is a zzso zzso zzso zzso comparative study in 90 overweight zzso patients, who were randomly assigned to treatment for 8 weeks with either zzso or zzso At baseline and after treatment, all patients underwent an oral zzso tolerance test, an evaluation of their zzso profiles and a zzso zzso clamp zzso In a zzso of 18 patients, a zzso study was carried zzso 

Blood pressure fell by the second week of treatment and remained significantly reduced compared with baseline in both treatment zzso Plasma zzso levels were also significantly reduced after zzso therapy, but no significant changes occurred in the other zzso parameters during treatment with either zzso During the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso use was similar in the two treatment groups at zzso and a moderate but statistically significant increase in insulin sensitivity was observed after zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso P zzso versus baseline and zzso versus zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso zzso was significantly higher after zzso than after zzso therapy zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso As zzso blood flow was similar in the two treatment groups at baseline and was unchanged after 8 weeks of therapy, skeletal muscle zzso extraction was significantly greater in the zzso inhibitor zzso than in the zzso comparative group zzso baseline 21 zzso 2, treatment 24 zzso 3 zzso zzso baseline 18 zzso 3, treatment 16 zzso 2 zzso P zzso zzso versus zzso zzso 

During short-term treatment, zzso zzso with zzso was able to moderately improve insulin sensitivity, in comparison with calcium zzso and this effect appeared to be independent of the zzso action of the zzso
