zzso We assessed the variation in subcutaneous abdominal zzso tissue blood flow within and between subjects and investigated whether it is correlated with body mass zzso zzso We measured body mass index and subcutaneous abdominal zzso tissue blood flow in 38 zzso subjects on the same day and on different days and, in a zzso of 16 subjects, after a mixed zzso zzso In 190 zzso in the zzso state, subcutaneous abdominal zzso tissue blood flow was significantly more variable between subjects than could be accounted for by the zzso variation zzso zzso abdominal zzso tissue blood flow was also significantly more variable between days within subjects than could be accounted for by zzso variation zzso zzso and zzso subcutaneous abdominal zzso tissue blood flow were zzso correlated with body mass index, as was the zzso rise in subcutaneous abdominal zzso tissue blood zzso Multiple zzso analysis showed that zzso blood flow was not dependent on insulin concentration after allowing for body mass zzso There was no correlation between zzso subcutaneous abdominal zzso tissue blood flow and insulin zzso zzso zzso does not appear to have a direct zzso effect in subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso subjects have lower zzso and zzso subcutaneous abdominal zzso tissue blood zzso This may be because of a blunted response to sympathetic zzso or it may be another aspect of the zzso zzso
