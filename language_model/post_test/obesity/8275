zzso sleep zzso zzso is an zzso condition characterized by zzso episodes of obstruction of the upper airway leading to sleep fragmentation and intermittent zzso during zzso zzso zzso to zzso and the prevalence of zzso is increasing worldwide because of the ongoing epidemic of zzso Recent evidence has shown that surrogate markers of cardiovascular risk, including sympathetic zzso systemic zzso and zzso dysfunction, are significantly increased in obese patients with zzso versus those without zzso suggesting that zzso is not simply an zzso of zzso Moreover, findings from animal models and patients with zzso show that intermittent zzso zzso the zzso dysfunction of zzso zzso insulin resistance and zzso fatty liver zzso In patients with the zzso syndrome, the prevalence of moderate to severe zzso is very high zzso In this population, zzso is independently associated with increased zzso and zzso levels as well as markers of zzso zzso zzso and zzso A recent randomized, controlled, crossover study showed that effective treatment of zzso with continuous positive airway pressure for 3 months significantly reduced several components of the zzso syndrome, including blood pressure, zzso levels, and visceral zzso Finally, several cohort studies have consistently shown that zzso is associated with increased cardiovascular zzso independent of zzso Taken together, these results support the concept that zzso zzso the zzso risk attributed to obesity and the zzso zzso zzso and treatment of zzso may decrease the cardiovascular risk in obese zzso
