The prevalence of coronary artery disease zzso among South Asians zzso significantly exceeds that of zzso South Asians also suffer from more zzso clinically aggressive and zzso extensive zzso zzso The role of conventional zzso risk factors zzso remains zzso 

We sought to determine if the zzso burdens of zzso immigrants differed from zzso We also sought to determine whether zzso zzso was more extensive among zzso and whether zzso ethnicity was an independent predictor of zzso zzso 

We reviewed the zzso and zzso of 520 zzso and 219 Caucasians zzso referred with stable angina zzso or acute coronary zzso 

zzso zzso was significantly more common among zzso than Caucasians zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso Diabetes zzso zzso age and male sex independently predicted zzso zzso South Asian ethnicity showed a trend toward predicting zzso disease zzso zzso zzso The frequency of zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso hypertension zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso obesity zzso vs zzso P zzso and zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso were significantly greater among zzso however, smoking was significantly more common among Caucasians zzso vs zzso P zzso Compared to zzso zzso were significantly younger at the time of presentation for coronary zzso zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso referred for coronary zzso with stable angina and acute coronary syndromes are younger, have significantly higher rates of zzso disease, as well as higher rates of zzso hypertension, obesity and zzso than zzso zzso zzso prevention and treatment may be warranted in this zzso
