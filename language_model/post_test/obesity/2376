zzso is an independent risk factor for the development of heart zzso Several recent studies have found better outcomes of heart failure for obese patients, an observation termed as the zzso zzso On the other hand, the negative effect of zzso on the evolution of heart failure has also been clearly zzso 

Data from the Minimum Basic Data Set were analyzed for all patients discharged from all the departments of internal medicine in hospitals of the Spanish National Health System between the years 2006 and zzso The information was limited to those patients with a primary or secondary diagnosis of heart zzso Patients with a diagnosis of obesity or zzso were zzso The mortality and zzso indexes of obese and zzso patients were compared against the zzso without these zzso 

A total of zzso heart failure zzso were zzso with zzso zzso diagnosed with obesity and zzso zzso with zzso zzso global mortality reached zzso and the risk of zzso was zzso zzso patients had a lower zzso mortality risk zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and early zzso risk zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso patients had a much higher risk of dying while in hospital zzso zzso zzso zzso or of being readmitted within 30 days after discharge zzso zzso zzso zzso even after adjusting for possible zzso zzso 

zzso in patients admitted for zzso substantially reduces zzso mortality risk and the possibility of early zzso whereas zzso is associated with important increases in zzso mortality and risk of zzso in the 30 days following zzso
