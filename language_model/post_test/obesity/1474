The insulin resistance syndrome is characterized by a constellation of risk factors including zzso central body fat distribution, hypertension, zzso zzso elevated plasma insulin levels, increased zzso and decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B, characterized by a predominance of small, dense LDL zzso is associated with increased zzso and lower HDL cholesterol zzso Both the insulin resistance syndrome and zzso B have also been related to increased risk of coronary heart zzso Using a sample of nearly 700 women who participated in the Kaiser zzso Women zzso zzso we investigated the associations of LDL zzso zzso B with the risk factors that characterize the insulin resistance zzso The results demonstrate that LDL zzso zzso B was strongly associated with both age and diabetes zzso Among zzso women, zzso B was more prevalent in those with higher body mass index and in those with higher zzso zzso In addition to the expected associations with zzso and HDL cholesterol, mean values of both zzso and zzso blood pressure were higher in women with zzso zzso Finally, zzso and zzso insulin levels and zzso zzso levels were higher in those with zzso zzso In general, these relationships persisted in zzso statistical zzso zzso a predominance of small, dense LDL particles appears to be an integral feature of the risk factors that characterize the insulin resistance zzso
