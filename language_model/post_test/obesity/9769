Although more than 40 years have passed since zzso zzso zzso was first reported, predicting the zzso outcome of individual zzso patients remains zzso Emerging zzso evidence indicates that overweight and obesity are risk factors for zzso zzso zzso We aimed to zzso the outcome of overweight zzso patients and improve our ability to predict the progression of zzso based on a combination of body mass index zzso and zzso zzso including zzso zzso area (Max zzso 

zzso adult zzso patients whose estimated zzso zzso rate was zzso zzso zzso were enrolled in this zzso Renal biopsy specimens were evaluated according to the Oxford zzso of zzso A zzso analysis and the zzso Cox zzso hazards method were used to evaluate 10-year kidney survival and the impact of zzso The ability of factors to predict the progression of zzso was evaluated by their diagnostic odds ratio zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso was found to be an independent predictor of a zzso increase in serum zzso value zzso zzso The combination of zzso zzso zzso Max zzso zzso zzso and presence of zzso zzso (Oxford zzso zzso raised zzso power for disease progression of zzso zzso zzso 

A combination of zzso zzso zzso the Oxford zzso zzso and a Max zzso zzso zzso can serve as a predictor of long-term zzso outcome of zzso
