To validate zzso indexes against minimal model analysis zzso of the frequently sampled intravenous zzso tolerance test zzso in an obese pediatric zzso 

zzso results were compared with zzso model assessment of insulin resistance zzso and zzso insulin with the sample zzso by sex, zzso and sensitivity index zzso median in 191 children (82 males and 109 zzso zzso zzso zzso years of age, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso score zzso zzso zzso 

Across zzso groups, correlation zzso between zzso and zzso ranged from zzso to zzso in males and from zzso to zzso in females (age and zzso zzso P zzso in all zzso Similar results were seen for zzso zzso In zzso the relationship was significantly weaker in zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso indexes in explaining zzso was sex dependent, varied with zzso stage, and in females was influenced by degree of insulin zzso In obese pediatric zzso we generally discourage the use of zzso indexes, although the zzso varies within zzso
