zzso zzso is a specific zzso inhibitor that has been shown to promote weight loss and improve zzso control in obese diabetic zzso To study its long-term zzso effect, 40 obese patients with zzso zzso diabetes zzso zzso or impaired zzso tolerance zzso were included in a zzso randomized, zzso controlled zzso Patients were assigned to receive either 60 zzso F or zzso zzso daily in conjunction with a zzso diet zzso 50% zzso Both groups showed a significant weight loss, with a zzso after 6 months without group differences zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Fifteen patients from the F group and 14 from the P group completed the 12-month study without weight loss zzso zzso regulation improved along with the weight loss, but with a larger decline in plasma zzso and zzso zzso levels on the F group zzso zzso Total skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso activity increased by zzso in the F group zzso zzso and by zzso in the P group zzso after 6 months of treatment, but was still less than the activity in zzso controls zzso zzso zzso zzso years; body mass index, zzso zzso zzso After adjustment for zzso zzso insulin, weight loss, and diabetic state, a positive effect of F remained on the total zzso activity, which accounted for zzso of the variation zzso zzso The waist to hip ratio was reduced in P subjects as compared with F subjects zzso zzso zzso mass zzso tended to be more reduced in the F group as compared with P subjects zzso v zzso zzso although the difference did not reach statistical zzso In conclusion, F seems to improve insulin sensitivity beyond the effect zzso through weight loss by a possible effect on zzso activity in skeletal muscle zzso
