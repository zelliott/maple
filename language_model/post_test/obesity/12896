In adults, visceral fat zzso is associated with insulin resistance and zzso The zzso nature of these relationships is not zzso The objective of the present study was to determine if similar relationships exist in zzso zzso Specifically, we determined whether visceral fat was associated with zzso insulin, insulin sensitivity zzso serum zzso zzso zzso or serum HDL cholesterol zzso zzso whether visceral fat or zzso was independently related to zzso and whether ethnicity influenced the relationship between visceral fat and risk zzso zzso were 61 zzso African-American and Caucasian zzso Total body fat was determined by zzso X-ray zzso visceral fat by zzso zzso and insulin sensitivity by the zzso frequently sampled intravenous zzso tolerance test with minimal zzso In multiple linear zzso analysis zzso for total fat, sex, and zzso visceral fat was independently related to zzso zzso zzso and zzso insulin zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso Total body fat was independently related to zzso zzso zzso zzso was independently related to zzso insulin zzso zzso but not to zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in African-Americans was zzso lower than in Caucasians zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso after adjusting for total fat, P zzso Nonetheless, ethnicity was not independently related to either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, after adjusting for total and visceral fat and zzso The slopes of the relationships of total and visceral fat with risk factors did not differ with zzso In conclusion, visceral fat appears metabolically unique in children, being independently associated with elevated zzso and insulin but not zzso zzso children and African-American children were more insulin zzso independent of visceral fat zzso Lower zzso was associated with higher, faster insulin, but not zzso Thus, zzso visceral fat zzso and ethnicity in children may zzso negative, but independent, health zzso
