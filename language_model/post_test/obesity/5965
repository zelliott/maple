This study was to explore the effects of a compound zzso from zzso zzso zzso on zzso syndrome in zzso The animal models, developed zzso zzso and insulin resistance, were induced by zzso in zzso mice, and were treated orally with 100 zzso zzso and 15 zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso mice fed with standard zzso were used as normal zzso The blood zzso the value of serum zzso and the content of zzso in the skeletal muscle were determined by zzso zzso The protein expression was evaluated by western zzso zzso administration decreased body weight gain, zzso index, serum zzso levels, and zzso zzso in skeletal muscle zzso At the same time, zzso administration also exhibited extensive effects on insulin resistance by improving oral zzso tolerance test, insulin tolerance test and zzso infusion rate in zzso clamp zzso Furthermore, in skeletal muscle, zzso reversed the zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso and also decreased the expression of zzso and increased the expression of zzso in the zzso zzso All the results suggest that zzso improves zzso syndrome may by the enhancement of insulin sensitivity and fatty acid zzso
