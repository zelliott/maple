The increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity in zzso children is potentially linked to contextual influences such as the food environment around zzso The proximity of fast-food and convenience stores to schools may enhance access to zzso foods and have a negative impact on zzso 

This study used spatial cluster analysis to determine whether food outlets are clustered around schools and evaluated the extent of food outlet zzso by school and school neighborhood zzso zzso 

The locations in 2008 of all schools, fast-food outlets, and convenience stores in five urban regions across New Zealand were zzso Using zzso analysis conducted in 2009, the number and proportion of outlets within zzso and zzso road distance around each school was zzso The spatial zzso of food outlets within zzso zzso of schools was determined using a zzso zzso Food outlet type, school level, zzso the degree of population density, and commercial land use zoning around each school were zzso 

zzso schools had a total proportion of zzso outlets per 1000 students within 800 m compared to zzso for secondary zzso The most socially deprived zzso of schools had three times the number and proportion of food outlets compared to the zzso zzso There was a high degree of zzso of food outlets around schools, with up to zzso times more outlets than might be zzso zzso were most clustered up to 800 m from schools and around secondary schools, socially deprived schools, and schools in densely populated and commercially zoned zzso 

Food environments in New Zealand within walking proximity to schools are characterized by a high density of fast-food outlets and convenience stores, particularly in zzso deprived zzso These zzso environments provide ready access to zzso foods that may have a negative impact on student diet and contribute to zzso in zzso
