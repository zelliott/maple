To determine if the relationship between abdominal visceral fat zzso and measures of zzso are different between Black and White subjects and to develop valid field prediction models that accurately identify those individuals with zzso levels associated with high risk for chronic zzso 

zzso zzso obtained from 91 Black men, 137 Black women, 227 White men, and 237 White women subjects, ages zzso zzso who were participants in the zzso Family zzso both at baseline and following 20 weeks of endurance zzso 

zzso abdominal subcutaneous fat zzso abdominal total fat zzso and zzso diameter zzso were measured by zzso zzso zzso Body density was determined by zzso weighing and was used to estimate relative body zzso zzso waist zzso and hip zzso and zzso thickness measures were taken, and zzso was calculated from weight zzso and height zzso Since CT abdominal fat variables were zzso a natural log transformation zzso was used to produce a normal zzso The General Linear Model zzso procedure was used to test the relationship between zzso and two different groups of zzso and zzso 

The zzso of White men and women was significantly higher than that of Black men and women, independent of zzso zzso zzso and age, and was greater for men than for zzso The CT model showed that the combination of zzso zzso zzso age, and race accounted for 84 and zzso of the zzso in zzso in men and women, zzso The zzso model provided two valid generalized field zzso prediction zzso The zzso zzso which included zzso zzso age and race, had an zzso of zzso and zzso for men and women, zzso The zzso zzso which included zzso zzso zzso zzso age, and race, had an zzso of zzso and zzso for men and women, zzso The field model equations became less accurate as the estimated zzso zzso 

zzso At the same age and level of zzso Black men and women have less zzso than White men and zzso These differences are greater in men than in zzso zzso The field zzso equations can be generalized to the diverse group of adults zzso both in an untrained and trained zzso However, their accuracy decreases with increasing levels of zzso
