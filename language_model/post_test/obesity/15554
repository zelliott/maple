zzso zzso production is important to the understanding of mechanisms involved in the development of fatty liver and zzso Previously, we have reported that zzso fatty acid synthesis and zzso zzso are increased in obese zzso Here, we describe the effects of a high zzso diet on zzso fatty acid synthesis and zzso gene expression in obese zzso 

zzso rats with zzso zzso zzso were fed on a high zzso diet zzso of zzso or lab zzso for 11 zzso 

zzso zzso and plasma zzso insulin zzso were further increased in the obese rats fed a high zzso zzso The experimental diet increased the activity of zzso zzso zzso the rate limiting zzso for zzso fatty acid zzso and zzso content, concurrent with an increase abundance of zzso zzso in the obese zzso Despite further zzso of zzso zzso there was no further increase in zzso zzso zzso abundance in the obese rats fed the high zzso zzso 

These data suggest that the synthesis of zzso fatty acids but not of zzso is further increased in obese rats fed the high zzso diet, and that zzso gene expression may be modulated in response to zzso in zzso zzso zzso
