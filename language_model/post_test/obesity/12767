The existence of a distinct diabetic zzso characterized by a raised left zzso mass, has previously been zzso However, as diabetes zzso is associated with both left zzso zzso and hypertension a zzso effect of raised blood pressure in diabetic patients has to be zzso In the present zzso study an zzso examination was performed as part of a health screening survey in 582 zzso aged 70 zzso After the exclusion of subjects with coronary heart disease or those on regular zzso treatment, 30 zzso subjects with diabetes were compared with 10 subjects with zzso diabetes zzso and a zzso blood pressure 90 zzso zzso or more and zzso zzso control subjects with normal zzso zzso Both groups with zzso showed a significantly increased left zzso diameter zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso and an increased zzso component in zzso zzso p zzso compared to the control zzso Left zzso mass was, however, only marginally and not significantly elevated in the diabetic subjects when compared to the healthy control subjects zzso zzso 19 and 133 zzso 28 vs 128 zzso 25 zzso Only in the subjects with zzso diabetes and a raised blood pressure was the zzso zzso significantly enlarged zzso zzso Thus, in the present sample no distinct diabetic zzso with an increased left zzso mass, independent of the influence of hypertension could be zzso The zzso zzso in these diabetic males were restricted to an increased left zzso size and an impaired zzso zzso
