zzso leads to significant increase in body weight, but the possible peripheral mechanisms involved in weight gain are still zzso Since exercise and zzso hormones zzso energy balance, we aimed to study the effect of swimming training on body weight gain and brown zzso tissue zzso type 2 zzso zzso responses in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso were submitted to a period of zzso training, 5 days per week with progressive higher duration of exercise zzso zzso training program did not totally prevent the higher body mass gain that follows zzso in rats zzso decrease in body mass gain in zzso trained rats compared to zzso decrease in sham operated trained animals, in relation to the respective sedentary zzso but training of zzso animals impaired the zzso of subcutaneous fat zzso Interestingly, swimming training zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso all zzso and BAT type 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in sham operated but not in zzso rats, indicating an impaired zzso and peripheral response to exercise in zzso zzso However, BAT zzso zzso consumption significantly increased by swimming training in both sham and zzso groups, indicating that zzso BAT zzso responds normally to exercise zzso but does not result in a significant reduction of body zzso In conclusion, increased body mass gain produced by zzso is not completely impaired by 8 weeks of high intensity physical training, showing that these animals sustain higher rate of body mass gain independent of being submitted to higher energy zzso
