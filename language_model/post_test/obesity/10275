Complex biological systems are best modeled as highly zzso fluid systems exhibiting a plasticity that allows them to adapt to a vast array of changing zzso Here we highlight several novel network-based approaches to zzso genetic networks underlying complex zzso These zzso zzso approaches combine large-scale zzso and gene expression results in segregating mouse populations to reconstruct reliable genetic networks underlying complex traits such as disease or drug zzso We apply these novel approaches to one of the most extensive surveys of gene expression studies ever undertaken in whole brain in a segregating mouse zzso More than 23,000 genes were monitored in whole brain samples from more than 300 mice derived from an zzso zzso population and zzso at over 1200 zzso markers zzso spread over the entire zzso We explore the zzso properties of the brain zzso network and highlight different approaches to zzso zzso associations among genes by zzso zzso and expression zzso We demonstrate the utility of these approaches by identifying and zzso zzso brain gene expression traits predicted to respond to a strong expression quantitative trait locus zzso for the zzso zzso 1 gene zzso that zzso with the physical location of this gene (a zzso zzso We identify core functional zzso making up the brain zzso network in mice that are coherent for core biological processes associated with zzso disease traits including obesity and zzso
