zzso is highly associated with insulin resistance and is the biggest risk factor for zzso diabetes zzso The molecular basis of this common syndrome, however, is poorly zzso It has been suggested that zzso necrosis factor zzso is a candidate zzso of insulin resistance in zzso as it is zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso and humans and it blocks the action of insulin in cultured cells and whole zzso To investigate the role of zzso in obesity and insulin resistance, we have generated obese mice with a targeted zzso zzso in the gene zzso zzso and those zzso the two receptors for zzso The absence of zzso resulted in significantly improved insulin sensitivity in both zzso obesity and that resulting for the zzso model of zzso The zzso obese mice had lower levels of circulating free fatty zzso and were protected from the zzso reduction in the insulin zzso zzso in muscle and fat zzso These results indicate that zzso is an important zzso of insulin resistance in obesity through its effects on several important sites of insulin zzso
