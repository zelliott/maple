The phenomenon of zzso pancreatic zzso dysfunction zzso has been very well documented in numerous in zzso experimental systems and has become widely zzso In zzso demonstration of zzso zzso on the other hand, has not been consistently demonstrated, and there remains a lack of consensus regarding the in zzso effects of chronically elevated free fatty acids zzso on zzso zzso Much of the disagreement relates to how insulin zzso is zzso in zzso and in particular whether insulin zzso is assessed in relation to whole body insulin sensitivity, which is clearly reduced by elevated zzso By correcting for changes in in zzso insulin sensitivity, we and others have shown that prolonged zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso animal models and humans with a positive family history of type 2 diabetes are more susceptible to this zzso whereas those with severe impairment of zzso function (such as individuals with type 2 zzso demonstrate no additional impairment of zzso function when zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso the combined zzso toxicity of elevated zzso and zzso has been zzso demonstrated in zzso and in some animal studies but not in humans, perhaps because there are limitations in zzso raising plasma zzso to sufficiently high levels for prolonged periods of zzso We and others have shown that therapies directed toward diminishing zzso stress and zzso stress have the potential to reduce zzso zzso dysfunction in animals and zzso In conclusion, zzso pancreatic zzso dysfunction is likely to be one contributor to the complex array of genetic and zzso insults that result in the relentless decline in pancreatic zzso function in those destined to develop type 2 diabetes, and mechanisms involved in this zzso are promising therapeutic zzso
