Individual cells must carefully regulate their energy flux to ensure zzso levels are adequate to maintain normal cellular zzso The same principle holds in zzso zzso Thus, for zzso to perform necessary zzso functions, sufficient nutrients need to be zzso It is more complex, however, to understand how the energy status of different cells impacts on the overall energy balance of the entire zzso We propose that the central nervous system is the critical organ for the coordination of zzso zzso processes that are essential to guarantee energy zzso at the zzso zzso In particular, we suggest that in specific zzso zzso zzso zzso fuel sensors, such as zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso target of zzso zzso integrate sensory input from zzso including those derived from recently zzso food or those that are stored in zzso zzso to regulate zzso pathways responsible for fuel intake and zzso The zzso to this hypothesis is that zzso of these zzso mechanisms in the brain may contribute to zzso zzso underlying diseases, such as obesity and type 2 zzso
