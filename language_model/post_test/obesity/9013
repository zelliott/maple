The aim of the study was to examine an association between the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and blood pressure values assessed by zzso ambulatory blood pressure monitoring zzso in obese patients with long-lasting type II zzso Two hundred and zzso obese patients (95 men and 119 zzso with above 10-year history of type II diabetes were recruited for the zzso In all the patients, zzso was performed and other zzso including age, body mass index zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso serum lipids and zzso were also zzso The zzso zzso was zzso by zzso chain zzso zzso length zzso Two zzso of patients were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Ala zzso carriers zzso zzso The studied groups were not different when age, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and frequency of hypertension were zzso A similar ratio of patients from both groups were treated with zzso zzso zzso calcium channel blockers, zzso zzso and zzso A difference was observed in a mean zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a mean night time zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blood pressure, which was significantly higher in patients with Ala zzso There was also a trend towards a higher mean daytime zzso blood pressure in this zzso It seems that the zzso zzso is associated with an increased mean zzso zzso blood pressure in obese diabetic zzso Different reaction for zzso medication depending on a zzso of the zzso gene should also be considered as a possible cause of the presented zzso
