To investigate zzso zzso receptors gamma 2 zzso gamma 2) zzso and its association with obesity or diabetes in Chinese zzso 

zzso weight zzso and overweight and obese zzso were included in this study, according to zzso 103 subjects had normal zzso zzso 50 had impaired zzso zzso and 78 had diabetes zzso according to WHO zzso for Diagnosis of Diabetes zzso We evaluated these subjects for the zzso zzso in the zzso gene using zzso zzso length zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso gamma 2 in overweight and obese subjects zzso zzso zzso were not significantly different from those in normal weight group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both in overweight and obese group and normal weight group, the zzso of zzso had lower plasma zzso as compared with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso were not different among Chinese subjects with normal zzso tolerance zzso zzso zzso those with impaired zzso tolerance zzso zzso zzso and those with diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In these three groups, the zzso of zzso had lower plasma zzso as compared with the zzso of zzso only in impaired zzso tolerance group the difference was not significant zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso in zzso gamma 2 was not associated with either diabetes or zzso The zzso gamma 2 Ala zzso may be involved in the expression of zzso and insulin zzso
