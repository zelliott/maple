The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the zzso of stroke after zzso zzso bypass was lower than that after zzso zzso zzso 

A prospective study was performed with consecutive patients who underwent isolated zzso bypass in the zzso Hospital Group between July 1, 1996 and December 31, 2001 zzso bypass was defined as coronary artery bypass requiring zzso zzso onto the ascending zzso The patients were divided into two groups, depending on the use of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso data were zzso collected and the risk factors for zzso stroke were zzso 

zzso zzso were more frequent in the zzso zzso The number of zzso zzso was not significantly different but the number of zzso zzso was significantly greater in the zzso group than in the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso stroke was zzso in the zzso group and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso risk factors influencing the occurrence of zzso stroke zzso use of zzso zzso age over 75, peripheral vascular disease, zzso vein use, and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the use of zzso zzso age over 75, and peripheral vascular disease were isolated zzso of zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso stroke was lower in the zzso group than in the zzso group, even though the side clamp was applied to the ascending zzso for zzso zzso The use of side clamping for zzso zzso bypass does not increase the risk of zzso zzso
