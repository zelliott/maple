The purpose of the present study was to compare tissue zzso capacity, skeletal muscle fatty acid zzso and tissue fuel stores in low-fat fed zzso zzso of energy from corn zzso male zzso rats, and in high-fat fed zzso of energy from corn zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso male zzso zzso zzso of zzso and OR rats was based on body weight gain zzso zzso for zzso lower zzso for zzso after 5 weeks on the high-fat zzso Body weight gain over the zzso dietary period was 91 zzso 9 g in zzso 98 zzso 4 g in zzso and 158 zzso 5 g in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Energy intake over the zzso dietary period was zzso zzso 101 zzso in zzso zzso zzso 51 zzso in zzso and zzso zzso 45 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso activity zzso in the zzso muscle was not significantly different among groups: zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in OR and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso activity in the heart, zzso zzso zzso and liver, zzso zzso zzso was also not significantly different among zzso zzso acid composition of the zzso muscle was not significantly different among zzso zzso zzso levels in the liver, zzso muscle, and heart were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
