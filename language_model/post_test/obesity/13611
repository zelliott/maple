This study aimed to explore the relationship among insulin resistance zzso zzso injury, zzso zzso zzso activity zzso and bone zzso in the presence of zzso 

zzso obesity treated with vitamin D, and obesity treated with zzso zzso D zzso were studied in animal models using aged zzso zzso zzso infusion rates zzso levels of urinary zzso zzso serum zzso D zzso serum zzso D zzso and bone mineral density zzso in zzso zzso and zzso bone were zzso 

zzso in obese rats zzso A negative correlation existed between zzso level and zzso in the aged obese rats, which did not exist in the normal control zzso zzso of serum zzso in all models were zzso zzso rats had lower levels of serum zzso and zzso than normal control zzso Treating obese rats with vitamin D had no effect on levels of serum zzso serum zzso and zzso Administration of zzso to obese rats significantly increased serum zzso to zzso levels and zzso to normal zzso In obese rats, levels of serum zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso bone were positively correlated with zzso and the level of serum zzso was zzso correlated with the zzso zzso 

In the presence of zzso zzso zzso injury, decrease in zzso and bone loss zzso zzso kidney accounts for a decrease in zzso which is a zzso factor for bone zzso
