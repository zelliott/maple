zzso and zzso have opposing effects on some zzso zzso Thus, the zzso to zzso balance may be as important as the individual hormones in determining the biological interaction between zzso sex hormones and zzso factors such as zzso and zzso We tested this hypothesis by evaluating the zzso zzso association of sex hormones and zzso to zzso ratios with serum zzso and zzso in older men and zzso zzso 

zzso 

A total of zzso community dwelling men and zzso women aged zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and sex hormone zzso 

zzso and zzso levels were higher in women than men zzso zzso In both zzso zzso zzso were lower, and zzso levels higher, with increasing zzso and waist zzso (all P zzso Although the ratio of total testosterone to total zzso was significantly associated with both zzso in both zzso the strongest and most consistent zzso associations were observed when the zzso to zzso ratio was expressed as total testosterone to zzso zzso In linear zzso the testosterone to zzso zzso ratio was positively related to zzso and zzso related to zzso with nearly identical standardized zzso for men and women (all P zzso The strength of the hormone zzso associations was reduced, but not zzso after adjustment for age, zzso and cardiovascular disease risk factors, including insulin zzso 

The striking similarity of the hormone zzso associations for men and women, despite wide differences in sex hormone and zzso levels, suggests these results reflect underlying zzso mechanisms common to both zzso
