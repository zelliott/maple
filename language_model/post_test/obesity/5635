We performed this study to investigate whether zzso and zzso zzso are able to regulate zzso free zzso zzso zzso in zzso from healthy and obese zzso Twenty-six zzso men zzso healthy and 12 zzso were enrolled in the zzso We measured zzso plasma zzso insulin, zzso and zzso zzso zzso at the baseline and after stimulation with zzso or zzso was measured by fluorescent probe zzso In zzso from healthy subjects, zzso stimulation by zzso led to a zzso decrease in zzso zzso 245 zzso 39 zzso zzso 5 zzso 109 zzso 27 zzso p zzso zzso 10 zzso 77 zzso 26 zzso p zzso while no significant change in zzso zzso zzso was detected in obese zzso Furthermore, the zzso with zzso (10 zzso and zzso zzso zzso completely abated the effect of zzso on zzso in zzso from healthy zzso Analysis of the time course for zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso loss induced by zzso (10 zzso was zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso was able to produce a significant rise in zzso in zzso from healthy individuals zzso 234 zzso 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso 594 zzso 44 zzso p zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso 56 zzso p zzso while no such finding was zzso in zzso from obese zzso When zzso from healthy subjects were zzso with zzso (5 zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso effect of the zzso zzso was completely zzso The time course of zzso (5 zzso effect on zzso zzso showed that the zzso effect of zzso was zzso In conclusion, zzso the stimulation of zzso zzso by zzso is able to induce a significant zzso and zzso fall in zzso zzso zzso the stimulation of zzso by zzso lead to a zzso zzso and zzso rise in zzso zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso and zzso stimulation is not zzso in obese subjects, in whom is probably present a reduced sensitivity to the zzso effect of zzso zzso
