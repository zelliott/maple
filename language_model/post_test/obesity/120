In order to assess zzso zzso interactions in man, we have developed a zzso zzso for zzso and T4 in zzso nuclear extracts from circulating zzso zzso This zzso zzso the technique of salt zzso to isolate nuclear receptors and employs standard zzso analysis for zzso and T4 to determine zzso binding capacity zzso and equilibrium zzso zzso zzso We have determined that 11 normal subjects had a zzso for zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso zzso X zzso zzso the T4 zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA and the zzso was zzso zzso zzso X zzso zzso zzso patients had a mean zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA and a mean T4 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso less than zzso compared to zzso zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso had a zzso fed zzso that was zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA for zzso zzso less than zzso compared to zzso and was zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA for T4 zzso less than zzso compared to zzso During zzso the average zzso zzso increased to zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA and the average T4 zzso increased to zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA, values that are both significantly higher than those in the fed zzso the zzso zzso were zzso in obese subjects zzso to zzso in fed and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso M zzso was employed to ascertain if the zzso properties of the zzso zzso human cell zzso were similar to those previously observed in rat and human liver and kidney zzso The zzso profile obtained was similar to that reported zzso The major binding activity has an estimated zzso radius of 35 A and a molecular weight ratio of approximately 50,000 zzso These studies indicate that: 1) high affinity zzso and T4 receptors exist in human zzso cells and have properties similar to those for zzso and T4 described previously in rat zzso 2) zzso and T4 zzso number tends to increase in zzso subjects and tend to be lower in obese patients than in normal weight control zzso 3) zzso is associated with an increase in both zzso and T4 zzso and 4) despite their apparent zzso zzso zzso receptors in rat liver and human zzso cells may be regulated differently, at least during zzso since zzso zzso receptors decrease in the zzso zzso zzso these observations support the concept that human white cell zzso nuclear zzso binding is capable of rapid zzso suggesting a mechanism for zzso regulation of zzso zzso
