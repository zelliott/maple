zzso and obesity in young people are assessed by comparing body mass index zzso with a reference zzso However, two widely used reference standards, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention zzso and the World Health Organization zzso growth curves, have different definitions of overweight and zzso thus affecting estimates of zzso We compared the associations between overweight and obesity as defined by each of these zzso and the presence of zzso risk zzso 

We obtained data from a zzso study involving zzso boys and girls aged 9, 13 and 16 years in zzso zzso We calculated zzso zzso using the zzso and WHO growth zzso and compared their abilities to detect zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and insulin, and zzso and zzso blood pressure using receiver operating characteristic curves, sensitivity, specificity and zzso zzso 

The zzso scores for zzso using the WHO growth zzso were higher than those using the zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso for all zzso The WHO and zzso growth zzso generated virtually identical receiver operating characteristic zzso for individual or combined zzso risk zzso The definitions of overweight and obesity had low sensitivities but adequate zzso for zzso zzso zzso as defined by the WHO or zzso growth zzso zzso zzso risk similarly, but overweight as defined by the WHO zzso had marginally higher sensitivities (by zzso and lower zzso (by zzso than the zzso zzso 

The WHO growth zzso show no significant zzso advantage over the zzso growth zzso in detecting zzso abnormalities in children aged zzso zzso
