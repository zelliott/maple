zzso evidence suggests that the broadly acting zzso zzso zzso factor is associated with visceral zzso the zzso syndrome, diabetes and exerts beneficial effects on zzso To further zzso the relationship between zzso zzso factor and zzso zzso characteristic of zzso we examined the effect of pronounced weight loss on serum levels of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso severely obese adults were examined before and 18 months after zzso zzso zzso fat distribution was determined by zzso zzso parameters by standard methods, zzso zzso and serum zzso zzso factor levels by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso surgery resulted in a mean body mass index zzso reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso improvements in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso factor serum levels decreased from a median zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis, relative change in zzso zzso factor levels was significantly associated with change in weight, zzso fat mass, visceral fat diameter, insulin, zzso model for insulin resistance, zzso and zzso levels (all zzso zzso P zzso No associations were observed for zzso zzso zzso or zzso necrosis factor zzso After adjustment for age, sex and smoking status, associations remained zzso 

The beneficial effects of zzso zzso pronounced weight loss on zzso zzso may partially be attributable to visceral zzso tissue reduction and zzso decreasing zzso zzso factor zzso
