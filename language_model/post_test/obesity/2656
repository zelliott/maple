zzso is a risk factor for knee zzso Total knee zzso is the definitive surgical treatment of this zzso zzso a high percentage of subjects treated are zzso Since 2000 in the zzso Region the Register of zzso zzso zzso zzso has recorded data of all the primary and revision operations performed on the zzso height and weight of patients at the time of surgery have also been zzso 

To understand how overweight and obesity affect the outcome of knee zzso a population of subjects treated with cemented total knee zzso between 2000 and 2005 was zzso zzso knee zzso were implanted in zzso zzso zzso of the patients were normal weight, zzso were overweight zzso zzso Mass Index zzso zzso zzso were obese (30 zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso obese zzso zzso Mean and range of follow-up were respectively zzso and zzso zzso zzso failure was defined as the exchange of at least one component for whatever zzso 

In normal weight patients there were 36 failures out of zzso implants zzso in overweight patients there were 87 out of zzso zzso in obese 59 out of zzso zzso and in zzso obese there were 4 out of zzso zzso The mean time to failure for each class was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cox zzso analyses showed that the risk of implant failure was not influenced by zzso absolute body weight, or zzso zzso an increased failure risk was observed in mobile zzso zzso in comparison with those with a fixed zzso zzso zzso zzso an increased failure risk was also related to age zzso zzso zzso per zzso These results were also confirmed when considering septic loosening as the zzso There were no differences in the rate of zzso complications and death in the 4 classes of zzso 

In conclusion, cemented knee zzso implanted in patients with arthritis do not have significantly different rates of survival or zzso complications in obese subjects compared with normal weight subjects, at least up to 5 years after zzso The conclusion also applies to subjects affected by zzso zzso although this findings should be regarded with caution due to the small sample zzso
