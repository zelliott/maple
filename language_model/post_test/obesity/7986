zzso balloons have been proposed to induce weight loss in obese zzso The consequences of the balloon on gastric physiology remain poorly zzso We studied the influence of an zzso balloon on gastric zzso in obese zzso 

12 patients were included in the study, with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The balloon was inserted under light zzso and zzso control, inflated with 700 zzso zzso and removed 6 months zzso Body weight and gastric zzso zzso and T zzso using zzso acid breath test were monitored before balloon placement, during its zzso and 2 months after zzso 

Mean weight loss was: zzso zzso zzso zzso after one month; zzso zzso zzso zzso after 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after 6 months and zzso zzso zzso zzso two months after zzso zzso zzso zzso rates were significantly decreased in the first periods with balloon in place, and returned to zzso values after balloon zzso zzso was: 87 zzso 32 zzso before zzso zzso 181 zzso 91 zzso after 1 month, 145 zzso 99 zzso after 3 months, 104 zzso 50 zzso after 6 months and 90 zzso 43 zzso 2 months after zzso T lag was 36 zzso 18 zzso before zzso zzso 102 zzso 82 zzso after 1 month, 77 zzso 53 zzso after 3 months, 59 zzso 28 zzso after 6 months and 40 zzso 21 zzso 2 months after zzso 

zzso in obese patients seems to be a good help in following the zzso caloric diet, especially during the first three months when the gastric zzso is slower and the sense of zzso is zzso After this period gastric zzso starts to return to normal and the stomach adapts to zzso zzso efficacy in weight zzso
