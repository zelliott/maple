To assess the risk factors for symptomatic zzso zzso women in the zzso Health Study cohort (age range, 34 to 59 zzso were followed for four years after completing a detailed questionnaire about food and alcohol intake in zzso A total of 433 zzso and 179 cases of newly zzso zzso zzso diagnosed by zzso examination or zzso films, were reported during the four-year zzso The zzso relative risk for very obese women, who had a zzso index of relative weight zzso in zzso divided by the square of the height in zzso of more than 32 zzso per square meter, was zzso (95 percent confidence zzso zzso to zzso as compared with women whose relative weight was less than 20 zzso per square zzso For slightly overweight women zzso weight, 24 to zzso zzso per square zzso the relative risk was zzso (95 percent confidence zzso zzso to zzso Overall, we observed a roughly linear relation between relative weight and the risk of zzso Among the zzso women whose relative weight was less than 25 zzso per square meter, a high energy intake zzso than zzso J per zzso as compared with a low energy intake (less than zzso J per zzso was associated with an increased zzso of symptomatic zzso zzso risk, zzso 95 percent confidence zzso zzso to zzso and an alcohol intake of at least 5 g per day was associated with a decreased zzso as compared with abstention zzso risk, zzso 95 percent confidence zzso zzso to zzso Parity did not appear to be an important risk factor after an adjustment was made for relative zzso These data support a strong association between obesity and symptomatic zzso and suggest that even moderate overweight may increase the zzso
