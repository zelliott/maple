zzso zzso were zzso from zzso mice, loaded for 2 h with zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and calcium zzso in the loading zzso increased zzso in the zzso medium resulted in reduced amounts of zzso in the zzso A zzso zzso of zzso zzso was also evident when the specific zzso of the zzso approached that of the labeling zzso indicating that the effect was not simply due to zzso zzso The depression of zzso zzso diminished after culture of the zzso in a zzso medium and it was absent in zzso taken from mice zzso for the gene zzso The zzso effect became less pronounced when 50 zzso zzso an inhibitor of the calcium inward zzso was added to the zzso zzso medium and abolished in the presence of 20 zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso observed is not necessarily due to a direct zzso interaction with the outward calcium transport but may also result from stimulation of the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso
