The zzso of growth hormone zzso is impaired in the genetically obese zzso rat where zzso gene expression and plasma zzso levels are depressed; however, the underlying mechanism of this zzso remains zzso We have evaluated the potential zzso role of zzso zzso hormone zzso and zzso zzso gene expression in the onset of the decreased zzso zzso levels by studying both zzso and zzso zzso and zzso levels in obese and lean rats at 5 weeks of age when the decrease in zzso zzso is first zzso At that age both zzso content and zzso zzso were significantly reduced in obese rats as compared to lean zzso zzso zzso content was also decreased in obese rats, but zzso zzso levels did not zzso Since zzso is capable of stimulating zzso gene zzso the decreased zzso zzso level could be a critical factor in causing the zzso in zzso gene expression and zzso diminution of circulating plasma zzso
