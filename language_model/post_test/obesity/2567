zzso policies have been zzso as potential policy instruments to address the increasing prevalence of zzso This article examines whether altering the cost of zzso zzso foods, compared with healthy, zzso foods through the use of fiscal pricing zzso or zzso policy instruments would, in fact, change food consumption patterns and overall diet enough to significantly reduce zzso weight zzso 

This article examined empirical evidence regarding the food and restaurant price sensitivity of weight outcomes based on a literature search to identify zzso English-language articles published between 1990 and zzso Studies were identified from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso search combinations used the terms zzso body mass index, and zzso each in combination with the terms price, prices, tax, zzso and zzso 

The studies reviewed showed that when statistically significant associations were found between food and restaurant prices zzso and weight zzso the effects were generally small in zzso although in some cases they were larger for zzso status zzso populations and for those at risk for overweight or zzso 

The limited existing evidence suggests that small taxes or subsidies are not likely to produce significant changes in zzso or obesity prevalence but that zzso pricing interventions may have some measurable effects on Americans' weight zzso particularly for children and zzso zzso zzso and those most at risk for zzso Additional research is needed to be able to draw strong policy conclusions regarding the effectiveness of zzso interventions aimed at reducing zzso
