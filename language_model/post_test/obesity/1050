Little is known about how the intensity of exercise influences cardiovascular fitness and body zzso especially in obese zzso 

Our goal was to determine the effects of physical training intensity on the cardiovascular zzso percentage of body fat zzso and visceral zzso tissue zzso of obese zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were assigned to 1) biweekly lifestyle education zzso 2) zzso + zzso physical training, or 3) zzso + high-intensity physical zzso The intervention lasted 8 zzso Physical training was offered 5 zzso and the target energy expenditure for all subjects in physical training groups was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fitness was measured with a zzso treadmill test, zzso with zzso X-ray zzso and zzso with magnetic resonance zzso 

The increase in cardiovascular fitness in the high-intensity physical training group, but not in the zzso group, was significantly greater than that in the zzso alone group zzso zzso zzso no other comparisons of the 3 groups were zzso Compared with the zzso alone group, a group composed of subjects in both physical training groups combined who attended training zzso zzso showed favorable changes in cardiovascular fitness zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We found no evidence that the high-intensity physical training was more effective than the zzso physical training in enhancing body zzso 

The cardiovascular fitness of obese adolescents was significantly improved by physical training, especially high-intensity physical zzso The physical training also reduced both visceral and zzso zzso but there was no clear effect of the intensity of physical zzso
