To investigate the association of zzso body mass index zzso zzso with outcomes of zzso cancer in patients treated with zzso zzso 

All zzso patients diagnosed with zzso cancer and treated with zzso zzso to a dose of 60 zzso or higher were zzso zzso Body weight was measured both at entry and at the end of zzso zzso survival zzso overall survival zzso zzso control zzso and distant zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The median follow-up was zzso zzso 

Patients with lower zzso zzso were statistically significantly associated with poorer zzso and zzso than those with higher zzso zzso There was no significant difference between zzso zzso groups in terms of zzso and zzso Body weight loss zzso during radiation did not influence survival zzso However, in the group with higher zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso survival of patients with less zzso during radiation were statistically longer when compared with greater zzso 

This study demonstrates that higher zzso zzso positively influenced survival outcomes for patients with zzso zzso Patients with higher zzso zzso who were able to maintain their weight during radiation had significantly better survival than patients with greater zzso
