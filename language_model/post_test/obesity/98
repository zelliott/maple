zzso The effect of insulin upon zzso transport and metabolism in zzso muscles of genetically obese zzso and zzso lean zzso rats was investigated at 5-6 weeks and zzso weeks of zzso zzso strips of zzso muscles were used rather than the intact muscle in order to circumvent problems of diffusion of zzso zzso In younger obese rats zzso weeks), plasma zzso of zzso insulin were twice those of controls, whereas their circulating zzso zzso were zzso zzso effects upon zzso zzso and zzso metabolism by zzso muscles of these rats were characterized by both a decreased sensitivity and a decrease in the zzso response of this tissue to the zzso zzso In older obese rats zzso weeks), circulating zzso of insulin and zzso were both zzso zzso A decrease of zzso in zzso capacity to muscles of obese rats was zzso The zzso muscles from the older obese animals also displayed decreased sensitivity and zzso response to zzso However, at a low insulin concentration zzso zzso zzso by muscles of older obese rats was zzso but such a concentration was ineffective in stimulating zzso incorporation into zzso and zzso metabolism by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by muscle was calculated from the zzso of zzso consumption, and zzso zzso to zzso The rate of zzso of fatty acids was normal in muscles of younger obese animals, but increased in those of the older obese zzso Increased zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found in muscles of older obese rats and may reflect zzso zzso of zzso metabolism as a result of increased zzso zzso zzso Thus several abnormalities are responsible for insulin resistance of muscles from obese zzso rats among which we have observed decreased insulin zzso decreased zzso transport and increased zzso of zzso fatty acid which could inhibit zzso zzso
