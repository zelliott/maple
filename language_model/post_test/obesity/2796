zzso zzso as a presenting symptom of zzso zzso leukemia zzso zzso has never been reported in zzso Similarly, precursor zzso is characteristically negative for zzso We report the first case of a patient with precursor zzso who presented with zzso zzso and zzso tumor expression of zzso 

42 year old male presented with zzso zzso zzso pale stools, dark urine and about 35 pound weight loss over the previous 3 zzso The initial laboratory work was suggestive of zzso zzso zzso elevated zzso zzso zzso and CA zzso zzso zzso were also zzso The CT scan of abdomen showed massive zzso with coarse zzso with contracted zzso zzso and normal sized common zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a zzso mass with zzso zzso CT scan of the chest showed anterior zzso mass (16 zzso zzso 10 zzso CT guided biopsy of the mass showed zzso zzso with diffuse proliferation of medium sized zzso zzso The zzso cells were positive for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso expression of zzso PET CT scan again showed a large anterior zzso mass with diffuse liver involvement and abnormal activity in zzso zzso CT guided liver biopsy and bone zzso biopsy revealed the same zzso and zzso Bone zzso zzso showed zzso zzso Thus, the diagnosis of precursor zzso was made and zzso with elevated CA zzso were attributed to zzso zzso 

Our case illustrates an unusual presentation of zzso zzso as zzso zzso It also indicates the zzso nature of CA zzso for zzso zzso It is the first case report of zzso precursor T cell zzso with unusual expression of zzso zzso biopsy with thorough zzso is required to differentiate precursor zzso from zzso and small cell zzso
