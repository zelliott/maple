zzso behavioral treatment has been shown to be an effective intervention for the management of pediatric zzso The goal of this study was to compare the zzso of two protocols for the delivery of zzso behavioral zzso 

Thirty-one families with obese children were zzso to groups in which families were provided mixed treatment incorporating both group and individualized treatment vs group treatment zzso zzso of treatment was defined as the magnitude of reduction in standardized zzso and percentage overweight per dollar spent for recruitment and zzso zzso data were assessed at zzso 6 months and 12 months zzso 

zzso for the 24 families with complete data showed the group intervention was significantly more cost-effective than the mixed zzso This was due to the similarity between the two groups in zzso or percentage overweight change for children and their parents, while the mixed treatment was significantly more expensive to deliver than the group zzso 

These findings suggest that a zzso behavioral intervention employing group treatment alone is a more cost-effective approach to treating pediatric obesity than a mixed group plus individual zzso
