For the past two decades, the dominant methods to identify zzso genes of complex disease were linkage analysis and association zzso zzso analysis usually identifies broad zzso which can zzso dozens to hundreds of candidate zzso Transition from quantitative trait zzso to gene has been a challenge due to the absence of complete functional information for the majority of genes in this zzso locus and limited knowledge of the link between gene function and zzso Recently, zzso biology tools that employ information extracted from public online databases have been zzso In this review, we introduced principles of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and Endeavor, then used the prediction of zzso genes for type 2 diabetes zzso and osteoporosis as examples to zzso the application of zzso biology strategies, and finally discuss the limitations and prospects of these zzso
