Studies were carried out on cholesterol metabolism in 11 zzso patients and 16 obese patients with zzso and 13 with zzso The patients underwent several investigations under zzso ward zzso zzso patients usually had an increase in low density zzso zzso Several mechanisms may have combined to cause a high zzso For instance, the obese zzso patients had an increase in cholesterol zzso zzso of cholesterol also was increased zzso However, other mechanisms not explored in this study probably contributed to most of the fall in zzso Treatment of zzso patients produced the expected fall in zzso One possible mechanism could be that zzso hormones enhance the conversion of cholesterol into zzso zzso this mechanism has been suggested by other workers from animal zzso However, no evidence was obtained in either zzso or zzso patients that zzso hormones alter synthesis of zzso zzso On the other hand, the hormones appeared to increase the synthesis of zzso Patients with zzso frequently had zzso zzso The cause was mostly an enhanced zzso of zzso cholesterol associated with a tendency to obesity and increased synthesis of zzso In contrast, the usually thin zzso patients did not have zzso zzso The studies show that zzso hormones a) influence zzso by an action on the zzso of zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso or zzso b) stimulate synthesis of zzso and c) affect zzso zzso metabolism in large part by influencing energy balance and cholesterol zzso
