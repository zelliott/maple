A mathematical model of steady state insulin metabolism was developed to predict the effects of blood flow changes upon zzso zzso insulin zzso In addition to blood flows to major zzso and zzso the model includes representations for insulin feedback regulation of zzso insulin clearance and pancreatic insulin zzso Within the range of insulin sensitivities assumed for zzso and pancreatic feedback regulation and the range of initial insulin zzso rates zzso the model predicts that the zzso zzso insulin concentration rises by up to 20 zzso per zzso as portal blood flow zzso The necessary zzso in portal blood flow lie well inside the range of increased total zzso blood flow observed in obese zzso The results of this study suggest that a significant portion of the zzso in zzso insulin zzso seen in obesity may be the result of increased portal blood flow and that other clinical observations and zzso changes that accompany obesity may also be related to altered portal zzso
