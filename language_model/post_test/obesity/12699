zzso rehabilitation and exercise training improve prognosis following major cardiac events, partly by improving coronary risk factors, including plasma zzso Only limited data are available to define zzso of zzso improvements following aggressive zzso therapy with cardiac zzso 

We studied 237 consecutive patients from two institutions who were enrolled in zzso phase 2 cardiac rehabilitation and exercise zzso By zzso and multivariable zzso we assessed the impact of numerous clinical zzso including indexes of zzso age, zzso zzso zzso exercise capacity, and psychological factors, on improvements in plasma zzso values with cardiac zzso 

zzso risk factors improved following cardiac rehabilitation, including levels of zzso zzso cholesterol zzso P zzso zzso zzso cholesterol zzso P zzso and zzso zzso P zzso body mass index zzso P zzso percentage of body fat zzso P zzso and exercise capacity zzso P zzso By both zzso and multivariable zzso corresponding zzso baseline values were the strongest zzso of improvements in levels of zzso zzso cholesterol zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso cholesterol zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso By multivariable zzso reductions in body mass index zzso zzso zzso P zzso and older age zzso zzso zzso P zzso were strong independent zzso of reduction in zzso values following cardiac zzso However, low baseline zzso values were independently associated with improvements in both zzso and zzso zzso cholesterol zzso Using a model incorporating 13 clinical zzso improvements in zzso values with cardiac rehabilitation were only modestly predictable with the variables zzso accounting for only zzso to zzso of the improvements in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso risk factors markedly improved following cardiac rehabilitation and exercise zzso zzso zzso in zzso values are modestly zzso zzso Those patients with the worst baseline zzso values had the most improvements in zzso values following cardiac zzso However, patients with combined zzso and low levels of zzso zzso cholesterol are likely to require drug zzso
