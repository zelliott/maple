zzso may explain the newly established association of obesity with zzso zzso zzso This study investigated if zzso levels in zzso patients differed from healthy controls and their potential effect in the development of zzso 

zzso was used to determine serum zzso levels of 65 zzso patients and 165 healthy zzso The expressions of zzso protein in the tumor and adjacent zzso parts were examined by the zzso zzso Cell proliferation zzso were used to assess the zzso of zzso in two human liver cancer cell zzso 

zzso zzso levels were significantly higher in the zzso patients than the zzso zzso correlations of serum zzso levels with serum zzso levels and insulin resistance were found in the controls, but not in the zzso zzso In contrast, serum zzso levels significantly correlated with serum zzso and alkaline zzso levels in the zzso patients, but this trend was not observed in the zzso The expression pattern of zzso protein between the paired tumor and adjacent zzso zzso significantly correlated with tumor zzso In zzso zzso increased cell proliferation in a zzso zzso 

Increased zzso expressions were found in zzso and this increase might contribute to tumor zzso
