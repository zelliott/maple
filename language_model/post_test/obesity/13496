Recently, zzso was identified as a candidate gene contributing to both childhood and severe adult zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso expression of zzso and/or of the zzso zzso in zzso tissue zzso with measures of obesity and fat zzso We also investigated whether the zzso obesity risk zzso might explain zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

In paired samples of visceral and subcutaneous zzso tissue from 55 lean and obese participants, we investigated whether zzso and zzso zzso expression is fat zzso altered in obesity and related to measures of fat zzso insulin sensitivity and zzso zzso All participants were zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso expression was zzso higher in subcutaneous than in visceral zzso zzso zzso zzso expression correlated with visceral zzso zzso zzso gene expression in both zzso correlated with age and was zzso correlated to zzso and per cent body zzso zzso zzso levels were not related to measures of insulin sensitivity and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso higher in visceral than in subcutaneous zzso zzso but did not correlate with zzso and zzso zzso There was no association between zzso and zzso or zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso tissue zzso zzso is fat zzso and zzso zzso with measures of zzso However, the direction of this relationship still needs to be zzso
