We assessed the effect of zzso brown zzso tissue zzso zzso on dietary obesity in adult female zzso zzso In rats maintained for 32 days on an zzso regimen, BAT zzso produced significant reductions in food intake zzso zzso zzso zzso weight gain zzso zzso zzso zzso and carcass fat zzso zzso zzso A zzso of zzso consuming as many calories as controls zzso zzso failed to gain more weight zzso zzso or accumulate more fat zzso than zzso In rats developing obesity for 32 days followed by 8 days on laboratory zzso weight change was unaffected by zzso during either weight gain zzso zzso zzso g for zzso or weight loss zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as was carcass fat zzso zzso zzso BAT zzso zzso was unchanged in zzso obese rats and those recovering from zzso We did not, therefore, find evidence that under these experimental conditions sympathetic zzso of BAT countered obesity during overconsumption or contributed to recovery from zzso
