This zzso zzso study was performed to examine the hypothesis that if conventional zzso head zzso is applied, zzso is more difficult for patients with zzso chest diameter zzso zzso zzso outside the average range zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso zzso diameter at the zzso notch were measured zzso All patients were placed on a surgical bed with an zzso zzso zzso During zzso the zzso view was graded by use of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was defined as a grade 3 or 4 zzso 

zzso was observed for 49 patients zzso zzso zzso between measured chest zzso diameter for each patient and the calculated median value were used for statistical zzso In zzso analysis, the difference between chest zzso diameter and the median value was significantly related to zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed that the difference between chest zzso diameter and the median value was an independent predictor of zzso zzso ratio, zzso 95 % confidence zzso zzso p zzso zzso operating characteristic curve analysis showed that this test with a test threshold of zzso zzso had reasonable diagnostic accuracy zzso under the curve of zzso 

When using a standard pillow size of 7 zzso chest zzso diameter above or below the average range zzso or zzso zzso was a strong predictor of zzso for apparently zzso zzso In such cases, modification of pillow height should be zzso
