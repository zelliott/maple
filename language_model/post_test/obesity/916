To establish a rapid test for zzso syndrome we measured serum cortisol during and following zzso zzso infusion (5 zzso for 5 h from zzso zzso in simple obesity (N zzso zzso and in zzso syndrome (N zzso zzso We had first established that 5 zzso was the lowest dose which consistently lowered serum cortisol in simple zzso In zzso serum zzso ranged from zzso (less than 30) to 48 zzso at zzso less than 30 to 37 at zzso and less than 30 to 38 at zzso h the following zzso zzso cortisol at these three times did not show any overlap between simple obesity and zzso zzso Having established these findings we proceeded to study a group of patients with zzso zzso zzso These patients behaved zzso Their values at zzso and zzso h did not overlap those of zzso zzso However, at zzso zzso 5 of the 7 had values within the range seen in zzso syndrome with a mean of 290 zzso 99 zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso h serum cortisol levels distinguish between zzso syndrome and both simple obesity and zzso zzso zzso However, in the latter, cortisol suppression is less prolonged than in simple zzso This finding may be important for our understanding of the zzso of the zzso
