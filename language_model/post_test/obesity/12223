The relationship between altered zzso interaction in the zzso period of oral zzso tolerance test zzso and impaired zzso zzso zzso was studied in 9 obese zzso They underwent zzso zzso following zzso hour total fast, and the results of blood zzso insulin, growth hormone, zzso zzso and free fatty acids were compared to those of the control zzso Blood zzso values in the zzso period of zzso were higher during the zzso than in the control zzso zzso zzso levels following fast dropped below the control values and four patients showed zzso symptoms of zzso zzso Mean maximum blood zzso irrespective of time was significantly higher, mean zzso zzso lower after fast than in the control experiment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso response following fast was significantly reduced in 0-2 h period with delayed maximum value obtained at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso cortisol response was higher when compared to control, but there was no difference in growth hormone and zzso zzso zzso and zzso values of free fatty acids were significantly higher after fast than in the control zzso The data suggest that zzso impairment of zzso interaction in the zzso period of zzso decreases the ability of obese subjects to maintain zzso zzso zzso and provokes zzso zzso in some of zzso zzso of zzso metabolism in zzso subjects is a convenient experimental model for the investigation of zzso zzso
