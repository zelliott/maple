zzso disorders like diabetes zzso and obesity may compromise the fertility of men and zzso To unveil zzso zzso changes potentially affecting male zzso the zzso of zzso cells from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso obese and clinically healthy individuals were comparatively analyzed by difference gel zzso The adaptation of a general protein extraction procedure to the zzso of proteins from zzso cells allowed for the resolution of zzso fluorescent spots in the difference gel zzso image of the master zzso which contained the entirety of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the pathological and reference zzso by applying an average abundance ratio setting of zzso and a p zzso zzso criterion resulted in the identification of 79 fluorescent spots containing proteins that were present at significantly changed levels in the zzso zzso zzso evaluation of the zzso data followed by mass zzso protein identification revealed altered levels of 12, 71, and 13 protein species in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso obese patients, respectively, with considerably enhanced amounts of the same set of one molecular form of zzso one form of zzso and two forms of zzso in each group of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was the only protein that was detected at decreased levels in all three zzso zzso The former three proteins are part of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein complex, which is thought to fulfill zzso functions, such as zzso zzso protection, zzso regulation and gain of competence for zzso reaction, whereas the putative role of the latter protein to function as a zzso zzso during zzso maturation remains to be explored at the zzso zzso The zzso similar differences detected in the three groups of pathological zzso zzso reflect a zzso enhanced formation of predominantly zzso modified forms of three zzso protein complex zzso possibly as a response to enduring zzso and enhanced zzso zzso
