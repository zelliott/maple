Human obesity is associated with elevated zzso levels and a high risk of death from cardiovascular zzso In the present study, we investigated the effects of zzso on vascular wound healing and zzso zzso growth in zzso 

zzso mice placed on an zzso high-fat diet had elevated zzso zzso levels compared with their counterparts maintained on normal zzso and the former demonstrated significantly enhanced zzso zzso after carotid artery injury with zzso zzso The zzso forming in response to injury strongly expressed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso diet had no effect on injured vessels from zzso zzso mice despite zzso zzso diabetes, and zzso in these zzso Daily administration of zzso to zzso mice during the zzso period after injury reversed this zzso dramatically increasing zzso thickness and the severity of zzso zzso zzso zzso also enhanced zzso growth and increased cellular proliferation in injured arteries from zzso mice but had no effect on vessels from zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our results raise the possibility that there might be a zzso zzso zzso link between the zzso in human obesity and the increased risk for cardiovascular complications associated with this zzso
