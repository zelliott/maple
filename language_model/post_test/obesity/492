zzso soluble zzso zzso zzso has been recently found to be associated zzso with insulin zzso 

To evaluate circulating zzso concentration after changing insulin sensitivity in obese zzso 

zzso zzso concentration was evaluated after zzso weight loss in obese women zzso zzso group, zzso after zzso weight loss plus resistance training zzso group, zzso and after follow-up without weight loss zzso zzso group, zzso 

After 16 weeks, insulin sensitivity zzso zzso Model zzso zzso significantly improved in parallel to weight loss zzso and reduced total fat mass zzso using magnetic resonance zzso in the D zzso zzso muscle mass decreased significantly zzso zzso zzso concentration did not change zzso In the zzso group, weight loss zzso and improvement of insulin sensitivity were of similar zzso zzso muscle mass was preserved zzso zzso zzso concentration decreased significantly zzso Interestingly, higher the thigh muscle volume after weight loss, higher the decrease in circulating zzso zzso We also found that higher the increases in leg force at week 16, higher the decrease in circulating zzso concentration in all individuals as a zzso No significant changes were observed in insulin sensitivity, zzso concentration or thigh muscle mass in the C zzso 

These findings suggest a long-term regulation of serum zzso concentration by zzso improvement of insulin sensitivity in obese zzso
