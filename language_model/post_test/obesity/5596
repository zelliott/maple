To review studies of patterns of food zzso as assessed by diet index, factor analysis or cluster analysis, and their associations with body mass index or obesity zzso 

zzso literature review zzso search with zzso of zzso 

Thirty zzso studies relating food intake patterns to zzso information were identified and zzso Food intake patterns were defined using a diet index, factor or cluster analysis in 12, nine and nine studies, zzso zzso of body mass were made zzso with the diet assessment in all studies, and only in a few cases were the primary outcomes related to zzso 

The food intake patterns identified could, in most factor or cluster analysis studies, be zzso zzso zzso meat, zzso sweet or energy dense zzso zzso vegetables, fruit, whole grain and low-fat zzso or zzso by high alcohol zzso The diet indexes were designed to capture a high diversity and/or food combinations matching the zzso The relationships with zzso were zzso studies found that intake patterns, which we zzso as zzso sweet or energy dense were positively associated with zzso while similar patterns in four other studies were zzso associated with zzso The significant associations between diet index score and zzso were consistently negative, while the associations between factor scores or cluster membership and zzso were less clear in terms of food intake zzso Men and women had similar food intake patterns, but food intake patterns were less often positively associated with zzso in zzso In 11 studies, there were no significant associations between food intake pattern and zzso 

This review showed that no consistent associations could be identified between zzso or zzso and food intake patterns, derived from diet index, factor analysis or cluster zzso However, the zzso of food intake patterns identified by such analyses and the lack of gold standards for the application of these techniques zzso consistent analysis of a relation between food intake patterns and zzso
