To depict the general trends of muscle zzso performance in obese subjects within a wide range of age and body zzso 

zzso study for the measurement of lower limb zzso zzso power output with a modification of the zzso stair climbing test in a large population of obese subjects of both genders within a wide span of age zzso zzso and body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, body composition was also determined by zzso analysis in a representative zzso in order to evaluate the relationships between zzso mass zzso and power zzso 

A total of zzso obese subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso from an Italian population seeking medical support for body weight zzso Within this sample, a consistent zzso of 193 subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso was also selected for accessory study of body zzso 

In general, male subjects developed significantly higher lower limb power output zzso than female subjects zzso both in absolute terms and per unit body zzso In both zzso W was influenced zzso by age zzso and positively by zzso zzso While the effect of age was similar in both zzso zzso had a different positive effect in male and in female subjects, being more zzso in male zzso In the zzso zzso was found to depend both on age and zzso in a fashion comparable with that displayed by zzso The zzso differences in W disappeared when expressed per unit zzso and a significant linear correlation was found between zzso and W, both in male and female subjects zzso zzso 

The lower limb zzso power output is significantly higher in obese male subjects than in female subjects, being zzso influenced by age but positively related to zzso Female subjects appear to be at a greater disadvantage for effect of zzso the major motor limitations being suffered by older women with higher zzso These gender differences in zzso and zzso W changes seem to be related to changes in zzso in the zzso in whom body composition was zzso
