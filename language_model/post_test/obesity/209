Adult obese zzso and lean male mice were fed zzso amounts zzso 20 to 30 per cent of zzso zzso of either a zzso high-fat or zzso diet for three zzso All mice were fed an equal amount of zzso zzso Total body fat, total body nitrogen and zzso nitrogen were measured in separate groups of mice initially and following three weeks of energy zzso zzso mice lost 38 to 75 per cent more body energy than did lean zzso Fat accounted for most of the total energy lost zzso to 95 per zzso zzso mice lost more fat, but less zzso than lean zzso Of the total body protein lost by lean mice, 40 to 50 per cent was from skeletal zzso but obese mice lost very little zzso zzso zzso of the diet fed did not significantly affect losses of body weight, fat or protein in either obese or lean zzso mice fed the zzso diet had heavier zzso and zzso These results suggest that adult obese mice zzso more total energy than lean zzso In addition, loss of body protein during restricted energy intake may be more closely related to remaining body fat stores than to composition of the zzso
