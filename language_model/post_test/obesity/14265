zzso is a negative regulator of zzso protein signaling and promotes zzso zzso Recently, we described a zzso at the zzso locus with the G zzso associated with hypertension in a zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to assess whether the zzso zzso is zzso of overweight in young subjects with grade I zzso We zzso at the zzso zzso locus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso female, zzso zzso zzso white zzso subjects zzso 33 zzso 9 zzso never treated for hypertension and at low cardiovascular zzso Median follow-up was zzso zzso At zzso male patients carrying the zzso zzso zzso had higher body mass index zzso than patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso The frequency of male patients with zzso or zzso 25 was similar between the patients with G zzso and those with zzso zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso not zzso No significant difference between the 2 groups was observed with regard to physical activity, blood pressure, and heart zzso At the end of zzso zzso was higher in male patients with G zzso compared with patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and the frequency of male patients with zzso zzso was greater in the former zzso vs zzso P zzso According to Cox regression, zzso G was a significant predictor of developing overweight or obesity during zzso These zzso relations were not significant in female zzso In young male patients with grade I hypertension, zzso zzso zzso is associated with increased zzso and with greater risk of developing overweight or zzso The zzso zzso zzso may be considered a genetic marker that predicts an zzso predisposition to gaining zzso
