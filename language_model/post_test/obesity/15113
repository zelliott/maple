The zzso project draws on the concept of zzso zzso between policy developers zzso zzso and researchers to deliver a knowledge zzso zzso that maps policy zzso conducts workshops on zzso policy making, supports the development of zzso policy zzso and zzso zzso policy making into zzso zzso zzso of government and nongovernment zzso representatives will be based on potential to: develop policies relevant to zzso reach broad audiences, and commit to zzso staff and building a culture that supports zzso policy zzso zzso will increase awareness of both obesity and policy cycles, as well as develop zzso skills in zzso assessing and applying relevant evidence to policy zzso The zzso team will then support participants to: 1) develop zzso policy zzso that are both commensurate with national and zzso plans and also informed by evidence from the Pacific zzso Prevention in Communities project and elsewhere; and 2) collaborate with participating zzso to zzso zzso policy making structures and zzso This knowledge zzso initiative will be evaluated via data from zzso interviews, a validated self-assessment zzso process zzso and zzso 

Public health interventions have rarely targeted zzso policy making structures and processes to reduce obesity and zzso This study will zzso advance understanding of knowledge zzso processes to extend zzso policy making skills and develop a suite of national zzso policies that can potentially improve population health zzso
