zzso zzso into zzso tissue increases with zzso a condition associated with zzso inflammation and insulin zzso We investigated the direct effects of zzso factors on zzso inflammation and insulin zzso zzso zzso incubated with media zzso by zzso zzso zzso showed dramatically increased zzso of several zzso zzso greater nuclear factor zzso B zzso activity, and enhanced binding of zzso zzso All of these effects were prevented by zzso with zzso an zzso zzso zzso incubated with zzso also released more zzso fatty acids and this increased zzso was not suppressed by zzso In addition, zzso treatment decreased zzso zzso zzso in zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso factors induce inflammatory responses and reduce insulin responsiveness in zzso These effects of zzso factors on zzso may contribute significantly to the systemic inflammation and insulin resistance associated with zzso
