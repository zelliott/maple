zzso regulation of the fatty acid zzso zzso gene by zzso zzso fatty acids and zzso was investigated in zzso and zzso of zzso fatty rats and their lean zzso The sequence spanning zzso zzso to zzso of zzso zzso which is responsive to zzso stimulation zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso was linked to a reporter gene containing a zzso promoter and zzso into rat zzso or zzso The activity of the reporter, zzso zzso in the presence of zzso alone was similar in the primary cultured cells from the lean and obese zzso In the presence of zzso however, zzso zzso activity was markedly increased in zzso of lean rats, but was not significantly increased in those of obese zzso The stimulation by zzso was reduced in zzso zzso cells of lean zzso Similarly, the stimulation by zzso was reduced in zzso cells and in cells from lean rats containing an expression zzso zzso zzso However, neither zzso fatty acids nor zzso cells from obese rats responded to zzso The same effects were observed at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Similar results were seen in zzso although the stimulation and suppression were much smaller than in zzso The zzso capacities of the receptors of liver and zzso tissue were reduced in the presence of zzso or zzso fatty zzso zzso and zzso fatty acids appeared to suppress the insulin stimulation of zzso zzso by reducing the zzso capacities of zzso zzso zzso on the zzso response element of zzso gene and suppressed the zzso
