zzso obesity is zzso by zzso and insulin zzso a trend toward zzso zzso zzso of zzso axis and zzso of zzso zzso zzso It has been hypothesized that treatment with zzso zzso and zzso zzso could counteract those zzso zzso Thus, we studied the effects of zzso treatment with zzso or zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and hormonal variables zzso zzso zzso testosterone, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as on blood pressure in 28 zzso patients with abdominal obesity zzso 3 M, 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in M and zzso zzso All patients were on balanced zzso diet zzso zzso Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with zzso zzso 500 zzso twice daily zzso or zzso zzso 15 zzso zzso daily zzso or zzso zzso Before treatment all groups had similar zzso zzso and hormonal zzso After zzso treatment with zzso zzso or zzso weight, zzso and zzso reductions were similar in all groups zzso vs baseline in either zzso In each group zzso ratio showed non significant trend toward zzso No significant variations in zzso and zzso variables were recorded in each group after 1 and zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso insulin response, zzso ratio showed a similar trend toward improvement in all groups, while zzso 24 h urinary zzso zzso zzso testosterone, zzso hormone and zzso levels did not show any zzso zzso zzso and similar reductions of zzso but not of zzso levels were found in all zzso In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that, at least after zzso treatment, zzso and zzso do not modify the effects of diet on zzso zzso and hormonal parameters as well as on blood pressure in patients with abdominal zzso
