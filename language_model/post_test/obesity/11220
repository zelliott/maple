zzso and obesity in adulthood are established risk factors for adverse cardiovascular zzso but the contribution of overweight in childhood to later cardiovascular risk is less zzso Evidence for a direct effect of childhood overweight would highlight early life as an important target for cardiovascular disease zzso The aim of this study was to assess whether overweight and obesity in childhood and adolescence contribute to excess cardiovascular risk in zzso
