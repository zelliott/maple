We evaluated the risk assessment and management patterns employed by primary care physicians in patients at elevated zzso zzso 

Between April 2011 and March 2012, multiple physicians from 9 zzso Care Teams zzso and 88 physicians from traditional zzso zzso practices completed a practice assessment on the management of zzso zzso 40 years old with no clinical evidence of cardiovascular disease and diagnosed with at least 1 of the zzso zzso type 2 diabetes zzso zzso or zzso 

zzso with zzso zzso or hypertension tended to have a body mass index zzso 25 zzso zzso circumference zzso obtained for only zzso zzso Solo patients, revealed that zzso of these individuals were zzso obese and that at least zzso of Solo patients had zzso zzso zzso risk, determined by the physicians for zzso of all patients without zzso and typically performed using traditional risk engines, was often miscalculated zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Healthy zzso modifications were infrequently recommended zzso zzso was widely used zzso zzso but treatment targets were infrequently zzso The composite outcome of zzso zzso zzso cholesterol, zzso and blood pressure targets was met by zzso and zzso of patients managed by zzso and Solo physicians zzso 

zzso and cardiovascular risk were zzso and the latter often zzso Patients were infrequently zzso on the benefits of healthy zzso zzso A paradigm change in assessing and managing obesity and cardiovascular risk via aggressive lifestyle interventions is warranted in individuals at elevated zzso zzso
