Brown zzso tissue zzso zzso was assessed by measuring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and oxygen consumption in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The food intake and body weight of zzso rats increased more than those of controls and zzso rats became zzso zzso zzso zzso as an indicator of zzso activity, zzso zzso activity, as a marker of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of BAT in zzso rats were significantly reduced compared with those in zzso And, also, even when zzso rats were restricted in food intake zzso to produce comparable changes in body weight with zzso or matched in food intake zzso with zzso these parameters in both zzso and zzso zzso groups were decreased markedly compared to those in zzso As expected, body weight in zzso zzso rats increased significantly more than that in zzso In response to cold exposure, these parameters of zzso rats increased as much as those of controls zzso These results suggest that reduced brown zzso tissue zzso might be one of the important factors that are responsible for the development of obesity after zzso
