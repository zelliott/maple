In this paper the general concepts of the relationship between body weight, food intake and zzso to vascular disease are zzso in the light of recent zzso Several studies suggest that the traditional view of the relationship between mortality and zzso as direct and linear are mistaken and that the relationship is zzso shaped with minimal mortality at zzso rather than zzso zzso Furthermore, the notion that higher levels of food energy intake may be responsible for the enhanced zzso to zzso disease are also challenged by those in the lower than the upper ranges of total caloric zzso This may account for some of the anomalous inverse relationships found within countries between food (including zzso intake and zzso disease deaths, findings which have stood for years in zzso contrast with the direct relationship between fat intake and cardiovascular mortality between zzso These apparently paradoxical relationships may be explained by the further unexpected finding of low order but highly significant inverse correlations between food energy intake and zzso This has supported the notion of a spectrum of energy zzso with the energy zzso storing fat even on low zzso and the zzso zzso a high intake yet remaining zzso zzso responses to excess intake and to food deprivation may also be involved in this constitutional variation in energy zzso
