zzso is associated with cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, zzso and diabetes zzso as well as cardiovascular zzso 

To evaluate zzso zzso and treatment characteristics of patients with zzso hypertension and zzso zzso by body mass index and the zzso of blood pressure zzso and zzso targets in obese versus zzso zzso 

This retrospective study used data from GE zzso Electronic Medical Records database zzso of a primary care physician zzso Patients aged zzso 18 years and having zzso hypertension and zzso were zzso based on their body mass zzso normal weight zzso zzso zzso overweight zzso zzso and obese zzso zzso zzso Blood pressure and zzso goal zzso were based on Joint National Committee on Prevention, zzso zzso and Treatment of High Blood zzso and National zzso Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, zzso 

A total of zzso patients with zzso hypertension and zzso were identified and zzso as normal weight zzso zzso zzso overweight zzso zzso zzso and obese zzso zzso zzso Patients who were obese were younger zzso zzso were more likely to have diabetes zzso zzso zzso had higher baseline zzso and zzso levels and lower levels of zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso and were more likely to be prescribed zzso and zzso agents zzso zzso In zzso zzso obese patients were significantly more likely to fail to attain zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso P zzso and dual zzso and zzso zzso cholesterol zzso ratio zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso 

zzso appears to be an independent risk factor for the failure to attain zzso and dual zzso and zzso zzso cholesterol goals in patients with zzso hypertension and zzso These findings suggest that future research is needed to determine the underlying link between obesity and failure to attain these zzso
