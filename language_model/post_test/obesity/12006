It was the aim to investigate the influence of gastric bypass on zzso sodium and water zzso The relationship between sodium and water zzso along the gastrointestinal tract and their zzso zzso is poorly zzso zzso effects on blood pressure have been seen after zzso surgery before significant weight loss has zzso 

Male zzso rats zzso zzso 19 zzso underwent either gastric bypass zzso zzso zzso or sham operation zzso zzso 7) and were given a zzso diet with zzso water ad zzso Before and after surgery, the rats received an oral sodium load zzso zzso as zzso saline zzso zzso and were then placed in individual zzso cages so the urine volume, sodium content, and water intake for 8 hours could be zzso The urine sodium concentration was also zzso 

The rats that had undergone gastric bypass had a significantly lower body weight than the zzso controls throughout the follow-up period zzso zzso 21 g versus zzso zzso zzso g at day zzso P zzso zzso An oral sodium load after gastric bypass led to an increase in water intake zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso urine output zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso No change was seen in water zzso urine zzso or sodium zzso after sham zzso 

zzso zzso water zzso and sodium zzso are all increased after gastric bypass surgery in rats given an oral sodium load compared with zzso zzso More rapid zzso and less zzso of a dietary sodium load could be a part of the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of zzso surgery on blood zzso
