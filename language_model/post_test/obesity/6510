We undertook this study to determine whether there are differences in the responses of different persons to long-term zzso and to assess the possibility that zzso are involved in such zzso After a two-week zzso period, 12 pairs of young adult male zzso twins were overfed by zzso zzso zzso zzso per day, 6 days a week, for a total of 84 days during a zzso zzso The total excess amount each man consumed was 353 zzso zzso zzso During zzso individual changes in body composition and topography of fat deposition varied zzso The mean weight gain was zzso zzso but the range was zzso to zzso zzso The similarity within each pair in the response to zzso was significant zzso less than zzso with respect to body weight, percentage of fat, fat mass, and estimated subcutaneous fat, with about three times more zzso among pairs than within pairs zzso approximately zzso After adjustment for the gains in fat mass, the zzso similarity was particularly evident with respect to the changes in regional fat distribution and amount of abdominal visceral fat zzso less than zzso with about six times as much zzso among pairs as within pairs zzso approximately zzso We conclude that the most likely explanation for the zzso similarity in the adaptation to long-term zzso and for the variations in weight gain and fat distribution among the pairs of twins is that genetic factors are zzso These may govern the tendency to store energy as either fat or lean tissue and the various zzso of the resting expenditure of zzso
