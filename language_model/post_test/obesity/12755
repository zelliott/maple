To evaluate the effects of obesity on the zzso zzso we compared total and free zzso testosterone zzso zzso zzso and its zzso and 5 zzso zzso 17 zzso zzso and zzso levels in a group of 35 obese zzso mass index zzso zzso men zzso zzso zzso to levels in a zzso control zzso We observed a highly significant negative correlation zzso zzso between plasma zzso levels and zzso and a significant positive correlation zzso zzso between zzso levels and zzso There were no differences between the obese and the zzso men in levels of zzso zzso zzso and 5 zzso zzso 17 zzso zzso zzso levels were significantly higher in obese men and were significantly zzso zzso correlated with the waist hip zzso zzso To evaluate the role of the zzso complex in the decreased zzso levels in obese men, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied in eight obese middle-aged men and eight zzso zzso The zzso of plasma cortisol levels was also zzso Whereas zzso pulse frequency was similar in the obese and control subjects, mean zzso zzso levels, mean zzso zzso pulse zzso and the sum of all zzso zzso pulse zzso and zzso masses were significantly lower in the obese than in the zzso Moreover, there was a highly significant correlation between the sum of zzso pulse zzso and plasma zzso zzso This decrease in zzso pulse zzso is not an isolated phenomenon of zzso dysfunction in obese men, because the pulse zzso of plasma cortisol levels was also zzso The decreased zzso pulse zzso together with the normal respond of zzso cells to zzso stimulation reported in the literature suggest by zzso that the decreased zzso levels in obese men are the consequence of a zzso The decreased zzso pulse zzso and the decreased zzso of cortisol zzso and hence probably of zzso zzso point toward a general zzso of zzso function in obese zzso
