The ability of zzso zzso zzso to increase hunger has been noticed for centuries, although intensive research on its molecular mode of action started only after the characterization of its main psychoactive component zzso in the late zzso Despite the public concern related to the abuse of marijuana and its zzso scientific studies have pointed to the therapeutic zzso of zzso compounds and have highlighted their ability to stimulate zzso especially for sweet and palatable zzso Later, the discovery of specific receptors and their zzso zzso zzso suggested the existence of an zzso zzso system, providing a zzso basis for biological effects induced by marijuana and other zzso zzso reports describing the zzso properties of cannabinoids and the recent insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso action have proposed a central role of the zzso system in zzso The aim of this review is to provide an extensive overview on the role of this zzso system in feeding behavior by zzso the most relevant data obtained from human and animal studies and by zzso the interactions of the zzso system with the most important zzso networks and zzso pathways involved in the control of food zzso Finally, a critical evaluation of future potential zzso applications of zzso zzso in the therapy of obesity and eating disorders will be zzso
