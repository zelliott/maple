zzso patients zzso after blunt trauma are at increased risk compared to non-obese for organ dysfunction, prolonged hospital stay, infection, prolonged mechanical zzso and zzso zzso and zzso fatty liver disease zzso produce a low grade systemic inflammatory response syndrome zzso with compromised zzso blood flow, which increases with body mass zzso We hypothesized that obesity further zzso liver dysfunction by reduced zzso zzso following zzso zzso shock zzso 

zzso zzso rats zzso zzso g & zzso zzso zzso were randomly assigned to 4 groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and resuscitation zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso of mean zzso pressure zzso for 60 zzso zzso was return of shed zzso zzso and 2 volumes of zzso zzso zzso blood flow zzso using zzso zzso liver zzso and complete zzso panel were measured over 4 h after completion of zzso 

zzso rats had increased zzso heart rate, and zzso blood zzso and zzso zzso compared to lean controls, required less blood withdrawal zzso to maintain zzso zzso and zzso did not restore zzso zzso zzso rats had decreased zzso at zzso and during zzso which persisted 4 h post zzso zzso and zzso were increased compared to zzso at 4 h zzso 

These data suggest that obesity significantly contributes to trauma outcomes through compromised vascular control or through zzso zzso zzso to impair zzso blood flow after zzso resulting in a greater zzso zzso The zzso state of zzso seen in obesity appears to prime the liver for zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso perhaps intensified by insidious and ongoing zzso zzso established prior to the traumatic injury or zzso
