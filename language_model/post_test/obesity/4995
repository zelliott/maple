We tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso are higher in obese subjects with fatty liver than in obese subjects without fatty zzso 

We recruited 22 obese zzso zzso men aged zzso years, in whom liver fat was assessed by ultrasound and classified into categories of no, mild to moderate and severe fatty liver by two independent zzso Regional and visceral abdominal fat were assessed by zzso X-ray zzso and magnetic resonance imaging, and zzso zzso production, zzso zzso disposal during an insulin zzso and zzso zzso were measured, along with zzso suppression zzso zzso suppression and insulin sensitivity index for zzso during an zzso 

Seven subjects had no evidence of fatty liver, nine had mild or moderate fatty liver and six had severe fatty zzso The amount of visceral fat was not associated with the degree of fatty zzso zzso zzso disposal was zzso associated with fatty liver zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the groups with no fatty liver, mild to moderate fatty liver and severe fatty liver, respectively, zzso zzso suppression during the zzso was decreased zzso zzso and zzso zzso for no, mild to moderate, and severe fatty liver, zzso and the insulin sensitivity index for zzso was decreased zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested that zzso zzso were associated with fatty liver independently of zzso zzso production and disposal zzso 

In obese men, zzso zzso during an zzso are associated with fatty liver independently of classic measures of insulin sensitivity determined by the zzso zzso The contribution to this association by factors regulating zzso zzso requires further zzso
