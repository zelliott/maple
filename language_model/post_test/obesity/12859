To describe the impact of ejection fraction on the prognosis during 2 years after coronary artery bypass zzso zzso 

All patients in western Sweden who underwent zzso without zzso valve surgery between June 1988 and June zzso 

In all, zzso patients were operated upon and information on ejection fraction was available for 1961 patients zzso Of these patients, 178 zzso had an ejection fraction zzso 517 zzso an ejection fraction of zzso and zzso zzso an ejection zzso or zzso zzso In these groups the zzso during the first 30 days after zzso were zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso The corresponding values for zzso between 30 days and 2 years were zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso Patients with a lower ejection fraction were more frequently men and more frequently had a history of cardiovascular zzso In zzso analysis the zzso ejection fraction was an independent predictor for total zzso zzso Patients with a low ejection fraction died more frequently in association with zzso zzso zzso was, with the exception of that for zzso due to heart failure and infection, not associated significantly with the zzso ejection zzso 

During the 2 years after zzso a low zzso ejection fraction was associated with a higher zzso but the association with morbidity was more zzso
