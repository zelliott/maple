The creation of a database with zzso parameters zzso weight and zzso from school screening children and the comparison of zzso children with their counterparts suffering of zzso to Cobb zzso or zzso degrees zzso 

zzso screened children where divided in 3 zzso The 1st group comprised normal children with 0 degrees angle of trunk zzso zzso The 2nd group comprised children with zzso or zzso degree and zzso zzso 6 zzso The third group comprised children with zzso degrees and Cobb zzso or zzso zzso The zzso and standard zzso zzso 1 zzso of body weight and zzso the body mass index zzso zzso zzso and the corrected for the zzso curve height were calculated by zzso zzso analysis included zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

In boys of the 1st and 2nd group zzso had obesity zzso zzso zzso zzso severe obesity zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso obesity zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso and zzso in girls zzso In the 3rd group girls, zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso severely zzso zzso zzso while among boys zzso were severely zzso In the 3rd group there were no obese girls and only zzso obese zzso The comparison of body weight between zzso zzso zzso and zzso children zzso and 2nd zzso fails to show any statistical zzso In the 1st and 2nd group, the girls' mean height is greater than that of boys aged 9 zzso years but less when boys are zzso years zzso In the 3rd group a mean of zzso zzso increase is observed after height correction for the zzso curve, in boys and zzso zzso in girls zzso The comparison of body height (both zzso and zzso between zzso and zzso children fails to show any statistical zzso zzso A variety of findings regarding the stature and weight of zzso children has been zzso In this studied Mediterranean sample of the population, the zzso parameters of height and weight in children with zzso regardless of curve type and site, are not statistically different from their zzso zzso
