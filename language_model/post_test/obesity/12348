The authors conducted a cohort study of zzso zzso drug zzso use and risk of symptomatic benign zzso zzso zzso using data from zzso men without zzso at baseline in the zzso arm of the zzso Cancer Prevention Trial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was defined as medical or surgical treatment or at least 2 International zzso zzso zzso zzso values greater than or equal to zzso zzso hazards models using zzso exposure for zzso use were employed to estimate zzso associations of zzso medical conditions and zzso use with zzso zzso zzso other zzso musculoskeletal conditions, and headaches were associated with increased zzso risk zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Use of any zzso use of zzso and use of zzso zzso were associated with significant increases in zzso risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Control for indications for zzso use, including baseline zzso attenuated the associations slightly, but all became zzso Among men with no indications for zzso use, the hazard ratio for any zzso use was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The modest associations of zzso use with zzso risk in this cohort were probably due to zzso by indication, and zzso use was not associated with zzso zzso
