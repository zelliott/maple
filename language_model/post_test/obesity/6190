We investigated the associations between zzso of cholesterol metabolism and features of the zzso syndrome zzso in the presence and absence of zzso diabetes zzso 

Men with the zzso zzso and 10 zzso and zzso controls were zzso Plasma zzso and zzso were measured by gas zzso zzso and their ratios to total cholesterol were used to estimate cholesterol zzso 

Compared with healthy controls, zzso subjects had significantly higher zzso and lower zzso ratios zzso In the zzso subjects without zzso zzso zzso ratio was positively associated with age and zzso associated with plasma zzso and insulin zzso while in zzso subjects with zzso zzso the ratio was positively associated with age and zzso zzso and zzso associated with zzso and zzso Age and zzso insulin were independent zzso of zzso ratio in zzso subjects with zzso There was a significant negative association between plasma zzso with zzso ratio zzso zzso in zzso subjects without zzso but not in zzso subjects with zzso 

zzso zzso efficiency was lower and cholesterol synthesis higher in zzso subjects with or without zzso compared with healthy zzso Moreover, the zzso relationship between cholesterol synthesis and cholesterol zzso is lost in the presence of zzso
