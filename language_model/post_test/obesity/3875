zzso dysfunction occurs in obesity and zzso However, there is uncertainty about the relative contribution of zzso dysfunction, smooth muscle dysfunction, or zzso zzso 

We examined zzso resistance vessel responses to zzso zzso agents in matched subjects on no zzso medications classified as zzso Type 2 diabetes, zzso impaired zzso zzso zzso zzso obese, and zzso zzso zzso to both zzso and zzso were impaired in obese, zzso and diabetic subjects compared to zzso However, diabetic and zzso subjects had no further impairment than zzso obese zzso zzso data revealed that obese, zzso and diabetic males compared to zzso males demonstrated impaired responses to zzso However, among zzso obese, zzso and diabetic subjects demonstrated impaired zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that gender and zzso but not zzso were strongly related to zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso was greater in subjects with diabetes and zzso compared to zzso obese zzso 

zzso zzso function is impaired in zzso with little further impairment in zzso and Type 2 zzso zzso appear more sensitive to the deleterious effect of obesity on zzso resistance vessel function, and males to smooth zzso zzso There is a specific increase in zzso zzso responses in zzso and Type 2 diabetes independent of zzso
