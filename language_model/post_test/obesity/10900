To compare the relation between zzso zzso content, central obesity and insulin sensitivity in Europeans and South zzso 

zzso study of 40 South Asian and European zzso men matched for age and body mass zzso We measured zzso zzso by zzso magnetic resonance zzso of zzso muscle, insulin sensitivity by the short insulin tolerance test, per cent body fat by zzso zzso zzso and visceral fat by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso 

South Asians compared with Europeans had a higher mean per cent body fat zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso and lower insulin sensitivity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Mean zzso zzso zzso zzso content was higher in South Asians than in Europeans zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso dry weight, p zzso zzso In Europeans zzso zzso was correlated with per cent body fat zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso p zzso visceral fat zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and insulin sensitivity zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In South Asians zzso zzso was not significantly related to insulin sensitivity or zzso and the strongest associations of insulin sensitivity were with zzso plasma zzso and zzso zzso 

The association of zzso zzso with insulin sensitivity and obesity in Europeans is consistent with the hypothesis that muscle zzso mediates the effect of obesity on insulin zzso The absence of a similar relation of insulin sensitivity to zzso zzso in South Asians suggests that other mechanisms zzso the high insulin resistance observed in this zzso
