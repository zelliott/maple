The importance of maternal nutrition for fetal brain development is increasingly zzso Previous studies have suggested that maternal obesity or maternal exposure to zzso diets may permanently alter brain structure and function in the zzso To test whether maternal exposure to a high-fat diet, prior and during zzso alters fetal zzso development, we fed zzso old zzso females with a high-fat diet zzso calories from zzso for 10 weeks prior to zzso and 17 days zzso Fetal brains at embryonic day zzso were used to determine zzso changes in the zzso We report that maternal exposure to the high-fat diet induced small for zzso age zzso status and fetal zzso The proliferation of neural zzso was increased in the zzso from zzso and zzso in fetuses from mothers fed the high-fat diet when compared to controls, but decreased within the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso was decreased zzso Horn and zzso The differentiation of zzso zzso within the zzso was also zzso These data indicate that, under the influence of a maternal high-fat diet administered prior and during zzso fetal zzso development is altered at embryonic day 17, as indicated by zzso changes in proliferation of neural zzso decreased zzso and by decreased zzso differentiation within the zzso zzso
