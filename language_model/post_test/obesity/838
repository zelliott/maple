In zzso the development of zzso is associated with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso possibly stemming from zzso of zzso zzso fatty acid zzso zzso Because zzso zzso is regulated by insulin and zzso we examined in cardiac zzso from lean and obese zzso rats the effects of insulin and the zzso agent zzso on the initial rate of zzso zzso zzso distribution of zzso and zzso zzso In cardiac zzso from obese zzso rats, under zzso conditions, zzso was relocated to the zzso at the expense of zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso rate, zzso zzso rate into zzso and the zzso zzso zzso concentration each were significantly zzso All these zzso processes were zzso by the zzso inhibitor zzso indicating its zzso zzso In cardiac zzso isolated from lean rats, in zzso administration of insulin induced the zzso of zzso to the zzso and zzso initial rates of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, in zzso from obese rats, insulin failed to alter the zzso zzso of zzso and the rates of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In cardiac zzso from lean and obese animals, zzso zzso the initial rates of zzso zzso and zzso although zzso only induced the zzso of zzso to the zzso in lean zzso The present results indicate that in cardiac zzso from obese zzso rats, a permanent relocation of zzso to the zzso is responsible for zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, in zzso these cardiac zzso although sensitive to zzso zzso were completely insensitive to insulin, as the zzso conditions in zzso obese animals resemble the zzso condition in lean zzso
