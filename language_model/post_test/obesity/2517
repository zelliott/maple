Estimates of excess mortality associated with body mass index zzso in zzso have been calculated for the US zzso 

The objective of this article is to compare the excess mortality associated with zzso levels to the excess mortality associated with other zzso zzso 

For the zzso Third National Health and Nutrition zzso Survey, estimates of excess deaths were calculated for standard zzso levels and for comparable levels of percentage body fat, waist zzso hip and arm zzso zzso ratio, the sum of 4 zzso zzso and zzso zzso The outcome measure is the percentage of deaths in the full sample in excess of those predicted for the reference zzso 

For the level equivalent to zzso zzso estimates of excess deaths ranged from zzso for zzso ratio to zzso for percentage body zzso All except waist zzso zzso ratio, and zzso ratio were significantly greater than zero zzso zzso For the level equivalent to zzso 25 to zzso the percentage of excess deaths was zzso for percentage body fat and negative for all other zzso estimates were significantly below zero only for zzso and zzso zzso For the level equivalent to zzso or zzso 30, estimates ranged from zzso for waist circumference to zzso for percentage of zzso none were significantly different from zzso Estimates for zzso zzso zzso causes of death, and other causes of death showed no statistically significant or systematic differences between zzso and other zzso 

In this zzso study, attributable zzso of deaths were similar across zzso
