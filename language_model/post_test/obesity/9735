In the public health arena, a single component of total dietary zzso such as sugar zzso has been questioned as the health risk of zzso This study aimed to investigate if the zzso of obesity prevalence in the USA is associated with dietary sugar intake when other dietary zzso are zzso 

In this zzso study, National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso and III zzso zzso zzso 28 zzso were zzso zzso zzso models were used to determine if body mass index was predicted by the daily zzso of total energy, zzso zzso and total zzso and the percentages of energy from zzso fat, total sugar, and added zzso 

From 1970 through 1990, the contribution of zzso to total zzso intake decreased in the 1 to 18 y and zzso y subgroups, and the contribution of added zzso to the total energy intake did not zzso zzso zzso models identified energy intake as a positive zzso zzso as a negative zzso and total sugar intake as a zzso for body mass index in the 1 to 18 y and zzso y age zzso Daily energy intake was positively predicted by zzso and fat zzso but not with total and added sugar zzso in the two age zzso 

Energy intake was the primary contributor to body mass index in all age groups in this zzso The major energy sources of children and adolescents differed from those of zzso The implicated associations between energy and zzso zzso indicate that keeping energy balance is the primary strategy to avoid zzso
