Published studies have shown that overproduction of very low density zzso is a major factor leading to zzso in zzso Few systematic studies of zzso removal or zzso zzso zzso activity zzso in obesity have zzso We have examined zzso zzso zzso zzso activities in 12 lean and 12 obese zzso and zzso volunteers after overnight zzso zzso doses were calculated to compensate for the zzso between body mass and plasma volume in zzso zzso zzso activities of zzso zzso and zzso zzso origin were distinguished by in zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso doses were given to each subject to determine zzso activities under conditions of zzso release and to define sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso plasma or zzso plasma zzso were similar in lean and obese individuals despite a nearly zzso increase in calculated zzso tissue mass in the zzso Since zzso tissue zzso has been reported to increase in proportion to zzso size, the lack of difference in zzso zzso zzso was zzso There was an inverse correlation between plasma zzso concentration and zzso zzso zzso These empirical observations may reflect relatively decreased zzso zzso zzso in relation to zzso organ mass in obese zzso The mechanism of this relationship has not been zzso
