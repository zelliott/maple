The newly discovered zzso zzso zzso has been proposed to play a critical role in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso expression and, more recently, the protein content of zzso were investigated in zzso These studies have shown that the content of this protein varies quite substantially and that several factors could be responsible for its variation in human skeletal zzso The aim of this review is to determine whether obesity and zzso increased zzso activity contribute to variation in muscle zzso zzso A recent study from our laboratories revealed that, in zzso zzso content in skeletal muscle is zzso by about zzso compared to zzso Body weight loss in obese subjects did not cause any change in skeletal muscle zzso zzso On the other hand, when increased muscular zzso activity of knee zzso muscles is induced by several weeks of zzso electrical zzso zzso content increased by about zzso zzso and increased zzso activity do not appear zzso however, to explain the magnitude of the human skeletal muscle variation in zzso zzso Since intensive efforts are being devoted to this area of research, it is expected that our understanding of the causes contributing to its variation in humans will soon be substantially zzso
