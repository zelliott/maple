zzso zzso function is often observed in older individuals and may zzso to the development of type 2 zzso We have studied the age-related effects of zzso zzso on insulin release in zzso isolated from female zzso zzso and lean zzso 

zzso were challenged with zzso or zzso zzso zzso in media with zzso zzso or without zzso 

zzso zzso (10 zzso increased zzso insulin release in zzso from zzso to 5-week-old zzso mice both in zzso and zzso In zzso from zzso to zzso zzso mice, 10 zzso zzso and 10 zzso zzso enhanced insulin release in zzso but not in zzso zzso increased insulin release in zzso from zzso to 5-week-old and zzso lean mice incubated in zzso but not in zzso from zzso lean zzso The zzso exchange inhibitor zzso zzso zzso did not affect insulin release zzso by zzso zzso zzso did not enhance zzso insulin zzso in zzso from zzso to zzso zzso mice in the presence of low zzso Na zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso from zzso to zzso mice also when zzso was zzso The results suggest that zzso signal zzso involving zzso zzso and Na is reduced with age in mouse pancreatic zzso 

zzso zzso may add to the age-related decrease in zzso insulin release by affecting the zzso capacity of the zzso through mechanisms other than zzso zzso zzso
