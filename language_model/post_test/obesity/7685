zzso zzso zzso zzso is an herbal medicine traditionally used for treatment of abdominal pain, gastrointestinal disease, zzso and related zzso 

We investigated the effects and molecular mechanism of zzso zzso water extract on zzso zzso and an animal model of zzso 

To study the effect of zzso on zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells were treated every two days with zzso at various zzso zzso for eight zzso Oil Red O zzso was performed to determine the zzso zzso in zzso zzso To zzso the zzso mechanism of zzso on zzso zzso levels of zzso and expression of zzso were analyzed by Western zzso zzso was administered orally to high fat diet zzso obese rats to confirm its effect in zzso 

zzso inhibited zzso zzso differentiation in a zzso manner without cellular zzso zzso expression was highly decreased by zzso treatment, whereas there was no significant change in zzso zzso zzso administration significantly reduced the body weight of rats fed a zzso Plasma zzso levels were significantly lower in the zzso zzso group than those in the zzso control group or normal diet zzso group, although serum total, zzso and zzso levels did not differ between the zzso 

These results demonstrate an zzso effect of zzso on zzso through reduction of an zzso factor, zzso zzso had a beneficial effect, reducing body weight gain in a zzso animal model of zzso
