zzso zzso zzso a zzso marker of inflammation that is moderately elevated in zzso zzso syndrome zzso and type 2 diabetes, has been proposed as a surrogate marker of zzso zzso zzso Its clinical usefulness in the diagnosis of NASH was evaluated in severely obese patients without or with zzso diabetes, and NASH and the potential roles of the liver and of the zzso tissue in zzso production were zzso 

zzso obese patients without NASH (without zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso or with zzso and diabetes zzso zzso zzso and with NASH (without zzso zzso zzso or with zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso For each patient, liver and zzso tissue zzso were collected during a zzso surgery and were used to determine the zzso gene expression by real-time zzso The role of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso expression was also evaluated in subcutaneous zzso tissue obtained during zzso zzso 

Plasma zzso levels were elevated in severely obese patients independently from the presence or absence of zzso diabetes, or zzso zzso gene expression was not only increased in zzso but also in zzso zzso of obese patients compared with controls zzso In human zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were positively correlated with those of zzso and the zzso expression was enhanced in zzso by zzso and zzso 

Plasma zzso levels are not zzso of the diagnosis of NASH in severely obese zzso The liver but also the zzso tissue can produce zzso a process which could be dependent on zzso zzso both zzso might contribute to the elevated plasma zzso levels found in zzso In addition, the large amount of body fat may well produce an important part of the circulating zzso further limiting its clinical usefulness in the evaluation of NASH in severely obese zzso
