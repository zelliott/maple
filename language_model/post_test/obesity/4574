In developing zzso of therapeutic target zzso significant time and effort are committed to the preparation of large numbers of zzso In an effort to develop a potent inhibitor of protein zzso zzso zzso zzso as an zzso and/or zzso agent, we constructed an zzso chemical library by using a simplified procedure that zzso tedious zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso derivatives were zzso by zzso the two halves of the target zzso When mixed and heated in test tubes, the precursors produced the reaction products as zzso After brief zzso the products were pure enough to be used for zzso zzso With the precursors for the zzso reactions prepared, the zzso library compounds could be prepared in a day by using the present zzso The library compounds thus obtained were examined for their zzso activities against zzso Among them, compound zzso was the most potent inhibitor of zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso The in zzso effect of zzso was also examined in an zzso mouse zzso zzso obese zzso mice were divided into two groups and each group was fed a high-fat diet zzso or zzso for four zzso The group of zzso mice gained significantly less weight relative to the zzso control group during the four weeks of the drug feeding zzso In contrast to the zzso effect of zzso no difference was observed in the zzso control of the zzso and zzso mice zzso
