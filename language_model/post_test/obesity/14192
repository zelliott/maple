zzso syndrome zzso is known to increase the risk of cardiovascular zzso zzso protein zzso has been reported to be elevated in subjects with zzso However, which component of zzso contributes mostly to the zzso has not been studied in zzso 

We studied 628 apparently healthy Japanese subjects zzso zzso women zzso age zzso zzso Body mass index, waist circumference zzso blood pressure, zzso zzso insulin and zzso were zzso zzso was defined according to the National zzso Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III zzso 

In partial correlation analysis, zzso showed the strongest correlation with zzso among the variables related to zzso zzso increased as the number of zzso components zzso The mean zzso value adjusted for demographic variables was higher in subjects with zzso than those without zzso and further adjustments with variables related to zzso revealed that the significant difference between the two groups disappeared only when further adjustment was made for zzso In multiple linear zzso analysis, the independent variable that most strongly explained the zzso level was zzso which was followed by zzso Finally, comparison of the zzso levels in groups zzso by abdominal obesity and the number of zzso components revealed that those with abdominal obesity tended to show higher zzso levels compared with those without abdominal obesity regardless of the number of zzso components other than zzso 

zzso with zzso showed higher levels of zzso and the main zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso
