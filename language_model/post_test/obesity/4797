zzso zzso zzso is a major cause of zzso zzso zzso Yet the zzso mechanisms underlying the development of zzso are not fully zzso partially due to lack of suitable models that mimic the complex zzso of zzso disease in diabetic zzso In this study, we describe early and late zzso manifestations of zzso and zzso responses to long-term treatments with zzso or high-dose zzso in zzso rats, a model of zzso syndrome, diabetes, and chronic zzso zzso At 8 weeks of age, obese zzso rats developed zzso syndrome and diabetes zzso zzso zzso and zzso and early signs of zzso disease zzso zzso collagen IV deposition, zzso zzso and zzso zzso By 32 weeks of age, animals developed zzso zzso consistent with zzso including zzso expansion, zzso zzso inflammation and fibrosis, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso markedly increased body weight but reduced food zzso improved zzso control, and attenuated zzso and liver and kidney zzso In contrast, zzso markedly increased cardiac zzso via a blood zzso zzso zzso zzso did not improve zzso zzso but zzso blood pressure, and nearly prevented diabetic zzso zzso The zzso model thus detects the clinical observations seen with zzso and zzso in terms of primary and secondary zzso of cardiac and zzso zzso This and previous reports indicate that the obese zzso rat meets currently accepted criteria for progressive experimental diabetic zzso disease in zzso suggesting that this may be the best available rat model for simulation of human zzso
