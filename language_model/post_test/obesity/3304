The aim of our study was to investigate the hypothesis that insulin resistance is involved in the zzso of essential hypertension, and to explain whether zzso in this condition is the result of either zzso overproduction or defective zzso insulin zzso In 14 lean zzso 17 overweight zzso 17 lean essential zzso and 20 overweight essential zzso subjects, we measured, after overnight zzso blood zzso serum insulin, and serum zzso and calculated the zzso and the zzso ratios, which can be commonly taken as indexes of peripheral sensitivity to insulin and zzso insulin zzso zzso When compared to lean zzso overweight and/or zzso patients exhibited higher serum insulin and zzso zzso and a lower zzso zzso No difference was found in the zzso ratio between zzso and zzso zzso zzso blood pressure was directly correlated with serum insulin zzso less than zzso and zzso zzso less than zzso and zzso correlated with the zzso ratio zzso less than zzso We conclude that insulin resistance is present in both essential zzso and overweight zzso Considering the zzso of the zzso ratio when taken as the zzso insulin clearance index, we believe that zzso is caused by a zzso zzso response to the defective peripheral action of the zzso
