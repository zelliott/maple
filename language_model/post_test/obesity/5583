zzso zzso insulin zzso is well known for its role in feeding zzso In addition, its concentration is modified in response to zzso Recent studies suggest that brain insulin zzso in memory zzso possibly through stimulation by zzso zzso The present zzso study focused on local in zzso regulation of zzso by zzso and on the effects of aging on zzso since aging is characterized by deterioration of memory, body weight regulation, and central zzso zzso zzso (8 zzso infused for 5 zzso increased zzso zzso levels zzso by zzso and zzso insulin levels by zzso only, suggesting a specific zzso regulation of zzso by zzso Neither zzso nor zzso were affected, suggesting a central zzso The same dose of zzso induced a modest zzso delayed zzso zzso increase in zzso zzso suggesting that the effect of zzso on zzso is independent of a previously defined local zzso insulin zzso zzso levels in old normal weight rats were half the levels of young zzso In genetically old obese zzso zzso rats, zzso concentration was zzso of that in young normal rats, suggesting a deterioration of zzso availability when aging and obesity are zzso zzso The above results, in line with recent considerations on a potential role of central insulin in learning and memory, suggest particular effects of zzso on feeding and memory and probably on a specific zzso for zzso
