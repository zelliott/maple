The type of dietary fat influences the blood zzso zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on circulating cholesterol levels and other zzso when included in an zzso diet to nutritionally treat zzso 

Thirty-five patients zzso zzso zzso age: 33 zzso zzso were randomly assigned during 8 weeks one of the following zzso omega-3 fatty acids supplemented zzso + zzso enriched in salmon zzso zzso 3 zzso or control zzso zzso and blood zzso were determined at baseline zzso zzso and at zzso zzso zzso 

zzso total cholesterol statistically decreased after the zzso nutritional intervention in all experimental groups, being more pronounced in the enriched diet group zzso zzso The zzso levels decreased in both zzso zzso zzso zzso and omega-3 supplemented zzso zzso zzso dietary groups, while subjects who followed the salmon diet did not show such changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These data suggest that a balanced zzso diet enriched in salmon results in a beneficial effect on the plasma zzso profile that could be zzso by the salmon composition as a whole, and not only by the omega-3 zzso
