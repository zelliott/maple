It has been proposed that both zzso and low sympathetic nervous system zzso activity contribute to zzso Because zzso inhibit zzso activity, we hypothesized that zzso and low zzso activity may be found in association in zzso Indians, a population with a high prevalence of zzso We therefore measured zzso of zzso zzso axis and zzso activities in 39 zzso men, 20 zzso zzso zzso years; weight, zzso zzso zzso body fat zzso zzso zzso and 19 Caucasians zzso years, zzso zzso zzso body zzso zzso axis activity was assessed by zzso of morning zzso plasma zzso zzso and cortisol zzso and 24-hour urinary free cortisol zzso zzso zzso activity was assessed as muscle sympathetic nerve activity zzso by zzso and by measurement of catecholamines zzso plasma concentration and 24-hour urinary zzso Plasma zzso and cortisol and zzso were similar in zzso and zzso zzso was positively correlated with percent body fat zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and was lower in zzso compared with Caucasians after adjustment for percent body fat zzso v zzso zzso P zzso zzso We conclude that zzso Indians, a population with a high prevalence of zzso have lower zzso activity but normal zzso axis activity compared with zzso
