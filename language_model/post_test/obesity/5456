The high prevalence of obesity and cardiovascular risk factors in zzso affirms the need for effective weight loss zzso In this study, we investigated the combined effect of zzso diet, and exercise in obese zzso patients zzso 

In an zzso prospective intervention trial, 14 obese zzso zzso zzso and 14 matched simple obese controls were allocated to zzso treatment with zzso (10 to 15 zzso diet zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and body composition zzso from zzso zzso were assessed monthly for the first 5 months and thereafter every second month for the next 6 zzso 

Mean zzso weight loss at 11 months was zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso The zzso exhibited the same improvements in body zzso waist zzso blood zzso and zzso zzso as the simple zzso In a zzso model, baseline weight, duration of growth hormone replacement therapy, and duration of zzso disease explained zzso zzso zzso zzso of the variation in weight loss at 4 months in the zzso Only baseline weight and waist circumference could predict weight loss at 11 zzso 

zzso are not resistant to weight loss zzso Almost all will achieve at least zzso weight loss, and zzso can zzso weight within 11 zzso However, the long-term effect on risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease as well as on mortality needs to be zzso
