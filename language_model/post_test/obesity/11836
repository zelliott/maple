zzso syndrome zzso is a major health problem in schizophrenic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the candidate genes responsible for the liability to zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of the zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso on zzso zzso in patients with schizophrenia or zzso zzso 

zzso profiles and zzso gene zzso were determined in 600 patients zzso men and zzso zzso with a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia or zzso zzso zzso zzso and components of zzso were compared between patients with different zzso or zzso zzso 

In the whole population, the zzso frequency of zzso and zzso was zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso had no significant effect on obesity or zzso zzso However, following gender zzso of the data, we found female zzso zzso carriers were at greater risk of developing abdominal obesity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and hypertension zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso than female zzso zzso zzso Male zzso zzso carriers had lower insulin levels zzso zzso zzso and lower zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso levels than male zzso zzso zzso Moreover, female zzso zzso carriers had higher body weight zzso zzso zzso waist circumference zzso zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso and were at greater risk of developing hypertension zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso gene zzso were significantly associated with zzso level in men and blood pressure in zzso 

We did not find an association of zzso gene zzso with zzso or obesity in our schizophrenia zzso But further analyses by gender zzso revealed zzso differences in the effect of different zzso zzso on certain zzso zzso in these zzso
