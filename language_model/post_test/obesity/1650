To discover zzso genes that might play a role in regulating energy balance, we carried out a zzso screen for genes induced by a zzso fast in male zzso mouse zzso One such gene was zzso zzso binding protein zzso zzso zzso The product of this gene is of interest because it blocks zzso action, suggesting that zzso zzso of this gene in the zzso may reduce zzso negative feedback, leading to elevated zzso levels, thus promoting obese zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that a zzso fast zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of mice and zzso To assess if zzso zzso promotes zzso the gene was transferred to the zzso via an zzso virus zzso Within 2 zzso following zzso zzso mice on a high-fat diet exhibited elevated body weight, without zzso relative to mice receiving the control zzso zzso Body weight remained elevated for more than 8 zzso and was associated with elevated zzso and impaired zzso zzso These studies suggest that elevated zzso zzso promotes obese zzso
