The aim of this study was to determine whether lower serum zzso level is associated with the risk of zzso zzso

A total of zzso participants were zzso zzso was significantly higher in zzso participants than in zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were significantly lower in zzso participants than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that lower serum zzso level zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso smoking zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso higher blood pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso 

Lower serum level of zzso may increase the risk of zzso zzso zzso independently of zzso Our findings facilitate further study to clarify the role of zzso in zzso zzso
