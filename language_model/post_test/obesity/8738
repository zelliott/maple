To investigate gender differences in circulating zzso levels and zzso tissue production of zzso 

zzso men and 63 women with a large zzso variation in body mass index zzso but otherwise healthy, were investigated after an overnight zzso Body fat zzso abdominal subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso of zzso in zzso and serum zzso were zzso 

Although there was no gender difference in mean zzso or fat cell size, mean percentage body fat was 49 in women and 36 in men zzso zzso At each level of zzso serum zzso levels were about two times higher in women than in men zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso rate of zzso in men was two-thirds of that in women zzso zzso The gender differences in body fat content, serum zzso and zzso zzso were observed in obese zzso 27 zzso zzso as well as non-obese zzso zzso zzso levels zzso zzso and zzso zzso rate zzso zzso correlated positively with body fat content in either zzso However, the gender differences in serum zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso rate zzso zzso remained statistically significantly different even when the values were adjusted for body zzso 

The gender difference in circulating zzso zzso can be due to at least two different zzso A higher proportion of zzso tissue and increased production rate of zzso per unit mass of zzso tissue might explain why women have higher circulating zzso levels than zzso
