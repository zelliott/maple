zzso nerve injury is a rare complication of cardiac zzso and is usually caused by direct trauma during zzso artery access, zzso from a zzso or prolonged digital pressure for zzso zzso zzso nerve stimulation has been used to treat different pain syndromes in the upper and lower zzso with variable success and it typically requires direct vision with open surgical zzso Since the zzso nerve can be readily seen with zzso an zzso lead placement seemed zzso 

A zzso zzso obese male who sustained zzso nerve injury during cardiac zzso continued to complain of intractable zzso zzso 18 months zzso He failed multiple treatment zzso and continued to complain of severe zzso pains that markedly interfere with his daily zzso Two zzso leads were placed under real-time zzso and the placement was confirmed with zzso One lead was placed along the zzso axis of the nerve and the patient had good coverage over the anterior thigh but not below the zzso So another lead was placed zzso across the zzso nerve in order to stimulate all the branches and the patient reported good coverage along the zzso nerve distribution down to the zzso 

The patient continues to be pain free 20 months after the zzso 

Here we described a novel zzso zzso approach for zzso nerve stimulation with ultrasound guidance which allowed precise placement of the stimulating lead very close to the zzso nerve without the need for surgical zzso
