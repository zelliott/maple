The short form zzso of the zzso deletion zzso of the zzso zzso gene was previously found to be associated with reduced zzso zzso rate in obese zzso We investigated the effects of this zzso on changes in body weight in Finnish zzso and type 2 diabetic subjects during a 10 y zzso 

Controlled 10 y follow-up study with zzso 5 and 10 y zzso 

A total of 126 zzso control subjects and 84 newly zzso middle-aged type 2 diabetic patients from eastern Finland zzso 

zzso zzso blood pressure, oral zzso tolerance test, plasma insulin, plasma zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined by zzso chain reaction followed by zzso gel zzso 

No significant differences were found in the prevalence of the zzso deletion zzso between zzso and type 2 diabetic zzso The zzso subjects with the zzso zzso had a greater increase in their mean body weight during 5 y follow-up than the zzso subjects with other zzso zzso in body weight zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, zzso for the difference between the zzso Also, the trend for the zzso of body weight was statistically significant in the zzso subjects with the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was not zzso or zzso associated with body weight in type 2 diabetic zzso 

The zzso of two short zzso zzso was associated with an increase in body weight among zzso zzso
