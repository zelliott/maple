It has been suggested that zzso and insulin resistance triggered by zzso diets can account for zzso damage and deficits of cognitive zzso We wonder if the impairment of learning and memory processes detected in zzso obese zzso mice is linked to diet composition zzso With this purpose we have evaluated learning performance in mice undergoing a short-term high-fat zzso treatment, which leads to a zzso state characterized by increased zzso without significant changes of zzso and insulin plasma zzso zzso mice were fed either a zzso zzso zzso from zzso or control diet (10 zzso from zzso during 8 zzso Learning performance was evaluated by using the zzso zzso version of the zzso zzso maze test zzso Mice were trained to learn the zzso protocol and then memory was tested at different zzso Time spent to consume food placed in zzso arms and errors committed to find them were measured in all zzso zzso mice significantly spent more time in learning the task and made a greater number of errors than zzso Moreover, retention tests revealed that both working and total memory errors were also more numerous in zzso zzso The current results show that short-term zzso zzso spatial learning and suggest that impairment of zzso learning zzso by zzso diets might be zzso before zzso zzso linked to obesity zzso
