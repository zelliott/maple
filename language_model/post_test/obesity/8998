We investigated the joint associations of leisure time physical activity and abdominal obesity with zzso insulin and zzso zzso levels and with the risk of impaired zzso tolerance zzso and Type 2 diabetes zzso 2 zzso 

A zzso zzso random sample of zzso Finnish adults zzso years of age without a history of cardiovascular disease or zzso Relative energy expenditure during the previous 12 months zzso assessed by a zzso was used as a measure of leisure time physical zzso zzso ratio zzso was used as a measure of abdominal zzso zzso and Type 2 zzso were assessed by a zzso oral zzso tolerance test and were defined according to the World Health Organization zzso 

While zzso zzso and zzso insulin levels increased with increasing zzso zzso zzso and P zzso respectively), both of them decreased with increasing physical activity zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso The highest zzso zzso and zzso insulin levels were found among individuals who had most abdominal obesity and were least physically zzso zzso inactive individuals had a higher prevalence of zzso and Type 2 zzso in all zzso zzso than physically active zzso 

Higher levels of leisure time physical activity are associated with lower zzso zzso and zzso insulin levels and a reduced risk of having zzso and Type 2 zzso independent of the level of abdominal zzso
