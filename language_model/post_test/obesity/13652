Several zzso zzso reportedly zzso zzso zzso of zzso and thereby induce insulin zzso In this study, to investigate the effect of zzso on insulin signaling and metabolism in zzso mice with genetic zzso insulin resistance, a dominant negative zzso zzso deleted zzso zzso was zzso in the liver via injection of its zzso into the zzso zzso zzso expression levels were zzso to zzso that of zzso expressed zzso zzso tolerance in zzso mice improved significantly compared with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was significantly suppressed in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly suppressed in the zzso liver, whereas zzso zzso of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to insulin stimulation was increased approximately zzso and zzso zzso was clearly enhanced under both zzso and zzso conditions in the zzso of zzso zzso Thus, our data indicate that suppression of the zzso zzso leads to improved zzso tolerance in zzso zzso These observations may contribute to the development of novel zzso zzso
