The zzso period after small zzso bypass operations could be subdivided into zzso Analysis of the rate of weight loss during the period of constant weight loss zzso zzso in 80 subjects gave a mean rate of zzso zzso units zzso per week zzso zzso or zzso zzso per week zzso zzso After both zzso and zzso zzso the rate of weight loss during period II was correlated to initial body zzso After zzso zzso the rate of weight loss was also correlated to the length of the zzso zzso in function, either as absolute value or as a fraction of the total small zzso zzso The absence of these correlations after zzso zzso might be due to a more variable zzso in to the zzso loop after this zzso It is suggested that a small zzso bypass operation should not be performed as a standardized procedure with predetermined segments of the small zzso in function, but rather as an operation designed for each zzso
