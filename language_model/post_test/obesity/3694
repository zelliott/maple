zzso screening is making a comeback in drug discovery as the maturation of chemical zzso methods has facilitated target identification for zzso small zzso A limitation of these approaches is that time-consuming genetic methods or other means are often required to determine the biologically relevant target (or zzso from among multiple zzso interactions that are typically zzso Here, we have combined zzso screening of a directed zzso library with competitive zzso protein profiling to map and functionally characterize the targets of screening zzso Using this approach, we identify zzso 3 zzso also known as zzso as a primary molecular target of zzso compounds that promote zzso storage in zzso We further show that zzso activity is markedly elevated during zzso zzso Treatment of two mouse models of zzso with a zzso inhibitor ameliorates multiple features of zzso syndrome, illustrating the power of the described strategy to accelerate the identification and zzso validation of new therapeutic zzso
