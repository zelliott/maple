To characterize changes in zzso levels in response to oral zzso tolerance test zzso and to correlate changes in zzso levels with changes in insulin and zzso following zzso in Chinese obese children of zzso I and II stage with insulin zzso 

22 obese children with insulin resistance state were divided into four groups according to their zzso stage and zzso boys of zzso I zzso boys of zzso II zzso girls of zzso I zzso girls of zzso II zzso zzso insulin and zzso were measured at 0, 30, 60 and 120 zzso following zzso The control children with normal zzso were divided into control boys of zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso control boys of zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso control girls of zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso control girls of zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso serum zzso levels were zzso 

zzso levels were lower in obese zzso zzso levels of control group decreased in zzso II stage zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso decreased more significantly than that in zzso group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso levels expressed a downward trend after zzso among obese zzso The decrease in zzso levels at 60 zzso with respect to zzso values was zzso in zzso zzso zzso at 0 zzso correlated directly with zzso level at 0 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There wasn't a significant correlation of zzso changes with zzso changes and insulin changes during zzso in obese children with insulin zzso 

In conclusion, in obese children with insulin resistance, zzso levels decreased with advancing zzso zzso zzso zzso suppression following zzso was influenced by gender and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels and zzso suppression after zzso did not significantly correlate with the degree of insulin resistance and insulin zzso
