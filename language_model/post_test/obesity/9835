The present study tested the zzso by examining the perceptions and attitudes of four very successful and four relatively unsuccessful adolescent weight controllers 1 year after completing immersion zzso We expected that successful weight zzso more so than unsuccessful weight zzso would report more elaborate definitions of their healthy obsessions and describe more negative reactions to potential and actual zzso zzso interviews were conducted using a version of the zzso Collaborative zzso zzso 

Reliable coding of the interviews produced results that supported the hypothesis that highly successful weight controllers seem to nurture strong healthy zzso including clear definitions of healthy zzso heightened commitment based on the emotional impact of excess weight, and negative reactions to zzso In addition, these adolescent weight controllers seemed motivated by some of the same factors that elite athletes identified in the Sport zzso Model zzso zzso and zzso zzso Social Support of zzso zzso and zzso Institutional zzso and zzso zzso
