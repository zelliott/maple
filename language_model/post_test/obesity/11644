zzso of obesity on gene expression for zzso peptides and zzso zzso in the zzso nucleus zzso and on zzso peptides and zzso stimulating hormone zzso in the zzso nucleus zzso were examined in obese zzso rats (18 weeks zzso zzso zzso rats are zzso diabetic and zzso as indicated by high serum zzso insulin and zzso zzso ARC zzso zzso zzso levels were significantly lower in the obese relative to lean zzso rats and ARC zzso Y zzso zzso levels were higher zzso There were no differences in zzso and zzso zzso levels in the ARC zzso zzso zzso rats had lower zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels in the zzso nucleus zzso zzso but did not have lower zzso zzso zzso levels zzso The decrease in zzso in the ARC and decrease in zzso in the zzso seen in the obese zzso rat in the present study suggest that reduced activity of the zzso system in the ARC to zzso zzso may contribute to the related zzso zzso activity of the zzso system in the ARC to zzso zzso may be due to a zzso of zzso signaling zzso to zzso
