zzso is a serious and rapidly growing health problem zzso Few therapies are available beyond diet, exercise and zzso zzso A previously approved medication, zzso has been withdrawn from the market due to concerns over the potential of increased risk of cardiovascular zzso events, based on a phase IV clinical trial that included only individuals at high risk for zzso zzso 

The aim of the study was to compare zzso users and matched zzso on rates of zzso events, both overall and zzso by whether the patient qualified for zzso zzso use, using data from real-life clinical zzso 

A retrospective cohort was constructed from electronic medical record data from physician office practices zzso primary care) in the UK and Germany, using the zzso database from IMS Health zzso For patients with at least one physician visit in which zzso was prescribed between 1 April 1999 and 31 October 2008, the date of their first such prescription was their index zzso Users and zzso were matched 1 : 1 on index date zzso 30 zzso sex, age group (six zzso zzso zzso Index and evidence of obesity zzso body mass index zzso or, if zzso was missing, diagnosis of obesity or very high weight relative to zzso The zzso total samples zzso were zzso in Germany and zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the samples were compared according to the ratio of their crude zzso rates of acute zzso zzso zzso stroke and either zzso or stroke per 1000 zzso of zzso Cox zzso analysis was used to compare the risk of zzso events as a hazard ratio zzso with zzso confidence intervals zzso between zzso user and zzso zzso controlling for label status and/or history of prior zzso disease at zzso 

The risk of zzso stroke and either zzso or stroke was not higher among zzso users than comparable zzso of zzso in both Germany and the UK zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Regardless of whether or not the model controlled for prior zzso disease zzso the direction and statistical significance of the differences did not zzso In the sensitivity analyses including only those without a history of zzso in the 365 days prior to the index date there was no increased risk of zzso events in either Germany or the zzso 

This study offers a framework for the safety assessment of zzso drugs using an zzso zzso study zzso Large electronic health databases were used to construct retrospective zzso to examine the risk in a population using one specific zzso zzso Use of zzso in general practice settings was not found to increase the risk of acute zzso zzso
