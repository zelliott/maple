zzso is becoming recognized as one of the most important risk factors for the development of zzso The purpose of the review is to examine the latest evidence linking hypertension to zzso zzso the benefits of weight reduction and present results of recent clinical trials evaluating zzso treatment in obese zzso 

zzso tissue has been directly implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso has been associated with unequivocal changes in cardiovascular structure and zzso In contrast to earlier studies, several recent trials included overweight and obese zzso Evidence of potential benefits of zzso blockade in the management of obesity hypertension is zzso zzso management in obese individuals is complicated by poorer response to treatment, and the increased need for multiple zzso It is important to consider zzso sleep zzso in obese patients with resistant zzso 

Several new lines of evidence suggest that drugs blocking the zzso system might be considered as zzso therapy of zzso zzso Recent progress in understanding the mechanisms of obesity and associated disease processes might lead to development of novel therapeutic zzso Further research in this area holds great promise for prevention of zzso cardiovascular zzso
