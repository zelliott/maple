zzso zzso levels are elevated in subjects with zzso zzso indicating that obesity is associated with zzso zzso Since in man no abnormalities have yet been found in either the genes for zzso or its zzso the mechanism of zzso resistance in obesity remains zzso To determine if resistance might be related to zzso binding by a serum zzso we assessed the carrier status of zzso in zzso The presence of a specific zzso binding factor in human serum has been established by zzso demonstrating zzso binding to a serum component that is zzso and specifically zzso only by zzso zzso and not by human growth hormone, pork insulin, zzso growth factors I and II, zzso or zzso stimulating hormones, transforming growth zzso 1, zzso or leukemia zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso bound serum complex and the serum zzso binding component on a molecular zzso column revealing a mass of approximately 450 zzso and zzso identifying an inverse correlation between the concentration of serum zzso and the quantity of the zzso binding zzso It is suggested that binding of zzso by this serum component may influence the zzso response to zzso
