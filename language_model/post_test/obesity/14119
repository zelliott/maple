zzso obesity increases risk of insulin resistance and type 2 zzso This may partly be due to a zzso resistance to zzso zzso effect in visceral zzso We investigated whether zzso tissue releases the vascular zzso zzso zzso and whether zzso could account for regional differences in zzso 

One group consisted of zzso obese and zzso zzso subjects in whom zzso levels were compared between abdominal subcutaneous and zzso blood zzso A second group included subjects undergoing zzso zzso zzso subcutaneous and visceral zzso zzso were obtained to study the effect of zzso on differentiated zzso regarding zzso and gene and protein zzso 

zzso tissue had a marked net release of zzso in zzso which was zzso increased in zzso In zzso treated with zzso the zzso effect of insulin was attenuated in visceral but not in subcutaneous zzso which could not be explained by effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso decreased the expression of insulin zzso insulin zzso zzso and zzso and increased the expression of zzso zzso zzso in visceral but not in subcutaneous zzso These effects were zzso via zzso with signals through protein zzso C and zzso zzso The effect of zzso could be zzso by zzso of zzso 

zzso is released from human zzso tissue and links fat zzso to insulin zzso It selectively zzso insulin zzso of visceral zzso zzso via zzso signaling zzso which affect multiple steps in insulin zzso
