Acute central nervous system administration of zzso Y zzso elicits variable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso produces obesity in zzso zzso has been shown to increase zzso zzso 

In this study we examined the chronic zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso rats were implanted with zzso zzso to continuously record heart rate and zzso pressure in the conscious zzso zzso Y or vehicle was delivered into the third cerebral zzso by zzso zzso over 2 zzso Three groups were zzso vehicle, zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso 

zzso Y increased food intake and body weight in zzso animals, and substantially zzso visceral zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso Despite increased zzso chronic zzso administration of zzso in conscious zzso rats did not increase zzso zzso zzso Y decreased heart rate, suggesting a zzso zzso 

zzso induced by zzso zzso administration of zzso does not increase zzso pressure, perhaps indicating zzso of sympathetic zzso that may oppose the zzso effect of zzso
