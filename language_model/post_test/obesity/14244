We zzso the zzso III sample to assess the suitability of measured stature and sitting height to estimate leg length zzso + zzso and predict zzso High rates of overweight in the United States population may lead to greater zzso fat mass which will increase sitting height and artificially decrease estimates of both absolute and relative leg zzso 

The analyses include zzso women and zzso men, zzso years of age of White, Black or Mexican-American zzso The poverty index ratio, measured zzso sitting zzso upper leg zzso weight, four zzso zzso circumference and elbow, zzso and zzso zzso were extracted from the zzso The sitting height ratio, % body zzso % upper leg length zzso and other zzso were zzso zzso and principle component analysis were used to assess the relationship between measures of body zzso relative leg length and the other zzso 

For adults in the zzso III % body fat is more strongly correlated with zzso circumference zzso zzso zzso and zzso for women and zzso than with any measure of estimated leg length zzso range from zzso to zzso for both zzso zzso components analysis separates zzso stature and estimated leg length into zzso factors for this zzso 

Reports of a negative association between leg length and zzso for adults of the zzso III are likely zzso due to greater zzso fat thickness increasing sitting zzso Future rounds of the zzso and similar surveys in other nations with high body fat zzso should measure lower zzso length directly to better assess its relationship to health and disease zzso
