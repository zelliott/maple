To determine whether the zzso breath test reflects the presence of increased zzso fibrosis, zzso and zzso following zzso zzso 21 patients were evaluated with liver zzso liver chemistry tests, zzso zzso retention tests, and zzso breath tests prior to bypass and at 3, 6, and 12 months zzso Following zzso 15 zzso demonstrated increased zzso fibrosis, zzso or zzso and 35 zzso revealed increased fatty zzso zzso Although the zzso breath test results were significantly lower in patients with increased zzso fibrosis, zzso and zzso at 6 and 12 months following bypass zzso less than zzso this test had a positive predictability of only zzso An abnormal zzso had a positive predictability of zzso Other liver function tests were less reliable in identifying patients with potentially progressive zzso following zzso Thus, the zzso is more useful than the zzso breath test in reflecting increased zzso fibrosis, zzso and zzso following zzso zzso The zzso effects of obesity and increased fatty zzso of the liver following zzso bypass may account for the low predictability of the zzso breath zzso
