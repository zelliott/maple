The objective of this study was to determine the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso on energy zzso including body weight and zzso energy zzso and plasma zzso zzso in zzso 

Male Golden Syrian zzso zzso zzso 50) were fed for 5 weeks with experimental diets varying in cholesterol and zzso zzso zzso included zzso zzso zzso diet without added zzso zzso zzso zzso diet with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso free zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso samples were collected continuously for 3 days on week 3, and zzso energy output was measured by bomb zzso 

zzso fed zzso zzso gained less zzso weight than zzso fed zzso and zzso zzso zzso had no effect on total food consumption or gross energy intake after 5 weeks, but lower zzso weekly food zzso in zzso fed zzso zzso were observed at weeks 1 and 2 of the experiment in comparison to animals fed the zzso zzso In comparison to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso energy output by 47 and zzso zzso In zzso supplemented with zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso were zzso lower zzso than in zzso fed zzso Furthermore, plasma zzso levels in the zzso zzso group was zzso lower zzso than in the zzso group, despite the fact that both diets contained equivalent amounts of zzso The lower concentration of zzso zzso also reduced plasma zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso 

zzso decreases body weight gain in zzso likely due to lower energy zzso at the zzso zzso In addition to its previously observed powerful cholesterol-lowering effect, zzso has a zzso function in zzso
