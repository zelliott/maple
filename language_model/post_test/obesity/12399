To analyze the expression of zzso zzso zzso and 2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso and zzso in zzso tissue zzso of obese women during weight loss following zzso gastric bypass zzso and to compare these levels with those obtained in AT of zzso zzso 

Gene expression was determined by real-time zzso prior to surgery and at 3, 6, and 12 months after zzso 

All obese patients lost weight, reaching a mean zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso at 1 year after surgery zzso zzso zzso of their initial body zzso In obese subjects zzso and zzso were zzso whereas zzso was expressed at lower levels compared to zzso After surgery, zzso and zzso gene expression zzso whereas zzso expression zzso At 12 months after zzso these 3 genes had reached levels similar to the zzso In contrast, zzso gene expression was not different between groups and types of tissue and remained unchanged during weight zzso We found a positive correlation between zzso and levels of gene expression of zzso and zzso 

Gene expression of zzso zzso and zzso in AT is modified in human zzso This default is completely corrected by zzso
