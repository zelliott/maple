We studied the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on serum zzso and tissue expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso in normal mice and mice with insulin resistance induced by zzso zzso diet zzso Sixteen weeks of zzso feeding induced obesity with liver zzso and increased insulin levels but did not significantly affect circulating zzso or zzso Treatment with zzso zzso zzso decreased body weight and fat pad weight and ameliorated liver zzso in zzso mice with zzso reduction in blood zzso free fatty acid, zzso serum insulin levels, and zzso model assessment index zzso zzso clamp demonstrated the development of zzso and liver insulin resistance in zzso mice, which were both zzso by zzso zzso treatment markedly increased circulating zzso levels on both diets and zzso levels in zzso mice zzso Fat zzso zzso expression was not affected by zzso zzso zzso zzso expression increased in subcutaneous but not zzso fat after zzso zzso In addition to fat, a significant amount of zzso zzso was also expressed in the zzso This expression markedly increased after zzso treatment in zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso tissue expression of zzso zzso was significantly reduced in zzso mice and increased after zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso ameliorated the development of insulin resistance in zzso mice despite a major increase in serum zzso zzso This effect could be partially explained by increased zzso expression in zzso tissue after zzso zzso
