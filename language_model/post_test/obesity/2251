To evaluate the zzso parameters and zzso zzso scores in obese children with zzso fatty liver disease zzso 

A total of 77 children diagnosed with zzso via liver biopsy were included and divided into 2 zzso according to the zzso staging of zzso zzso mild zzso 0-1) vs significant zzso zzso zzso Clinical and laboratory parameters were evaluated in each zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio, zzso ratio index zzso PGA index, zzso index, zzso zzso zzso score, and pediatric zzso zzso index zzso were zzso 

No clinical or zzso zzso exhibited a significant difference between patients with mild and significant zzso Among zzso zzso zzso scores, only zzso and zzso revealed a significant difference between patients with mild and significant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The area under the receiving operating characteristic curve of zzso was zzso followed by zzso index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso score zzso zzso ratio zzso PGA score zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso might be useful zzso zzso zzso scores for predicting zzso zzso in children with zzso
