To explore the zzso of the tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso system and their relationship with plasma zzso zzso 

We studied a cohort of 157 diabetic and zzso females with a wide range of zzso distributed into five groups: zzso mass index zzso between 19 and 27 zzso zzso zzso between 27 and 40 zzso zzso obese type 2 diabetes zzso between 27 and 40 zzso with diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso obese type 2 diabetes zzso zzso with diabetes zzso zzso zzso levels, plasma total zzso and cholesterol, zzso low- and very zzso zzso cholesterol were zzso by zzso and zzso zzso Plasma zzso levels were measured by zzso zzso and insulin and zzso levels by zzso zzso Both soluble zzso zzso receptors were measured by zzso zzso 

All groups of patients showed significant increases in both zzso receptors relative to zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso was higher in zzso obese diabetic individuals compared with their zzso counterparts zzso while zzso was significantly different between obese and zzso obese subjects zzso zzso correlation analysis showed a significant relationship between both plasma zzso receptors and zzso percentage of body fat, zzso zzso insulin and zzso In zzso analysis, both zzso zzso plasma levels were predicted by percentage of body fat and the presence of diabetes zzso for zzso and zzso When plasma zzso levels were added into the model, this protein and the presence of diabetes explained zzso of the zzso of the plasma zzso zzso 

The presence of diabetes, zzso or zzso levels are independent zzso of both zzso zzso The independent association between plasma zzso receptors and zzso levels in obese patients is consistent with the hypothesis that these proteins could be involved in the same zzso that regulates body zzso
