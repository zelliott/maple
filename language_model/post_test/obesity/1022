Fourteen obese zzso zzso mass index zzso seven non-obese zzso zzso and five obese zzso zzso 

We first examined the influence of insulin on the proliferation of several human cell zzso Second, we compared several immune functions between obese and non-obese zzso and obese zzso patients using peripheral blood zzso zzso 

zzso decreased proliferation of zzso lines but not that of other types of cell zzso Furthermore, obesity zzso the production of zzso which could have zzso against zzso beta cells in zzso 

Our data suggested that the zzso of zzso could be affected by the change of immunity due to zzso and the treatment of obesity in zzso may be important from an zzso zzso
