The use of low-calorie diets is a common strategy for zzso reduction purposes, but the zzso of the zzso changes induced by moderately zzso otherwise zzso diets is still poorly zzso The aim of this nutritional intervention design was to study in obese women the effect of a balanced low-calorie diet on the zzso rate, and zzso fuel zzso changes during the weight loss process through the application of breath tests with stable zzso zzso Seven obese zzso mass zzso zzso women were assigned to a zzso dietary zzso intervention regime zzso zzso of energy as zzso zzso as fat and zzso as zzso zzso rate and zzso zzso were evaluated for 6 h in separate occasions during the weight loss program by indirect zzso and after zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Body weight loss after 10 weeks was zzso zzso while the percent body fat decrease was about zzso zzso was accompanied by a marked decrease in zzso zzso (about zzso zzso zzso zzso after the administration of a test meal with the same zzso distribution as the experimental low-energy diet was decreased zzso zzso as a consequence of the dietary zzso which was associated with lower insulin plasma levels zzso Although protein and zzso zzso were not significantly different after weight reduction zzso 1 versus day zzso the zzso zzso of these zzso tended to zzso Moreover, marginally significant indications obtained on days 15 and 45 suggest that the weight and body composition changes are attributable to a shift in zzso and zzso zzso zzso in favor of zzso zzso The breath tests zzso which were performed on different occasions along the experimental trial, confirmed that the cumulative zzso output decreased for labeled zzso with time, being only statistically significant for the zzso zzso between days 15 and zzso In zzso the weight and fat mass losses were associated with a lower zzso zzso which were probably compensated by an increase in zzso zzso without major changes in protein zzso
