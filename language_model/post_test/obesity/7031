The zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes an zzso that has been reported as a zzso zzso until zzso We have demonstrated that zzso is differently expressed in various mouse white zzso zzso depending on their zzso Its expression is associated with a higher ratio of zzso zzso zzso The cells that express zzso did not contain zzso zzso and the expression level of zzso was very low in mature zzso We have defined the role of zzso in zzso using either primary cultures of zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso or the zzso cell zzso Under the same differentiation conditions, zzso zzso cells from zzso that expressed zzso had a decreased capacity to accumulate lipids compared with those that did not express zzso Moreover, the zzso of sense or zzso zzso in zzso zzso inhibited or accelerated, respectively, their rate of differentiation into zzso In zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso zzso expression decreased in zzso zzso from mice where obesity was induced by a high-fat zzso All these results attributed for the first time a novel role to zzso which is the zzso of zzso in some zzso zzso
