zzso obese zzso zzso rats present an impaired response of zzso zzso production to the zzso by zzso In this work, we have investigated the zzso by this hormone of zzso zzso in zzso isolated from obese zzso rats and their lean zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso caused a zzso stimulation of zzso conversion to zzso in zzso isolated from either obese or lean zzso The stimulation of zzso by zzso was accompanied by a significant reduction of zzso zzso levels, an zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso and by a zzso increase in the cellular zzso of zzso The presence of insulin in the incubation medium zzso in a zzso manner, the effects of zzso In zzso isolated from lean rats, the zzso caused by insulin was complete, the concentration required for zzso insulin action ranging from zzso to zzso zzso In contrast, in obese rat zzso insulin only partially blocked zzso effects, and the sensitivity to insulin was zzso to zzso lower, as indicated by the corresponding zzso insulin action zzso Furthermore, insulin (10 zzso almost completely blocked the increase in zzso levels induced by zzso in lean rat zzso whereas it only provoked a small and zzso reduction of zzso levels of the zzso zzso in zzso obtained from obese zzso
