In southern and eastern Mediterranean countries, changes in lifestyle and the increasing prevalence of excess weight in childhood are risk factors for high blood pressure zzso during adolescence and zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso status of zzso adolescents and to identify associated zzso 

A zzso study in 2005, based on a zzso zzso random cluster sample of zzso boys and zzso girls aged zzso surveyed in home zzso The zzso and behavioral characteristics of the adolescents were zzso zzso were assessed by Body Mass Index zzso from measured height and weight zzso 2007), abdominal obesity by waist circumference zzso zzso was measured twice during the same zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso or zzso blood pressure zzso zzso 90th of the international reference or zzso zzso zzso zzso for 15-17 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso hypertension was zzso zzso 95th for 15-17 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso associations were assessed by zzso zzso 

The prevalence of elevated zzso was zzso higher among boys zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso of adolescents had zzso zzso adjusted for all zzso showed independent relationships with zzso and zzso - obesity zzso no excess weight increased elevated zzso zzso OR zzso zzso girls OR zzso zzso and hypertension zzso OR zzso zzso girls OR zzso zzso - abdominal obesity zzso was also associated with elevated zzso in both genders (for boys: 2nd zzso 1st zzso OR zzso zzso 3rd zzso zzso OR zzso zzso for zzso 2nd zzso 1st zzso OR zzso zzso 3rd zzso zzso OR zzso zzso but only among boys for zzso zzso with other zzso were zzso for boys, hypertension increased somewhat with sedentary lifestyle, while elevated zzso was slightly more prevalent among urban girls and those not attending zzso 

Within the limits of zzso measurement on one visit only, these results suggest that zzso adolescents of both genders are likely not spared from early elevated zzso Though further assessment is likely needed, the strong association with zzso observed suggests that interventions aimed at changing lifestyles to reduce this main risk factor may also be appropriate for the prevention of elevated zzso
