Over recent decades, the prevalence of obesity has increased dramatically zzso Although this epidemic is mainly attributable to modern zzso lifestyle, multiple twin and adoption studies indicate the significant role of genes in the zzso predisposition to becoming zzso As the zzso plays a central role in controlling body weight, its regulatory circuits may represent a crucial system in the zzso of the zzso zzso variations in genes in the zzso pathways may therefore contribute to the zzso for obesity in humans and zzso We zzso current knowledge on the zzso role of the zzso in zzso regulation and review genetic studies on the zzso candidate genes in relation to zzso Together, data from functional and genetic studies as well as the new, common, obesity zzso identified in zzso association scans support an important role for the zzso genes in zzso to zzso However, findings are still zzso for many candidate zzso To improve our understanding of the genetic architecture of common zzso we suggest that specific obesity zzso should be considered and different zzso approaches zzso Such studies should consider multiple genes from the same zzso zzso together with environmental risk zzso
