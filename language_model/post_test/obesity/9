This disposition of zzso was examined in an overfed rat model of human obesity following zzso administration of a zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso dose based upon ideal body zzso zzso zzso rats were maintained on a nutritionally complete zzso diet containing zzso vegetable zzso and were compared to animals given a standard laboratory diet over the same zzso zzso At the time of study obese rats zzso controls by zzso zzso zzso 32 g zzso 450 zzso 7 zzso zzso The absolute clearance of zzso from plasma increased by zzso in obese zzso Higher partial formation clearance to zzso zzso and zzso zzso accounted for most of this zzso zzso by zzso zzso was also substantially increased zzso indicating that metabolism via toxic zzso also occurred at a greater rate in obese zzso Absolute zzso clearance of the zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso increased with zzso whereas parent volume of distribution remained zzso Some rats raised on the zzso diet remained lean and were examined separately as a dietary control zzso zzso disposition in these animals was indistinguishable from zzso controls, suggesting that zzso elimination changes in overweight animals resulted from obesity itself and not from the obesity inducing zzso zzso Although animals placed on the zzso diet ate fewer grams of food per day, their caloric intake was similar to that of zzso animals when adjusted for differences in body weight and caloric content of the zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
