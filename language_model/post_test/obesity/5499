To determine parental influences on zzso the eating behavior of 80 obese and normal weight children zzso 8-12 zzso was investigated in the zzso 

A controlled repeated measures design was zzso The mother was either present or absent while the child was eating in the zzso The eating style was measured by recording cumulative eating zzso with a universal eating zzso using zzso as a standardized experimental zzso 

The eating behavior of obese children differed significantly from normal weight children only when the mother was present in the zzso zzso children ate faster with larger bites and showed an acceleration of their eating rate toward the end of the zzso 

Such an eating style can be hypothesized to explain an increased calorie intake in obese children, promoting a positive energy balance in the long zzso The data support a learning model of obesity in childhood, which also has implications for family zzso
