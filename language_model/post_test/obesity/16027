The zzso link between obesity and hypertension is more clearly emerging to be one between insulin resistance and zzso Relative insulin resistance occurs not only in obese zzso patients but also in non-obese lean essential zzso zzso Although insulin has complex actions on the zzso plausible mechanisms by which insulin might raise blood pressure include zzso sodium retention and stimulation of the sympathetic nervous zzso However, the evidence that insulin can actually raise blood pressure in the long-term is zzso Since hypertension does not develop in all obese or zzso subjects, the relationship must be modulated by other genetic or environmental zzso zzso diminished physical zzso aging, and diabetes are ubiquitous contributors to relative insulin resistance and all are associated with a tendency for blood pressure to zzso zzso and agents associated with acquired insulin resistance and secondary forms of hypertension include pregnancy, oral zzso zzso and zzso Although type 2 zzso diabetes is a state of increased insulin resistance, hypertension is partly sustained by secondary zzso zzso Future research should identify the genetic and environmental zzso of insulin resistance in hypertension and zzso these in zzso
