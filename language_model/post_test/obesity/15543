In a retrospective zzso study we assessed whether and how zzso former fractures sustained at the ages of zzso are associated with subsequent fractures sustained at the ages of zzso The zzso women who responded to fracture questions of the baseline postal zzso (in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Finland formed the study zzso They reported zzso former and zzso subsequent zzso The hazard ratio zzso with zzso confidence zzso zzso of a subsequent fracture was zzso zzso in women with the history of a former fracture compared with women without such a zzso A former low-energy wrist fracture was related to subsequent low-energy wrist zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fractures, whereas former zzso zzso fractures were related only to subsequent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not to low-energy wrist zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The analysis of bone mineral density zzso data of a zzso of zzso women who underwent dual zzso zzso zzso during zzso revealed that those with a wrist fracture due to a fall on the same level at the age of zzso recorded zzso lower spinal zzso zzso zzso and zzso lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso women, whereas the corresponding differences for women with a former zzso fracture due to zzso trauma were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that an early zzso low-energy wrist fracture is an indicator of low peak zzso which zzso to subsequent fractures in general, whereas early zzso fractures are mainly indicators of other and more specific zzso factors which mainly zzso to same types of subsequent fractures zzso
