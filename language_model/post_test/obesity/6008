zzso is a risk factor for several zzso although appears to have an inverse association with zzso strongly related to zzso zzso obesity is difficult due to numerous biases and zzso 

To avoid these biases we used a zzso zzso approach incorporating an analysis of zzso in the zzso gene that are strongly associated with zzso levels among zzso subjects from a study of zzso kidney and zzso zzso 

The zzso A zzso which is linked with increased zzso was associated with a decreased risk of lung cancer zzso odds ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso It was also associated with a weak increased risk of kidney cancer, which was more apparent before the age of 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our results highlight the potential for genetic variation to act as an zzso marker of environmentally modifiable factors, and offer the potential to obtain estimates of the zzso effect of zzso However, far larger sample sizes than studied here will be required to undertake this with zzso
