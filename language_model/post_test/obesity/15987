The purpose of these experiments was to determine whether the activity of the zzso zzso channel was modulated in the same manner in zzso of the zzso mouse as in zzso of zzso lean mice of the same zzso The effect of agents that are known to alter the zzso and movements of zzso zzso were investigated in relation to zzso insulin zzso and in relation to the effect of zzso In zzso of obese mice, zzso and zzso both inhibited zzso insulin release, zzso being the more potent zzso zzso zzso was inhibited either not at all zzso or much less zzso in zzso of the zzso mouse compared with those of lean zzso At zzso zzso zzso zzso initiated insulin zzso in zzso of the zzso mouse and acted zzso with zzso to evoke a zzso activity that was zzso greater than that evoked by 20 zzso zzso also initiated zzso at zzso zzso zzso and acted zzso with zzso but its effect was considerably smaller than that of zzso A comparison of the effect of zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and in the absence of zzso suggests that, in the obese zzso the operation of the zzso zzso channel is zzso
