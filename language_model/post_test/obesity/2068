A new series of zzso derivatives was obtained by incorporating one or the other of the two zzso of the central chain into different zzso These compounds lower blood zzso levels in the genetically obese and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, they decreased insulin and zzso levels in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the left hand carbon of the chain afforded compounds among which zzso derivatives 5, 9 and 13 were the most zzso The same carbon atom was used to elaborate different types of rings zzso zzso giving rise to compounds 14 and 19 with moderate to good zzso Finally, zzso using the right hand carbon of the chain gave rise to highly potent zzso zzso
