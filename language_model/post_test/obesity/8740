zzso is a more potent cardiovascular risk factor zzso in men than in zzso Because traditional zzso cannot fully account for this sex difference, we tested the hypothesis that compared with men, women exhibit more robust zzso function independent of obesity and that this sex difference is zzso by zzso 

We studied leg blood flow zzso responses to graded zzso artery infusions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso in groups of lean, obese zzso and type II diabetic zzso zzso women and zzso and body mass zzso zzso zzso response to zzso administration of zzso an inhibitor of zzso oxide zzso was also assessed in normal men and zzso zzso zzso increments in response to zzso were zzso versus zzso in lean women versus men zzso and zzso versus zzso in zzso women versus men zzso zzso In zzso maximum zzso increments in response to zzso were zzso and zzso in women and men, respectively, zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso were zzso and zzso in women and men, respectively zzso The response to zzso was not different between sexes and zzso 

zzso zzso women exhibit more robust zzso zzso zzso to higher rates of zzso oxide release than zzso Given the protective vascular action of zzso oxide, this difference may partially explain the lower zzso of zzso disease in zzso In zzso women, zzso causes impairment of zzso function beyond that observed with obesity alone and leads to zzso dysfunction similar to that observed in zzso zzso These findings may help explain the similar rates of coronary artery disease and mortality in diabetic men and zzso
