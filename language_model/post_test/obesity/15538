Table 1 is a synopsis of the major findings from an extensive literature on the association between human body zzso and coronary heart zzso zzso some studies have used quite sophisticated laboratory procedures to zzso body fat most have relied upon zzso zzso to determine some component of body zzso Of these, body weight and height are the simplest zzso and are, therefore, zzso to large-scale prospective zzso Height and weight are highly zzso zzso although in the short term, weight can have considerable zzso variation associated with gastric zzso and state of zzso Less reliable zzso than height and weight are zzso and body zzso both of which have been used extensively in zzso and prospective zzso For zzso both the zzso and zzso zzso is affected by the measurement technique, location of the zzso site, the zzso zzso used and zzso zzso As measurement error has been shown to be a function of zzso zzso accurate and zzso zzso zzso are particularly difficult to make in the zzso In these subjects, it is not always possible to locate a specific anatomical zzso landmark or to pull a parallel zzso away from the underlying zzso Furthermore, in the extremely obese it is sometimes possible for a zzso to be thicker than the jaws of the currently available commercial zzso zzso body zzso are zzso in all subjects and have greater zzso than zzso They are, therefore, the preferred method in obese zzso However, there is considerable work to be done to establish their association with body zzso The evidence examined in this review suggests that body weight is a poor predictor of coronary heart zzso Some studies have reported no difference in the body weight of coronary heart disease patients compared to subjects free of the disease, others found the body weight of subjects with coronary heart disease to be slightly greater, and one found the body weight of cardiac patients to be less than zzso zzso however, is associated with coronary heart disease in prospective studies with long-term and zzso follow-up periods and zzso zzso zzso infant and childhood zzso may link shorter adult height and zzso to cardiovascular zzso Many researchers have studied the relationship between overweight and coronary heart disease by using a surrogate measurement of body zzso such as relative weight or a zzso zzso In general, results produced by these studies suggest zzso zzso particularly the often used body mass index, are not strong zzso of coronary heart zzso zzso zzso designs have consistently failed to show a relationship between body mass index and coronary heart zzso zzso results from prospective studies, however, are difficult to zzso To further confuse the situation, the body mass index has been examined in relation to different coronary heart disease zzso and adjusted for different zzso zzso Explaining the inconsistent results on the basis of length of follow-up is also not zzso When follow-up periods exceed 20 years, and sample size is small, however, this closer association has not been found, even with a long follow-up zzso zzso some studies have found no association after 15, 13 and 12 years others have reported a relationship after zzso 10, 12, 10 and 7 zzso The 22 year follow-up evidence from the zzso Study shows the strongest zzso association between body mass index and coronary heart zzso zzso zzso
