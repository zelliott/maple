The aim of this study was to describe the feasibility and morbidity rates associated with total zzso radical zzso zzso with or without pelvic zzso for stage I zzso cancer in obese zzso 

zzso patients with stage I zzso cancer who underwent total zzso radical surgery at the Department of zzso and zzso of San zzso Hospital were compared to zzso zzso The same group of obese patients was compared with patients who underwent radical zzso zzso zzso was defined as a body mass index more than 30 zzso 

Between September 2003 and September 2007, 75 women underwent zzso Median age was 54 years and median body mass index was 28 zzso zzso women were zzso There were no differences between zzso and obese women in zzso time length of zzso and pelvic zzso removed and operative or late zzso Blood loss was significantly higher in obese zzso Comparing zzso zzso and zzso in obese women treated in our center, zzso was associated with decreased operative time, but also with increased blood loss, zzso rate, duration of hospitalization and frequency of post surgical zzso 

Total zzso radical zzso (with pelvic zzso is a safe option in patients with zzso zzso zzso is not a zzso to perform a zzso with no differences in surgical parameters between obese and zzso zzso zzso show a significant decrease of complications compared to zzso radical surgery in obese zzso
