zzso is a risk factor for zzso zzso We studied the relationships between the body mass index zzso and the zzso pattern of blood pressure zzso zzso function and sodium and water zzso zzso in a group of 25 moderately zzso zzso men (41 zzso 2 zzso 80 zzso 3 zzso zzso were given a high sodium diet (6 g zzso added to their usual diet, daily zzso zzso On the 7th day, zzso was monitored during 24 h and urine collected in 2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were a zzso divided into 2 groups according to the median zzso zzso zzso Group 1, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Group 2, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No difference was observed between the two groups for age, 24 h urine and sodium zzso or zzso and zzso zzso However, heart rate was significantly higher during N in Group 2 zzso zzso 2 vs 57 zzso 2 zzso zzso Na and water zzso were significantly higher during D than during N in Group 1, but lower during D than during N in Group zzso zzso clearance was higher in Group 2 than in Group 1 especially during N zzso zzso zzso zzso In Group 2, subjects concentrated their urine more than in Group 1, as evaluated from the zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso This ratio was positively correlated to zzso during D zzso zzso but not during zzso These results show that the zzso zzso associated with overweight is more intense at night and that moderately overweight zzso have a reduced sodium and water zzso during the day and a zzso larger zzso at zzso The reduced zzso zzso goes along with an increased urine zzso The nocturnal rise in zzso is zzso with a rise in heart zzso Given the growing health problems linked to obesity and hypertension, these results open a new field for the understanding of the difficulty to zzso sodium in this zzso
