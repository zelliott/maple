zzso results exist regarding bone mineral density zzso metabolism and zzso function of adult patients with zzso adrenal zzso zzso We evaluated the long-term outcome and the impact of chronic zzso replacement in these zzso 

Physical zzso serum hormone zzso zzso and metabolism were studied in 45 consecutive zzso adult zzso 

Among the 36 women, only 14 zzso had regular zzso Among the 27 women with classical zzso the mean number of surgical reconstructions of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso Twenty of them zzso were sexually zzso Three men presented with zzso adrenal rest zzso Twenty-five patients zzso had decreased zzso at the zzso neck and/or at the zzso zzso zzso was correlated with the zzso zzso at the zzso neck zzso zzso and at the zzso spine zzso zzso zzso dose was zzso correlated with the zzso zzso at the zzso neck zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso had a significantly lower zzso and received higher zzso dose than those with normal zzso zzso was found in 21 patients zzso There was a significantly positive correlation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and between zzso and zzso levels zzso zzso zzso 

Adult patients with zzso treated with long-term zzso are at risk for decreased zzso increased zzso and disturbed zzso zzso
