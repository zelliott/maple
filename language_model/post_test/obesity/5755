Recent findings indicate that zzso zzso are involved in the regulatory network of zzso and zzso Thus far, only a few human zzso are known to function as zzso regulators, fanning interest in studies on the functional role of zzso during zzso in zzso In a previous study, we used a zzso to assess zzso expression during human zzso zzso We found that expression of the zzso was increased in mature zzso zzso is an zzso zzso located in the zzso of zzso zzso terminal domain, zzso zzso II, zzso A, small zzso zzso Target prediction and zzso zzso analyses revealed the zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso as a putative target zzso In this study, we found that zzso was gradually zzso during zzso zzso To understand the roles of zzso in zzso we adopted a zzso approach to silence zzso zzso in human zzso We found that zzso zzso effectively suppressed zzso zzso as evidenced by decreased zzso droplets and the ability of zzso to decrease zzso levels of zzso molecular markers and zzso zzso Furthermore, the cell growth zzso revealed that zzso zzso promoted zzso Nevertheless, it had no effect on zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso may be involved in zzso and could be targeted for therapeutic intervention in zzso
