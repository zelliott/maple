The increasing prevalence of obesity and related zzso disorders zzso with increasing exposure to light at zzso Previous studies report that mice exposed to dim light at night zzso develop symptoms of zzso zzso This study investigated whether mice returned to dark nights after zzso exposure recover zzso zzso 

Male zzso mice were assigned to either: standard zzso zzso conditions for 8 weeks zzso zzso for 8 weeks zzso zzso for 4 weeks followed by 4 weeks of zzso zzso and zzso for 4 weeks followed by 4 weeks of zzso zzso 

After 4 weeks in their respective lighting conditions both groups initially placed in zzso increased body mass gain compared to zzso zzso Half of the zzso mice zzso were then transferred to zzso and vice versa zzso Following the transfer zzso and zzso mice gained more weight than zzso and zzso zzso At the conclusion of the study zzso mice did not differ from zzso mice with respect to weight gain and had lower fat pad mass compared to zzso zzso Compared to all other groups zzso mice decreased zzso tolerance as indicated by an zzso zzso tolerance test at week 7, indicating that zzso mice recovered zzso zzso zzso mice also increased zzso zzso expression in peripheral fat as compared to both zzso and zzso mice, suggesting peripheral inflammation is induced by zzso but not sustained after return to zzso 

These results suggest that zzso to dark nights ameliorates zzso disruption caused by zzso zzso
