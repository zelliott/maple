Eight zzso zzso obese zzso pigs were sacrificed at 45 zzso live weight and an average age of 170 days and were compared with a group of zzso lean zzso pigs fed the same zzso and sacrificed at either 45 zzso zzso age 130 zzso or at 170 days zzso live weight 90 zzso Body composition and various carcass zzso in zzso zzso tissue metabolism and muscle composition were zzso At equal weight, the obese pig had a greater percent body fat (40 zzso zzso and zzso thickness zzso zzso zzso zzso than the zzso At equal age, the difference in percent body fat was not as great (40 zzso zzso while zzso thickness was zzso zzso body protein was greater in the lean pigs at either equal weight or equal zzso In zzso zzso per 100 zzso zzso zzso was lower in obese pigs than in lean pigs at equal zzso However, obese tissue exhibited a greater zzso zzso to zzso stimulation than zzso tissue from lean pigs at equal zzso zzso zzso per total fat mass was zzso At equal age, no differences in zzso between lean and obese pigs were zzso When compared at either equal age or equal weight, weight of zzso muscle, and zzso of muscle zzso and DNA were greater in lean compared to obese zzso zzso ratios were similar at equal weight and age whereas the zzso ratio was lower in lean muscle compared to obese at equal zzso The decreased protein deposition in the obese, zzso pigs appeared due to fewer muscle zzso rather than a decreased cellular capacity for protein zzso
