zzso synthesis in skeletal muscle is markedly zzso zzso zzso of control zzso within 3 h of oral feeding in mice subjected to an overnight fast (18 zzso The stimulation of protein synthesis is the result of a faster rate of translation zzso however, neither the zzso zzso hormones or zzso nor the mechanisms responsible for the effect of feeding are well zzso zzso of the present study revealed that the amount of zzso initiation factor zzso zzso present in the zzso form zzso zzso was not changed after overnight zzso or a subsequent zzso zzso period compared with muscles from freely fed zzso In contrast, the zzso state of the zzso binding protein 1 zzso was changed with nutritional zzso zzso increased the proportion of the zzso form of zzso whereas feeding promoted a shift to the more highly zzso forms of the zzso Moreover, zzso increased the amount of zzso recovered by almost zzso indicative of an increase in the zzso zzso The increased association of zzso with zzso was completely reversed within 3 h of zzso zzso and zzso also altered the amount of zzso that zzso with zzso However, in contrast to the results obtained for zzso zzso decreased the amount of zzso recovered in the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso causes a decrease in the formation of the active zzso zzso The zzso in zzso zzso and association of zzso and zzso with zzso observed in control mice in response to zzso and zzso were also observed in diabetic mice exhibiting characteristics of type I or type II diabetes subjected to the same conditions, suggesting that insulin alone does not mediate the observed zzso Thus the integrated feeding response represents an important area of investigation for understanding the regulation of translation zzso
