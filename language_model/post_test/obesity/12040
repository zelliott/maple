zzso is a common disorder, and related diseases such as diabetes, zzso hypertension, cardiovascular disease and cancer are a major cause of mortality and morbidity in zzso zzso Development of obesity is associated with extensive modifications in zzso tissue involving zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso systems cooperate in these zzso zzso is tightly associated with zzso as shown by the findings that zzso tissue zzso trigger blood vessel formation, whereas in turn zzso tissue zzso cells promote zzso zzso A nutritionally induced obesity model in transgenic mice has been used extensively to study the role of the zzso and zzso systems and of zzso in the development of zzso Most studies support a role of these systems in zzso and zzso and suggest that their zzso may affect development of zzso zzso Such models have also shown that treatment of obese female mice with zzso has the potential to improve zzso insulin resistance and zzso zzso via decreased expression of zzso zzso Thus, zzso models of obesity have been very useful tools to study mechanisms of zzso tissue development, as well as effects of hormonal zzso
