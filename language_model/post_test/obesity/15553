The zzso were screened by zzso chain reaction with subsequent restriction zzso length zzso zzso zzso Data were statistically zzso for zzso In addition to these case control studies, the transmission zzso test zzso was applied to 80 families of obese zzso and to 52 families of patients with zzso 

Both the tests for association and linkage were zzso The zzso zzso zzso in the three weight groups zzso zzso normal zzso zzso zzso zzso and the AN patients zzso were zzso Extremely obese individuals showed no excess of the zzso zzso No zzso for the zzso zzso were zzso
