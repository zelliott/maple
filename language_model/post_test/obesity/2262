Although it is known that obesity has a profound effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso image quality and patient organ dose, quantitative data describing this relationship are not currently zzso This study examines the effect of obesity on the calculated radiation dose to zzso and zzso from CT using newly developed zzso representing overweight and obese zzso These zzso were derived from the previously developed zzso male and female zzso zzso The result was a set of ten zzso (five zzso five zzso with body mass indexes ranging from zzso zzso body zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso were modeled using triangular mesh geometry and include specified amounts of the subcutaneous zzso tissue and visceral zzso zzso The zzso zzso were then zzso and defined in the zzso Carlo zzso zzso code to calculate organ doses from CT zzso zzso scanning protocols for a GE zzso 16 scanner operating at 120 and 140 zzso were zzso It was found that for the same scanner operating zzso radiation doses to zzso deep in the abdomen zzso zzso can be up to 59% smaller for obese individuals compared to those of normal body zzso This effect was found to be less significant for shallow zzso On the other hand, increasing the tube potential from 120 to 140 zzso for the same obese individual resulted in increased organ doses by as much as zzso for zzso within the scan field zzso zzso and zzso for those out of the scan field zzso zzso zzso As higher tube currents are often used for larger patients to maintain image quality, it was of interest to zzso the associated effective zzso It was found from this study that when the zzso was doubled for the obese zzso obese zzso and zzso zzso the effective dose relative to that of the normal weight phantom increased by zzso zzso and zzso zzso This set of new obese zzso can be used in the future to study the zzso of image quality and radiation dose for patients of different weight zzso Our ultimate goal is to compile all the data derived from these zzso into a comprehensive zzso database defined in the zzso zzso
