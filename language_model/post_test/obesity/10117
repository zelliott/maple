zzso fatty acid binding protein zzso zzso in the metabolism of fatty acids in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 54 of the zzso gene has been suggested as regulating the zzso of zzso fatty zzso We examined the fatty acid composition of serum zzso zzso and the concentration of serum free fatty acids after an overnight fast in obese subjects, aged zzso years, on their habitual zzso The body mass index of the subjects ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso Six subjects were zzso for the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 37 subjects were zzso for the zzso zzso and 24 subjects were zzso for the zzso zzso We did not find any consistent differences in the proportions of zzso fatty acids in serum zzso cholesterol zzso or zzso but the concentration of serum free fatty acids tended to be higher in subjects who were zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso In conclusion, our findings suggest that a zzso at zzso 54 of the zzso gene does not substantially modify the fatty acid composition of serum lipids in obese zzso
