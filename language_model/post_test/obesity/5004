zzso of the human zzso has yielded thousands of potential drug zzso The difficulty now is in determining which targets have real therapeutic value and should be the focus of a drug discovery zzso The available evidence suggests that knockout technology can be used zzso to identify targets that are amenable to drug development for the treatment of a variety of zzso This review compares the knockout zzso of 21 potential obesity targets with the effects of zzso designed for those targets on zzso and, when data were available, on zzso The zzso of obesity target zzso model the effects seen when zzso designed for those obesity targets are delivered to zzso of the 21 obesity targets zzso 16 showed a correspondence between knockout zzso and drug effect in mice and/or zzso This suggests that, at least in terms of evaluating obesity targets, it is rare for zzso zzso changes caused by the gene knockout to prevent detection of the relevant zzso In the majority of cases, the knockout zzso also zzso the effects seen when the relevant zzso were delivered to zzso Thus, it seems rational to use mouse knockout technology zzso to identify genes that regulate body fat in zzso and then to develop zzso zzso by targeting the human protein products of these zzso Ultimately, the value of using this approach to identify novel targets for human zzso therapies will be judged by future studies examining the zzso effect, in humans, of the zzso that result from this zzso
