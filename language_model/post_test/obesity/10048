To evaluate whether body mass index zzso is a representative equivalent measure of body zzso independent of age, race, zzso sexual zzso and distribution of fat in children and zzso 

zzso study of 192 healthy subjects zzso boys and 92 girls, 103 white and 89 zzso age 7 to 17 zzso zzso Height and weight were measured in the standard fashion, and zzso zzso was calculated from these zzso Fat mass and percent body fat were determined using zzso zzso zzso Sexual maturation was evaluated by physical zzso Distribution of fat was determined by the zzso zzso 

There were no significant differences by gender and ethnic group for any of the demographic or zzso zzso except zzso ratio, which was higher in white compared with black zzso zzso was significantly and positively correlated with age, stage of zzso and all of the zzso variables in each zzso zzso The correlation of maturation stage with zzso was stronger than the correlation between age and zzso A multiple zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso race, sexual zzso and distribution of fat were all significant independent zzso of the percent body fat (multiple R zzso zzso The percent body zzso relationship was dependent on the stage of sexual zzso gender (for an equivalent zzso girls have greater amounts of body fat than zzso race (for equivalent zzso whites have higher body fat than zzso and zzso ratio (for equivalent zzso those with central obesity have greater body zzso than those with peripheral zzso 

zzso is not an equivalent measure of the percent body fat for each zzso zzso When zzso is used as a measure of body zzso in a research or clinical setting, particularly when comparisons are made across race and zzso it may be important to consider the maturation stage, race, zzso and distribution of body fat in the interpretation of the zzso
