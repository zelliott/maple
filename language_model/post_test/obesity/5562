Assessment of the effects of zzso 120 zzso three times daily vs zzso on weight loss and serum lipids in obese zzso zzso 

A 24 week zzso zzso randomized, zzso zzso After a zzso zzso zzso period zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of calories as zzso zzso patients were submitted to the zzso diet and randomly assigned to either zzso 120 zzso or zzso three times zzso Patients who completed the zzso study zzso were eligible for participation in a subsequent 24 week zzso zzso extension zzso 

Patients with body mass index zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cholesterol, zzso zzso zzso 

zzso assessments included weight loss, zzso levels, other cardiovascular risk factors and zzso zzso Safety zzso
