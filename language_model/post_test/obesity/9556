Blood pressure zzso was followed simultaneously with body weight in zzso zzso obese patients zzso to either zzso bypass (101 zzso or dietary treatment zzso zzso After a median observation time of 24 months zzso zzso zzso body weight fell significantly from a median of zzso zzso to zzso zzso in the zzso bypass patients whilst median zzso decreased significantly from zzso zzso to zzso zzso In the patients treated with diet, body weight decreased significantly from a median of zzso zzso to zzso zzso after a median observation time of 18 months zzso zzso zzso whereas the median zzso of zzso zzso was zzso The fall in zzso after weight loss was significantly positively correlated with the height of zzso before the weight zzso The correlation could not be explained by a greater weight loss in the patients with initially high zzso Furthermore, a significantly positive correlation between zzso changes and body weight changes was demonstrated, but this correlation was lesser than the zzso The study shows that the beneficial effect of a weight loss upon zzso in obese patients is greater the higher the initial zzso is, but also that a normal zzso is only little affected and explained mainly by cuff zzso
