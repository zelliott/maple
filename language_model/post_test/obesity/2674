zzso exerts a zzso effect on appetite and regulates energy zzso zzso gene zzso have been shown to be associated with zzso traits, although there is evidence suggesting linkage and association with obesity and the zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that these genes are good candidates for zzso to zzso zzso sequencing identified 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 8 zzso zzso The 10 common zzso were zzso in zzso obese subjects and in zzso subjects from a general population cohort of European zzso In the obesity zzso study, the zzso zzso zzso was found to be associated with obesity zzso zzso zzso in additive model, P zzso zzso in dominant model, odds ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso showed an association with obesity zzso zzso zzso zzso adjusted for age and zzso in obese zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso showed an association with insulin levels at zzso zzso zzso tolerance test zzso zzso zzso zzso in obese zzso We found an association between the eating behavior zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in obese zzso However, none of these associations remained significant when corrected for multiple zzso zzso of the nominal associations with obesity could not be confirmed in a German zzso association zzso study for zzso and zzso zzso Our data suggest that common zzso in zzso and its zzso genes are not major contributors to the development of zzso zzso although common zzso may alter body weight and eating behavior and contribute to insulin resistance, in particular in the context of zzso zzso
