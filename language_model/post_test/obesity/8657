To evaluate the tissue distribution and possible role of the zzso zzso receptors zzso in insulin action in fat and muscle biopsy specimens from lean, obese and subjects with Type II zzso diabetes zzso 

We measured zzso zzso zzso beta zzso and zzso gamma protein expression by western zzso zzso The zzso gamma protein was also measured in muscle before and after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso alpha protein was expressed zzso in muscle relative to fat (more than zzso The zzso beta protein was similar in fat and zzso The amount of zzso gamma protein found in muscle was, on average, two-thirds of that present in zzso There was no statistically significant difference between zzso and diabetic subjects in baseline zzso muscle zzso zzso beta or zzso protein zzso zzso analysis zzso however, significantly higher zzso gamma protein in the most insulin resistant diabetic subjects with zzso disposal rates of 3-6 zzso compared with their age and weight matched counterparts with zzso disposal rates of zzso zzso zzso 23 vs 88 zzso 10 zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso in diabetic and vs 94 zzso 15, p zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Muscle zzso gamma protein and zzso disposal rates were zzso correlated in diabetic subjects zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso 

All zzso zzso beta or zzso are present in skeletal muscle and zzso tissue with different relative zzso The zzso gamma protein is abundant in skeletal muscle as well as zzso zzso The altered expression of skeletal muscle zzso gamma is consistent with a role for this nuclear protein in the impaired insulin action of Type II zzso
