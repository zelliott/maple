zzso in zzso tissue has been implicated in vascular dysfunction, but the local mechanisms by which this occurs are zzso 

Small arteries with and without zzso zzso tissue were taken from subcutaneous zzso fat biopsy samples and studied with wire zzso and zzso We established that healthy zzso tissue around human small arteries zzso factors that influence zzso by increasing zzso oxide zzso However, in zzso fat from obese subjects with zzso syndrome zzso circumference zzso versus zzso zzso in control subjects, zzso insulin sensitivity zzso versus zzso in control subjects, zzso the loss of this zzso effect was accompanied by an increase in zzso area zzso versus zzso zzso zzso and zzso evidence of inflammation zzso necrosis factor zzso 1 zzso versus zzso zzso Application of the zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso to zzso fat around healthy blood vessels reduced zzso activity, resulting in the obese zzso These effects could be reversed with free radical zzso or zzso zzso Similarly, induction of zzso zzso inflammation and resulted in loss of zzso capacity, which could be rescued by zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso with a soluble zzso of zzso type 1 zzso or zzso of zzso oxide zzso blocked the zzso effect of healthy zzso zzso zzso 

We conclude that zzso zzso zzso and provide the first functional evidence that it is a zzso zzso of local vascular tone by increasing zzso oxide zzso This capacity is lost in obesity by the development of zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso and zzso zzso
