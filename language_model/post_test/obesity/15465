To investigate linkage and association between the zzso zzso zzso gene and body composition variables in the Quebec Family Study zzso 

zzso linkage analysis using families, and zzso and zzso analyses using normal weight and obese unrelated subjects from zzso 

169 nuclear families were used for linkage zzso 308 unrelated subjects zzso zzso 162 zzso from these families were used for zzso testing of zzso and zzso zzso between subjects with body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and those with zzso or zzso 27 zzso zzso zzso zzso and for a series of zzso analyses using age, plus height for fat mass zzso and fat free mass zzso as zzso A corrected P value zzso for multiple tests has been calculated according to zzso zzso zzso of zzso 

zzso were zzso (in zzso sum of six zzso zzso in zzso zzso (in zzso percent body fat zzso and zzso (in zzso zzso chain react restricted zzso length zzso zzso was used to identified a zzso substitution in zzso 4, a zzso in zzso 6, a zzso in zzso 14 and an automatic DNA zzso for a CA zzso repeat in zzso 3, and zzso pattern on zzso gel for a zzso repeat in zzso zzso 

Good evidence of linkage was observed for zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and for the zzso repeat with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso linkages zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso were also observed between zzso and zzso zzso and zzso between the CA repeat and zzso zzso and zzso and between the zzso repeat and zzso Moreover, zzso values were found to be different among zzso for the zzso repeat zzso with heavier zzso carriers of the zzso zzso at the zzso zzso showing 4 zzso less of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 21 vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso Also, at the zzso zzso in lower zzso zzso carriers of the zzso zzso were 4 zzso lighter in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 47 vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 18; P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso No significant differences were observed between lower and higher zzso subjects in zzso and zzso frequency zzso for any of the zzso 

These results indicate that the zzso gene is involved in the regulation of the body composition in human particularly of zzso in the zzso
