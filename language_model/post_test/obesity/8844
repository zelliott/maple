The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between zzso body mass index zzso and dental zzso among US zzso 

Body measures data and oral health data came from the zzso National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso zzso measures for primary and permanent zzso were: zzso dental zzso zzso and zzso severity zzso mean zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso poverty zzso Analysis was limited to children 2 to 17 years zzso 

zzso zzso of overweight children 2 to 6 years old and zzso of overweight children 6 to 17 years old had dental zzso Geometric mean dental zzso scores for overweight children were zzso and zzso for primary and permanent zzso zzso Controlling for zzso there was no significant association between zzso and dental zzso prevalence in either zzso In addition, among children with a positive history of dental zzso zzso was significantly associated with dental zzso severity in the permanent zzso - overweight children had a lower geometric mean zzso than did normal weight zzso 

Although it was hypothesized that zzso body mass index would be associated with increased dental zzso prevalence and severity, these associations were not zzso Rather, overweight was found to be associated with lower geometric mean zzso Future studies should address which factors specific to overweight in children might be protective against dental zzso in the permanent zzso Given the importance of overweight as a public health problem, however, clinicians are encouraged to continue providing health education and dietary counseling to their overweight child zzso
