zzso is associated with an increased risk of zzso recurrence zzso after radical zzso zzso It is unclear whether this is due to technical challenges related to operating on obese men or other zzso zzso 

To examine whether obesity predicts higher zzso zzso zzso zzso (as a measure of residual zzso zzso after zzso and if this accounts for the greater zzso risk in obese zzso 

A retrospective analysis of zzso zzso patients from 2001 to 2010 in the zzso US Veterans zzso Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital database with median follow-up of 41 zzso 

All patients underwent zzso 

We evaluated the relationship between body mass index zzso and zzso zzso zzso within 6 zzso after zzso zzso zzso hazards models were used to examine the association between zzso and zzso with and without zzso zzso 

Mean zzso was zzso zzso Higher zzso was associated with higher zzso zzso on both zzso zzso and multivariable analyses zzso Increased zzso was associated with increased zzso risk zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso slightly zzso but did not zzso this association zzso zzso zzso When zzso by zzso zzso obesity only significantly predicted zzso in men with an zzso zzso zzso Unfortunately, other clinically relevant end points such as zzso or mortality were not zzso 

zzso men are more likely to have a higher zzso zzso suggesting that either more advanced disease or technical issues confound an ideal zzso However, even after adjusting for the increased zzso zzso obesity remained zzso of zzso suggesting that tumors in obese men are growing zzso This provides further support for the idea that obesity is biologically associated with prostate cancer zzso
