zzso as well as cardiovascular sympathetic activity is zzso in the heart of diabetic and obese zzso The aim of this work was to assess the effect of sympathetic control on variations in skin blood flow in 14 controls, 42 subjects with zzso diabetes and 57 obese subjects without zzso All subjects had normal blood pressure and had no other disease state which might modify skin blood zzso zzso measurement of skin blood flow on the zzso aspect of the right first finger was performed at rest and during three tests which activate sympathetic zzso deep zzso zzso active zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In all 113 subjects, there was a negative correlation between age and the standard zzso of blood skin flow at rest zzso zzso zzso and rate of blood skin flow decline during R zzso zzso zzso O zzso zzso and V zzso zzso zzso The standard zzso and slope of decline in blood skin flow during R was lower than the initial levels in controls in 11 diabetes patients and 6 obese subjects and in 15 diabetic patients and 12 obese subjects zzso The slope of decline in skin blood flow during O was positively correlated with plasma cholesterol zzso zzso zzso red cell zzso index zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso control and zzso The respective effects of these factors were analyzed in each of the three groups of zzso These preliminary results suggest that 1) the variation in skin blood flow at rest is regulated by the sympathetic system and the drop in skin blood flow during the three tests zzso the sympathetic system decreases with age, 2) sympathetic control of peripheral zzso is reduced in many diabetic and obese subjects, 3) red cell zzso and different zzso parameters and zzso function have an zzso
