It has been well demonstrated that insulin resistance plays an important role in the zzso of coronary risk factors through the progression of zzso in animal models of insulin zzso In humans, a high-fat diet is the major cause of obesity and insulin zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso in high-fat diet zzso and insulin resistance by gene targeting and zzso study using the common zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso died at zzso zzso due to zzso zzso zzso zzso mice were protected from the development of insulin resistance due to zzso zzso under a high-fat diet and the zzso were zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice showed zzso and zzso of zzso despite the smaller size of zzso and decreased fat mass, which may explain these zzso at least in zzso This study reveals a zzso zzso role for zzso in high-fat zzso obesity due to zzso zzso and insulin resistance, which requires both zzso of zzso A zzso zzso has been detected in the human zzso zzso Since this zzso acid substitution may cause a reduction in the zzso activity of zzso this zzso may be associated with decreased insulin resistance and decreased risk of Type 2 zzso To investigate this hypothesis, we performed a zzso study of the zzso zzso zzso In an obese group, subjects with zzso were more insulin sensitive than those zzso The frequency of zzso was significantly lower in the diabetic group, suggesting that this zzso protects against Type 2 zzso These results revealed that both in mice and humans, zzso is a thrifty gene zzso Type 2 zzso
