In humans, steroid hormones circulate in the blood mainly bound to specific steroid transport zzso namely zzso zzso zzso for cortisol and sex zzso zzso zzso for testosterone and zzso The binding activities of these proteins are believed to zzso the zzso of steroids to target zzso It has been shown in zzso that insulin is a potent inhibitor of both zzso and zzso zzso by a human zzso cell zzso zzso To further investigate this potential effect of insulin in zzso we zzso studied three groups of lean subjects, obese subjects, and obese subjects with zzso zzso all of whom were otherwise zzso The three groups were comparable in sex and age, and in the two obese groups, body mass index, waist to hip ratio, and blood pressure were zzso Plasma total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso 31 zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso were significantly increased in obese subjects with zzso zzso Plasma zzso correlated positively with zzso zzso levels zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso levels zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and area under the curve of zzso after an oral zzso tolerance test zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and correlated zzso with the insulin response to zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso as well as to oral zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso challenge zzso zzso levels did not zzso with insulin zzso Multiple linear zzso analysis showed that only zzso contributed to the zzso of the zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso explaining zzso of its zzso Morning cortisol levels did not differ between the groups and did not correlate to any of the zzso or insulin metabolism zzso Because zzso chains influence the biological activity and zzso of zzso we analyzed the migration profile of zzso by Western zzso and the interaction of zzso with zzso Con zzso The results indicated that the zzso zzso zzso and interaction with Con A did not differ between lean and obese zzso These data favor the hypothesis that the zzso effect of insulin on zzso liver zzso might be relevant in zzso and therefore contribute to decrease zzso levels in obese patients with enhanced insulin zzso In both men and women, zzso levels correlated zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and positively with insulin sensitivity zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso and r zzso zzso P zzso zzso in men and women, respectively), but not with insulin zzso The disposition index zzso zzso zzso was significantly decreased in the obese, zzso subjects, suggesting that zzso was inadequate for their degree of insulin zzso The disposition index correlated positively with plasma zzso levels zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso with plasma zzso levels zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso is a marker of insulin zzso in a similar way as zzso is a marker of insulin zzso As high plasma zzso levels have been associated with increased zzso of type 2 diabetes, this important issue merits further zzso
