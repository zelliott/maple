zzso is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes in zzso The risk of developing diabetes is zzso greater for male cats than for zzso even after having been neutered early in zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of different zzso pathways in the regulation of zzso zzso production zzso during the zzso state considering these risk zzso A triple zzso protocol using zzso zzso and zzso was applied in zzso cats (12 lean and 12 zzso equal sex zzso fed three different zzso Compared with lean zzso obese cats had higher insulin zzso zzso but similar blood zzso zzso zzso was lower in obese cats zzso zzso due to lower zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso body mass index, and zzso correlated zzso with zzso zzso zzso Female obese cats had approximately zzso times higher zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso than male obese zzso However, zzso was not higher because zzso cycling was increased zzso zzso zzso These results support the notion that zzso obese cats have lower zzso zzso compared with lean cats and are still capable of maintaining zzso zzso despite the well-documented existence of peripheral insulin resistance in obese zzso Our data further suggest that sex-related differences exist in the regulation of zzso zzso metabolism in obese zzso suggesting that zzso cycling acts as a controlling mechanism to zzso zzso Increased zzso cycling could therefore be an important factor in modulating the diabetes risk in female zzso
