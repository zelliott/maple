In this study, we investigated the zzso properties of zzso zzso extract zzso in mice in which obesity was induced with a high-fat diet zzso zzso administration zzso zzso for 70 days decreased body weight gain, zzso tissue weight, and the serum zzso level in mice fed a zzso zzso reduced serum levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso of zzso droplets in the zzso zzso restored the zzso decrease in zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso of zzso and zzso and decreased the expression of zzso in mature zzso zzso In addition, we further explored the active compound responsible for zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso increased the zzso of zzso and zzso with increasing zzso zzso in mature zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso (or zzso exert improving effects on zzso obesity by promoting zzso and reducing zzso
