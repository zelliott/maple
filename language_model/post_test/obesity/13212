Although the body mass index zzso mass index, zzso is widely used as a surrogate measure of zzso it is moderately associated zzso approximately zzso with height among zzso We examined whether the resulting preferential zzso of taller children as overweight is zzso 

zzso analyses of children zzso zzso zzso examined the relation of height to zzso (as assessed by zzso and zzso zzso and zzso levels of zzso zzso analyses examined the relation of childhood height and zzso zzso to adult zzso age, 25 zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso 

Children zzso and adults zzso who had participated in the zzso Heart zzso 

We constructed three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso levels of insulin, were also zzso 

The zzso of children as overweight zzso or zzso zzso varied markedly by zzso with a zzso difference in the prevalence of overweight across zzso of height between the ages of 3 and 10 zzso Childhood zzso however, was also related to zzso thicknesses and insulin levels, and all associations were modified in a similar manner by zzso Furthermore, childhood height was related to adult zzso and of the three childhood zzso zzso zzso showed the strongest associations with adult zzso 

Because zzso reflects the positive association between height and zzso among children, it is a better zzso index than is either zzso or zzso
