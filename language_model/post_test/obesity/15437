Among zzso subjects, insulin resistance has been associated with increased cardiovascular risk factors, including zzso hypertension, impaired zzso and zzso Less is known about the relationship between insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk factors in subjects with type 2 zzso 

To examine this issue, we determined insulin sensitivity zzso in zzso type 2 diabetic subjects by minimal model analyses of frequently sampled intravenous zzso tolerance tests in the zzso Resistance zzso Study zzso a large zzso study of insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular disease in African-Americans, Hispanics, and zzso zzso We defined zzso subjects as having zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (above median in zzso subjects of all ethnic groups in the zzso Using this definition, only 37 type 2 diabetic subjects were insulin sensitive, and the remaining zzso were insulin zzso 

After adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, and clinic, insulin resistance was significantly correlated with total zzso zzso cholesterol, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and was zzso correlated with HDL cholesterol level and LDL zzso zzso zzso thickness was greater in zzso than in zzso subjects, but this difference was not statistically zzso After further adjustment for waist circumference zzso of visceral zzso zzso subjects continued to have higher zzso zzso inhibitor 1 and zzso zzso levels, lower HDL cholesterol levels, and smaller LDL particle size than did zzso zzso After further adjustment for zzso zzso levels, these results were very zzso 

We conclude that zzso type 2 diabetic subjects have more zzso cardiovascular risk factor profiles than zzso type 2 diabetic subjects and that this is only partially related to increased obesity and an adverse body fat zzso
