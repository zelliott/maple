Sleep restriction in humans increases risk for zzso but previous zzso studies show weight loss following sleep zzso possibly due to stressful methods used to prevent zzso zzso zzso rats exhibit zzso and resistance to weight zzso It was hypothesized that sleep disruption by a zzso method would increase body weight, and the effect of partial sleep deprivation zzso on body weight in OR and zzso zzso rats was zzso 

OR and zzso rats zzso zzso zzso were implanted with zzso to record zzso After baseline recording, six zzso and six OR rats underwent 8 h zzso during light phase for 9 zzso Sleep was reduced using recordings of random zzso zzso states were scored as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Total number of transitions between zzso zzso food zzso and body weight were zzso 

Exposure to noise decreased zzso and zzso time, while increasing W zzso zzso increased the number of transitions between stages and zzso Further, zzso during the rest phase increased recovery sleep during the active zzso The zzso zzso and OR rats had greater food intake and body weight compared to controls 

zzso by zzso means increases body weight in zzso Also, zzso during the rest phase increases active period zzso
