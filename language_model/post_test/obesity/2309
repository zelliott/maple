Recent accumulating evidence suggests that innate immunity is associated with zzso chronic inflammation and zzso zzso Here, we show that a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 105 zzso differentiation protein zzso complex, contributes to high-fat diet zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso and insulin zzso An zzso dramatically increased zzso zzso and protein expression in zzso vascular fraction of zzso white zzso tissue zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression also was significantly increased in the visceral zzso tissue of obese human subjects relative to zzso zzso The zzso complex was expressed by most zzso tissue zzso zzso An zzso increased zzso expression on the zzso subset of zzso that accumulate in zzso zzso also acquired this characteristic in zzso with zzso zzso zzso knockout zzso and zzso zzso mice had less zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso and insulin resistance compared with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Finally, the saturated fatty zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso for zzso but they did not activate zzso Thus, the zzso complex is a major zzso of zzso tissue inflammation independent of zzso signaling and may represent a novel therapeutic target for zzso zzso zzso
