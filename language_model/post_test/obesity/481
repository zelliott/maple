zzso and zzso diseases share common risk zzso We used structural equation zzso zzso to evaluate the independent and combined effects of zzso and zzso implicated in cardiovascular diseases on zzso function in type 2 zzso 

1,188 type 2 diabetic patients were zzso into high-risk and low-risk groups according to zzso zzso of the zzso transformed zzso urinary zzso ratio and plasma zzso zzso Models for these groups, zzso continuous and zzso zzso data, were developed separately to evaluate the zzso among measured variables and zzso factors using zzso zzso zzso zzso and model selection as assessed by a zzso zzso 

zzso measured variables zzso zzso zzso blood zzso and zzso of the genes zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso components of the zzso system zzso and zzso metabolism were loaded onto their respective zzso factors of zzso and zzso In addition to direct and indirect effects, zzso factors of zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso factors of zzso and zzso zzso to influence zzso zzso Together with zzso of the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso G protein zzso zzso zzso sodium channel alpha zzso and zzso zzso 3, these parameters explained zzso of the zzso in zzso function in the high-risk and low-risk zzso 

zzso is a useful tool for confirming and zzso multiple interactions of biological pathways with genetic zzso The combined and interactive effects of blood pressure, zzso and obesity on zzso function may have therapeutic zzso especially in type 2 diabetic individuals with genetic risk zzso
