In zzso obese rats, zzso natural killer zzso cell zzso has been demonstrated to be impaired by zzso zzso zzso zzso The contribution of the obese zzso to this zzso cell dysfunction and its zzso remains zzso In this study, the functions of zzso cells from zzso obese rats after adoptive transfer into lean zzso were investigated using in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells of zzso and zzso obese zzso rats were depleted in zzso Then, zzso cells from either zzso or obese donors were zzso The numbers of peripheral blood zzso cells were analyzed by zzso cell sorting zzso and the distribution pattern of zzso cells in lung and zzso by zzso zzso expression was evaluated by zzso and zzso of zzso target proteins of zzso by zzso The numbers of zzso cells in blood and lung were significantly higher in obese animals compared to lean ones after transfer of zzso cells from obese zzso zzso This was correlated with increased zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso without altered zzso expression in those zzso cells transferred to lean zzso zzso obese zzso zzso These results show for the first time that the altered zzso of zzso cells from obese rats can be zzso by generation of a zzso zzso environment of lean zzso
