The aim of the present study was to measure whole body zzso zzso zzso and zzso rate by zzso zzso clamp and indirect zzso in 7 zzso obese subjects zzso 40 zzso at three time zzso before zzso diversion zzso surgery zzso 3 months after surgery zzso and after reaching stable body weight, at least 2 years after surgery zzso A group of 7 control subjects zzso matched zzso for sex, age and zzso with zzso patients, was also zzso The M value at zzso was significantly higher than at zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso No statistical difference was observed between the zzso and C zzso Similarly, zzso zzso rate was significantly increased at zzso with respect to zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso and was not significantly different between zzso and zzso zzso levels of zzso fatty acids zzso decreased significantly both from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso The same applied to zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso Weight decreased mainly in the late zzso period zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso of total zzso rather than in the early zzso period zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of total zzso We also report the clinical case of a young woman of normal weight, who underwent zzso for zzso zzso to familial zzso zzso zzso whose M value, plasma insulin and blood zzso levels were zzso upon zzso of serum zzso and zzso levels as determined by the therapeutic zzso zzso In conclusion, in obese diabetic patients zzso zzso induced by zzso causes a zzso enhancement of insulin sensitivity and zzso zzso This improvement in metabolism is noticeable before the surgery has major effects on body zzso These observations suggest that lowered plasma zzso rather than weight loss per se, are the cause of the zzso of insulin zzso
