The primary goal of this study was to assess whether increases in zzso mass zzso and decreases in total and percentage fat mass from 15 weeks of twice weekly supervised strength training would be maintained over 6 months of zzso exercise in a zzso controlled zzso 

In all, 60 women aged zzso zzso body mass index between 20 and 35 zzso were zzso to control or treatment zzso The treatment group performed zzso supervised strength training followed by 6 months of zzso zzso zzso at zzso 15, and 39 weeks included body weight and body composition by zzso X-ray zzso zzso measures zzso was used to assess zzso differences for changes over zzso 

Almost zzso of prescribed exercise sessions were zzso The body composition treatment effects over 15 weeks were largely maintained over 6 months of zzso zzso Over the total 39 weeks of strength training, the treatment group gained zzso zzso more in zzso lost zzso zzso more in fat mass, and lost zzso more in percent body fat when compared to the control zzso zzso for these zzso differences in zzso changes were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso training did not result in any significant weight loss or waist circumference zzso Adjustment for changes in energy intake and physical activity did not alter these zzso 

zzso strength training is zzso feasible for busy zzso women and the favorable body composition changes resulting from supervised strength training can be maintained over zzso These findings lay the groundwork for determining the long-term health benefits of this zzso feasible exercise prescription, potentially including prevention of zzso fat zzso
