We evaluated the effect of maternal obesity before and throughout gestation on offspring zzso axis zzso zzso zzso by Columbia zzso zzso were fed either zzso of National Research Council zzso recommendations zzso zzso or zzso of zzso recommendations zzso zzso from 60 d before mating until zzso Ten zzso born to zzso zzso (five males and five zzso and eight zzso born to C zzso (three male and five zzso were zzso From delivery to weaning zzso were maintained with their mothers, who were all fed zzso zzso zzso After zzso all zzso were group housed and fed the same diet to meet zzso zzso At 19 zzso of age zzso were placed in individual pens and fed a zzso diet to meet maintenance zzso zzso vein zzso were placed and 2 d later zzso received an intravenous zzso zzso hormone zzso challenge followed by an zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso challenge 1 d zzso Thirty d later offspring were again zzso and placed into metabolism crates for 2 d before receiving an isolation stress zzso zzso and cortisol responses to the isolation stress test and zzso challenge and cortisol responses to zzso challenge were zzso zzso was zzso via zzso and zzso was zzso using an zzso zzso both were analyzed using repeated measures using the MIXED procedure of zzso zzso from zzso zzso had elevated zzso plasma zzso and cortisol compared with C offspring before all three challenges zzso zzso zzso from zzso mothers tended zzso zzso zzso to have a greater zzso response after an zzso zzso injection than offspring from C mothers zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso 1,570 area under the curve, zzso zzso response to the zzso and zzso challenges was not influenced by maternal nutrition zzso zzso zzso and averaged zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso response following the isolation stress test was also similar zzso zzso zzso for zzso and C offspring zzso zzso 20 zzso and cortisol response during the isolation stress test was similar between C and zzso offspring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that maternal obesity before and during gestation does not affect stress responses by the zzso but has an impact on zzso zzso The lack of differences in cortisol release under the influence of difference zzso of zzso during the zzso challenge could indicate adrenal dysfunction in zzso zzso
