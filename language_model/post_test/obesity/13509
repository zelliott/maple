Virtually all social science research related to obesity studies a person's body mass index zzso Yet there is wide agreement in the medical literature that zzso is seriously flawed because it does not distinguish fat from zzso mass such as muscle and zzso This paper studies data that include multiple measures of zzso and finds that many important patterns, such as who is classified as obese, group rates of zzso and correlations of obesity with social science zzso are all sensitive to the measure of zzso and obesity zzso We show that, relative to percent body fat, zzso zzso substantial zzso of individuals as obese or zzso in general, zzso is less accurate zzso men than zzso Furthermore, when percent body fat instead of zzso is used to define zzso the gap in obesity between white and African American men increases substantially but the gap in obesity between African American and white women is cut in zzso Finally, total body fat is zzso correlated with employment for some groups and zzso mass is not significantly correlated with employment for any group, a difference that was obscured in previous research that studied zzso In the long run, social science zzso should include more accurate measures of zzso In the short run, zzso more accurate measures of zzso using height and weight is not possible except by making unattractive zzso but there is also no reason to adhere uncritically to zzso as a measure of zzso Social science research on obesity would be enriched by greater consideration of alternate specifications of weight and height and more accurate measures of zzso
