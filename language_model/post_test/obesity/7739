zzso zzso is not thought to pose a zzso barrier for diffusion of zzso from the zzso to zzso In contrast, in zzso zzso the zzso is critically important for insulin action, because transport of insulin across the zzso cell layer is rate limiting for zzso zzso zzso However, very little is known concerning the role in this process of zzso the mural cells lining the zzso membrane of zzso zzso zzso is a growth factor involved in the recruitment and function of zzso We studied insulin action in mice expressing zzso lacking the zzso binding domain, producing a protein with a partial loss of function zzso zzso action was assessed through zzso of insulin signaling and insulin and zzso tolerance zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso vascular zzso zzso One outcome of this change was an increase in zzso insulin zzso This correlated with enhanced whole body zzso zzso and increased insulin clearance from the circulation during an insulin tolerance zzso In obese mice, zzso zzso was associated with an zzso reduction in zzso insulin and drastically reduced insulin zzso These mice did not have significantly higher zzso levels, reflecting a dramatic increase in insulin zzso Our findings show that, despite already having a high zzso zzso zzso transport can be further zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to connect zzso changes in zzso zzso transport to changes in insulin action, demonstrating a link between zzso signaling and insulin zzso
