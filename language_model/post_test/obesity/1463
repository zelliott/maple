To determine whether zzso ratio is a useful predictor for coronary heart disease zzso risk factors in zzso 

An zzso study comparing relationships between zzso ratio, body mass index, zzso ratio and zzso risk factor levels zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure, zzso blood zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cholesterol, HDL cholesterol zzso and the risk factor morbidity index zzso of the risk factor scores for hypertension, abnormal zzso zzso zzso zzso and low HDL zzso point each if zzso 

A health examination facility within a general zzso 

zzso men underwent routine health zzso 

Body mass index, zzso ratio and zzso ratio were significantly associated with all of the risk factor levels and with the risk factor morbidity index according to the result of simple zzso zzso Multiple zzso analysis for zzso ratio and body mass index showed that both of them were also significantly associated with all of the risk factor levels and with the risk factor morbidity index, except zzso levels with body mass zzso According to the results of multiple zzso analysis for zzso ratio and body mass index, body mass index was not significantly associated with zzso blood zzso zzso cholesterol levels or the risk factor morbidity index whereas zzso ratio was significantly associated with all of the zzso On the other hand, while zzso ratio was significantly associated with all of the zzso zzso ratio was not significantly associated with most of the variables when zzso ratio and zzso ratio were zzso 

zzso ratio, an index of abdominal zzso may be a better predictor of multiple zzso risk factors in men than zzso ratio in mass zzso zzso
