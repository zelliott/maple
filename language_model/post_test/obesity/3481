zzso measures such as zzso zzso zzso zzso waist zzso zzso arm circumference zzso and upper thigh zzso have been linked to the risk of cardiovascular disease zzso However, their relationships with zzso zzso are zzso Studies in zzso zzso especially in Asian countries where zzso is zzso are zzso 

We conducted a zzso study to assess the associations of zzso zzso waist zzso hip zzso body mass index zzso zzso and upper thigh circumference with carotid zzso thickness zzso among zzso middle-aged participants free of zzso in rural zzso 

After adjusting for age and sex, zzso and waist circumference but not zzso showed a positive significant association with zzso In zzso analysis, each standard zzso zzso increase of zzso zzso or zzso zzso was associated with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso difference in zzso respectively, after controlling for age, sex, zzso smoking status, education level, and zzso blood pressure zzso The associations of zzso and zzso with zzso were independent of the influence of other zzso zzso The associations of other zzso measures and zzso were not zzso 

In our relatively lean, healthy Asian population, zzso and zzso appear to be better zzso of early zzso than other common surrogates of zzso
