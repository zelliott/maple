Although insulin has been shown to stimulate zzso zzso and zzso has been implicated in the raised zzso levels found in diseases associated with significant insulin resistance, zzso function has not been studied so far in women with zzso We have assessed zzso function in women with zzso at the early zzso and late zzso zzso stages of evolution of the disease after strong stimulation with zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso differences in zzso function would be expected, depending on the stage of evolution of zzso 

Following an overnight fast, a standard zzso (75 zzso zzso was performed zzso zzso in all diabetic and control zzso Blood samples were obtained for blood zzso insulin and zzso zzso before and at 30-minute intervals for 2 zzso On the termination of the zzso a zzso test zzso zzso zzso was performed zzso zzso and blood samples were obtained for zzso zzso delta zzso total testosterone, free testosterone and zzso zzso before and then at zzso intervals for 20 zzso 

Thirty-one women with zzso (13 zzso and 18 with relative zzso 12 obese and 11 normally zzso zzso zzso women, aged zzso years, were zzso 

The integrated response zzso of zzso to zzso was found to be normal in zzso zzso and obese zzso women in the face of an increased free testosterone response, while in relatively zzso zzso women the zzso response was significantly reduced in the face of a normal free testosterone zzso 

The results suggest that in women with zzso the zzso have a reduced ability to convert zzso to zzso probably due to a reduction of zzso zzso zzso As zzso protect against zzso it is speculated that the relative inability of the zzso to produce zzso in zzso women with relative zzso might be involved in the development of the zzso which often zzso this zzso
