We measured skin elastic properties zzso ability, zzso ability, and the skin zzso of 4 different body sites, finger, hand, zzso and chest, in 191 normal individuals by means of a new zzso device and investigated the correlation of skin elastic properties with sex, site, age, and the degree of zzso Neither sex nor the degree of obesity were correlated with skin elastic zzso The skin elastic property of the chest was significantly higher than those of the other three zzso zzso in the skin elasticity of the hand, zzso and chest were associated with zzso This simple and zzso device can provide an objective method for evaluating skin elastic zzso
