zzso zzso tissue of lean and genetically obese zzso zzso rats was used to study the zzso zzso distribution and zzso recruitment of the zzso zzso zzso and to zzso possible molecular zzso of the zzso zzso Hearts were removed from zzso and zzso (20 zzso lean and obese zzso rats, and processed for zzso zzso and Western zzso of zzso In obese rats, the total zzso content in a crude membrane fraction was reduced to 75 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of lean zzso In contrast, zzso abundance in plasma zzso was not significantly different between lean and obese rats with a zzso decrease zzso zzso zzso in the zzso fraction of obese zzso In plasma zzso of lean animals insulin was found to increase the zzso abundance to zzso zzso zzso of control with a significantly zzso zzso zzso reduced effect in the obese group zzso zzso zzso of zzso In these animals insulin failed to recruit zzso from the zzso zzso whereas the hormone induced a significant decrease (41 zzso zzso of zzso zzso in lean zzso In zzso membrane zzso obtained from cardiac zzso of lean rats, a 24 zzso zzso protein could be zzso whereas no significant zzso of this species was observed in zzso zzso prepared from obese zzso In addition to the zzso of zzso insulin was found to promote the movement of the small zzso protein zzso from the zzso zzso to 61 zzso zzso of zzso to the plasma membrane zzso to 177 zzso zzso of zzso in lean rats with no effect of the hormone on zzso zzso in the obese zzso In conclusion, cardiac zzso zzso of zzso obese zzso rats is subject to multiple cellular abnormalities involving a reduced zzso altered zzso and defective recruitment of zzso We show here an association of the latter zzso with zzso at the level of small zzso proteins possibly leading to an impaired trafficking of zzso in the zzso zzso
