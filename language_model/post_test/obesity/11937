zzso zzso and indexes that assess excess of zzso are associated with cardiovascular risk factors, and predict diabetes zzso 

This zzso study reported the performance of zzso indexes to detect or turn diabetes unlikely in patients with zzso Patients with hypertension zzso pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso drug zzso aged zzso years, being 150 men and 332 women, had weight, zzso waist circumference zzso hip zzso body mass index zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso ratio zzso and zzso height ratio zzso zzso Diabetes was diagnosed by zzso blood zzso zzso zzso or zzso drug use zzso of the zzso 

All zzso indexes were associated with diabetes in a modified zzso regression, adjusting for age, smoking, and physical activity, in women, but not in zzso In men, only the area under the zzso characteristic curve zzso for zzso was statistically associated with diabetes zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso A zzso of zzso had sensitivity of zzso zzso and negative zzso probability of zzso zzso Among women, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso had zzso and negative zzso probability zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for women and zzso zzso for men are highly suggestive of diabetes among this population of zzso zzso Indexes below these zzso turn diabetes unlikely in this zzso The investigation of zzso of this performance in other zzso clinics is zzso
