To compare the performance, in terms of specificity for cortisol zzso of late-night zzso cortisol with 24-hour zzso cortisol zzso zzso and overnight zzso zzso suppression test zzso zzso in a group of obese zzso zzso 

Forty obese patients with zzso without clinical features of zzso syndrome were zzso zzso urinary and zzso cortisol were measured directly by an zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso The zzso of the three tests using various zzso were calculated and zzso employing the assumption that none of the patients had zzso 

The patients had a mean age and zzso of 56 years zzso zzso and 37 zzso zzso zzso All 40 provided late-night zzso cortisol zzso zzso patients completed all three zzso Two patients only completed two screening zzso The zzso of late-night zzso cortisol zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The specificity of late-night zzso cortisol was significantly less than 24 zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso cortisol has a poor specificity for cortisol excess in obese patients with zzso with 24 zzso zzso showing significantly better specificity in our zzso
