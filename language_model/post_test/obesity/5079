zzso has major effects on both zzso and zzso chain zzso acid zzso To determine whether the insulin resistance of obesity equally affects both zzso and zzso chain zzso acid zzso we measured the ability of obese and normal subjects to dispose of intravenous zzso dose of zzso zzso zzso or zzso (4 zzso zzso plasma zzso levels were the same in the 18 normal and 17 obese zzso plus or minus zzso of ideal body zzso subjects, but zzso plasma insulin levels were higher in the obese group (15 plus or minus 2 vs 6 plus or minus 1 zzso p less than zzso The obese group had a slower zzso disappearance rate after zzso challenge zzso plus or minus zzso zzso zzso plus or minus zzso zzso p less than zzso despite having a greater serum insulin response to the zzso load zzso plus or minus 4 vs 11 plus or minus 1 insulin area zzso p less than zzso confirming insulin zzso In contrast, disposal of a zzso load was the same in normal and obese subjects, as assessed by initial and second phase exponential disappearance rates, zzso clearance rates of zzso and volumes of zzso In normal men, disposal rates of zzso and zzso after simultaneous administration of both substances were slower than corresponding disposal rates determined when each substance was given zzso We conclude that obese subjects with impaired zzso disposal have normal zzso zzso suggesting that the insulin resistance of obesity can be selective in its effect on different zzso zzso zzso and zzso also appear to mutually antagonize each other's zzso
