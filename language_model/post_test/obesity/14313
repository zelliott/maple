zzso evidence suggests that zzso zzso zzso stress plays a role in the zzso of diabetes, contributing to pancreatic zzso loss and insulin zzso zzso of the unfolded protein response zzso play a dual role in zzso acting as beneficial regulators under zzso conditions or as triggers of zzso dysfunction and zzso under situations of chronic zzso Novel findings suggest that zzso makes a zzso a zzso zzso its enormous capacity to zzso and zzso insulin, is also its Achilles zzso rendering it vulnerable to chronic high zzso and fatty acid exposure, agents that contribute to zzso failure in type 2 zzso In this review, we address the transition from physiology to pathology, namely how and why the zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso stress response and which defenses are triggered by zzso against these zzso zzso stress may also link obesity and insulin resistance in type 2 zzso High fat feeding and obesity induce zzso stress in liver, which suppresses insulin signaling via zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso data suggest that zzso stress may also contribute to zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso and zzso putative zzso of zzso loss in type 1 diabetes, induce severe zzso stress through, respectively, zzso depletion of zzso calcium and zzso of zzso zzso thus zzso zzso defenses and amplifying the zzso zzso A better understanding of the pathways regulating zzso stress in zzso may be instrumental for the design of novel therapies to prevent zzso loss in zzso
