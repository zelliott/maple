zzso zzso are lateral zzso zzso implicated in regulating feeding and the zzso zzso To study their possible relevance to obesity and diabetes, we measured zzso zzso zzso levels in obese, zzso zzso fatty zzso and in zzso non-obese zzso diabetic fatty zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso fatty rats were zzso lower than those in lean controls zzso zzso zzso zzso arbitrary units, zzso but did not differ between zzso diabetic rats and zzso zzso Treatment of zzso diabetic rats with zzso (1 or 3 zzso body weight daily for 13 weeks) zzso plasma zzso and significantly reduced plasma insulin, while zzso levels were zzso higher than in zzso zzso rats zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment markedly enhanced weight gain compared with zzso zzso rats zzso weight zzso g zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso even though they were restricted to the same food zzso zzso zzso rats had significantly lower zzso zzso zzso levels zzso arbitrary zzso than both zzso lean controls zzso zzso and zzso diabetics zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso gene expression may be suppressed by substantial weight zzso zzso signals that might mediate this effect have not been identified, but plasma zzso insulin and zzso are not obviously zzso
