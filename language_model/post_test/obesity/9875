To examine the influence of obesity on the patient characteristics and zzso features of zzso cancer, and to find how treatment and prognosis were affected by obesity in women with zzso zzso 

The data of 370 consecutive women operated for zzso cancer were zzso zzso Patients were divided into three categories as zzso zzso and zzso according to zzso All patients underwent primary surgical treatment including total abdominal zzso bilateral zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was carried out for all patients except for those with no zzso invasion regardless of the tumor grade or for whom it was technically zzso zzso zzso was performed when zzso and zzso assessments suggested zzso or grade 3 zzso zzso % zzso invasion and cervical zzso 

Patients with a zzso zzso mass zzso of zzso were significantly zzso Patients with a zzso of zzso were statistically less likely to zzso % zzso invasion and more likely to have stage I zzso There were no significant differences in the zzso of positive pelvic and zzso zzso zzso and tumor grades between the three zzso Also, there were no differences in surgery type, the mean of removed pelvic and zzso zzso zzso number, hospital stay, blood loss and complications between the zzso The patients with a zzso of zzso had significantly longer operating zzso There were no statistically significant differences in zzso the median number of months at recurrence or the site of recurrence between the three groups, as well as the zzso overall and zzso survival of zzso zzso zzso hazard models identified stage III and IV disease as significant zzso for mortality rates, while stage III and IV disease, hypertension and pelvic zzso were identified as significant zzso for recurrence zzso 

Positive zzso zzso deep zzso invasion and stage zzso zzso cancer were significantly more common in patients with a zzso of zzso There were no significant differences in tumor grade, surgical technique, surgical morbidity or zzso zzso between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso mortality rates were not affected by the zzso
