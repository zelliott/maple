To evaluate disturbances of the zzso axis in women with zzso zzso syndrome zzso 

zzso cohort zzso 

zzso City University, zzso zzso 

Sixty women with zzso and 19 women with normal zzso 

Administration of human zzso hormone zzso zzso suppression testing, and stimulation of zzso with zzso zzso 

Plasma cortisol and zzso levels, plasma zzso and zzso levels, and zzso zzso 

In women with zzso plasma zzso and cortisol levels were significantly higher and the plasma zzso level after the administration of zzso was higher than in zzso Based on the response to zzso patients with zzso could be classified into three zzso those with a normal response to zzso zzso 1), those with an exaggerated response of zzso to zzso zzso zzso and those with a high zzso level of cortisol and a poor response to zzso zzso zzso In groups 2 and 3, zzso levels were significantly higher, suppression of zzso by zzso was significantly greater, and zzso rates with zzso zzso were significantly lower than in group zzso 

This zzso provides insight into the underlying cause of zzso and thus is useful in selecting appropriate zzso
