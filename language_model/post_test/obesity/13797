zzso is a neuroendocrine zzso precursor that zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 in zzso To explore the function of zzso and its derived zzso transgenic mice were created which express zzso using the zzso zzso The body weight of transgenic mice was normal until approximately zzso weeks, and then increased zzso over zzso zzso Adult transgenic mice had a fat mass approximately twice that of zzso mice, and zzso blood zzso levels were slightly zzso In the zzso the levels of several fully processed peptides in transgenic mice were not reduced compared with zzso mice, indicating that the zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso 1 activity in this zzso Because the zzso potency of zzso peptides towards zzso zzso 1 is much greater in the absence of zzso E activity, the zzso zzso was also expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although the transgenic mice were born in the expected frequency, 21 of 22 zzso transgenic zzso zzso mice died between 11 and 26 weeks of age, presumably due to greatly elevated blood zzso The levels of several zzso peptides were significantly reduced in the zzso transgenic zzso zzso mice relative to zzso zzso zzso mice, suggesting that the zzso inhibited zzso zzso 1 in these zzso Taken together, these results are consistent with a role for zzso peptides as zzso that influence body weight independently of their function as zzso of zzso zzso zzso
