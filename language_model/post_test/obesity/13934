To test whether resting oxygen zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso differs between obese adolescents zzso zzso 18; zzso 30) and a matched zzso control group after adjustment for differences in zzso mass zzso and fat mass zzso 

zzso and zzso were assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured by indirect zzso 

There was no difference in resting zzso between groups after adjusting for zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not differ between groups after adjusting for body zzso Percentage zzso and zzso zzso zzso - resting zzso were significantly higher in the obese group during zzso exercise, however not after adjusting for body zzso zzso was not significantly different between groups after adjusting for zzso 

When body compositions are appropriately controlled for, resting zzso zzso zzso and zzso do not differ between obese and zzso zzso These data suggested that the higher relative zzso observed in obese adolescent subjects is due to their higher zzso and not to an impaired zzso even though they may be less physically zzso
