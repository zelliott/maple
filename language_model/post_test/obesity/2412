The effect of zzso zzso on skeletal muscle protein metabolism was studied in lean mice and in mice rendered obese with zzso After zzso of the zzso muscle, the zzso growth of zzso muscle was less pronounced in obese than in lean zzso zzso turnover was studied in the isolated zzso muscle 4 days after the zzso zzso incorporation in total proteins and zzso release in the incubation medium zzso of protein synthesis and zzso were increased by 3- and zzso in overloaded zzso zzso zzso muscles of lean and obese mice, respectively, compared to the control muscles isolated from the zzso zzso The qualitative modifications in the pattern of proteins zzso from zzso were identical in both groups of zzso This increase in protein turnover in overloaded muscles results from an increased rate of zzso chain initiation zzso in lean mice, zzso in obese zzso without any modification of zzso chain zzso zzso zzso zzso was also able to reverse the zzso in zzso acid zzso which is present in zzso muscles of zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso increase of skeletal muscle protein turnover is diminished in obese zzso
