zzso obese zzso and lean zzso rats were fed a soy protein diet ad zzso under barrier conditions from 4 zzso of age until zzso zzso rats were also pair fed with lean controls to prevent zzso Time of death was determined and zzso collected at zzso for zzso zzso zzso rats had longer 10th zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso females zzso compared with zzso zzso and maximum life spans zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso females zzso compared with zzso zzso than did obese zzso Preventing zzso increased maximum life span in both males zzso zzso and females zzso zzso zzso in lean rats were similar to those reported for other zzso zzso For obese rats fed ad zzso zzso zzso disease zzso was the major cause of mortality zzso zzso zzso zzso Prevention of zzso decreased deaths attributable to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A smaller restriction in energy intake zzso required to prevent zzso compared with the zzso in most other studies produced similar increases in zzso suggesting that obese zzso rats are particularly sensitive to energy zzso zzso of early onset of zzso disease is a likely zzso Percentage body fat in zzso obese rats did not differ from that of animals fed ad zzso thus, reduced longevity is not the result of obesity per se, but rather is influenced by other zzso zzso occurring in this strain of rats zzso for the zzso zzso Because zzso with progression to zzso is a complication in human zzso the zzso strain offers the opportunity to investigate initiating mechanisms of this zzso
