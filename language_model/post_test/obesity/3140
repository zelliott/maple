zzso zzso factor zzso zzso reduces appetite and body weight in zzso and zzso We studied the zzso and long-term effects of zzso a second-generation zzso zzso in zzso obese zzso mice and brown zzso tissue zzso obese zzso zzso protein zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso administration zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 3 or 7 days reduced food intake and body weight zzso body fat zzso The effect of zzso on food intake and body weight was more pronounced in zzso zzso obese zzso mice compared with zzso controls and was associated with suppressed expression of zzso zzso Y and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso increased zzso protein 1 zzso expression in BAT and energy expenditure in zzso obese zzso zzso zzso observations revealed a sustained reduction in body weight for several days zzso treatment of zzso but not zzso mice, followed by a gradual regain in body weight over 28 zzso Finally, zzso administration improved the zzso profile in both zzso obese zzso and zzso mice and resulted in a significantly improved zzso response to oral zzso tolerance tests in zzso zzso compared with zzso mice of similar body zzso These data suggest that zzso may act through a zzso downstream of the putative point responsible for zzso resistance in zzso obese zzso and zzso mice to alter food zzso body weight, body zzso and zzso zzso has delayed and persistent effects in zzso obese zzso mice, which account for a reduction in body weight over and above what would be expected based on decreased foot intake zzso
