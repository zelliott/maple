zzso with bilateral zzso zzso in the general region of the zzso zzso zzso nucleus develop zzso excessive food intake and zzso zzso zzso zzso destroys zzso of the zzso zzso zzso nucleus and produces zzso but zzso zzso zzso mustard zzso primarily destroys zzso zzso but has produced only a slight obesity even when rats were maintained on high-fat zzso In the present study, rats treated with zzso zzso zzso were zzso moderately obese and zzso zzso rats zzso zzso zzso were not different from controls when fed standard zzso zzso However, zzso rats zzso + zzso zzso were zzso zzso obese and zzso Thus, two components of the zzso zzso syndrome previously attributed to zzso damage zzso and zzso were reproduced simply by zzso treatment zzso The third component zzso occurred only when both zzso and zzso were zzso suggesting that zzso in both zzso may perform a zzso function and may be able to substitute for one another in this zzso Since zzso treatment is required for all components of both obesity syndromes described here, this underscores the importance of zzso zzso in mechanisms of zzso The combined treatment approach also represents the first rat model of zzso zzso obesity that can be entirely produced by systemic administration of zzso
