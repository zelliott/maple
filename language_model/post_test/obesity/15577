We tested the inverse relationship between body fat and food hoarding in zzso zzso by decreasing or increasing body fat through partial surgical zzso zzso or by making zzso zzso of the zzso nucleus of the zzso zzso zzso We asked three zzso 1) Is food hoarding increased after body fat loss due to zzso 2) Is food hoarding decreased after zzso 3) Does zzso affect the hoarding response to zzso zzso housed in a simulated zzso system increased food hoarding after zzso followed by a decrease to zzso levels as body fat was partially compensated through an increase in the mass of their zzso fat zzso zzso zzso had increased body mass and food intake but did not have decreased food zzso nor was food hoarding increased by zzso in zzso zzso The partial body fat compensation by zzso + zzso zzso suggests that the damaged zzso did not cause a general failure to sense energy deficits but did affect the ability to integrate internal and external energy zzso
