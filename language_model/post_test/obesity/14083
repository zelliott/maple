This review focuses on the possible association between types of fatty acids and weight zzso It examines the biological zzso underlining these associations and the evidence obtained to date from clinical trials and zzso zzso Animal studies have shown that dietary zzso and zzso fatty acids compared to zzso fatty acids appear to promote weight zzso Similarly, zzso fatty acids zzso appear to favor weight loss compared to saturated fatty acids zzso in human zzso The structure of fatty acids seems to affect their degree of zzso and zzso Although results are zzso human studies follow the general trend reported in animal zzso These trials suggest that some fatty acids are prone to zzso and some others lead to fat storage when comparing zzso zzso For instance, zzso zzso fatty acids zzso zzso and zzso acids are zzso zzso to other zzso but results remain zzso zzso studies concerning this issue reported that total dietary fat, which includes zzso zzso and zzso could increase the risk of zzso but results are few and zzso The rising biological zzso linking dietary fat quality and risk of zzso together with the rather recent addition of fatty acids content in food composition tables, support the need for major zzso studies in that zzso
