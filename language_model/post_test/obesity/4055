zzso zzso rats exhibit marked zzso when compared to lean zzso but deposit a smaller percentage of total dietary energy as body zzso This study was designed to determine the roles of skeletal muscle protein zzso protein degradation, zzso or DNA in producing the lower muscle mass of obese zzso At 44 days, 3 zzso muscles, the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso were significantly smaller in the obese zzso At 72 days, the differences in weights of these muscles were more zzso zzso synthesis and degradation were determined in the zzso at 44 days of age using an in zzso whole muscle incubation zzso zzso synthesis rate was significantly decreased in the obese zzso These changes were accompanied by reductions in both zzso and DNA zzso zzso changes in zzso acid levels were observed in both the red and white portions of the zzso zzso These changes in the anabolic process of protein zzso appear to be sufficient to account for the reduced muscle mass in the obese zzso zzso
