The objective of this study was to compare the effects of zzso zzso gastric bypass carried out by zzso versus that accomplished by zzso on pulmonary zzso 

A total of 26 women zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso were studied candidates for zzso zzso gastric bypass carried out by zzso zzso zzso and zzso (or open surgery zzso zzso zzso patients having lung disease, and those unable to carry out the tests properly were zzso The physical therapy was standardized for both the zzso Respiratory evaluation was carried out during the zzso period and on the second zzso day by using zzso and other tests that evaluated respiratory muscle strength and zzso zzso zzso was evaluated by the visual analog scale on the second zzso zzso The statistical analysis was carried out with zzso or zzso tests, depending on the distribution of zzso considering zzso as statistically zzso 

Patients were similar with respect to age, zzso and zzso zzso A decrease in all variables was observed for both the groups in the zzso period, although this decrease was less pronounced in the LG zzso zzso intensity was also lower in the LG zzso The length of hospital stay was 2 days, and there were no pulmonary zzso 

As there were no differences in the zzso of pulmonary complications and the length of hospital stay between the groups, the results showed that zzso zzso gastric bypass carried out by zzso caused less pain and impairment of pulmonary function in the zzso zzso
