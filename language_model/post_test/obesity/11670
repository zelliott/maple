To investigate the independent and combined effects of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene and the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein 1 zzso gene on body weight change in type 2 diabetic and zzso control subjects during a zzso follow-up zzso 

Controlled zzso follow-up study with zzso 5 and zzso zzso 

70 newly zzso middle-aged type 2 diabetic patients and 123 zzso control subjects from eastern zzso 

zzso zzso blood pressure, oral zzso tolerance test, plasma insulin, plasma zzso and zzso zzso by zzso chain reaction followed by zzso zzso 

No significant differences were found in the zzso of the two zzso between diabetic and control zzso The zzso were not zzso or zzso associated with body weight or zzso in diabetic or control zzso When the diabetic and control subjects were zzso together, the change in the mean body weight was significantly greater among the subjects with both zzso zzso zzso zzso than among those with no zzso zzso zzso zzso change in weight zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso and change in Body Mass Index zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso 

The simultaneous existence of the two zzso was associated with a tendency to gain weight suggesting a synergistic effect of these zzso on body weight zzso
