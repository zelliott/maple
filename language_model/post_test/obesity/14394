We reported previously that zzso reduced the energy density of body weight gain (an indicator of zzso gain in lean and fat zzso and the efficiency of energy retention in obese zzso mice to values zzso those in lean mice, but that zzso had much less influence on these parameters in zzso mice fed a zzso high fat zzso To determine if fat was the exclusive factor in the zzso high fat diet that negated effects of zzso zzso mice were fed a zzso high zzso zzso diet identical in composition to the high fat diet, except for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso mice fed the zzso high zzso diet from 4 to 7 zzso of age zzso those of mice fed the zzso high fat diet, not those of mice fed the high zzso zzso zzso Plasma zzso responses to a zzso load in zzso zzso mice paralleled the zzso changes in energy zzso These results demonstrate that diet composition interacts with adrenal zzso to influence energy and zzso metabolism in zzso zzso consumption of either a zzso high zzso or high fat diet zzso the beneficial effects of zzso on energy and zzso metabolism observed when zzso zzso mice consume a zzso zzso
