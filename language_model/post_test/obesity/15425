Whereas development of resistance to the action of insulin on zzso metabolism during gestation has been zzso it is presently not known whether there is also resistance to the action of insulin on zzso zzso We have, therefore, examined the effect of zzso zzso (during zzso zzso on free fatty acid zzso turnover in seven zzso overweight or obese women during and after zzso zzso rates of zzso release, zzso and zzso and zzso plasma zzso zzso were not significantly different from each other during the 2nd and 3rd zzso of pregnancy and zzso During zzso zzso 500 zzso zzso however, zzso was significantly less inhibited during the 3rd zzso (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than during the 2nd zzso (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, fat zzso was not inhibited at all (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during the 3rd zzso but was suppressed by 51% (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during the 2nd zzso and by 38% (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These data demonstrated that resistance to the action of insulin on zzso and on fat zzso developed during late gestation and disappeared zzso
