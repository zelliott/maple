zzso populations from gastrointestinal tracts of genetically lean and obese pigs fed a low- or zzso diet zzso or 50% alfalfa zzso zzso were zzso with rumen fluid media and specific energy zzso Total culture counts in zzso samples declined 56 zzso greater than zzso and zzso zzso less than zzso in lean and obese animals, respectively, 3 weeks after feeding the zzso zzso After 8 weeks, culture counts had risen and were similar to those obtained before alfalfa was fed zzso zzso At slaughter, 12 to 17 weeks after feeding the zzso diet, total counts from zzso samples of lean pigs continued to rise and were zzso greater than the zzso counts, whereas counts from obese animals declined 37% zzso greater than zzso The number of zzso bacteria in zzso samples of zzso pigs fed the zzso diet increased 80 and zzso from 0 to 3 weeks and 3 to 8 weeks, zzso This overall increases from 0 to 8 weeks in lean pigs was significant zzso less than zzso however, these increases were not seen in obese zzso These data suggest that the zzso is initially suppressed when exposed to a zzso diet and that later some adaptation takes place, apparently more so in lean than in obese zzso When specific energy sources were used to delineate the distribution of different bacterial populations in the zzso zzso and zzso trends could be detected between zzso and zzso zzso These data also support the concept that bacteria populations from different sites in the large zzso zzso
