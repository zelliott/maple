zzso is associated with reduced operating lung zzso We hypothesized that obesity zzso airway dysfunction independent of reduced zzso 

18 obese zzso zzso zzso zzso and 17 non-obese subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso by forced zzso technique, ventilation zzso zzso clearance index zzso zzso zzso by multiple breath nitrogen zzso and closing capacity zzso by single breath nitrogen zzso 

zzso had higher zzso and zzso and lower zzso and zzso After adjustment for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso still correlated with zzso zzso capacity (as % predicted zzso was not increased but was closer to zzso in the obese zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso correlated with zzso 

In zzso there are abnormalities in airway function that are independent of reduced zzso zzso closure is not increased but zzso occurs close to zzso affecting zzso and zzso
