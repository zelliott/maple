zzso a potent zzso zzso zzso zzso suppresses zzso and improves zzso intolerance and insulin zzso Recent evidence suggests that zzso may produce these effects by altering central nervous system zzso regulation of zzso To determine whether or not the zzso plays a critical role in these zzso effects on peripheral zzso we compared the zzso responses to zzso when administered peripherally versus centrally in naturally obese and zzso intolerant Syrian zzso Male zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso were treated with zzso or vehicle either zzso zzso 800 zzso or zzso zzso 1 zzso daily at 1 h after light onset for 14 days while held on 14-hour daily zzso zzso tolerance tests zzso 3 g zzso zzso were conducted after zzso Compared to control animals, zzso zzso significantly reduced weight gain zzso zzso zzso zzso and the areas under the zzso and insulin zzso zzso by 29 and zzso zzso Similarly, compared with zzso controls, zzso zzso at 1 zzso substantially reduced weight gain zzso zzso zzso zzso the areas under the zzso and insulin zzso zzso by 31 and zzso respectively, and the zzso plasma insulin concentration by zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, both treatments significantly improved zzso suppression of zzso zzso production during a zzso zzso Thus, daily administration of zzso at a very low dose zzso replicates the zzso effects of zzso administered zzso at a much higher zzso This finding demonstrates for the first time that the zzso is a critical target of zzso zzso zzso
