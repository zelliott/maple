The purpose of this study was to identify factors affecting the nocturnal decline in blood pressure zzso in severe zzso 

zzso zzso zzso data, zzso tolerance status, and body fat composition were obtained in 82 candidates for zzso surgery zzso age: 40 (11) years; zzso 46 zzso To determine the nocturnal zzso fall we used zzso ambulatory zzso monitoring to measure the magnitude zzso of nocturnal decline, the % zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso status and nocturnal hypertension zzso 

zzso percent of patients had nocturnal zzso Sixty percent had non zzso status, of which zzso had nocturnal zzso No specific factors were associated with the average zzso zzso and zzso Having zzso abnormalities was of primary importance for all variables evaluating nocturnal zzso decline independent of daytime zzso levels and severity of zzso In comparing patients with or without zzso tolerance zzso the zzso zzso and zzso were significantly higher and the zzso nocturnal decline and % zzso in both zzso and zzso were significantly lower in those with zzso tolerance zzso In an adjusted zzso model, having both zzso abnormalities and nocturnal zzso remained associated with non zzso status with an OR of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso severely obese patients, non zzso status and nocturnal zzso are common, and the presence of zzso abnormalities was the primary variable associated with impaired nocturnal fall in zzso
