Although obese patients are thought to be susceptible to zzso pulmonary zzso there are only limited data on the relationship between obesity and lung volumes after zzso We studied how surgery and obesity affect lung volumes measured by zzso 

We zzso studied 161 patients having either breast surgery zzso A, zzso or lower abdominal zzso zzso B, zzso zzso and general zzso were zzso zzso was measured with the patient zzso in a 30 degrees zzso zzso We measured vital capacity zzso forced vital capacity, peak zzso flow and forced zzso volume in 1 s at zzso assessment zzso after zzso zzso induction of zzso and zzso zzso 1 h and 3 h after zzso 

zzso zzso values were all within the normal zzso All zzso values decreased significantly with increasing body mass index zzso The greatest reduction of mean VC zzso as percentage of baseline zzso occurred after zzso and was more marked after zzso than after breast surgery zzso zzso zzso vs 20 zzso Considering patients according to zzso zzso zzso VC decreased after surgery by 12 zzso 24 zzso and 40 zzso zzso VC recovered more rapidly in Group zzso 

zzso reduction in zzso volumes was related to zzso zzso had more effect on VC than the site of zzso
