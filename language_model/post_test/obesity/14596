Failure to adapt to a changing nutritional environment comes at a cost, as evidenced by the modern human obesity zzso zzso of zzso diets can lead to obesity and is associated with deleterious consequences not only in humans but also in many other animals, including zzso The question thus arises whether animals restricted over multiple generations to zzso diets can evolve mechanisms to limit the deposition of adverse levels of body zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso reared for multiple generations on zzso foods zzso a chemically defined artificial diet or a zzso zzso zzso progressively developed the ability to eat excess zzso without laying it down as fat, providing strong evidence that excess fat storage has a fitness zzso In contrast, zzso reared in zzso environments (a chemically defined artificial diet or a zzso zzso zzso had a greater propensity to store zzso zzso as zzso Additionally, insects reared on the zzso zzso zzso evolved a preference for laying their eggs on this plant, whereas those selected on the zzso zzso zzso showed no zzso Our results provide an experimental example of zzso adaptation in the face of changes in the nutritional environment and suggest that changes in plant zzso profiles may promote zzso population zzso
