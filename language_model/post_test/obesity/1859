To compare zzso nocturnal zzso zzso and multiple sleep zzso test zzso data between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sleep zzso zzso zzso 

This is a retrospective analysis of zzso zzso and zzso data of a large group of zzso patients who underwent a complete zzso evaluation in our sleep disorders zzso The patients were divided in two groups: the zzso group, those patients who had a zzso respiratory zzso index zzso that was at least two times higher than the lateral zzso and the zzso group, those patients in whom the zzso in the zzso position was less than twice that in the lateral zzso 

From a group of 666 consecutive zzso patients whose conditions were diagnosed in our unit from September 1990 to February 1995, zzso patients met the following criteria and were included in the zzso zzso 10; zzso 20 years, and body mass index zzso zzso 

Of all zzso patients, zzso were found to be zzso No differences in height were observed but weight and zzso were significantly higher in the zzso group, these patients being on the average zzso zzso heavier than those in the zzso zzso The zzso group was, on average, 2 years younger than the zzso zzso zzso sleep quality was better preserved in the zzso zzso In this group, sleep efficiency and the percentages of deep sleep zzso 3 and 4) were significantly higher while the percentages of light sleep zzso 1 and 2) were significantly lower than in the zzso zzso No differences for rapid eye movement zzso sleep were zzso In addition, zzso after sleep onset and the number of short zzso zzso zzso were significantly lower in the zzso zzso zzso index and total zzso were significantly higher and the minimal zzso oxygen zzso in zzso and zzso sleep was significantly lower in the zzso No differences in periodic limb movements data were found between the two zzso The average zzso was significantly shorter in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the most dominant variable that zzso with zzso dependency in zzso patients is zzso followed by zzso which also adds a significant contribution to the prediction of zzso zzso Age, although zzso adds only a minor improvement to the prediction of this zzso dependency zzso A zzso obese, and older zzso patient is significantly less likely to be zzso than a zzso thin, and young zzso zzso In four obese zzso patients who lost weight, a much more pronounced reduction was seen in the lateral zzso than in the zzso zzso and three of these cases who were previously zzso became zzso 

In a large population of zzso patients, most were found to have at least twice as many zzso in the zzso than in the lateral zzso These so-called zzso zzso are on the average thinner and younger than zzso zzso They had fewer and less severe breathing abnormalities than the zzso zzso zzso their nocturnal sleep quality was better preserved and, according to zzso data, they were less sleepy during daytime zzso zzso was the most dominant factor that could predict the zzso dependency followed by zzso and zzso zzso showed a threshold effect, the prevalence of zzso in those with severe zzso zzso or zzso 40) was significantly lower than in those zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso showed a major significant inverse relationship with zzso dependency, while age had only a minor although significant inverse relationship with zzso Body position during sleep has a profound effect on the frequency and severity of breathing abnormalities in zzso zzso
