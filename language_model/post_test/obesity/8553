zzso resistance plays an important role in the zzso of human type 2 zzso In humans, a negative correlation between insulin sensitivity and zzso zzso zzso content has been zzso thus, zzso becomes a marker for insulin zzso Recently, magnetic resonance zzso zzso has been established as a dependable method for selective detection and zzso of zzso in zzso To validate the zzso between insulin sensitivity and zzso in an animal model of type 2 diabetes, we established volume selective zzso at 7 zzso to zzso assess zzso in the zzso In male obese zzso zzso zzso rats and their lean zzso zzso levels were determined repeatedly over 4 months, and insulin sensitivity was measured by the zzso clamp method at zzso and at zzso weeks of zzso A distinct relation between zzso and insulin sensitivity was demonstrated as well as age dependence for both zzso zzso treatment caused a clear reduction of zzso and zzso fat despite increased body weight, and a marked improvement of insulin zzso Thus, the insulin zzso properties of zzso were consistent with a zzso of lipids from zzso zzso muscle, zzso back into fat zzso
