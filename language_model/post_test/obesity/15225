zzso white zzso tissue zzso is characterized by large-scale zzso of zzso zzso in parallel with systemic insulin zzso however, the cellular stimulus that zzso this signaling cascade and zzso release is still zzso The objective of this study was to determine the role of the zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso on AT zzso zzso zzso in zzso Here, we find that the zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso are highly induced in AT from high-fat zzso obese mice, concurrent with insulin zzso Global zzso deletion of the zzso regulatory zzso zzso but not knockout of zzso zzso preserves zzso zzso and skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity, despite severe zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and ex zzso zzso zzso in obese zzso mice are markedly reduced despite zzso zzso zzso stress, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, bone zzso transplant studies reveal that these improvements in obese zzso mice are independent of reduced zzso expression in the zzso zzso Taken together, these studies demonstrate that zzso expression plays a critical role in zzso AT insulin sensitivity and, more so, suggest that reduced zzso activity is a key step in the initiation and propagation of the inflammatory response in obese zzso
