We have shown that zzso fetal growth restriction zzso newborn rats exhibit zzso reduced zzso and adult zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is a principal zzso regulator that specifically regulates appetite in the zzso zzso nucleus zzso In response to zzso zzso zzso activity increases the expression of zzso zzso Y zzso and zzso protein zzso and decreases zzso zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso offspring would exhibit zzso zzso zzso contributing to zzso and zzso We determined zzso activity and zzso peptides zzso and zzso during zzso and fed conditions in the ARC of adult zzso and control zzso zzso rats were fed ad zzso diet zzso or were 50% food restricted from gestation day 10 to 21 to produce zzso zzso At 10 months of age, zzso ARC was dissected from zzso zzso zzso and fed control and zzso zzso zzso nucleus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and protein expression zzso and zzso zzso zzso was determined by quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction and Western zzso zzso In the fed state, zzso adult females demonstrated evidence of persistent appetite stimulation with significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso and zzso zzso as compared to fed zzso In controls though not zzso adult zzso zzso significantly increased zzso zzso and zzso and decreased zzso and zzso Despite zzso fed zzso adult females exhibit zzso zzso activity and appetite zzso factors, similar to that exhibited by zzso zzso These results suggest that an enhanced appetite drive in both fed and zzso states contributes to zzso and obesity in zzso zzso
