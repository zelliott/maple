zzso zzso zzso zzso is a gastrointestinal hormone that zzso zzso insulin zzso during a zzso Since zzso has also been shown to exert zzso zzso and zzso zzso effects in zzso both zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been considered as potential zzso in type 2 diabetes zzso In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that chronically zzso zzso levels in a transgenic zzso mouse model would increase zzso tissue expansion and exert beneficial effects on zzso zzso In contrast, although zzso zzso mice demonstrated enhanced zzso function, resulting in improved zzso tolerance and insulin sensitivity, they exhibited reduced zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso and zzso zzso were both greatly reduced, and a number of genes involved in zzso zzso signaling pathways were found to be zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso mice was associated with decreased energy zzso involving zzso of zzso zzso Together, these studies suggest that, in the context of zzso transgenic zzso zzso has the potential to improve zzso and zzso function as well as zzso zzso
