Only limited data are available on the development and feasibility zzso of zzso interventions to prevent and reduce obesity in zzso Clear documentation of the zzso process of development and content of such interventions is essential to enable other researchers to understand why interventions succeed or zzso 

This paper describes the development of the Healthy zzso zzso zzso a zzso intervention to prevent obesity in children, through the first 4 steps of the zzso zzso protocol zzso The intervention focuses on the following health zzso zzso reduction of the consumption of zzso zzso drinks, zzso increase in the proportion of healthy snacks consumed and zzso reduction of TV viewing and other zzso activities, within the context of a wider attempt to improve diet and increase physical zzso
