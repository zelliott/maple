zzso is characterized by the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is one of two known zzso zzso that catalyze the final and only committed step in zzso zzso In this report, we describe the pharmacological effects of a novel selective zzso zzso zzso This compound inhibited zzso synthesis in both zzso and skeletal zzso and increased fatty acid zzso in skeletal zzso at 1 zzso The repeated administration of zzso to zzso obese zzso and genetically obese zzso mice zzso zzso for zzso weeks) significantly decreased the visceral fat pad weights and the zzso zzso contents compared to controls without affecting food zzso In addition, fatty acid zzso in skeletal muscle zzso was increased by the treatment of zzso in both mice zzso This is the first report demonstrating that a small synthetic zzso inhibitor increases fatty acid zzso in skeletal muscle in zzso and ex zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso is a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of obesity and zzso abnormalities such as zzso zzso
