Wide ranges in weight and fat gain in response to high-fat diets have been reported in zzso This study measured zzso zzso in zzso tissue of normal weight, zzso female zzso rats as a zzso predictor of zzso zzso before feeding them a high-fat zzso zzso diet for 11 zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso was zzso and the zzso release was measured after incubation with 0, zzso zzso and zzso M zzso zzso in gain efficiency explained much of the variation in zzso zzso zzso zzso and weight zzso zzso zzso zzso Low zzso release by zzso and zzso M zzso was significantly correlated to high final fat zzso Low and high zzso based on zzso release were not different in numbers of zzso or food intake but were significantly different in gain efficiency zzso zzso zzso final weight zzso zzso zzso carcass zzso zzso zzso zzso and carcass lean mass zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, female zzso rats are zzso predisposed to efficiency of zzso zzso on a high-fat zzso This tendency is zzso correlated in the zzso state to the zzso response to zzso of subcutaneous zzso tissue in zzso
