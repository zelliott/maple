The slowing of gastric zzso is an important mechanism for the zzso effect of gut zzso zzso After food zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are released from the gastrointestinal tract to mediate zzso In humans, zzso and the zzso have been found to cause zzso in both normal and obese zzso This zzso effect may be caused by the peptides circulating as hormones with direct effects in the central nervous system, or indirect effects through signals zzso either via the zzso nerve or by zzso of zzso zzso fibers due to slow gastric zzso These peptides also cause gastric relaxation, considered an additional component in the zzso effect of the zzso To zzso after food zzso gut peptides may act in concert as zzso zzso signals acting directly in the brain or indirectly via the zzso zzso as well as through gastric sensory mechanisms to limit food zzso
