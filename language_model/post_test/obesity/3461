zzso and hypertension, known zzso states, are identified zzso for increased retinal zzso zzso However, the molecular link between inflammation and zzso zzso remains zzso zzso protein zzso is zzso as an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso This study aims to examine zzso expression and zzso its role in zzso zzso zzso and retinal zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and control zzso zzso rats were compared with groups fed a high-fat diet zzso zzso and zzso for zzso 

Compared with W controls, zzso alone or in combination with hypertension significantly induced formation of zzso zzso a hallmark of retinal zzso zzso These effects were accompanied by significant increases in zzso zzso zzso and expression of zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso significantly increased interaction of zzso and expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies identified zzso expression within zzso and zzso cells surrounding retinal zzso zzso To model zzso in zzso human retinal zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso coupled to zzso zzso zzso triggered expression of zzso and its interaction with zzso resulting in zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells abolished zzso zzso zzso release into medium and cell death, evident by decreases in zzso zzso expression and the proportion of live to dead zzso 

These findings provide the first evidence for enhanced zzso expression in hypertension and zzso retinal zzso response and suggest that zzso is required for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the release of zzso in zzso zzso
