zzso syndrome has been associated with impaired zzso quality of life zzso in several zzso Many studies used only one zzso measure and failed to adjust for important zzso zzso including zzso depression and zzso zzso 

To investigate the relationship between zzso syndrome and zzso using multiple zzso We also sought to determine whether increasing body mass index or diabetes status further modified this zzso 

This zzso study included 390 obese participants with elevated waist circumference and at least one other criterion for zzso zzso Of these 390 participants, zzso had zzso syndrome zzso is, they met 3 out of the 5 criteria specified by the zzso (National zzso Education zzso and 121 did zzso Participants were enrolled in a primary zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed using two generic instruments, the Medical Outcomes Study zzso 12 and the zzso as well as an zzso measure, the Impact of Weight on Quality of zzso zzso in zzso were compared among participants with and without zzso zzso zzso linear zzso was used to determine how zzso varied according to zzso syndrome status, and whether factors including weight, depression and burden of zzso disease modified this zzso 

zzso syndrome was not associated with zzso as assessed by any of the zzso In zzso analysis, depression, disease burden and employment status were significantly associated with worse zzso on all zzso In multivariable models, only depression remained significantly associated with reduced zzso on all zzso zzso obesity and diabetes status did not modify the relationship between zzso syndrome and zzso 

In contrast to previous studies, zzso syndrome was not associated with impaired zzso as assessed by multiple zzso This suggests that zzso syndrome in itself is not associated with decreased zzso but other factors such as zzso depression and greater disease burden may significantly influence the quality of life in this zzso
