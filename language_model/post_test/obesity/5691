The purpose of these studies was to determine if the zzso of zzso bodies as a carbon source for zzso could account for the decreased zzso body production by zzso of obese zzso rats, as well as contribute to the enhanced rates of fatty acid synthesis observed in these zzso zzso body production was decreased from zzso zzso in the lean to 538 zzso in the obese zzso zzso less than zzso The incorporation of zzso bodies into fatty acids was significantly greater in the obese rat liver zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso versus obese, zzso zzso P less than zzso The relative contribution of this zzso to the overall rate of fatty acid synthesis was not affected by zzso and accounted for only 3 to zzso of the fatty acids zzso The incorporation of zzso bodies into zzso zzso zzso was similar in the two zzso zzso zzso zzso versus obese zzso zzso zzso This accounted for zzso and zzso of the total zzso synthesis in lean and obese rat zzso zzso The total incorporation of zzso bodies into zzso was zzso zzso in the lean rat zzso and zzso zzso in the obese zzso less than zzso The net increase was 35 zzso zzso whereas the net decrease in zzso was zzso zzso Thus, although zzso body carbon zzso for zzso synthesis was increased in the liver of the obese rats, this zzso could only account for a fraction of the zzso difference in zzso body production and was of relatively minor importance as a source of carbon for zzso fatty acid synthesis in both lean and obese zzso
