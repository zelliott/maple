The purpose of these studies was to test the hypothesis that dietary variety decreases the rate of zzso and increases energy intake in zzso 

In zzso 1, zzso in response to the same or a variety of food cues was measured followed by consumption of the study zzso In zzso 2, children responded in a computer task to earn points for the same or a variety of low or high energy density foods, which were then zzso 

zzso number of responses, and energy intake were zzso 

Participants in the same groups zzso faster than those in the variety groups zzso zzso zzso and in zzso 2, the effect of variety was independent of energy zzso Participants in the variety groups also consumed more energy than those in the same groups in both experiments zzso zzso zzso 

zzso variety disrupted zzso and increased energy intake in zzso In addition, the response to dietary variety was independent of energy density, suggesting that increasing variety of low energy density foods may increase zzso
