Children snore less than adults and have fewer zzso zzso suggesting a less collapsible upper zzso We therefore hypothesized that the zzso upper airway responses to zzso pressure loading decrease with age because of changes in upper airway structure and zzso zzso We measured upper airway upstream zzso relationships during sleep in 20 zzso zzso children and zzso zzso were made by zzso zzso zzso zzso with the level of zzso pressure applied via a zzso The slope of the upstream zzso curve zzso was used to characterize upper airway zzso We found that zzso was zzso in children than in adults (8 zzso 5 zzso 30 zzso 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and that zzso correlated with age zzso zzso zzso P zzso and body mass index zzso zzso zzso 63, P zzso The zzso pressure in 100 zzso during sleep was measured in six children and two adults; it correlated zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso We conclude that the upper airway zzso responses to zzso pressure loading decrease with zzso This is associated with increased body mass index, even in zzso zzso zzso zzso drive during sleep plays a role in modulating upper airway zzso
