In order to assess the beneficial effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on reduction of mass and zzso of function of pancreatic beta cells under diabetic conditions, diabetic zzso zzso mice were treated with zzso for 6 weeks, and insulin zzso capacity and insulin content of isolated pancreatic zzso were zzso In addition, the expression of zzso stress zzso zzso zzso proteins and zzso zzso in zzso zzso was examined to measure reduction of zzso stress in pancreatic beta zzso The capacity for zzso insulin zzso from isolated zzso and their insulin content were improved by zzso treatment zzso zzso When beta cells were stained with zzso zzso those of zzso mice treated with zzso exhibited strong zzso as also observed in their lean zzso The density of zzso for zzso stress markers was significantly reduced in pancreatic zzso of zzso zzso mice zzso zzso This study clearly demonstrates the benefit of long-term treatment with zzso in decreasing zzso and improving zzso insulin zzso capacity in diabetic zzso zzso The results of zzso examination suggest that this treatment reduces zzso stress and thereby preserves zzso zzso Treatment with zzso thus protects against zzso damage and would be useful for restoration of insulin zzso capacity in obese diabetes zzso
