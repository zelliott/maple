There is considerable interest in defining the relationship between zzso variation and the risk of common complex zzso Strategies which assist in the zzso of target zzso that have the potential to be zzso regulated might provide a useful approach in identifying concrete examples of zzso zzso Focusing on the zzso role of zzso factors in the zzso of obesity this report outlines an approach zzso gene expression data and a suite of zzso tools to zzso a list of target candidate genes for more detailed experimental zzso Gene expression zzso were performed using peripheral blood zzso from children aged zzso selected from the zzso zzso Birth Growth Study which were grouped by body mass index zzso Genes showing zzso fold differential expression between low and high zzso groups were selected for in zzso zzso Several zzso tools were used for each following zzso 1) a literature search was carried out to identify whether the zzso expressed genes were associated with zzso zzso Of those zzso zzso putative zzso regulated promoters were identified by 2) defining the promoter regions, 3) then by selecting promoters with a zzso island zzso 4) and then by identifying any zzso factor binding zzso covering zzso sites within the zzso This zzso processing culminated in the identification of a short list of target zzso genes zzso regulated by DNA zzso which can be taken forward for experimental zzso The proposed zzso provides a flexible, versatile and low cost methodology for target gene zzso that is zzso to multiple species and disease zzso
