Several studies have shown that obesity is associated with more aggressive prostate cancer zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso as body mass index zzso is associated with a higher risk of zzso zzso invasion zzso in patients undergoing extended pelvic zzso zzso dissection zzso 

Clinical and pathological data were available for zzso consecutive men with zzso treated with radical zzso zzso and zzso at a single European zzso academic zzso zzso and multivariable zzso zzso analyses addressed the rate of zzso zzso consisted of zzso prostate specific zzso zzso biopsy zzso sum, clinical stage history of diabetes zzso as well as zzso coded as either continuous or zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso or more) zzso zzso accuracy was assessed with area under curve zzso 

zzso zzso was diagnosed in 105 patients zzso Mean number of removed zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso Of all zzso patients, zzso zzso were normal weight, 518 zzso overweight, and 104 zzso were clinically zzso zzso of zzso did not significantly differ across different zzso categories zzso zzso and 30 zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso In zzso zzso models, neither continuously coded nor zzso zzso was a significant predictor of zzso at zzso or multivariable analyses (all zzso Moreover, inclusion of zzso with zzso clinical stage, biopsy zzso sum and presence of zzso did not increase the ability of these variables to predict zzso zzso without zzso vs zzso and zzso with zzso coded as continuous and zzso zzso zzso all zzso zzso 

In men undergoing zzso and zzso increased zzso was not associated with increased risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso routinely considering patient zzso in risk zzso schemes or zzso zzso models may not be zzso
