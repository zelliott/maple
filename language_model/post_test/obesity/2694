Excess food intake leads to obesity and diabetes, both of which are well-known independent risk factors for zzso and both of which are growing zzso in an aging zzso We hypothesized that aging enhances the zzso and vascular effects of high fat diet zzso and therefore examined the effect of age on zzso and insulin resistance in zzso zzso knockout zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso mice developed substantially worse zzso syndrome, diabetes, and zzso than zzso zzso zzso mice when both were fed zzso for 3 months, despite similar zzso in total cholesterol zzso zzso analyses were performed to analyze the mechanism responsible for the marked acceleration of zzso in middle-aged zzso zzso middle-aged mice had greater zzso expression of multiple zzso genes than zzso young mice, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression of these zzso markedly increased in young mice fed zzso but decreased or only modestly increased in middle-aged mice fed zzso despite the fact that systemic zzso stress and vascular zzso oxygen species generation, measured by plasma zzso zzso concentration zzso and zzso conversion and zzso expression zzso were greater in middle-aged mice fed zzso Thus, the mechanism for the accelerated vascular injury in older zzso mice was likely the profound inability to mount an zzso zzso This effect was related to a decrease in vascular expression of 2 key zzso pathways regulating the zzso response, zzso and zzso box, zzso O family zzso Treatment of middle-aged mice fed zzso with the zzso zzso attenuated zzso whereas treatment with the insulin zzso zzso attenuated both zzso syndrome and zzso Both treatments decreased zzso zzso A novel effect of zzso was to increase expression of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso a downstream target of zzso contributing to enhanced expression of vascular zzso zzso This investigation underscores the role of zzso stress when multiple zzso risk factors, particularly aging, zzso on the vessel wall and emphasizes the need to develop effective strategies to inhibit zzso stress to protect aging zzso
