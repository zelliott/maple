zzso The authors present a system developed for the Challenge in Natural Language zzso for Clinical zzso zzso obesity challenge, whose aim was to automatically identify the status of obesity and 15 related zzso in patients using their clinical discharge zzso The challenge consisted of two tasks, zzso and zzso The zzso task was to identify explicit references to the diseases, whereas the intuitive task focused on the prediction of the disease status when the evidence was not explicitly zzso DESIGN The authors assembled a set of resources to zzso and zzso profile the diseases and their associated symptoms, treatments, zzso These features were explored in a hybrid text mining approach, which combined dictionary zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The methods were applied on a set of zzso previously unseen discharge zzso and the predictions were evaluated against a manually prepared gold zzso The overall ranking of the participating teams was primarily based on the zzso zzso zzso The implemented method achieved the zzso zzso of zzso for the zzso task (which was the highest achieved in the zzso and zzso for the intuitive task zzso zzso out of 28 zzso highest was zzso The zzso zzso showed an average accuracy of zzso for zzso and zzso for intuitive zzso zzso The performance achieved was in line with the agreement between human zzso indicating the potential of text mining for accurate and efficient prediction of disease zzso from clinical discharge zzso
