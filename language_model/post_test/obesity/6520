Recent studies have shown the zzso power of abdominal distribution of zzso tissue for the development of cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes as well as strong associations to the previously known risk factors for these zzso The reason for the zzso of abdominal fat might be due to an imbalance between cortisol and sex steroid zzso zzso zzso density seems to be particularly high in abdominal zzso zzso leading to expression of zzso zzso activity primarily zzso zzso and testosterone seems to counteract this, the former perhaps through competition with the cortisol zzso zzso of zzso fat, particularly in the zzso drained by the portal zzso probably leads to high free fatty acid zzso in the portal zzso because of the high zzso sensitivity of these zzso This in turn seems to inhibit zzso clearance of portal insulin, leading to peripheral zzso insulin resistance, perhaps hypertension as well as zzso via drive by free fatty acids of zzso synthesis in the zzso These are risk factors for diabetes, cardiovascular disease and zzso It is of interest that subjects with abdominal zzso tissue have several factors leading to increased cortisol and low sex steroid hormone zzso including stress, high alcohol consumption and zzso This might provide some of the background to this zzso
