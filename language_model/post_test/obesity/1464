The existence of a DNA zzso at the zzso zzso locus could be of great interest for genetic analysis of obesity and related disorders since zzso zzso is the zzso zzso of zzso tissue zzso and therefore plays a key role in energy zzso The zzso zzso repeat zzso was identified within a human zzso clone selected with a rat zzso zzso zzso This marker was subsequently localized to the short arm of zzso 19 zzso whereas human zzso zzso zzso had been mapped to the long arm of zzso 19 zzso A zzso of the zzso zzso gene or the presence of a zzso could explain the zzso zzso from the two regions were analyzed in Southern zzso zzso A human zzso tissue zzso zzso full-length zzso probe zzso only to zzso from the zzso region whereas the zzso zzso probe zzso only to zzso from the zzso zzso These data show that the occurrence of gene zzso or the presence of a zzso on the short arm of zzso 19 is very unlikely and that zzso is unrelated to the zzso zzso zzso
