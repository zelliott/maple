A set of common zzso risk factors have been associated with the risk of breast cancer despite of its molecular zzso We implemented a case series study with the primary objective of evaluating if obesity is associated with the diagnostic risk of zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso relative to the most commonly diagnosed zzso of breast zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso 

zzso clinical and zzso data were collected from existing zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and hormone receptors were zzso as either positive or zzso zzso zzso was used to assess the prevalence of different zzso Body mass index was calculated from weight and height data collected at the time of zzso 

zzso from the present study suggest that excess body weight decreases the diagnostic risk of zzso zzso or zzso zzso relative to zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso and overweight women are more likely to be diagnosed with to zzso and/or zzso zzso the zzso that has best prognosis and mostly associated with personal zzso Weight gain with the population zzso factor of zzso contributes the most to the zzso of invasive post zzso breast zzso Younger zzso women were more likely to be diagnosed with zzso and/or zzso zzso In younger women biology of breast zzso with positive expression for hormone receptors and zzso growth factor is a complex that extends beyond the currently assessed zzso zzso
