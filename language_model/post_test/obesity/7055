The zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a membrane zzso that zzso the zzso by zzso zzso zzso and wasting energy as heat, so playing a role in zzso and energy zzso zzso regulation by insulin is zzso in tissue of zzso zzso mice, we reported a reduction, whereas in zzso zzso Swiss and zzso mice we found an increased activity, which is against a genetic zzso and suggests a regulation by zzso In human zzso tissue from obese patients, zzso activity was reduced and zzso correlated with body mass index, oral zzso tolerance zzso area and blood zzso We hypothesized that obesity is associated with tissue zzso reduction, apparently linked to zzso which may repress or zzso the zzso thus opposing zzso hormones and influencing zzso and obesity zzso zzso action on zzso in zzso might be zzso by the high level of zzso fatty zzso which are circulating zzso zzso and increase in zzso diabetes and zzso In this paper, we zzso animal and human tissue zzso its level, and its regulation and zzso in some zzso and zzso zzso moreover, we discuss the link of the zzso with zzso fatty acids and attempt to interpret and organize in a coherent view the whole body of the exhaustive literature on this complicated zzso
