High plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is a frequent finding in obesity and zzso tissue has recently been suggested to be a source of circulating zzso in zzso In the present study, differences in zzso tissue gene expression and protein zzso rate of zzso between subcutaneous and visceral zzso tissue was zzso in specimens obtained from 22 obese zzso The zzso rate of zzso was zzso higher in subcutaneous zzso tissue than in visceral zzso tissue zzso zzso 50 vs 138 zzso 24 zzso zzso cells, P zzso In accordance with the zzso data, subcutaneous zzso tissue contained about zzso higher levels of zzso zzso than visceral zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso total zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso from subcutaneous but not from visceral zzso tissue correlated significantly with cell size zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso greater amounts of zzso and had a higher zzso gene expression than visceral zzso tissue from the same obese zzso zzso in mind that subcutaneous zzso tissue is the largest fat depot these finding may be important for the zzso abnormalities associated with zzso
