zzso zzso is a common cause of anterior knee pain in young patients and can be detected zzso with magnetic resonance imaging zzso The purpose of our study was to evaluate the correlation between subcutaneous fat thickness around the knee joint on zzso zzso as a surrogate marker of zzso with the presence or absence of zzso zzso 

A retrospective review was conducted of knee zzso in 170 patients who satisfied the inclusion zzso Imaging was performed over a 12-month period on a zzso zzso system with a dedicated zzso zzso Two zzso experienced in musculoskeletal imaging assessed each examination in consensus for the presence or absence of zzso zzso and graded positive studies from 0 zzso to 3 (full cartilage thickness zzso zzso of subcutaneous knee fat thickness was obtained on the zzso aspect of the zzso 

zzso findings of zzso zzso were present in 33 patients zzso of which, there were 11 grade 1 zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso and 13 grade 3 zzso zzso The mean subcutaneous knee fat thickness was significantly higher in the zzso zzso group for all grades compared with the normal group zzso zzso and there was a significant correlation between subcutaneous knee fat thickness and grades of zzso zzso (R zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso Female patients had thicker subcutaneous knee fat and more severe grades of zzso zzso 

zzso knee fat thickness as a surrogate marker of obesity was positively associated with the presence and severity of zzso zzso on zzso
