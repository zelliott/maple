We examined the hypothesis that zzso dysfunction in mice fed a high-fat zzso diet can be prevented by zzso and zzso zzso delivery of the human zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso injection of zzso resulted in expression of human zzso for up to zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased human zzso expression in fat zzso without affecting zzso zzso In mice fed a zzso diet, zzso zzso attenuated the increases in body weight, blood zzso blood pressure, and inflammatory zzso as well as the content of both visceral and subcutaneous zzso zzso of zzso increased the numbers of zzso of small cell size zzso insulin sensitivity zzso zzso levels, as well as vascular relaxation to zzso compared with zzso mice administered the zzso fluorescent zzso zzso of mice fed a zzso diet expressed high levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins and displayed marked increases in zzso specific transcript zzso zzso of zzso lowered the elevated levels of these proteins and increased Sonic zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of HO activity by administration of tin zzso to zzso mice zzso with the zzso reversed the decrease in zzso transcript, zzso and zzso zzso zzso this novel study demonstrates that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso increases insulin zzso and improves zzso function by increasing zzso zzso and zzso and by decreasing inflammatory zzso These effects are reversed by the HO activity zzso zzso zzso
