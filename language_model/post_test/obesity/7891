Because of the similarities between zzso syndrome and insulin resistance zzso metabolism in obesity has been investigated in numerous zzso Our study investigates serum zzso insulin, and cortisol response to oral zzso stimulation in a group of obese and lean zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso obese zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 14 lean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso healthy zzso women were included in the zzso zzso zzso insulin, and cortisol levels were measured at 30-minute intervals during 120 minutes of oral zzso tolerance testing zzso Mean serum zzso and insulin levels were significantly higher in the obese group compared with lean subjects, and cortisol levels were similar during zzso There was not a significant difference for cortisol area under the curve zzso during zzso between the two zzso No correlation between cortisol zzso insulin zzso and zzso zzso was noted for both zzso During zzso a decrease in cortisol levels was observed in both zzso The zzso occurred at 30 minutes of the zzso in the obese group and at 60 minutes of the zzso in the lean zzso At 90 and 120 minutes of the zzso serum cortisol levels were similar to zzso levels in both the obese group and the lean zzso Previous studies reported altered zzso axis activity, altered levels of urinary cortisol zzso and increased zzso clearance of cortisol in zzso In our study in obese women, the only detected difference from lean subjects was a quicker suppression and recovery in serum cortisol levels after zzso zzso
