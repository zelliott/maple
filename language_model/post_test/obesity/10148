zzso and zzso two members of a zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso family, promote both insulin and zzso signaling in a similar fashion in cultured zzso In addition, zzso mediates zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in cultured zzso Here we characterized genetically modified mice lacking zzso zzso or both to determine the zzso roles of these two proteins in zzso zzso of the zzso gene resulted in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso deletion of the zzso gene did not alter zzso energy balance, and zzso zzso Energy zzso energy zzso fat content, body weight, and plasma insulin, zzso zzso and zzso levels were similar between zzso and zzso zzso fed either normal zzso or a high-fat zzso Moreover, deletion of zzso failed to alter insulin and zzso zzso zzso double knockout mice also developed energy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso however, plasma zzso and insulin levels were significantly lower in zzso than in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso but not zzso is a key positive regulator of energy and zzso metabolism in zzso
