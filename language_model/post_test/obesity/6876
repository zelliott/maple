Patients undergoing zzso delivery typically receive a zzso to zzso dose of zzso as zzso zzso zzso This traditional dosage may not provide an adequate tissue concentration of zzso in obese patients during the zzso zzso This study compared the tissue zzso of zzso zzso administered as a either a zzso or a zzso dose prior to zzso delivery in obese zzso 

Twenty obese patients zzso zzso body mass index zzso who underwent zzso delivery completed this zzso zzso Eleven patients received zzso of zzso and nine received zzso Blood and subcutaneous zzso were collected at the times of the incision and zzso zzso zzso were collected at zzso zzso A zzso concentration threshold of zzso for tissue samples was used as a surrogate adequate zzso Plasma and tissue zzso zzso were compared for the two zzso 

Mean zzso zzso cord, and zzso zzso zzso were significantly higher in the zzso treatment group zzso zzso incision site tissue obtained at time of incision creation also was significantly higher in the zzso group than in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso at closure were significantly different in the two dosage groups zzso zzso zzso zzso All tissue samples were above the target of zzso Body zzso did not correlate with the zzso in zzso tissue zzso No surgical site infections, zzso or other adverse effects were zzso 

zzso a zzso dose of zzso of zzso produced blood and tissue zzso zzso that were significantly higher than zzso obtained from a zzso dose in patients with zzso between 35 and zzso undergoing zzso zzso It is unclear if the larger zzso dose produces a more protective zzso effect than that obtained with the more traditional zzso dose for zzso delivery in obese zzso
