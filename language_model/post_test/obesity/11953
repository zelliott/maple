zzso zzso intake has been favorably associated with reduced risk of zzso outcomes in zzso zzso however, few zzso trials have introduced a zzso approach to explore molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso actions of zzso zzso 

We examined the effects of oral zzso supplementation on zzso zzso and global zzso and zzso profiling in overweight zzso 

We undertook this randomized, zzso pilot trial in 14 healthy, overweight volunteers zzso mass index (in zzso zzso who were randomly assigned to receive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or a zzso for 4 zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso blood and urine specimens were collected according to standardized zzso zzso zzso were conducted on blood zzso zzso was extracted and subsequently zzso with the Human Gene ST zzso array zzso Santa zzso zzso zzso zzso profiling was analyzed with the zzso zzso array zzso Laboratories, zzso zzso 

We observed that zzso treatment significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso treatment compared with zzso zzso after zzso zzso P zzso zzso and appeared to decrease zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso treatment compared with zzso zzso after zzso zzso P zzso zzso No consistent patterns were observed across inflammatory zzso Gene expression profiling revealed zzso of 24 genes and zzso of 36 genes including genes related to zzso and inflammatory pathways such as zzso and tumor necrosis zzso protein 9 zzso and zzso basic protein zzso zzso zzso profiling showed significant differences in the expression amounts of several peptides and proteins after zzso 

zzso supplementation for 4 zzso in overweight individuals led to distinct changes in gene expression and zzso profiling consistent with favorable effects on several zzso zzso This trial was registered at zzso as zzso
