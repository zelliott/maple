Patients with type 2 diabetes zzso exhibit zzso and zzso as well as a markedly increased zzso of zzso cardiovascular zzso Here we report the characterization of a novel zzso capable of lowering both zzso and zzso levels in animal zzso This compound, designated zzso is a potent zzso with dual human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In keeping with its zzso activity, zzso caused complete zzso of the elevated zzso in zzso mice and zzso diabetic fatty zzso zzso lowered both cholesterol and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso inhibited cholesterol zzso at steps before zzso and reduced zzso levels of zzso zzso A zzso zzso Moreover, zzso significantly suppressed gene expression of fatty acid synthesis and induced expression of genes for fatty acid degradation and zzso zzso Studies on 17 additional zzso or zzso zzso showed that zzso lowering in zzso correlated with the magnitude of zzso gene expression zzso zzso the presence of zzso zzso did not affect the relationship between zzso gene expression and zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso zzso such as zzso affect zzso zzso leading to an zzso plasma zzso zzso Agents with these properties may provide favorable means for treatment of type 2 diabetes and zzso and the prevention of zzso cardiovascular zzso
