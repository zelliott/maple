The zzso consequences of visceral obesity have been associated with amplification of zzso action by zzso zzso type 1 zzso in zzso zzso This study aimed to assess in a rat model of zzso obesity the effects of pharmacological zzso zzso on the zzso and expression of key genes of zzso metabolism in zzso zzso zzso zzso fed a zzso high-fat diet were treated or not with a specific zzso inhibitor zzso A, 3 zzso for 3 zzso zzso A did not alter food intake or body weight gain but specifically reduced zzso zzso weight zzso and zzso size, without significantly affecting those of zzso or zzso zzso In zzso fat, the inhibitor decreased (to zzso of zzso zzso levels of genes involved in zzso synthesis zzso zzso zzso and fatty acid cycling zzso zzso and zzso and increased zzso the activity of the fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In striking contrast, in the zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso levels of those genes related to zzso zzso and slightly decreased zzso zzso 1 activity, whereas gene expression remained unaffected in the zzso zzso zzso A robustly reduced liver zzso content and plasma zzso The study demonstrates that pharmacological zzso of zzso at a dose that does not alter food zzso reduces fat zzso specifically in the zzso zzso zzso exerts divergent zzso zzso effects on genes of zzso zzso and reduces zzso and zzso
