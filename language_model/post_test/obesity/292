zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso clinical discharge zzso is of great importance in human life science, as it helps physicians to make medical studies by providing statistically relevant data for zzso This can be further facilitated if, at the labeling of discharge zzso semantic labels are also extracted from text, such as whether a given disease is present, zzso questionable in a patient, or is zzso in the zzso The authors present a zzso technique that successfully zzso the semantic zzso zzso DESIGN The authors introduce a zzso zzso semantic zzso technique for use on clinical discharge zzso The zzso is performed in subsequent zzso First, some misleading parts are removed from the zzso then the text is zzso into positive, negative, and uncertain context zzso then a sequence of zzso zzso is applied to assign the appropriate semantic zzso zzso For evaluation the authors used the documents of the zzso zzso Challenge and adopted its evaluation zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso On the two zzso of the zzso Challenge zzso and intuitive zzso the system performed very well, and achieved a zzso zzso zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the intuitive tasks, and obtained second place at the zzso and first place at the intuitive zzso of the zzso zzso The authors show in the paper that a simple zzso zzso can tackle the semantic zzso task more successfully than machine learning techniques, if the training data are limited and some semantic labels are very zzso
