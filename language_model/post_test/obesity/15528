The effects of zzso flow and inflation volume on the mechanical properties of the respiratory system in eight zzso and paralyzed zzso zzso obese patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso who had never smoked and had normal zzso seated zzso were investigated by using the technique of rapid airway zzso during zzso zzso With the patients in the zzso position, we measured the zzso resistance zzso which in humans probably reflects airway resistance, the zzso resistance zzso zzso due to zzso pressure dissipation and zzso inequalities, and zzso respiratory zzso zzso zzso pressure zzso was measured by using a zzso zzso and functional residual capacity was measured by the zzso zzso The results were compared with a previous study on 16 normal zzso paralyzed zzso Compared with normal zzso we found that in obese zzso 1) functional residual capacity was markedly lower zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was higher (24 zzso zzso zzso 2) zzso zzso zzso was increased zzso zzso 59 zzso 3) the zzso curve of the respiratory system was zzso with an zzso zzso 4) zzso zzso and delta zzso were higher than normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5) zzso increased with increasing zzso flow, zzso did not change, and delta zzso decreased zzso and 6) with increasing inflation volume, zzso and zzso zzso whereas delta zzso rose zzso Overall, our data suggest that obese subjects during sedation and paralysis are characterized by zzso and marked zzso of the mechanical properties of the respiratory system, largely explained by a reduction in lung volume due to the excessive zzso zzso
