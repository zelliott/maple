zzso sleep zzso zzso is characterized by a marked sympathetic zzso as documented by the elevated sympathetic nerve firing rate detected in peripheral muscle zzso No data are available, however, on the zzso of sympathetic drive in vascular regional districts other than the muscle zzso 

In 66 middle-aged zzso individuals classified according to zzso zzso ratio and zzso index as lean individuals without zzso zzso zzso or with zzso zzso zzso zzso and as obese individuals without zzso zzso zzso or with zzso zzso zzso zzso we measured blood pressure, heart rate, muscle sympathetic nerve activity zzso and skin sympathetic nerve activity zzso respectively, via zzso zzso also included zzso responses to an emotional zzso 

The four groups were matched for age, sex and blood pressure zzso Both in lean and obese individuals, presence of zzso was accompanied by zzso values significantly greater than those found in zzso zzso In contrast, no significant difference was found in zzso values between zzso and zzso patients both in the lean and in the obese zzso This was the case also for the zzso responses to an emotional zzso 

These data provide the first evidence that in zzso the zzso overdrive seen in the muscle circulation is not detected in zzso circulation and thus it cannot be regarded as a generalized phenomenon affecting the whole cardiovascular zzso Further studies are needed to clarify whether in zzso sympathetic drive of other vascular districts, such as the zzso zzso or cerebral zzso is activated or zzso
