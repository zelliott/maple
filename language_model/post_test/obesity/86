Four lines of mice, two lines selected for rapid growth zzso body zzso zzso and zzso and their zzso control lines zzso and zzso respectively), were examined for traits related to zzso The zzso line is obese while the other three lines are normal in body composition at 10 weeks of age when fed stock zzso In experiment I, mice were fed stock diet and examined at intervals from 4 to 22 weeks of zzso Mice were fed either a zzso or high-fat diet in experiment II and examined at 4, 6 and 10 weeks of zzso The traits measured were serum zzso serum insulin and in zzso insulin responsiveness of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined at 10 weeks of zzso zzso responsiveness was determined for the zzso muscle by zzso zzso Body weights differed significantly zzso greater than zzso greater than zzso greater than zzso P less than zzso The zzso obese line was zzso and mildly zzso while the zzso line was zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso muscle were similar among lines while the zzso zzso by zzso and zzso lines was less zzso less than zzso than the zzso zzso by their control zzso Diet did not affect zzso zzso but high-fat diets reduced zzso less than zzso the insulin zzso zzso when compared to the zzso zzso zzso lines had more and larger zzso zzso than control lines when fed the stock diet zzso less than zzso zzso insulin responsiveness of muscle tissue among the lines occurred zzso with an increase in zzso zzso
