Poor early growth is associated with Type II diabetes, hypertension and other features of the zzso syndrome in zzso It has been suggested that this results from the development of a thrifty zzso by a zzso zzso Such a zzso would zzso the offspring to the development of obesity if born into conditions of zzso The present study aimed to determine if early nutrition affected subsequent development of zzso Mice were established as zzso zzso controls zzso of control zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso fed a zzso diet during pregnancy, but nursed by control zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of control zzso nursed by zzso zzso Mice were weaned on to standard laboratory zzso or a cafeteria zzso zzso zzso although smaller at birth ( P zzso caught up and exceeded the weight of control offspring by 7 days of age ( P zzso zzso zzso offspring were smaller than controls by 7 days of age ( P zzso zzso animals gained more weight than controls when given free access to a highly palatable diet ( P zzso zzso zzso animals showed no additional weight gain when given a highly palatable diet compared with zzso zzso These results suggest that the early environment has long-term consequences for weight zzso These programmed responses are powerful enough to block excess weight gain from a highly palatable diet and, thus, have major implications for the drug-free regulation of food intake and zzso
