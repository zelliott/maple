The goals of this study were to assess zzso the impact of zzso alcohol use, and smoking on total mortality and to test the zzso hypothesis that subjects with two or more of these risk factors may experience an elevated risk of overall zzso 

Information on body mass index zzso alcohol zzso cigarette smoking, and other zzso factors was obtained from a cohort of zzso zzso men living in zzso They were between 45 and 68 years of age at the initial examination zzso After 22 years of follow-up that included nearly zzso zzso of zzso zzso deaths from all causes were zzso 

There was a significant zzso zzso relation between zzso and overall zzso A weaker zzso pattern in risk was also present for the intake of zzso A strong positive association was observed with zzso of cigarette zzso A synergistic interaction between zzso and alcohol was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso Specifically, men who had the lowest body mass zzso zzso zzso and drank moderately to heavily zzso or zzso 25 zzso experienced a zzso excess risk zzso risk, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso - zzso compared to a reference group composed of men who had intermediate body mass zzso zzso - zzso zzso and drank occasionally to lightly zzso - zzso zzso The increase in risk due to the interactive effect of low zzso and high alcohol intake was stronger (and statistically zzso than when each of these risk factors was considered separately zzso risk, zzso and zzso zzso There was no significant interaction for zzso and cigarette smoking, for alcohol and cigarette smoking, or for the three factors zzso 

The most important finding of this study was that, in addition to confirming that cigarette smoking could shorten life, extreme zzso or zzso zzso values and high alcohol consumption are each potentially harmful to health, but even more so if moderate or heavy drinking is zzso with low body mass, a possible indicator for low intake of zzso
