We have previously shown that zzso of zzso control of heart rate variations are found in more than half of non diabetic obese subjects zzso J zzso zzso and are associated with a more severe insulin resistance in zzso dependent diabetic patients zzso zzso The aim of this study was to examine whether zzso zzso are also associated with a more severe insulin resistance in non diabetic obese zzso 245 obese subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso aged zzso zzso zzso years, with a normal oral zzso tolerance test were zzso zzso activity was evaluated by heart rate variations during three zzso zzso zzso zzso and active zzso with age being taken into zzso The zzso maneuver was abnormal in zzso the zzso test in zzso and the zzso test in zzso of the zzso One hundred and thirty subjects zzso had at least one abnormal zzso Compared with those with three normal tests, the obese subjects with zzso zzso had very similar zzso and blood pressure, but significantly higher values of heart rate zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso blood zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and plasma insulin zzso zzso 6 vs 82 zzso 4 zzso p zzso zzso In the whole series of obese subjects, heart rate variations during the zzso and zzso tests correlated zzso with blood zzso zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso respectively), and during the zzso test they correlated zzso with the zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso This data suggests that cardiac zzso zzso should take part in the zzso syndrome and might account for the poor cardiovascular prognosis linked to this zzso
