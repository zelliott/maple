The goal of this study was to investigate the influence of body mass on fitness in a healthy cohort of urban children and adolescents and to evaluate the difference in the cardiovascular responses, as measured by heart rate and endurance time, zzso with exercise in each zzso 

This zzso study was conducted in an exercise zzso Participants were healthy boys and girls aged 4 to 18 zzso The study evaluated heart rate and endurance time during exercise testing on a zzso zzso measures were endurance time and heart zzso 

The study comprised zzso boys and 222 girls ranging in age from 4 to 18 years zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso children had a significantly lower endurance time than zzso children zzso P zzso girls, P zzso zzso The mean zzso decrease in endurance time for obese versus zzso children was zzso zzso minutes for boys and zzso zzso minutes for zzso A decrease in mean endurance time of zzso minute for each unit increase in zzso was zzso zzso boys and girls performed at a higher heart rate than their zzso counterparts, although there was no statistically significant difference in maximum heart rate achieved by obese and zzso children zzso P zzso zzso girls, P zzso zzso 

Endurance time was significantly decreased in these obese boys and girls, and they performed at a higher heart rate earlier in exercise than zzso zzso There was no significant difference in maximum heart rate between obese and zzso zzso
