zzso concentration closely zzso with individual nutritional status, and moderate weight loss results in a decrease in zzso with minimal changes in other zzso hormone zzso zzso The data suggest that a decrease in peripheral conversion of the zzso T4 into its zzso active zzso zzso is at least in part responsible for the observed changes in zzso hormone zzso
