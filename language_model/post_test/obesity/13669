The relationships of zzso protein 4 zzso with insulin sensitivity and body fat distribution have been investigated in a few recent studies with conflicting zzso This may have been due to differences in ages of the subjects in the different zzso The aim of this study was to investigate whether the association of zzso and insulin sensitivity and percent trunk fat are influenced by zzso 

zzso analyses of 48 young subjects and 55 elderly zzso zzso sensitivity was determined by a zzso zzso Body fat distribution was determined by a zzso X-ray zzso zzso 

In the young subjects, zzso levels were associated with insulin sensitivity zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso percent trunk fat zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In contrast, in the elderly subjects there was no correlation between zzso levels and insulin sensitivity zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso percent trunk fat zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

The associations of zzso with insulin sensitivity, percent trunk fat, and zzso levels are influenced by zzso
