zzso zzso metabolism zzso insulin clamp at plasma insulin concentration of 100 zzso and zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso were examined in 42 obese subjects zzso body weight zzso 158 zzso zzso with normal zzso tolerance and in 36 normal weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In 10 obese and eight control subjects, insulin was infused at six rates to increase plasma insulin concentration by approximately 10, 20, 40, 80, 2,000, and 20,000 zzso Throughout the zzso range of plasma insulin zzso both the increase in total body zzso zzso and the suppression of zzso zzso production zzso were significantly impaired in the obese group zzso less than zzso to zzso At the two highest plasma insulin zzso zzso of zzso and the stimulation of zzso disposal were similar in both the obese and control zzso zzso zzso during the zzso zzso 125 zzso clamp was twofold greater in obese subjects than in controls zzso less than zzso and was zzso related to the rate of zzso zzso during the insulin clamp zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso but was still unable to zzso zzso disposal zzso less than zzso In conclusion, our results indicate that insulin resistance is a common accompaniment of obesity and can be overcome at zzso insulin zzso Both in the zzso state and following a zzso stimulus obese people display zzso which zzso with the degree of insulin zzso However, zzso zzso fails to fully compensate for the insulin zzso
