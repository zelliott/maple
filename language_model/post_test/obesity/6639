zzso of visceral fat, more so than subcutaneous fat, is strongly associated with severe zzso zzso However, the factors regulating zzso zzso are poorly zzso In this study, we show differential expression of zzso plasma zzso zzso a zzso regulator of local zzso growth factor zzso action, in zzso tissue of zzso zzso zzso expression was fivefold higher in visceral zzso fat compared with subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso and brown fat of zzso To investigate the possible role of zzso zzso expression in fat zzso zzso zzso and zzso knockout zzso mice were fed a high-fat diet zzso for up to 20 zzso zzso size increased in subcutaneous and zzso zzso similarly in zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, fat cell size and in zzso zzso zzso were significantly reduced in zzso fat of zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso After 20 zzso on zzso zzso of zzso a downstream signaling intermediate of zzso and insulin zzso zzso was significantly decreased by 50% in zzso compared with subcutaneous fat in zzso mice, but was significantly increased zzso in zzso compared with subcutaneous fat in zzso zzso zzso This appeared to be because of enhanced zzso signaling in zzso fat of zzso zzso zzso These data establish fat zzso expression of zzso and indicate preferential impact of zzso zzso on visceral fat in the mouse that is associated with enhanced insulin zzso zzso Thus, zzso may be a potential target for treatment and/or prevention strategies for visceral obesity and related zzso
