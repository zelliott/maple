Globally, about zzso women die every year from pregnancy related causes and more than half of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa zzso zzso zzso of the maternal deaths are associated with zzso disorders in pregnancy such as pregnancy induced hypertension zzso However, very little is known about zzso and associated zzso in many zzso countries such as zzso We therefore sought to assess rural and urban differences in blood pressure zzso and zzso among pregnant women in zzso 

We conducted a zzso study among 967 rural zzso and urban zzso pregnant women with a zzso age of more than 20 zzso zzso was defined as a zzso blood pressure of zzso zzso and/or zzso blood pressure of zzso zzso 

Women in urban Ghana had a higher mean zzso and zzso zzso than women in rural Ghana zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso The prevalence of zzso was also higher in urban Ghana zzso than in rural Ghana zzso zzso The urban and rural difference in mean zzso blood pressure persisted even after adjustments for the study characteristics in a linear zzso zzso In both rural and urban Ghana, zzso heart rate and a family history of hypertension were independently associated with zzso 

Our findings suggest higher mean zzso levels and zzso in urban Ghana than in rural zzso zzso was independently related to high zzso Left zzso the increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity in Ghana will exacerbate zzso levels in zzso
