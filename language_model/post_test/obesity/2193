Breast and colon cancer are zzso well known to be related to zzso zzso a protein that increases in zzso seems to be involved in the relationship but clinical data are zzso 

In this study, we therefore evaluated the serum zzso levels in 87 breast and 27 colon cancer patients and assessed the relation with zzso zzso status, zzso status and stage of zzso 

zzso zzso levels were lower in cancer cases zzso zzso zzso zzso for breast cancer, zzso zzso zzso for colon zzso than in controls zzso zzso zzso 

A low serum zzso level may be associated with both breast and colon cancer, and that this association is not statistically significant for either zzso or zzso status in breast cancer zzso
