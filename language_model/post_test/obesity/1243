We investigated the possible relationship between zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso and/or zzso that is seen in the zzso zzso zzso zzso when the animal is transferred from a low-energy zzso diet to a zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso zzso and transition from a HE to a zzso diet on the diabetic state of the zzso were also zzso zzso maintained on a zzso diet, showing zzso and zzso zzso zzso were used as zzso zzso and insulin zzso in the zzso of zzso was studied using the zzso technique and plasma levels of the two hormones were determined by zzso The zzso zzso of both zzso and insulin was significantly weaker in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to group zzso Transfer to a zzso diet resulted in complete recovery of the zzso and zzso pattern to that seen in group A zzso zzso zzso The plasma zzso levels of the group C animals were not significantly higher than in group A, while after zzso zzso treatment the zzso levels and zzso ratios remained significantly higher zzso zzso zzso At the same time the circulating levels of zzso and insulin were restored to zzso zzso zzso zzso and insulin zzso disappeared and zzso in parallel in zzso transferred to a HE diet and back to a zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso treatment of the zzso and zzso animals zzso circulating zzso and insulin levels, but not zzso levels, possibly due to a negative feedback effect of zzso on insulin zzso
