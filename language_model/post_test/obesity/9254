zzso comparative zzso was performed on a total of zzso patients in a clinical setting for a variety of zzso most commonly zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso region were identified in 31 zzso The deletion is enriched in the patient population when compared with controls zzso zzso zzso with both inherited and de zzso zzso zzso clinical information was available for six patients, who all had zzso delays of varying zzso Body mass index was zzso zzso in four of six patients, supporting the previously described association with zzso The zzso duplication, found in 17 patients, does not seem to be significantly enriched in our patient population compared with zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso region are zzso and are associated with zzso delay in addition to zzso
