zzso fatty acid profile, independent of caloric percent of fat, is a major regulator of body zzso This study examined the effects of dietary fat amount and types on fat storage and zzso gene expression in the mouse model of chronic zzso zzso 

The dietary interventions were in twofold: zzso the obesity was induced by a zzso zzso fat diet compared with a low-fat zzso diet, and zzso the zzso was tested by using high zzso zzso fat zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso mice were fed a high-fat zzso in zzso diet for 13 weeks and then classified as zzso obese zzso or zzso zzso mice according to upper and lower zzso of body weight zzso The zzso mice were then subdivided into three groups for a zzso secondary dietary zzso Two of the groups were switched to either a high zzso zzso zzso or a low-fat zzso in zzso zzso diet, whereas the third zzso and DR mice continued on the initial high-fat zzso Food efficiency was calculated as weekly body weight gain per gram of food zzso 

After switching the zzso mice to the zzso zzso or zzso diet, their body weights were reduced to the level of the DR and zzso zzso The food efficiencies were, from the highest to zzso in the order: zzso Using quantitative in zzso zzso we found that the zzso mice had higher levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Y zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso nucleus zzso than the DR mice, whereas the level of zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly reduced zzso zzso All effects that were essentially returned to DR levels by the change to the zzso zzso diet and, with the exception of a failure to zzso Arc zzso zzso levels, by the change to zzso zzso 

Taken together, the present results show that both change in level and quality of dietary fat can zzso alter zzso zzso expression and result in effective zzso of zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso diet when fed to already obese mice produced a pattern of zzso gene expression similar to that in obesity resistant zzso zzso It remains to be determined if the effects of zzso fatty acids on brain zzso gene expression are direct or zzso
