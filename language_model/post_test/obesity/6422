We respectively compared the nutritional and clinical zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in 40 critically ill, obese patients admitted to the trauma or surgical intensive care zzso 

Adult patients, 18 to 69 years old, with weights greater than zzso of ideal body weight, normal zzso and zzso functions, and who received at least 7 d of zzso tube feeding were zzso Patients were zzso according to feeding group: zzso feeding zzso zzso of adjusted weight per day; zzso zzso zzso or zzso feeding zzso zzso of adjusted weight per day; zzso zzso zzso The goal protein intake for both groups was approximately 2 zzso of ideal body weight per zzso Clinical events and nutrition data were recorded for 4 zzso 

Patients were similar according to sex, age, weight, body mass index, Second Acute zzso and zzso Health zzso score, zzso score, and zzso zzso zzso The zzso feeding group received significantly fewer calories than the zzso group zzso zzso The zzso group had a shorter stay in the intensive care unit zzso zzso zzso d versus zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso decreased duration of zzso therapy days zzso zzso zzso d versus zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and a trend toward a decrease in days of mechanical ventilation zzso zzso zzso d versus zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was no statistically significant difference in nitrogen balance or serum zzso response between zzso 

These data suggest that zzso zzso nutrition support is as least as effective as zzso feeding in critically ill, obese zzso
