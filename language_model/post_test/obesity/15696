zzso zzso mainly produced by zzso are active participants in the regulation of zzso Administration of zzso zzso was used to investigate the regulation and role of zzso during zzso in zzso zzso of zzso led to a significant increase in zzso levels in both serum and zzso zzso fluid, whereas a differential trend in local zzso systemic levels was observed for both zzso and zzso The role of zzso in zzso zzso was investigated using zzso zzso mice, with and without zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with delayed resolution of zzso inflammation induced by zzso because zzso mice had a more pronounced cellular zzso in the zzso as well as higher and prolonged local and systemic levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 compared with zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso exacerbated the inflammatory zzso and systemic zzso levels in zzso mice while zzso production of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast with the important role of zzso in regulating each aspect of zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated only with a decreased inflammatory zzso without affecting zzso zzso These findings point to a complex role for zzso in zzso zzso and further emphasize the interplay between obesity and zzso
