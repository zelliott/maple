What is the relationship between body size, physical activity and zzso parameters among male partners of couples attempting to become zzso 

zzso and obesity are associated with a higher prevalence of low zzso volume, zzso concentration and total zzso zzso 

Higher zzso is associated with impaired zzso zzso while increasing waist circumference zzso is also associated with impaired zzso parameters in zzso zzso 

Data from the zzso Investigation of zzso and the Environment zzso Study were zzso The LIFE study is a zzso prospective cohort of zzso couples attempting to conceive in two geographic areas zzso and Michigan, zzso recruited in zzso zzso were recruited from four counties in Michigan and 12 counties in Texas to ensure a range of environmental zzso and lifestyle zzso In person interviews were conducted to ascertain zzso health and zzso histories followed by zzso zzso 

We zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso class I) and zzso zzso class zzso for zzso Data were available for analysis in zzso men zzso zzso with a mean zzso zzso age of zzso zzso zzso years, zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The majority of the cohort zzso was overweight or obese with zzso reporting physical activity zzso zzso The median zzso concentration for the men in the cohort was zzso zzso with zzso having zzso zzso zzso 

When examining zzso zzso zzso volume showed a linear decline with increasing zzso and zzso zzso zzso Similarly, the total zzso count showed a negative linear association with zzso zzso zzso No significant relationship was seen between body size zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or DNA fragmentation zzso The percentage of men with abnormal volume, concentration and total zzso increased with increasing body size zzso zzso No relationship between physical activity and zzso parameters was zzso 

Our cohort was largely overweight and zzso which may result in limited external zzso zzso zzso The lack of physical activity did zzso examination of exercise more frequently than once per week, thus our ability to examine more active individuals is zzso 

Body size (as measured by zzso or zzso is zzso associated with zzso parameters with little influence of physical zzso Our findings are the first showing a relationship between zzso and zzso parameters in a sample of men without known zzso Given the worldwide obesity epidemic, further study of the role of weight loss to improve zzso parameters is zzso 

zzso by the zzso Research Program of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development zzso zzso zzso and zzso There are no competing zzso
