Both levels of total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio and zzso potential of cell and zzso and the intensity of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso and zzso are elevated in the liver of zzso mice as compared with zzso Presumably these zzso corresponding to the total zzso of zzso processes in zzso mice are zzso by zzso zzso treatment zzso zzso g body weight, 14 days, zzso elicits further increase of zzso and total zzso zzso levels, zzso zzso potential and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso The findings obtained can be used for explanation of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the liver of zzso zzso
