We have used zzso zzso ultrasound to investigate the zzso planes within subcutaneous fat at the zzso and abdominal sites in a group of 17 women attending a weight control group over a 12 month zzso In most subjects there was a single zzso zzso plane at each zzso As the thickness of zzso tissue increased, most of the change at the abdominal site was in the deep rather than the superficial layer of zzso At the zzso site both deep and superficial layers zzso Our findings confirm the presence of two different layers in human subcutaneous fat at the zzso and abdominal zzso These layers have been shown to be functionally different in animals and our study supports this in humans at the abdominal zzso
