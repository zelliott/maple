The Roma zzso are a zzso minority, founder population characterized by unique genetic background modeled by culturally determined zzso The present study explores whether the widely found cardiovascular diseases zzso risk effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso can be zzso in this specific zzso 

The community-based study was carried on 208 adult zzso Roma living in rural settlements of eastern and northern zzso zzso effect of four zzso candidate zzso are related to the most prominent classical zzso risk zzso obesity indicators zzso mass index and waist zzso hypertension and zzso zzso HDL and LDL zzso For all of them the standard risk zzso were zzso The extent to which the zzso status is related to zzso was assessed by zzso zzso zzso The strongest associations were found for zzso zzso of the zzso as a predictor of waist circumference zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso as well as for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso It is notable that zzso zzso of zzso gene turned out to be a protective genetic factor determining low zzso zzso 

The strength of the relation and the similarity of the results obtained for both tested indicators of obesity provide firm evidence that zzso plays an important role in obesity development in the Roma zzso
