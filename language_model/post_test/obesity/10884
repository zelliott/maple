zzso serum zzso zzso are decreased in zzso In zzso zzso individuals, acute exercise of sufficient intensity increases zzso zzso however, conflicting data exist concerning the zzso response to exercise in obese zzso To examine the zzso zzso response in obese individuals, we studied 8 zzso 11 lower body obese zzso and 12 upper body obese zzso women before, zzso and after 30 zzso zzso zzso of treadmill exercise at zzso oxygen consumption zzso Blood samples were taken every 5 zzso zzso zzso and were analyzed for zzso zzso with a sensitive zzso zzso zzso zzso The impact of 16 weeks of zzso exercise training on the zzso response to exercise was also examined in the obese zzso In response to exercise, the zzso integrated zzso concentration was significantly greater zzso zzso in the zzso women zzso zzso 220 zzso zzso zzso than in either of the obese groups zzso 435 zzso zzso zzso 189 zzso 26 zzso zzso zzso No differences were found between the zzso and zzso zzso The increased integrated zzso zzso could be accounted for by a greater zzso zzso production rate zzso per L distribution volume zzso in the zzso women than in either of the obese groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso This increase was attributed to a greater mass of zzso zzso per pulse in the zzso women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso both obese zzso After 16 weeks of zzso training, zzso oxygen consumption increased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso P zzso but no significant change in body composition occurred in the 10 obese women who completed the zzso No change was observed in the zzso response to exercise after training zzso zzso 10; zzso zzso zzso zzso post, 350 zzso 55 zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso response to exercise was attenuated in the obese women compared to zzso zzso Short term zzso training improved zzso but did not increase the zzso response to zzso
