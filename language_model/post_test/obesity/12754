The effects of short-term zzso on the production of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined zzso before and during a zzso zzso zzso clamp (40 zzso zzso zzso in 17 women (8 chronically zzso obese, zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 normal weight, zzso zzso zzso zzso During acute zzso plasma zzso decreased by approximately zzso within 1 h in both zzso zzso zzso production decreased zzso in the control subjects zzso zzso zzso and zzso in obese subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso production decreased zzso in control subjects zzso zzso zzso but only zzso in obese zzso Plasma zzso decreased by zzso from baseline in control subjects zzso zzso but only by zzso in obese subjects zzso zzso zzso Despite the similar decrease in zzso and zzso production in control subjects, zzso particle size zzso zzso decreased with zzso zzso zzso zzso In obese subjects, despite a decrease in zzso production similar to that in control subjects but no change in zzso production, zzso size did not change zzso Acute zzso in zzso 1) suppresses plasma zzso equally in control and obese subjects at this high dose of zzso 2) zzso zzso zzso production equally in control and obese subjects, perhaps secondary to the decrease in zzso 3) zzso zzso zzso production in control but less so in obese subjects, suggesting that obese subjects may be resistant to this effect of zzso 4) decreases plasma zzso and zzso particle size in control subjects, reflecting either stimulation of zzso activity or a greater relative decrease in zzso to zzso zzso and 5) does not decrease plasma zzso or zzso size in obese subjects to the same extent as it does in control zzso Thus, the insulin resistance of obesity affects some but not all aspects of zzso zzso
