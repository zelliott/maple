zzso obese zzso mice have been commonly used as an animal model in the efficacy assessment for new drug zzso Although high-fat feeding has been reported to cause profound zzso changes, including the expression of zzso zzso limited studies have been reported regarding the effect of zzso on zzso zzso in zzso In this study, we investigated zzso profiles of three 11 zzso zzso in the zzso mice and compared them to the normal lean zzso After oral administration, the in zzso exposure zzso of all three compounds was higher in zzso mice, which was consistent with the observed lower systemic clearance zzso in zzso mice compared to lean zzso As illustrated by zzso zzso a compound zzso predominantly by zzso and zzso the zzso profiles for zzso E were zzso similar between zzso and lean mice, but zzso lower in the zzso zzso Indeed, zzso activities for zzso and zzso as well as zzso were found to be lower in liver zzso prepared from zzso zzso The calculated zzso clearance zzso from in zzso studies with liver zzso correlated well with the observed in zzso clearance for both zzso and lean zzso The calculated oral zzso zzso based on intrinsic zzso clearance zzso zzso predicted zzso fold increase in zzso for the zzso mice, which was comparable to the observed zzso zzso these data suggest that the higher zzso is most likely due to the lower zzso effect in zzso zzso This study highlights the needs to take caution when zzso zzso and exposure data from healthy animals to diseased animals in designing pharmacological zzso
