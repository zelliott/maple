To evaluate a zzso evidence-based hypothesis that specific modifiable lifestyle factors implicated in the development of diabetes and associated obesity are related to the onset of zzso 

A hypothetical zzso model for zzso involving modifiable lifestyle factors implicated in the development of diabetes and obesity was constructed, based on a systematic literature zzso Secondary analysis of data was undertaken in a prospective cohort of women aged 40 and over, living in zzso zzso zzso included zzso women free from zzso at baseline and 277 incident cases of zzso zzso diet, lifestyle, zzso and social factors were measured at baseline and incident cases at zzso zzso zzso chain modeling was used to estimate the associations between variables and identify likely pathways zzso 

All hypothesized lifestyle factors (physical activity, high zzso index, and high energy zzso plus diabetes and obesity were retained within the graph as potential zzso However, low physical activity was the only direct risk factor linked zzso to the onset of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in addition to older zzso 

Poor lifestyle factors zzso linked to diabetes and obesity may contribute to the onset of zzso low physical activity appears to be an important modifiable zzso factor for zzso operating directly as well as indirectly via pathways involving obesity or zzso Further research is needed to demonstrate a zzso link between lifestyle and zzso
