This study examines the zzso of using three standard criteria zzso zzso heart rate zzso respiratory exchange ratio zzso and plateau in oxygen zzso zzso for the measurement of zzso oxygen consumption zzso in zzso zzso One hundred eight zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso overweight and obese zzso mass index zzso zzso 33 zzso 4 zzso sedentary zzso zzso 19 zzso 3 zzso women underwent one exercise test zzso zzso and 71 of these women underwent a second test zzso zzso zzso On test 1, 69 zzso women achieved zzso zzso 61 zzso reached an zzso and 16 zzso achieved a plateau in zzso zzso zzso zzso Women who reached zzso zzso and reached an zzso of at least zzso had a higher peak zzso zzso zzso than women who did not meet these zzso There was no difference in the highest zzso obtained between women who did and did not achieve a plateau in zzso during test 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso HR, zzso and zzso were similar between the two zzso On average, peak zzso was higher on the second test zzso zzso However, zzso was not different between exercise tests in women who achieved at least two of the three criteria on both tests zzso zzso 24; test 1, zzso zzso zzso test zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In addition, zzso was similar between the two exercise tests in 14 women who reached a plateau on the second test but did not reach a plateau on the first test zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso We conclude that achievement of a plateau in zzso is not a necessary criterion for a valid measurement of zzso in overweight and obese, zzso zzso zzso
