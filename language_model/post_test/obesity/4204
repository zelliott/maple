The present study was designed to determine whether and to what extent the zzso of the sympathetic nervous system reported in the zzso syndrome is generalized to the whole cardiovascular system or if it is rather confined to selected vascular zzso In 16 zzso patients with zzso syndrome, 12 essential zzso subjects, 12 obese subjects, and 14 lean healthy zzso controls, we measured blood pressure zzso Englewood, zzso heart rate zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso liquid zzso and zzso sympathetic nerve traffic in the skeletal muscle and in the skin districts zzso The muscle and skin nerve traffic zzso were obtained in a zzso zzso zzso also included skin sympathetic nerve responses to an zzso zzso zzso The 4 groups of subjects had zzso zzso Muscle sympathetic nerve traffic values were significantly higher in subjects with hypertension and in those with obesity than in controls zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso bursts per 100 heart beats, zzso P zzso for zzso A further significant increase in muscle sympathetic nerve traffic was detected in subjects with the zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso bursts per 100 heart beats, P zzso In contrast, skin sympathetic nerve traffic was not significantly different in the 4 groups of individuals zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso bursts per minute, zzso P zzso not zzso The skin sympathetic responses to an acoustic stimulus were also similar in the different zzso The present data provide the first direct evidence that in the zzso syndrome the sympathetic zzso is not zzso distributed over the cardiovascular zzso This may depend on the fact that muscle and skin sympathetic nerve activities are regulated by mechanisms that are affected in a different fashion by the various components of the zzso
