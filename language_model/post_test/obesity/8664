Recently, two zzso zzso at positions zzso and zzso in the promoter of the tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso have been zzso These zzso have, in different ethnic groups, been linked to estimates of insulin resistance and zzso The objective of the present study was to investigate whether these genetic zzso of zzso were associated with features of the insulin resistance syndrome or zzso in birth weight in two Danish study populations zzso 380 unrelated young healthy subjects and zzso zzso relatives of type 2 diabetic patients, zzso All study participants underwent an zzso zzso tolerance test with the addition of zzso after 20 zzso In addition, a number of zzso and zzso measures were performed on each zzso The subjects were zzso for the zzso by applying zzso restriction zzso length zzso Neither of the zzso was related to altered insulin sensitivity index or other features of the insulin resistance syndrome zzso mass index, waist to hip ratio, fat mass, zzso serum lipids or zzso serum insulin or zzso Birth weight and the zzso index were also not associated with the zzso In conclusion, although the study was carried out on sufficiently large study samples, the study does not support a major role of the zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso gene in the zzso of insulin resistance or altered birth weight among Danish Caucasian zzso
