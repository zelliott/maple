zzso assessment of disease activity and definition of cure of zzso using measurement of zzso zzso remains zzso Furthermore, with our efforts to achieve tight zzso control of the disease it is foreseeable that a proportion of patients may be rendered zzso zzso thus requiring testing for zzso zzso The aim of our study was to evaluate residual zzso zzso in cured patients with zzso 

At zzso circulating zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso levels were measured in 33 zzso patients nine years after treatment with surgery of whom 6 were additionally zzso Two tests were zzso the zzso suppression zzso zzso tolerance test zzso and the zzso provocation zzso test (1 zzso zzso zzso and the results were compared with 11 zzso and zzso control zzso 

According to the consensus criteria zzso zzso levels and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 21 treated zzso patients were zzso 6 had zzso zzso and zzso zzso values during zzso while 6 had persistent zzso After the zzso provocative test with zzso zzso for severe zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso we detected 9 severely zzso deficient patients zzso among 21 cured zzso zzso Mean zzso peak zzso response to the zzso test in zzso zzso was significantly lower compared with zzso with sufficient zzso zzso capacity and control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, zzso Mean zzso and zzso levels were not different between zzso and zzso cured zzso zzso levels and body mass index zzso were significantly higher in zzso male zzso compared with zzso male zzso zzso female zzso tended to have higher zzso while zzso levels were not zzso 

The assessment of residual zzso zzso capacity by the zzso provocation test is necessary in the long-term follow-up of successfully treated zzso since a large proportion of these patients are rendered zzso zzso
