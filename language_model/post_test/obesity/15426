Weight loss zzso decreases regional zzso of zzso tissue and improves insulin sensitivity, two parameters that correlate before zzso To examine the potential relation of zzso change in regional zzso to improvement in insulin sensitivity, 32 obese sedentary women and men completed a zzso zzso program and had repeat zzso of body composition zzso X-ray zzso and zzso zzso and insulin sensitivity zzso insulin zzso There were 15 lean men and women who served as control zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso The zzso intervention achieved significant decreases in weight zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso total fat mass zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso percent body fat zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso subcutaneous and visceral zzso tissue zzso and zzso were reduced zzso zzso 19 to zzso zzso 18 zzso and 157 zzso 12 to 96 zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso area of zzso muscle zzso at the zzso decreased from 67 zzso 5 to 55 zzso 4 zzso after zzso zzso sensitivity improved from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso Rates of zzso zzso zzso disposal accounted for the majority of this improvement zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cholesterol, and insulin all decreased after zzso zzso zzso After zzso insulin sensitivity continued to correlate with generalized and regional zzso but, with the exception of the percent decrease in zzso the magnitude of improvement in insulin sensitivity was not predicted by the various changes in body zzso These zzso weight loss data underscore the potential importance of visceral zzso in relation to insulin resistance and otherwise suggest that above a certain threshold of weight loss, improvement in insulin sensitivity does not bear a linear relationship to the magnitude of weight zzso
