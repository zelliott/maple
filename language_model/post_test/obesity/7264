The association between zzso zzso alcohol consumption and their joint effect in increasing the risk of elevated serum zzso zzso and zzso zzso is unclear in older zzso zzso 

To determine the association between alcohol, zzso and their combined effect with serum zzso and zzso in older zzso adults in the United zzso 

A zzso zzso study in participants zzso zzso zzso from the Rancho zzso Study zzso zzso mean age: 70 years, zzso 25 zzso alcohol zzso zzso who attended a research visit in zzso zzso was recorded by a trained nurse and alcohol use zzso by a validated zzso zzso zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso of elevated serum zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso in men zzso or zzso zzso in zzso were calculated for alcohol and zzso separately and their joint exposure using zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso zzso models adjusted for age, alcohol use, total cholesterol, serum zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso blood pressure, and diabetes zzso obesity independently increased the odds of elevated zzso in this cohort of older men and women by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Joint effects of zzso alcoholic zzso and obesity raised the odds of elevated zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrating zzso zzso participants had higher odds of elevated zzso even at 0 zzso zzso 1 zzso 

In older men and women, the combination of obesity with alcohol is synergistic in increasing the risk of liver zzso
