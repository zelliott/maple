This study aimed to investigate the association between different zzso measures of obesity and zzso characteristics in Chinese patients with clinically localized prostate cancer zzso A total of zzso patients with clinically localized zzso who underwent radical zzso zzso were included in this zzso Clinical and pathological data from each patient were zzso zzso measures of abdominal zzso were measured from zzso zzso zzso images from magnetic resonance imaging zzso for 413 zzso zzso Patient clinical and pathological characteristics were compared across body mass index zzso zzso zzso and multivariable zzso zzso models were used to address the influence of the zzso total testosterone level and zzso measures of obesity on pathological zzso In the zzso analysis, zzso was not significantly associated with any pathological zzso However, the percentage of visceral zzso tissue zzso was an independent predictor of a pathological zzso score zzso zzso zzso extension zzso zzso and seminal zzso invasion zzso zzso More importantly, we found that the zzso total testosterone level was significantly correlated with the zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso and subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that abdominal fat distribution, and particularly zzso is associated with a risk of advanced zzso Moreover, our present study confirms a significant inverse correlation between visceral zzso and zzso Further studies are warranted to zzso the biological mechanisms underlying the relationship between abdominal zzso and the aggressiveness of zzso
