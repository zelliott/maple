Strong evidence exists for a link between chronic low level inflammation and zzso insulin zzso however, little is known about the zzso networks zzso Here we show that high fat diet zzso or saturated fatty acid exposure directly activates zzso protein zzso zzso protein expression in liver, zzso and zzso Global zzso deletion prevented zzso inflammation and surprisingly increased zzso gene expression in white zzso tissue along with brown zzso tissue markers zzso zzso and zzso consistent with a resistance to zzso zzso In isolated zzso zzso from zzso mice, the zzso gene zzso and its targets zzso and zzso were zzso zzso along with zzso while zzso a gene important for zzso the zzso was suppressed in response to zzso Using zzso zzso zzso cells or zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso inflammation and zzso DNA binding activity, while zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene expression zzso Finally, zzso bone zzso mice transplanted with bone zzso lacking zzso demonstrated reduced systemic and zzso tissue inflammatory zzso zzso content, and maintained insulin sensitivity on zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that zzso or zzso exposure triggers zzso expression that controls expression of distinct aspects of alternative zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso protection from zzso systemic inflammation and insulin resistance, suggesting it may be an attractive therapeutic target for zzso zzso inflammatory zzso
