The aim of this study was to compare the effects of zzso and zzso on zzso necrosis factor zzso expression and zzso zzso in spontaneously zzso obese zzso 

zzso male zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rats were zzso to receive zzso zzso or control treatment for 12 weeks, after which zzso zzso levels, zzso tissue zzso and zzso parameters were zzso 

zzso zzso expression in zzso fat tissue was significantly greater in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso compared with the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso area in zzso fat tissue was increased at study zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with both the control and zzso groups zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Investigation of zzso revealed a decrease in the frequency of small fat cells and an increase in the frequency of large fat cells in both the zzso and zzso groups compared with the control group, with a greater increase in large fat cells in the zzso zzso At study zzso insulin and zzso values were significantly higher in the active treatment groups compared with the control zzso however, insulin levels were significantly greater in zzso animals compared with zzso zzso An oral zzso tolerance test performed at the end of the study showed that there were no significant differences among the three groups in terms of plasma zzso and insulin zzso 

This study suggests that although both zzso and zzso may have a zzso effect on fat cells in zzso zzso this effect is greater with zzso leading to zzso of zzso zzso expression and possible zzso of insulin zzso
