zzso zzso syndrome zzso is associated with insulin resistance zzso zzso and cardiovascular zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso highly expressed in obese zzso zzso We sought to assess zzso levels in zzso tissue zzso from zzso women and matched zzso The effects of zzso treatment on circulating zzso levels in zzso subjects, the effects of serum from normal and zzso women on in zzso migration and zzso before and after zzso treatment, and ex zzso regulation of AT zzso by zzso were also zzso 

zzso zzso zzso subcutaneous and zzso AT zzso zzso zzso zzso chain zzso and protein zzso zzso were significantly lower in zzso women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity were significantly higher zzso zzso After 6 months of zzso treatment, there was a significant increase in serum zzso zzso zzso and a corresponding decrease in zzso and zzso activity zzso zzso In zzso migration and zzso were significantly increased in serum from zzso women zzso zzso these effects were significantly attenuated by zzso treatment zzso zzso through the regulation of zzso levels via nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso changes in the zzso media thickness were zzso of changes in serum zzso zzso zzso zzso In AT zzso zzso significantly decreased zzso protein production and zzso into zzso media zzso zzso zzso P zzso 

zzso levels are lower in zzso zzso zzso treatment increases serum zzso in these zzso Our findings provide novel insights into the relationship between zzso zzso and zzso
