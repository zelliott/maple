The optimal zzso measure of obesity or body fat distribution that best predicts the risk of Type 2 diabetes in Asians is zzso Moreover, it has not been determined whether zzso zzso the effect of body fat distribution on diabetes risk in zzso 

We zzso the zzso and laboratory data of zzso zzso Korean adults zzso men and zzso women, aged zzso zzso who underwent routine medical zzso at zzso zzso zzso waist zzso zzso ratio, and zzso zzso (to calculate fat mass and per cent body zzso were measured at zzso 

Of the zzso participants, zzso subjects zzso developed diabetes over 5 zzso Each of the zzso measures of general obesity zzso fat mass, per cent body zzso and central body fat distribution zzso circumference and zzso zzso was a good predictor of Type 2 zzso However, when the areas under the zzso characteristic zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso waist circumference zzso zzso and zzso ratio zzso zzso were better zzso of diabetes risk than fat mass zzso zzso or per cent body fat zzso zzso In the low- zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso groups, the addition of zzso ratio or waist circumference to zzso could improve the prediction of diabetes zzso 

zzso waist circumference and zzso ratio were good zzso of Type 2 diabetes risk in zzso In non-obese or less obese subjects, measures of central body fat distribution can help improve the prediction of Type 2 diabetes risk when added to measures of general zzso
