zzso results from an imbalance between caloric intake and energy zzso zzso zzso and family studies have not only shown that genetic factors play an important role in the zzso of zzso but also contribute to several zzso including hypertension and type 2 zzso In recent years, several zzso defects responsible for obesity in zzso and, in rare cases, of human obesity have been zzso Besides zzso as the most notable example, numerous other proteins and zzso have recently been found that participate in a complex network to regulate food intake and energy zzso Interestingly, some of these molecules may also play a role in the development of zzso zzso The ongoing search for relevant genetic zzso should result in a better understanding of energy metabolism and hopefully clarify molecular mechanisms underlying the association between obesity and related zzso This knowledge should help develop new strategies for the treatment of obesity and associated risk factors for hypertension and related cardiovascular zzso
