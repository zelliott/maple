In zzso zzso synthesis is coupled to oxygen consumption by the zzso zzso zzso established across the zzso inner membrane in a process termed zzso zzso It has long been known from zzso studies that zzso synthesis is not perfectly coupled to oxygen zzso The major inefficiency in the system is leakage of zzso across the zzso inner membrane driven by the zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso leak can be determined zzso by measuring the oxygen consumption of zzso under zzso conditions (plus zzso as a function of the zzso zzso zzso This experimental system provides a convenient means to investigate inner membrane zzso to zzso and the effect of factors that may effect that zzso In this paper we review some results from our laboratory of indirect measurement of zzso zzso leak and how it has been applied to investigate the effect of aging, obesity and zzso status on zzso zzso The results show that zzso zzso leak in isolated liver zzso is not significantly different in a comparison of young and old rats, in contrast zzso there is an apparent increase in zzso leak in in zzso zzso in zzso from old rats when compared to those from young rats, zzso zzso leak in zzso zzso in zzso in zzso is not significantly different in young and old rats, zzso zzso leak is greater in isolated liver zzso from zzso mice compared to lean controls, zzso acute zzso zzso zzso administration restores the increased leak rate in isolated liver zzso from zzso mice to that of lean controls, zzso administration of zzso hormone zzso increases zzso leak in rat muscle zzso and zzso zzso leak in muscle zzso is insensitive to the presence of zzso It is proposed that the experimental system described here for measuring zzso zzso is an ideal functional zzso for determining whether the novel zzso proteins increase inner membrane zzso to zzso
