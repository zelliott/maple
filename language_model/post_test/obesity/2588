zzso is associated with zzso dysfunction and increased zzso The expression of zzso molecules may be influenced by a high zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to evaluate serum zzso zzso and zzso zzso in obese women, and to evaluate the role of zzso load on zzso circulating levels of zzso zzso and zzso in obese women with normal zzso zzso 

A total of 21 obese women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 19 lean controls women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were recruited and serum zzso zzso and zzso levels were measured in zzso zzso After an overnight fast, obese zzso zzso 6) and lean women zzso zzso 6) underwent a 2 h - 75 g oral zzso tolerance zzso Pre and zzso load zzso 60, 120 zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso 

zzso women had zzso serum levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso higher than those of control zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels were positively related to body mass index in the obese zzso zzso zzso molecules levels were no affected by a high zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels are increased in obese zzso A high zzso load is not associated with an increase in serum zzso molecules zzso
