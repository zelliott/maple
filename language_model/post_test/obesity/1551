To investigate the correlation between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the obesity of zzso zzso syndrome zzso 

zzso From zzso 2006 to zzso 2007, 118 zzso patients were enrolled in this study in zzso University Third Hospital, which were divided into 56 patients in obese zzso group and 62 patients in non-obese zzso group according to the WHO International zzso Task Force zzso criteria zzso mass index zzso 25 zzso The zzso of zzso gene promoter region, zzso and zzso 2 of zzso gene were detected by zzso zzso zzso obese zzso patients and 31 non-obese zzso patients were selected zzso serum levels of zzso zzso were measured by zzso in the mean time, serum levels of zzso zzso zzso insulin and the total white blood cell, hypersensitive zzso protein levels were zzso 

zzso zzso zzso frequency of zzso zzso and T zzso of zzso promoter region zzso in obese zzso patients were significantly higher than those in non-obese patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso all P zzso The frequency of zzso zzso and V zzso of zzso gene were zzso and zzso in obese zzso patients, which were significantly higher than those in non-obese group zzso and zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso level of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in obese zzso group which were significantly higher than those in non-obese zzso group zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 84) zzso P zzso zzso blood zzso zzso insulin and hypersensitive zzso protein and white blood cell count were zzso zzso zzso zzso (17 zzso 9) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in obese zzso group, which were significantly higher than in non-obese zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso (11 zzso 8) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso correlation between zzso and zzso serum levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were positively correlated with zzso in zzso patients zzso zzso 

zzso factors zzso and zzso had correlation with obesity of zzso patients, zzso patients who carried T zzso of zzso gene promoter region zzso and V zzso of zzso gene were high risk of zzso
