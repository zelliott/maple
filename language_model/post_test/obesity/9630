Adult neural stem cells zzso are known to exist in a few regions of the zzso however, the entity and zzso relevance of adult zzso zzso zzso remain zzso This work shows that adult zzso are zzso and predominantly present in the zzso zzso of adult zzso zzso zzso feeding led to not only depletion but also zzso impairment of zzso associated with zzso zzso In zzso zzso models demonstrated that their survival and zzso markedly decreased on zzso zzso but increased on zzso zzso mechanistically zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Mouse studies revealed that zzso zzso zzso led to depletion and impaired zzso differentiation of zzso and ultimately the development of obesity and zzso In conclusion, adult zzso are important for the central regulation of zzso zzso and zzso impairment of adult zzso is a critical neurodegenerative mechanism for obesity and related zzso
