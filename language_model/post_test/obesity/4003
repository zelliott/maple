To evaluate zzso in the zzso genetically obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fatty and lean zzso control rats were given zzso zzso infusions consisting largely of fat, zzso or zzso Relative to distilled water infusion, these infusions resulted in immediate reductions of food intake in both fatty and lean rats allowed to feed 20 zzso zzso zzso food zzso remained reduced throughout the 2 zzso period of zzso Thus, despite its zzso the fatty rat is responsive to the zzso effect of infused zzso However, the relative zzso effectiveness of the zzso infusions differed for the two zzso In lean rats, the different zzso infusions resulted in equivalent reductions of zzso In contrast, in fatty rats, fat was the least zzso and protein was the most zzso zzso Moreover, compared to lean rats, fatty rats displayed less initial suppression of feeding after fat infusion and greater overall suppression after protein zzso These effects are consistent with the long-term feeding behavior of the fatty rat for the different zzso and may be related to zzso and zzso zzso zzso that have been documented in this zzso
