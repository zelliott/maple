The aim of this study was to examine the relation between the zzso zzso and reduced plasma zzso levels commonly observed among men characterized by abdominal obesity and features of the insulin resistance zzso 

A total of zzso sedentary men, zzso and free from zzso disorders were classified on the basis of their zzso zzso 

Plasma HDL and zzso zzso as well as the zzso activity were significantly different between the three zzso zzso men having significantly lower HDL and zzso levels and higher zzso activity than zzso zzso A zzso zzso was used to determine the source of variation of plasma HDL and zzso levels among the three zzso groups of men divided on the basis of either a high zzso zzso or a low zzso zzso zzso a high zzso zzso or a low zzso zzso zzso of visceral zzso tissue assessed by zzso zzso or a low versus a high zzso plasma insulin concentration zzso the median value as a zzso zzso The effect of the zzso zzso observed on plasma zzso zzso was attenuated among men with features of the insulin resistance zzso It seems that the expected raising effect of the B2 zzso on plasma zzso zzso was blunted in the presence of a zzso zzso a high zzso of visceral zzso tissue or zzso 

Our data indicate that the zzso gene zzso zzso influences plasma zzso activity on one hand and plasma zzso zzso on the other hand among zzso The association between the zzso zzso and plasma zzso zzso is altered by the presence of abdominal obesity and some features of the insulin resistance zzso
