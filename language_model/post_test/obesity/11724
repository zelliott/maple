zzso decreases food intake in the rat when injected into the cerebral zzso We tested the effect of a novel zzso analog zzso injected zzso zzso on weight gain and food intake in zzso zzso rats zzso zzso were injected zzso zzso with either saline or zzso at zzso or zzso zzso In further experiments, larger rats at a more steady state on the growth curve zzso zzso were injected with either saline or zzso or 1 zzso zzso Food zzso water consumption and body weight were recorded zzso Weight gain was significantly reduced in the smaller rats injected with zzso or zzso zzso showing only a zzso and zzso increase in original weight, respectively, as compared to a zzso increase for the zzso The larger rats injected with 1 zzso had a significant reduction in body weight with a zzso decrease in original body weight as compared to a zzso increase for the zzso Food intake was significantly reduced suggesting that the weight loss observed after injection of zzso was attributable in part to a reduction in food zzso The genetically obese zzso rats injected with zzso (1 zzso had a significant reduction in weight gain and food zzso zzso significantly increased blood zzso and zzso levels and decreased zzso and T4 in zzso and zzso rats, an effect that was only zzso zzso also caused a decrease in zzso in both the zzso and nucleus zzso and an increase in zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso In this study, zzso exhibited a consistent and dramatic effect on body weight and food intake in zzso and obese zzso rats, and enabled us to study the role that zzso plays in weight control and the functional interactions of zzso with brain zzso and zzso and zzso zzso
