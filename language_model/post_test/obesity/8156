zzso is behind our zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been previously related to obesity and weight zzso However, zzso association and functionality of zzso zzso locus is still zzso The aim of this study was to zzso in zzso conditions, if the presence of zzso zzso in overweight women could be related to zzso zzso disorders, and zzso changes in sleep quality, to improve understanding of the previously demonstrated associations with obesity and reduced weight loss of the C zzso 

zzso temperature, zzso and position zzso and TAP variables were measured as markers of zzso functionality during 8 consecutive zzso A zzso and food diary was also completed, whereas sleep quality was determined by zzso zzso We recruited 85 women who were overweight with body mass index zzso of zzso and age zzso zzso From this sample, we found that 43 women were carrying the minor zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and 42 women were zzso carriers zzso zzso zzso Both groups of patients were matched for number, age, obesity parameters and energy zzso 

Compared with zzso subjects, who showed more robust zzso rhythm profiles, patients with the C zzso displayed significant zzso zzso lower zzso and greater fragmentation of the rhythm, a less stable zzso pattern and a significantly weakened zzso function, as assessed by the zzso function index zzso C subjects were also less active, started their activities later in the morning and were zzso during the day, showing a delayed zzso that characterizes zzso zzso 

C genetic zzso in zzso zzso display a less robust zzso rhythm than zzso and a delayed zzso that characterizes zzso zzso We support the notion that identifying zzso zzso in patients may assist the therapist in characterization of the roots of the zzso zzso
