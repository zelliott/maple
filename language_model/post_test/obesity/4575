High protein diets have been shown to improve zzso zzso in zzso models and in high-fat fed zzso We therefore evaluated the effects of a protein supplementation on zzso lipids zzso and zzso plasma zzso in obese non diabetic zzso 

Eleven obese women received a zzso zzso protein supplement zzso for zzso while otherwise nourished on a spontaneous diet, zzso zzso visceral body fat, total liver volume zzso zzso zzso and cholesterol zzso zzso tolerance zzso zzso zzso insulin sensitivity zzso IS zzso zzso zzso blood pressure and body composition zzso zzso were assessed before and after zzso zzso 

zzso were positively correlated with visceral fat and total liver volume at zzso zzso decreased significantly zzso by zzso zzso total zzso by zzso and total cholesterol by zzso zzso slightly increased fat free mass from zzso to zzso zzso zzso fat, total liver volume, zzso zzso zzso clearance and insulin sensitivity were not zzso 

zzso improves zzso zzso and plasma zzso profiles in obese non diabetic patients, without adverse effects on zzso tolerance or zzso zzso
