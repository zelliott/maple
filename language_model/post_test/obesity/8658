zzso in the upstream region of the zzso zzso gene could play a part in the development of zzso 

We screened the upstream region from 27 men by the single strand zzso zzso analysis and zzso sequencing and then zzso zzso non-obese zzso mass index zzso zzso and 123 obese zzso or zzso 28 zzso men including 138 patients with Type II zzso diabetes zzso 

Three zzso of single zzso substitution zzso at zzso zzso at zzso zzso at zzso and a zzso zzso repeat zzso at zzso were zzso The frequency of zzso and zzso zzso was higher in non-obese subjects and that of zzso zzso in zzso zzso In the zzso repeat zzso five zzso were detected including Z containing 17 zzso The Z - 6 zzso was more common in non-obese subjects and the Z + 2 zzso in obese zzso zzso 3 zzso - 6, zzso zzso zzso was associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and the absence of diabetes zzso zzso zzso and zzso 9 zzso + 2, zzso zzso zzso with obesity zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso - 6, zzso zzso zzso tended to be more common in non-obese zzso A zzso reporter zzso showed that zzso 2 and zzso 3 had zzso or zzso higher promoter activities than the most common zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso containing the zzso zzso could be associated with higher zzso levels of the gene and thereby with resistance to obesity and Type II zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene may play an important part in genetic predisposition to the zzso
