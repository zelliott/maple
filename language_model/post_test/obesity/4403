zzso prevalence is unusually high among adults with intellectual disability zzso There is limited and conflicting evidence on obesity prevalence among ambulatory children and adolescents with zzso The present study aimed to estimate obesity prevalence in this group and to compare with population zzso 

zzso of nine schools zzso zzso zzso 150 zzso for ambulatory children and adolescents with zzso ID in Scotland in zzso zzso was defined as measured body mass index zzso at or above the 95th zzso relative to UK 1990 reference data, and using the international definition based on zzso zzso prevalence observed was compared against Scottish population data on obesity prevalence from the most recent nationally representative zzso 

zzso prevalence (at or above 95th zzso for zzso was zzso and was significantly higher among those attending secondary schools compared with primary schools zzso zzso zzso of obesity was significantly higher than in the general zzso population in both boys and girls zzso zzso 

The present study suggests that that obesity may be very prevalent among ambulatory children and adolescents with zzso and that increased obesity risk may begin in zzso
