The present paper focuses on the study of blood zzso acid zzso in healthy men zzso and zzso and women, with special emphasis on the zzso of the recently described zzso zzso zzso acid zzso The wide range of changes found in this pool on comparing different zzso situations may be attributable to its proposed characteristic high dynamism on the one hand, but also to the influence of other factors such as zzso Along these lines, the zzso and zzso variations found here in human blood led to the speculation as to whether these differences could be related to the influence of zzso This hypothesis was further tested by chronically treating a group of male rats with zzso and checking their subsequent blood zzso acid compartment changes (which yielded a greater difference in the zzso zzso From the overall results obtained it may be concluded that the higher production of zzso in women and obese men affects zzso acid availability to the zzso by modulating the zzso zzso zzso acid pool through a mechanism that is, at present, zzso
