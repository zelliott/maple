Previous work suggested that the degree of psychiatric zzso evidenced in overweight individuals was related to the severity of binge eating problems and not related to the severity of zzso In a zzso study, we investigated the relationship between weight and eating disorders zzso in a sample of type 2 diabetic zzso 

Three hundred zzso patients with type 2 diabetes were zzso to various weight zzso zzso control, eating and zzso psychological problems, self-esteem, zzso and general zzso of zzso patients with and without an zzso were zzso 

Eighty-one percent of all type 2 diabetic patients were overweight or zzso zzso rates of zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso eating disorder was the most diagnosed zzso There was a strong relationship between body mass index zzso and eating zzso variables and a weak or no relationship between zzso and depression or general zzso zzso Patients with an zzso showed a greater zzso compared to patients without an zzso The diagnosis of an zzso did not seem to have a specific influence on zzso zzso 

Our results in a type 2 diabetic sample indicate that weight might have an impact on body and zzso psychological distress in type 2 diabetic patients, but is of minor or no importance for depressive symptomatology, lower self-esteem, and general psychiatric zzso Type 2 diabetic patients with an zzso however, suffer from considerable psychiatric zzso
