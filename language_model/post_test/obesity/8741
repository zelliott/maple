The principal risk factors of zzso of the knee are: age, obesity and zzso It is hypothesized that zzso walking zzso zzso 20 zzso in the elderly obese will lead to zzso zzso Changes in the gait pattern due to fatigue will lead to altered knee zzso at zzso and consequently decreased shock zzso This scenario will result in an increased rate of loading and possibly an increase in the overall magnitude of peak ground reaction forces, both of which could cause zzso cartilage zzso zzso females are at an overall higher risk of developing zzso than zzso This gender zzso may be explained by the fact that females have a higher percentage of body fat content zzso proportion of lean zzso that may increase the rate of zzso zzso These zzso hypotheses can be examined by studying continuous periods of walking in which ground reaction forces, knee zzso and zzso data are zzso
