The objective of this study was to determine the contribution of regional fat zzso defined as abdominal zzso or zzso zzso obesity in zzso differences to the prevalence odds of hypertension in overweight American zzso Data zzso from the zzso US National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso were zzso for this zzso zzso obesity was defined as waist zzso zzso zzso for men and women, zzso zzso obesity was defined using ratio of zzso to zzso zzso thickness and zzso zzso for men and women, zzso zzso odds ratios from zzso zzso zzso models were used to evaluate the contribution of regional fat zzso to zzso variation in zzso zzso adjustment was made for age, education, alcohol intake and body mass zzso In both men and women, coexistence of zzso and TO was associated with much higher prevalence odds of hypertension than association due to each of the regional fat zzso In men, coexistence of zzso and TO was associated with zzso zzso and zzso increased prevalence odds of hypertension in zzso zzso and Mexican Americans, zzso The corresponding values in women were zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and Mexican Americans, zzso The coexistence of zzso and TO appears to be the culprit that contributes to high blood pressure on top of body mass zzso Weight reduction programs that are targeted toward abdominal and zzso regions in zzso populations and along zzso lines may help to alleviate zzso disparity in risk of zzso
