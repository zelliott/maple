When using zzso or zzso zzso to study zzso zzso an zzso correction factor should be applied to correct for loss of label in the exchange pathways of the zzso acid zzso We have shown recently that the zzso recovery factor has a high zzso zzso and should therefore be determined in every zzso In the present study we examined the factors that might explain some of the zzso between subjects in zzso recovery zzso Data were pooled from four different studies with identical zzso in which the zzso recovery factor was measured, prior to an intervention, to correct plasma fatty acid zzso zzso zzso recovery was measured after 2 h of zzso zzso infusion at rest followed by 1 h of cycling exercise at zzso of zzso oxygen zzso zzso zzso in zzso recovery was zzso at rest and zzso during zzso zzso zzso revealed that, at rest, zzso of the zzso recovery could be accounted for by zzso zzso rate adjusted for zzso mass, percentage body fat and respiratory zzso zzso During exercise, zzso of the zzso in zzso recovery could be accounted for by energy expenditure adjusted for zzso mass, % body fat and zzso In conclusion, we show that the zzso recovery factor has a high zzso zzso both at rest and during exercise, which can partly be accounted for by zzso rate, zzso and % body zzso These data indicate that the zzso recovery factor needs to be determined in every subject, under similar conditions as used for the zzso determination of zzso zzso Failure to do this might result in large zzso or zzso of plasma zzso zzso and hence to artificial differences between zzso
