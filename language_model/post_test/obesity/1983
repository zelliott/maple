To zzso whether the administration of small doses of zzso zzso can increase zzso of sex hormone binding zzso zzso in obese women with different types of obesity and to evaluate the potential zzso benefits of such zzso 

Daily administration of 20 zzso of zzso during six weeks while maintaining habitual food intake and physical zzso 

zzso zzso obese women zzso zzso zzso zzso y mean zzso zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Plasma zzso of zzso zzso insulin, zzso hormones, sex hormones, blood zzso and insulin sensitivity (by zzso insulin clamp in 12 zzso at base line after six weeks of zzso 

Six weeks treatment with small doses of zzso resulted in a significant increase in plasma zzso The increase of zzso was higher in abdominal obesity and not associated with a significant change in body weight, plasma insulin zzso zzso ratio of plasma insulin sensitivity zzso disposal during insulin zzso In patients with initially high zzso the significant increase of insulin removal (as judged from the increase of zzso zzso was zzso Treatment resulted in a zzso increase of zzso decrease of zzso zzso and a more than double increase of zzso zzso 

Administration of small doses of zzso can increase the concentration of zzso without changing insulin zzso or zzso As there was a significant decrease (by zzso of T4 and parallel increase of zzso with a clear increase of zzso ratio it seems possible that rather than lack of zzso hormones a lower peripheral zzso of T4 might be a factor contributing to the low zzso concentration in abdominal zzso Treatment with small doses of zzso may be considered to zzso some of the risk factors associated with abdominal zzso particularly in some zzso of obese women with a relative resistance to zzso hormones possibly dependent on decreased peripheral zzso of zzso
