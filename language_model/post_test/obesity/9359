zzso zzso disposal is dependent on the zzso effects of zzso In type 2 diabetes, zzso zzso is impaired as a result of an imbalance in NO and zzso zzso We tested the hypothesis that chronic voluntary wheel running zzso prevents zzso in zzso zzso associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes independent of the effects of zzso on zzso by zzso zzso Long Evans zzso zzso zzso rats, a model of zzso obesity and type 2 diabetes, to 1) RUN, 2) caloric restriction zzso diet adjusted to match body weights of zzso group), or 3) sedentary control zzso groups zzso zzso zzso at 4 zzso At 40 zzso zzso and zzso zzso to insulin zzso zzso was assessed in the presence of a zzso zzso zzso blocker zzso or a NO zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, in zzso zzso isolated from the white portion of the zzso zzso Body weight, zzso plasma zzso and zzso zzso were lower in zzso and zzso than zzso zzso zzso however, the zzso area under the curve zzso following the zzso zzso tolerance test was lower only in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso responses to all doses of insulin were greater in zzso than zzso or zzso in the presence of a zzso zzso zzso but group differences in zzso to insulin with zzso of zzso were not zzso We conclude daily wheel running prevents obesity and type 2 zzso declines in zzso zzso in skeletal muscle zzso through mechanisms that appear to be NO zzso and independent of attenuating excess zzso in zzso zzso
