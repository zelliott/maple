Variation in energy intake by weight status at different ages may explain inconsistencies in previous research on energy intake and zzso zzso our objective was to determine the relationship between reported daily energy intake and zzso weight status across zzso 

We examined dietary reports of children ages 1 to 17 years by using the National Health and Nutrition zzso Survey, zzso (N zzso zzso Using measured height and weight, we zzso weight status based on zzso zzso (age zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using current zzso zzso intake was reported by using the repeatedly validated automated multiple pass method, a detailed zzso 24-hour zzso We used ordinary least squares zzso to examine the interactions of age and weight category on total energy zzso controlling for zzso race, ethnicity, and zzso 

Weight status and age both have positive associations with zzso energy zzso However, the interaction between weight and age demonstrates a negative effect throughout childhood, such that young zzso children reported consuming significantly more calories and zzso adolescents reported consuming fewer calories than their zzso zzso zzso 

In a nationally representative zzso sample, overweight and obese girls older than 7 years and boys older than 10 years reported consuming fewer daily calories than their zzso zzso One explanation for this would be that increased energy intake in early childhood is related to the onset of zzso but other mechanisms, such as differences in energy zzso may contribute more to maintaining zzso status through zzso
