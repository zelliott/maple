The aim of our study was to comparatively evaluate the efficacy and safety of zzso and zzso treatment in obese diabetic patients of both zzso with specific attention to zzso zzso changes and cardiovascular zzso 

Patients were zzso zzso and followed in 3 Italian zzso of Internal zzso We evaluated 144 obese diabetic zzso All were required to have been diagnosed as being diabetic for at least 6 months, and had zzso control with diet alone or diet and oral zzso zzso We administered zzso zzso zzso or zzso (10 zzso in a randomized, controlled, zzso clinical study, and evaluated zzso zzso zzso control, blood pressure and heart rate zzso during 12 months of this zzso 

A total of 141 zzso males and 72 zzso 35 males and 36 zzso aged 53 zzso 5 zzso with zzso 34 males and 36 zzso aged 51 zzso 4 zzso with zzso completed the 4 weeks on zzso diet and were zzso to zzso treatment with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso body mass index zzso improvement was present after 6 zzso 9 zzso and 12 zzso months in both zzso zzso waist circumference zzso hip circumference zzso and zzso ratio zzso zzso improvement was observed after 12 months zzso zzso in both zzso zzso zzso decrease was obtained after 6 zzso 9 zzso and 12 zzso months in both zzso After 9 and 12 months, mean zzso plasma zzso zzso and zzso plasma zzso zzso levels were significantly decreased in both groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blood pressure zzso and zzso blood pressure zzso improvement zzso was present in the zzso group after 12 zzso No significant change in blood pressure zzso was observed in the zzso group during the zzso No significant zzso variation was obtained during the study in either zzso Of the 133 patients who completed the study, zzso of patients in the zzso group and zzso of patients in the zzso group had side effects zzso vs zzso zzso Side effect profiles were different in the two zzso zzso All zzso side effects were gastrointestinal zzso zzso caused an increase in blood zzso sure (both zzso and zzso in one patient, but it was controlled by zzso zzso The zzso zzso changes were small and all mean vitamin and zzso values stayed within reference zzso No patients required vitamin zzso 

Both zzso and zzso were effective on zzso variables and on zzso pattern during the 12-month zzso in our sample, zzso appears to be slightly more zzso as an zzso drug, while zzso intake was not associated to any cardiovascular effect and was generally better tolerated than zzso
