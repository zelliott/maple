zzso is usually associated with obesity and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso knockout zzso mice without a signaling zzso zzso zzso in zzso however, have profound zzso without signs of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso tissue was zzso To test the hypothesis that the zzso zzso results in delayed degradation and slowed zzso we determined the zzso of zzso transfer in groups of zzso and zzso mice after intravenous zzso injection of zzso zzso and the reference substance zzso zzso The degradation pattern of zzso zzso in serum and brain zzso at different time points between 10 and zzso was measured by zzso and acid zzso Although zzso mice had reduced zzso of zzso zzso zzso by the brain and several peripheral zzso zzso was more stable in blood and zzso There was no change in the rate of zzso zzso zzso showed that serum soluble zzso zzso known to antagonize zzso zzso had a zzso increase, probably contributing to the zzso and reduced tissue zzso Thus, the zzso zzso unexpectedly increased the stability of zzso but suppressed its tissue zzso These changes probably contribute to the known partial resistance of the zzso mice to zzso zzso
