zzso after zzso zzso remains zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso tissue has not been thoroughly evaluated to establish associations with the occurrence of complications after zzso The current study sought to determine whether differences in zzso visceral zzso predicted complications after zzso 

Outcomes in patients undergoing zzso were zzso according to the zzso system for zzso complications and the International Study Group on zzso zzso system for zzso zzso pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso CT scans were evaluated by a blinded investigator for zzso of abdominal zzso and fat zzso Data on pancreatic zzso and pancreatic duct size were zzso zzso and zzso analyses were zzso 

A total of zzso patients underwent zzso for zzso and benign zzso Rates of zzso mortality and zzso at 90 days were zzso zzso and zzso zzso Patients with a body mass index zzso 25 zzso had higher rates of zzso zzso zzso zzso and complications zzso zzso In zzso analysis, patients were more likely to develop any complication as CT zzso decreased for zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and liver zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso complications after zzso remain zzso zzso CT zzso of abdominal zzso is an independent predictor of morbidity after zzso and suggests a high-risk patient physiology for pancreatic zzso
