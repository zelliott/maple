zzso often leads to symptoms of zzso congestion associated with normal zzso but abnormal zzso zzso This study analyzed zzso in passive zzso compliance in obesity using the rabbit zzso New Zealand White rabbits were fed a normal zzso or zzso added fat diet zzso After 12 weeks, rabbits fed the high fat diet developed obesity zzso versus zzso 04 zzso zzso and left zzso zzso zzso versus zzso g dry weight, zzso Compliance was assessed with the isolated heart preparation by analyzing the passive zzso left zzso zzso zzso The zzso relation was fit to an exponential function by zzso zzso results showed that the zzso of zzso was greater in obese than in lean rabbits zzso versus zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso compliance was zzso Computer simulation analyses suggested that an isolated reduction in zzso compliance may contribute to elevated cardiac filling pressures and exercise zzso These data suggest that zzso compliance is reduced early in the development of obesity and may be an important component in the reduction of cardiac reserve in zzso
