A variety of body size zzso have been used in population zzso analyses to describe zzso in drug clearance zzso such as total body weight zzso body surface area zzso lean body weight zzso and zzso zzso There is controversy, however, as to which body size zzso is most suitable for describing zzso across the whole zzso Given the increasing worldwide prevalence of zzso it is essential to identify the best size zzso so that dosing regimens can be developed that are suitable for patients of any zzso 

The aim of this study was to explore the use of body size zzso in population zzso analyses for describing zzso In particular, we sought to determine if any body size zzso was preferential to describe zzso and zzso its relationship with zzso and also identify study design features that result in the identification of a zzso relationship between zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso articles were identified from zzso using defined zzso A database was developed to collect information about study designs, model building and zzso analysis strategies, and final reported models for zzso The success of inclusion for a variety of zzso was zzso A zzso of studies was then performed to determine the average relationship reported between zzso and zzso For each study, zzso was calculated across the range of zzso for the study population and zzso to allow comparison between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso relationships with zzso of zzso zzso and estimated values were evaluated to determine the relationship that best described the data zzso Additionally, joint zzso of zzso were compared between studies reporting a zzso relationship between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and those reporting zzso relationships zzso linear increase in zzso with zzso ideal body weight or zzso 

A total of zzso out of zzso articles were included in the analysis, from which 484 zzso studies were zzso zzso percent of all models for zzso included body size as a zzso with zzso of models including a zzso relationship between zzso and zzso No single size zzso was more successful than others for describing zzso zzso with a fixed zzso of zzso zzso zzso or estimated zzso of zzso zzso zzso was found to best describe the average reported relationship between zzso and zzso The success of identifying a zzso increase in zzso with zzso was found to be higher for those studies that included a wider range of subject zzso 

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to have performed a zzso of zzso relationships between zzso and body zzso Although many studies reported a linear relationship between zzso and zzso the average relationship was found to be zzso zzso with an zzso zzso of zzso may be most suitable for describing an increase in zzso with body size as it accounts for both body composition and zzso zzso principles concerning differences in zzso rates across zzso
