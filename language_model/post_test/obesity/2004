Both the insulin response to zzso and the sensitivity to insulin show large variation in the normal zzso Many subjects have either a markedly low insulin response or low sensitivity to insulin, with nevertheless normal zzso zzso For such subjects to become zzso insulin zzso or insulin action must further deteriorate with time, or other factors are added which tip the balance towards zzso Most evidence to date indicates that reduced zzso responsiveness and reduced insulin sensitivity co-exist in subjects prior to developing zzso Both insulin zzso and insulin action are genetically controlled and influenced by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and insulin action vary zzso in a closely linked manner; inability to fully compensate for changes in one variable may generate a functional deficit in zzso zzso zzso combining low functions would run a zzso larger risk of zzso the zzso tolerance and be more vulnerable, in terms of diabetes zzso to factors that further reduce insulin output or insulin zzso zzso analysis of existing data zzso us to ascribe a dominating role to the impairment of insulin zzso in the zzso of zzso and zzso Patients with zzso also exhibit increased proportions of zzso and zzso conversion zzso We used zzso diabetic and zzso zzso zzso to study the possible relationship between zzso pancreatic insulin stores and the proportion of zzso peptides in the plasma and the zzso A marked increase in these peptides was associated with zzso reduction in insulin stores of the zzso After food zzso the depletion of pancreatic insulin in the diabetic animals was partially corrected, and the zzso ratio zzso In contrast, zzso zzso showed only 50% reduction in pancreatic insulin stores under zzso conditions, with no change in zzso zzso These findings suggest that in the diabetic zzso zzso pancreatic capacity for zzso of insulin is zzso the zzso consequences of this limitation are amplified by increased zzso demand secondary to insulin resistance, thus zzso the establishment of zzso which may in itself further exacerbate the pancreatic zzso
