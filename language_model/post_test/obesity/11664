zzso is associated with disorders of plasma zzso transport in many, but not in all obese zzso The effects of obesity on the regulation of genes involved in plasma zzso transport may depend on specific zzso causing or contributing to obesity and/or on interactions of a specific obesity zzso with the genetic zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso causes severe obesity associated with zzso and altered zzso zzso gene regulation in zzso fatty zzso 

To determine whether the effects of the obesity zzso zzso on zzso gene regulation in rat liver depend on the genetic zzso 

We studied zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene expression in obese rats carrying the zzso zzso on the background of the zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso zzso gene expression was increased in fatty rats of both zzso whereas zzso and zzso gene expression differed between zzso and zzso fatty zzso zzso gene zzso was reduced to half and zzso zzso was increased zzso in zzso zzso but not in zzso fatty rats vs lean zzso A fish oil diet suppressed zzso but not zzso gene zzso in zzso fatty rats, whereas in zzso fatty rats zzso zzso was zzso but zzso zzso was zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with the genetic background significantly affect the zzso and zzso regulation of the zzso zzso and zzso genes in rat zzso The genetic background may therefore be a major zzso of the consequences of a specific obesity zzso for plasma zzso zzso
