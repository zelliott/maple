A novel method has been developed to study zzso zzso zzso profiles using repeated zzso zzso in an zzso zzso We assessed the zzso zzso zzso zzso profile in males with mild obesity and evaluated the use of plasma and zzso zzso as markers of insulin zzso 

zzso zzso 

zzso lean zzso mass index, zzso zzso zzso zzso and 27 mildly obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso males measured zzso zzso zzso on six fixed zzso over a zzso period in an zzso zzso 

The total area under the zzso curve zzso and incremental area under the zzso curve zzso were used as zzso of zzso zzso zzso blood samples were obtained zzso Food intake was recorded by all zzso 

zzso and lean subjects had comparable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, during the day, obese subjects showed a greater zzso increase, resulting in significantly higher zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso The total group of 81 males was divided into zzso based on zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso these zzso zzso was the only significant zzso of subjects with high zzso model assessment zzso zzso zzso compared with low zzso zzso zzso Overall, zzso was the strongest zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso profiles can be used to investigate zzso zzso in both lean and mildly obese subjects and may help to detect subjects with an underlying disposition for zzso related to insulin resistance, zzso the zzso zzso
