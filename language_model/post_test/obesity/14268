zzso breathing is a common and serious cause of zzso zzso and zzso morbidity in zzso The spectrum of zzso zzso breathing ranges from habitual zzso to partial or complete airway zzso termed zzso sleep zzso zzso zzso patterns due to airway narrowing are highly zzso including zzso zzso increased respiratory effort, flow zzso zzso and/or gas exchange zzso As a consequence, sleep zzso may be zzso Increased upper airway resistance is an essential component of zzso including any combination of zzso of the zzso and/or zzso zzso However, in addition to zzso factors, the stability of the upper airway is predicated on zzso zzso zzso control, and zzso zzso During sleep, most children with zzso zzso attain a stable breathing pattern, indicating successful zzso zzso At sleep zzso airway muscle activity is reduced, zzso zzso increases, and an zzso threshold slightly below zzso levels is observed in zzso zzso zzso collapse is offset by zzso zzso activity in response to zzso and negative zzso zzso zzso zzso results in sudden reduction in airway muscle zzso contributing to obstruction during zzso zzso Arousal from sleep zzso zzso instability and, thus, zzso zzso zzso reductions in zzso zzso activity related to central zzso sleep processes likely account for the disproportionate severity of zzso observed during zzso zzso zzso the zzso of pediatric zzso may permit more precise clinical zzso and therefore improve or target therapies related to zzso zzso compensation, zzso control, and/or zzso zzso
