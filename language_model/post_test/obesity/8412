zzso evidence suggests that obesity is associated with tumor progression in prostate cancer zzso patients after radical zzso zzso We conducted a retrospective zzso study to determine the effect of body mass index zzso on the zzso characteristics and zzso recurrence of zzso in Japanese men who underwent zzso 

The medical records of zzso men with zzso treated by zzso without zzso therapy at four medical zzso between 2001 and 2009 were zzso zzso Patients were zzso into four groups using the World Health Organization zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the various zzso categories with zzso characteristics and zzso zzso were statistically zzso zzso recurrence was defined as a zzso level zzso 

Of the zzso patients, 230 zzso experienced zzso recurrence during the median follow-up period of 49 zzso The median zzso was zzso and zzso patients were zzso zzso were of normal weight, zzso were overweight and zzso were obese zzso zzso zzso zzso levels and zzso density zzso tended to decrease as zzso zzso zzso characteristics did not differ significantly among zzso zzso As per the WHO zzso and zzso categories, zzso recurrence rate was comparable among the zzso zzso After adjusting for other zzso and zzso zzso zzso Cox zzso hazards analysis revealed that a high zzso did not have an independent impact on zzso recurrence-free zzso 

zzso Japanese zzso patients treated by zzso had higher zzso zzso levels and zzso High zzso was not associated with adverse pathological findings or increased zzso recurrence rate in Japanese zzso patients treated with zzso zzso differences may exist in the relationship between obesity and outcomes of zzso in zzso zzso
