The relative or absolute zzso of pancreatic zzso mass function zzso the zzso of zzso It is necessary to alleviate the zzso stress and reduce the demand for insulin to decrease the effects of zzso affecting zzso zzso zzso is a natural zzso existed in food and can also be produced zzso through the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and obesity model would be helpful for understanding how zzso adapt to insulin resistance and how zzso alleviate the zzso impairment and protect pancreatic zzso cell function in pregnant mice with zzso zzso female mice were divided into three groups and fed with high fat food zzso group, zzso energy from zzso high fat with sodium zzso food zzso group, zzso zzso with zzso zzso or control food zzso group, zzso energy from zzso zzso The feeding would last for 14 weeks before mating and throughout the gestation zzso A subset of zzso were sacrificed at zzso day zzso zzso to evaluate the changes of metabolism and zzso function, mass, proliferation and zzso inflammatory reaction of zzso from different zzso zzso were double zzso to assess the zzso zzso insulin zzso expression of proliferation gene zzso and zzso gene zzso Moreover, we detected the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso to evaluate the zzso inflammatory response with zzso Mice fed with zzso showed obviously changes including the decreased values of weight gain, zzso insulin, zzso and total cholesterol level of blood compared with high fat diet group, and the reduced circulating maternal zzso factors at zzso Mice fed with zzso displayed zzso zzso with a greater zzso size and zzso area in zzso Furthermore, the higher ratio of zzso and inflammatory response were found in zzso group compared with zzso and zzso group, while the proliferation rates of zzso increased in zzso group, but not in zzso or zzso zzso shows an obvious function of zzso and can alleviate the zzso stress, maintain the zzso function and protect them from inflammatory response in pregnant obese mouse without obvious fetus zzso
