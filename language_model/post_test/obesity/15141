zzso AND zzso zzso We propose the minimal definition of zzso disease to be zzso overweight or obesity in combination with painful zzso zzso The associated symptoms in zzso disease include fatty deposits, easy zzso sleep zzso impaired memory, depression, difficulty zzso anxiety, rapid zzso zzso of breath, diabetes, zzso zzso fatigue, weakness and joint zzso 

We suggest that zzso disease is classified zzso zzso zzso diffuse form A form with zzso widespread painful zzso tissue without clear zzso zzso zzso zzso form - a form with general pain in zzso tissue and intense pain in and around multiple zzso and zzso zzso zzso form - a form with pain in and around multiple zzso zzso zzso form - a form with solitary deposits of excess fat for example at the zzso aspect of the zzso 

zzso disease most commonly appears between the ages of 35 and 50 years and is five to thirty times more common in women than in zzso The prevalence of zzso disease has not yet been exactly zzso 

zzso but zzso zzso include: nervous system dysfunction, mechanical pressure on nerves, zzso tissue dysfunction and zzso zzso AND zzso zzso Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria and should be made by systematic physical examination and thorough exclusion of differential zzso zzso the diagnosis should be made by a physician with a broad experience of patients with painful conditions and knowledge of family medicine, internal medicine or pain zzso The diagnosis should only be made when the differential diagnoses have been zzso 

zzso diagnoses include: fibromyalgia, zzso zzso zzso disorders, primary psychiatric disorders, multiple zzso zzso familial multiple zzso and zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso The majority of the cases of zzso disease occur zzso A to G zzso at position zzso of zzso DNA cannot be detected in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso typing has not revealed any correlation between typical zzso and the presence of the zzso zzso AND zzso The following treatments have lead to some pain reduction in patients with zzso disease: zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and rapid cycling zzso zzso As none of the treatments have led to long lasting complete pain reduction and revolutionary results, we propose that zzso disease should be treated in multidisciplinary teams zzso in chronic zzso 

The pain in zzso disease seems to be relatively constant over zzso
