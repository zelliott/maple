zzso and zzso are hormones that may represent a link between obesity and insulin zzso Genes for these hormones are new candidate genes of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes zzso The aim of our study was to determine the frequency of single zzso zzso zzso G and zzso G of zzso gene and zzso A and zzso G of zzso gene in patients with zzso anorexia zzso and in lean women and to study the influence of particular zzso on serum zzso of these zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and insulin levels were measured in 51 patients with zzso 17 with anorexia zzso and 17 lean zzso DNA analysis was carried out by means of zzso chain reaction zzso with restriction analysis of zzso product zzso zzso levels were lowest in obese women and highest in anorexia zzso zzso zzso zzso were lowest in anorexia zzso and highest in obese zzso zzso analysis within respective groups showed no differences in assessed parameters when comparing different zzso and zzso zzso The only difference detected was significantly higher zzso in zzso zzso relative to T zzso carries in 276 position of zzso gene in control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso In anorexia zzso patients, frequency of G zzso in zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher relative to control group zzso zzso 

zzso zzso G a zzso G of zzso gene and zzso and zzso G zzso gene did not influence serum zzso and zzso zzso zzso was influenced by T zzso presence in 276 position of zzso gene in control group zzso zzso zzso patients had higher frequency of G zzso of zzso zzso zzso compared to healthy zzso
