zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso family that mediates inflammation through the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso As mice lacking zzso become obese and insulin zzso and both zzso and zzso have a role in overall energy balance, we sought to determine whether zzso zzso also causes zzso Male and female zzso zzso and control zzso zzso mice were fed either a high-fat zzso zzso of zzso or a low-fat zzso zzso of zzso synthetic diet starting at 6 weeks of zzso zzso mice maintained lower but zzso levels of zzso compared with zzso zzso Plasma zzso levels were below the detection limit for both zzso and zzso zzso Male zzso mice gained extra fat mass by 16 weeks on the zzso diet, but not until 40 weeks on the zzso zzso Female zzso mice gained more fat by 28 weeks but only on the zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso mice develop obesity with an age and zzso differences, and only male mice display obesity on zzso zzso Overall, this study suggests that the lower level of zzso in zzso mice might be causing obesity development similarly to zzso zzso
