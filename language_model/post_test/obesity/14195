This zzso randomized, zzso zzso study was designed to compare zzso zzso combination therapy with combination zzso plus zzso therapy in overweight individuals with zzso controlled type 2 diabetes zzso 

zzso with inadequate zzso control zzso zzso or zzso while on zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso entered a zzso zzso period during which they received zzso 2 zzso At the end of the zzso individuals with zzso plasma zzso or zzso zzso were zzso to treatment with zzso (2 zzso and either zzso (4 zzso zzso zzso or a zzso zzso 5 zzso or zzso 80 zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso to maximum tolerated doses zzso 8 zzso zzso 15 zzso or zzso 320 zzso plus zzso 2 zzso during the first 12 weeks of zzso zzso The primary efficacy end point was the change in zzso zzso from baseline after 52 weeks of zzso 

zzso was zzso to zzso with respect to changes in zzso zzso after one year of treatment zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso treatment difference zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso reductions with zzso but not zzso were accompanied by significant improvements in measures of zzso function including zzso zzso The degree of zzso failure was significantly greater with zzso compared to zzso as measured by the zzso of failure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, zzso The proportion of individuals who experienced zzso events was significantly zzso lower with zzso zzso than with zzso zzso zzso ambulatory blood pressure and cardiovascular zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso were also reduced following one year of treatment with zzso but not zzso Both treatments were generally well zzso 

zzso combination therapy with zzso is zzso to zzso plus zzso combination therapy in reducing zzso zzso over one year of zzso zzso in measures of zzso function suggest that the improvements in zzso control may be better maintained in long-term therapy with the zzso zzso
