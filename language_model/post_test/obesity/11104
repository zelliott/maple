Recent studies suggest HDL exists as numerous zzso with distinct zzso compositions that are not reflected in the HDL cholesterol zzso zzso In this study, we sought to evaluate HDL zzso in adolescents with type 2 diabetes zzso to determine if changes in HDL composition are associated with early vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso 10), lean zzso zzso zzso and obese zzso zzso zzso youth were zzso Plasma was zzso using zzso zzso and zzso proteins were identified using mass zzso zzso vascular zzso was assessed using pulse wave zzso zzso We found youth with zzso exhibited decreased zzso content in zzso containing large HDL particles that was zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso No association was noted between zzso and zzso zzso analysis revealed changes in 7 of 45 identified proteins in the zzso group, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our data demonstrate early changes in the zzso and protein compositions of specific HDL subspecies in adolescents with zzso that are related to early markers of zzso zzso These findings suggest that analyzing the composition of zzso rather than zzso may be useful in assessing cardiovascular risk in this zzso
