The recently developed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rat is known to develop zzso diabetes after a prolonged period in a condition resembling zzso diabetes zzso zzso We examined the effect of pharmacological intervention with a potent zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso and zzso changes in this rat zzso The first two groups of rats received an zzso diet zzso zzso g normal zzso from 12 weeks of age zzso before the onset of zzso or from 28 weeks of age zzso after the onset of zzso while a third group received the zzso diet for the initial 16 weeks only (from 12 to 28 weeks of zzso A control group received standard rat zzso zzso rats gained less weight or lost weight despite increased food intake when switched to the zzso zzso zzso also reduced visceral zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and insulin zzso At the end of the study at 72 weeks, the pancreatic wet weight and insulin content were significantly higher in the treated groups versus control zzso The zzso changes observed in control rats, such as zzso of the zzso and reduced number and size of zzso were not present in zzso zzso zzso fed zzso from 12 to 28 weeks of age gradually gained weight after switching to standard zzso and zzso zzso and zzso appeared (in that zzso The pancreatic insulin content in these rats was significantly higher and the visceral zzso depot was significantly smaller than in control zzso Our study demonstrates that zzso prevented and reversed the zzso zzso and zzso changes in genetically diabetic zzso Moreover, treatment with zzso even for a short period produced a marked delay in the development of insulin zzso and frank zzso
