Disorders possibly associated with insulin resistance zzso are zzso zzso irregular zzso cycles, central obesity and zzso zzso syndrome zzso It is known that zzso is related to a high risk of zzso zzso after many years of zzso stimulation from zzso 

The purpose of the study was to estimate the thickness of the zzso in women with zzso without a diagnosis of zzso and in women with zzso without zzso 

Three groups of women included in the zzso 15 women diagnosed as zzso without zzso 16 women diagnosed as zzso without zzso and 20 women used as controls matched for age and body mass index zzso with the previous zzso zzso of the zzso was estimated in all cases with a zzso ultrasound in three consecutive measures during a zzso 

The mean thickness of the zzso was statistically higher in the zzso group zzso and in the zzso group zzso compared with the control group zzso zzso zzso 

It is concluded that both in women diagnosed as having insulin resistance without zzso and in women with zzso without insulin resistance, the zzso estimated thickness of the zzso is relatively high and a closer follow-up of these women is required in order to detect those in risk to develop zzso and/or zzso
