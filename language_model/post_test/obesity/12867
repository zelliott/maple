The present study evaluated whether a zzso technique could be used for zzso blood flow zzso in zzso zzso When this was confirmed, we applied the technique in different strains of zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso zzso could be given without interfering with mean zzso blood zzso zzso of the zzso with zzso blood was adequate, and the extraction of zzso in zzso beds was nearly zzso In zzso mice whole pancreatic blood flow was estimated to be zzso zzso zzso zzso pancreatic zzso and zzso blood flow to be 18 zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso 12 animals per zzso whereas corresponding values in lean zzso mice were twice as zzso In zzso mice zzso (3 zzso zzso doubled zzso blood flow without affecting whole pancreatic blood flow, whereas no effect was seen after an zzso dose of zzso In zzso zzso mice, zzso blood flow was more than five times higher than in the lean zzso mice when expressed as blood flow per gram zzso However, when zzso blood zzso was corrected for zzso weight, it was lower in the obese than in the lean mice, suggesting an impaired ability in obese mice to increase blood flow in concert with the increased zzso zzso This may contribute to the insufficient insulin zzso and resulting zzso seen in these zzso
