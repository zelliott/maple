zzso insulin resistance is associated with an increase in zzso zzso In zzso models, treatment with the zzso zzso zzso leads to the appearance of small, zzso zzso Whether such zzso zzso changes occur in zzso tissue of zzso patients is zzso 

The objective of the study was to study the effects of treatment with the zzso zzso on zzso zzso tissue zzso and function in zzso zzso 

This was a zzso zzso crossover zzso 

The study was conducted at a university medical zzso 

Twelve adult patients with zzso adrenal zzso zzso characterized by insulin resistance were included in this zzso 

After a zzso zzso phase, patients were treated with zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso each for 16 zzso or vice zzso 

After both zzso and zzso treatment, insulin sensitivity was determined by zzso zzso clamp and abdominal zzso zzso tissue was obtained to measure zzso cell surface and expression of genes involved in zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso treatment significantly improved the insulin sensitivity index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso per zzso P zzso and increased zzso expression levels of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso The increase in insulin sensitivity was accompanied by a significant enlargement of the zzso zzso cell surface zzso zzso zzso 725 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

In the human situation, treatment of zzso subjects with zzso improves insulin sensitivity, whereas at the same time, zzso zzso cell surface zzso
