Studies on plasma zzso zzso were performed in 10 zzso and 16 obese patients with zzso and in 13 with zzso zzso zzso patients generally had normal levels of zzso but obese patients often had zzso In most zzso patients zzso treatment lowered plasma zzso and most zzso patients had low zzso One mechanism zzso zzso hormones might decrease plasma zzso could be to increase zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso was not increased after therapy, nor was it increased in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso patients had zzso low levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso patients without zzso clearance of zzso was zzso A few obese, zzso patients with zzso zzso had low clearance of zzso which may have been due in part to competition for removal of excess zzso zzso Thus, no evidence was obtained for a significant zzso in zzso metabolism in zzso zzso zzso patients had normal synthesis and clearance of very low density zzso zzso In contrast, zzso synthesis was increased in 8 obese, zzso patients, and fractional clearance rates were relatively low compared to obese, zzso zzso In striking contrast, zzso patients had remarkable facility in clearing zzso Thus, zzso metabolism is not zzso zzso in hypothyroidism, but zzso hormones apparently can promote zzso of zzso
