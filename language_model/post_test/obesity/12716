The content of zzso zzso zzso and of zzso involved in its synthesis has been measured in the zzso of obese zzso mice 2 months and zzso months of age, a period of dynamic growth and marked zzso zzso and zzso and comparison made with the values found in the lean zzso control zzso The total zzso zzso content and zzso DNA was significantly increased in the 3- to zzso obese mice relative to both the lean control groups and the 2-month-old obese mice, illustrating the significant changes occurring in the obese mouse liver in this transition zzso The change in zzso zzso DNA in the obese mice is positively correlated with age (up to 4 months, body weight 60 zzso and with parameters linked to the activity of the zzso zzso zzso There is no apparent correlation between zzso concentration and zzso zzso the energy status of the cell, or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The increase in the zzso of zzso which is both a zzso and zzso of the de zzso and salvage pathways of zzso and zzso zzso is considered in relation to the increased zzso requirement associated with the rise in total zzso zzso DNA, and zzso zzso in the obese zzso
