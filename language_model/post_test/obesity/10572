zzso has been documented to play an important role in zzso In the present study, the zzso expression level of zzso and its zzso in zzso zzso muscle were determined by zzso zzso in lean zzso and obese zzso zzso Further, we determined zzso expression for zzso and its two zzso in zzso obese pigs which had either a high or low intramuscular fat zzso We demonstrate for the first time that zzso zzso has two alternative forms, zzso and zzso Unlike mice and humans where the zzso has 99 more zzso than zzso we found that in zzso zzso has 108 more zzso than zzso Our results indicate that the zzso zzso muscle of zzso obese pigs have a higher level of zzso expression for zzso and its zzso than zzso lean zzso Furthermore, zzso pigs with higher intramuscular fat content had a higher zzso and zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso muscle than zzso pigs with lower intramuscular fat content zzso whereas no difference was seen in zzso zzso expression between zzso pigs with high or low intramuscular zzso The ratio of zzso zzso to zzso zzso was also significantly different between zzso pigs distinguished by a high intramuscular fat content compared with those with low intramuscular fat zzso These data suggested that the zzso gene may have a crucial effect on body zzso zzso in zzso whereas the zzso zzso may play an important role in intramuscular fat deposition in obese zzso
