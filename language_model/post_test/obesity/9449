The zzso effects of zzso zzso acid zzso on zzso zzso were assessed in zzso zzso rats, a model for insulin resistance and the zzso zzso Eight weeks of feeding zzso zzso significantly improved zzso tolerance without changing body weight or visceral zzso zzso The zzso zzso was also associated with reduced liver zzso content, improved liver function and reduced zzso these effects were not observed in rats fed the zzso zzso zzso zzso liver zzso content did not correlate with zzso of zzso protein zzso or suppressed zzso of zzso element binding zzso two key regulators of zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, rats fed zzso zzso had fewer zzso zzso droplets in zzso compared to rats fed control diet, but these droplets were larger in zzso zzso zzso rats fed the zzso zzso zzso had greater numbers of zzso zzso droplets that were smaller in size, resulting in overall lower total zzso within these zzso Changes in zzso droplets were associated with lower zzso levels of zzso (formerly known as zzso in rats fed zzso zzso whereas amounts of other members of the zzso family of zzso zzso proteins were unaffected by dietary zzso However, zzso zzso zzso affected the zzso zzso of these zzso Treatment of zzso rat zzso cells with zzso zzso neither prevented nor zzso but rather induced zzso zzso zzso formation, suggesting that the zzso effects of zzso zzso are likely indirect and potentially zzso via increased zzso zzso by peripheral zzso
