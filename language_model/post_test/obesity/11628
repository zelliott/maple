The content and zzso of fatty acids in 30, 45 and zzso zzso lean zzso and obese zzso rats fed either reference zzso or a cafeteria diet has been zzso together with their actual fatty acid intake during each zzso Diet had little overall effect on the pattern of deposition of fatty zzso but zzso the deposition of fat was much higher in zzso zzso The zzso cafeteria diet allowed the direct incorporation of most fatty acids into the rat zzso whilst zzso feeding activated zzso and the deposition of a shorter chain and more saturated pattern of fatty zzso zzso obesity induced a significant expansion of net zzso when compared with lean zzso zzso obese rats accrued a high proportion of fatty zzso which was close to that zzso but nevertheless showed a net de zzso synthesis of fatty zzso It is zzso that the combined effects of genetic obesity and a zzso diet result in high rates of fat zzso with limited net zzso zzso zzso rats show a progressive impairment of their delta zzso system, a situation also observed in obese rats fed a reference zzso In zzso obese rats, cafeteria feeding resulted in an zzso of the conversion of zzso into zzso The cafeteria diet fully compensated for these drawbacks by zzso very high amounts of zzso fatty zzso
