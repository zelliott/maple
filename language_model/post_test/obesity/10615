Despite extensive research, the zzso of zzso zzso syndrome zzso remains zzso zzso an elevated circulating concentration of insulin zzso the production of zzso growth factor binding zzso zzso thus increasing the level of free zzso in serum and stimulating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been reported in zzso and in zzso however, there are inconsistencies in the zzso This systematic review and zzso aimed to determine whether zzso is decreased in zzso when controlling for the influence of zzso 

Articles published between 1988 and 2008 were searched using zzso zzso zzso and Web of zzso zzso literature, trials in progress, and recent reviews were also zzso Original articles were selected by two zzso To be included, the study must have compared serum zzso in two zzso either zzso versus controls, or an overweight zzso versus the normal weight zzso in either zzso From zzso identified articles, 12 were included in the zzso Data were zzso by two zzso independently and standardized for zzso 

The population difference is presented as the zzso Mean zzso zzso zzso zzso subjects had a significantly lower serum zzso of zzso compared with controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso subjects also had lower zzso levels compared with normal weight zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No significant difference was found between overweight zzso patients and overweight controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or between normal weight zzso patients and normal weight controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso controls had significantly lower zzso zzso than normal weight controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso 

These data indicate that a decreased serum level of zzso is unlikely to be a mechanism for zzso zzso in zzso zzso may be the major zzso of serum zzso
