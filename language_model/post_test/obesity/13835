zzso gene disruption has produced knockout zzso mice globally deficient in the orphan nuclear zzso zzso factor 1 zzso These zzso zzso mice lacked adrenal zzso and zzso and also had impaired expression of zzso in zzso zzso and marked structural abnormalities of the zzso zzso nucleus zzso To define the roles of zzso within discrete sites of the zzso organ zzso we have sought to make zzso zzso zzso mice (as reviewed zzso We first used adrenal transplants to restore adrenal function in global zzso zzso mice, providing a zzso form of a zzso zzso to study the roles of zzso in weight zzso These zzso zzso zzso mice became obese due to decreased locomotor activity, providing a novel model of zzso zzso Mice with a zzso zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso strategy exhibited zzso zzso revealing essential roles of zzso in zzso function in zzso zzso studies seek to zzso zzso in the brain or specific zzso cell types, thereby defining its roles in development and function at these zzso In addition, we review our use of bacterial artificial zzso zzso to develop a fluorescent marker for cells that express zzso
