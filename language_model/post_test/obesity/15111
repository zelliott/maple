zzso findings on the relationship between zzso and zzso cardiovascular disease zzso risk in zzso arthritis zzso are contradictory and originate in developed zzso zzso zzso of zzso now occurs in developing zzso We aimed to ascertain the associations of clinical obesity measures with zzso cardiovascular risk and zzso in African women with zzso from a developing black and developed Caucasian zzso 

The associations of body mass index zzso as an indicator of overall zzso and waist circumference and zzso and zzso ratios as abdominal obesity zzso with zzso risk factors and high resolution zzso zzso carotid artery zzso were assessed in zzso zzso models in zzso African women with established zzso 108 were black and 95 zzso 

zzso and zzso ratio were higher in African black compared to Caucasian women zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso versus zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso between population origin and zzso measures were not related to zzso risk factors but were associated with zzso independent of zzso and individual zzso In all patients, zzso was related to zzso and zzso blood pressure but not with serum zzso zzso whereas abdominal obesity zzso were associated with serum zzso zzso but not with blood pressure values; obesity measures that were associated with plasma zzso zzso comprised zzso waist circumference and zzso ratio zzso zzso in multiple zzso adjusted zzso In African Caucasian women, zzso was associated with common carotid artery zzso thickness zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso ratio with plaque zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for one standard zzso zzso zzso These relationships were independent of multiple zzso risk factors and explained by zzso risk zzso In African black women with zzso none of the obesity measures was related to zzso 

zzso in women with zzso from developing groups of black African descent does not as yet translate into zzso In Caucasian women with zzso that belong to developed zzso zzso and zzso ratio should be considered in zzso risk zzso
