To examine whether weight zzso changes in in zzso zzso zzso of subcutaneous abdominal and zzso fat cells were related to those in plasma zzso zzso 

A 15 week weight loss program induced by a moderate caloric zzso 

zzso men and 20 women (age zzso zzso body fat zzso 

In zzso zzso zzso of subcutaneous abdominal and zzso zzso and plasma levels of five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 153 and zzso and three zzso pesticides zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were measured before and after the weight reducing zzso 

Both genders showed a similar reduction in body weight zzso 11 zzso in response to treatment, although men lost significantly more fat mass than women zzso zzso vs zzso zzso respectively, zzso Mean zzso fat cell zzso did not vary before and after weight reduction, regardless of zzso and zzso In response to weight loss, significant increases of all zzso investigated were observed in men, whereas only zzso zzso zzso zzso 153 and 180 significantly rose in zzso In men, higher the increase in zzso zzso of subcutaneous abdominal or zzso zzso greater the rise in plasma levels of most pollutants zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 138 and zzso was in response to weight loss zzso zzso Similar positive correlations were also observed in women but only a few reached statistical significance zzso zzso 118 and zzso 

The weight zzso increase in plasma zzso levels is related to the rise in subcutaneous abdominal and zzso zzso zzso zzso especially in zzso
