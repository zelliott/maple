The effects of increasing cell size on zzso transport activity and metabolism and on the zzso of zzso transport systems in both the plasma and low density zzso zzso in isolated zzso cells from the aging rat model of obesity have been zzso zzso transport activity was assessed by measuring zzso transport and the concentration of zzso transport systems estimated by measuring specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transport activity increases from zzso to zzso zzso with a zzso increase in cell size, but remains constant per unit cellular surface area and is accompanied by a constant 5 zzso of zzso transport zzso of membrane protein in the plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso transport activity, on the other hand, remains constant at zzso zzso per zzso with increasing cell size, but markedly decreases per unit cellular surface area and is accompanied by a decrease from 30 zzso of zzso transport zzso of plasma membrane protein to the zzso zzso These diminished effects of insulin on zzso transport activity and the number of zzso transport systems in the plasma membrane fraction in enlarged cells are paralleled by an zzso decrease in the zzso number of zzso transport zzso of membrane protein in the low density zzso membrane zzso the source of those zzso transport systems appearing in the plasma membrane in response to zzso The effects of cell size on the metabolism of a low concentration of zzso zzso zzso directly parallel those on zzso transport activity and the concentration of zzso transport systems in the plasma membrane zzso and are not associated with significant zzso in the cell's sensitivity to zzso Thus, zzso cellular enlargement is accompanied by the development of a marked zzso zzso at the zzso transport level, which may be the consequence of a relative depletion of zzso transport systems in the zzso zzso
