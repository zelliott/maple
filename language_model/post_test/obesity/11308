zzso obesity is associated to increased fetal risk of obesity and other zzso zzso Human zzso zzso stem cells zzso have not been characterized in obese zzso The aim of this study was to isolate and compare zzso zzso from obese zzso and normal weight control zzso women, to identify zzso possibly zzso the fetus to zzso We enrolled 16 zzso and 7 zzso at delivery zzso zzso body mass zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively), and 32 not pregnant zzso zzso were zzso by flow zzso several maternal and newborn clinical and zzso parameters were also zzso The expression of membrane zzso zzso was higher on zzso than on zzso zzso zzso zzso Also, serum levels of zzso at delivery were higher in zzso versus zzso women and correlated with zzso zzso expression on zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso induction experiments revealed that zzso had a higher zzso potential than zzso as witnessed by higher zzso zzso zzso gamma and zzso zzso levels zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso respectively), at zzso day 14 associated with increased zzso zzso levels from baseline to day 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso was similar in the two sets of zzso after zzso zzso whereas it was increased in zzso after zzso zzso zzso expression was high also in zzso from zzso cords or visceral zzso tissue of not pregnant zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso by influencing the zzso potential of zzso could be an in zzso risk factor for zzso Our data strengthen the hypothesis that high levels of serum and zzso zzso are obesity zzso
