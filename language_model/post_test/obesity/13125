Advanced zzso end products zzso have been implicated in the zzso of diabetic kidney zzso The actions of zzso are zzso both through a zzso zzso and through specific receptors for zzso zzso To explore a specific role for zzso in zzso changes in type 2 diabetes, we examined the zzso effects of a zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice, a model of obese type 2 zzso One group of zzso mice was treated for 2 months with the zzso zzso and another zzso group was treated for the same period with an irrelevant zzso Two groups of zzso zzso mice were treated with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso for 2 zzso zzso zzso mice showed a pronounced increase in kidney weight, zzso volume, basement membrane thickness zzso total zzso volume, urinary zzso zzso zzso and zzso clearance compared with zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso mice, the increase in kidney weight, zzso volume, zzso volume, and zzso was reduced, whereas the increase in zzso clearance and zzso was fully zzso zzso these effects in zzso mice were seen without impact on body weight, blood zzso insulin levels, or food zzso In conclusion, zzso is an important zzso factor in the zzso changes in an animal model of type 2 zzso
