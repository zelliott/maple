Physical activity may reduce the risk of adverse maternal zzso yet there are very few studies that have examined the zzso of exercise amongst obese women during zzso We examined which relevant zzso zzso and health zzso variables and pregnancy symptoms were associated with exercise in a small sample of obese pregnant zzso 

This was a secondary analysis using data from an exercise intervention for the prevention of zzso diabetes in obese pregnant zzso Using the zzso Physical zzso zzso zzso 50 obese pregnant women were classified as zzso if they achieved zzso 900 zzso of exercise and zzso if they did not meet this zzso zzso examined which relevant variables were associated with exercise status at 12, 20, 28 and 36 weeks zzso 

zzso pregnant women with a history of zzso who had children living at zzso who had a lower zzso zzso reported no zzso and zzso and who had no lower back pain, were those women who were most likely to have exercised in early zzso Exercise in late pregnancy was most common among zzso educated zzso 

zzso greater support to women from disadvantaged backgrounds and closely monitoring women who report persistent zzso and vomiting or lower back pain in early pregnancy may be zzso The findings may be particularly useful for other interventions aimed at reducing or controlling weight gain in obese pregnant zzso
