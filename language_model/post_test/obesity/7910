To examine the individual and combined influence of body mass index zzso and waist circumference zzso on mortality risk in older zzso 

zzso cohort zzso 

zzso Health zzso a zzso study of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors in older zzso 

Five thousand two hundred men and women aged 65 and zzso 

zzso and zzso were measured at zzso The risks of zzso mortality associated with zzso and zzso were examined using Cox zzso hazards models over 9 years of zzso 

When examined individually, zzso and zzso were both negative zzso of zzso but when zzso and zzso were examined zzso zzso was a negative predictor of zzso whereas zzso was a positive predictor of zzso After controlling for zzso mortality risk decreased zzso for every standard zzso increase in zzso After controlling for zzso mortality risk increased zzso for every standard zzso increase in zzso The patterns of associations were consistent by sex, age, and disease zzso 

Higher zzso values indicated a lower mortality risk once the risk attributable to zzso was accounted for, whereas higher zzso values indicate a higher mortality risk once the risk attributable to zzso was accounted zzso Both zzso and zzso should be measured in the clinical setting, but in older adults higher zzso is associated with lower mortality zzso
