zzso is a recently discovered zzso proposed to increase zzso energy expenditure and improve zzso We aimed to comparatively evaluate serum zzso levels in patients with zzso zzso fatty liver disease zzso zzso controls and study their association with disease zzso 

Fifteen and 16 zzso enrolled patients with zzso zzso simple zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and 24 lean and 28 obese controls without zzso were zzso zzso established zzso and zzso tests were zzso 

zzso zzso levels were statistically different in obese controls zzso zzso zzso and patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso and NASH zzso zzso zzso compared with lean controls zzso zzso but were similar among patients with zzso NASH and obese zzso This difference remained significant after adjustment for body mass index (or waist zzso zzso age, insulin resistance zzso by zzso or zzso exercise and time since blood zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso levels were independently from zzso correlated with insulin resistance and zzso zzso zzso zzso tended to be higher in patients with zzso zzso than without zzso zzso zzso portal inflammation and independently associated with the zzso these data need to be confirmed by future zzso 

zzso zzso levels differ between lean controls and obese controls or zzso zzso Despite similar circulating zzso levels between zzso and NASH groups, zzso may be independently and positively associated with the presence of portal zzso Future clinical and zzso studies are needed to confirm and extend these zzso
