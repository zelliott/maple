zzso is an independent risk factor for zzso dysfunction in patients with zzso including diabetic zzso but the mechanism underlying this connection remains zzso zzso is an zzso degradation system that maintains zzso zzso by removing damaged proteins and zzso and zzso zzso is associated with the zzso of zzso zzso We therefore examined the role of zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso cell damage in mice and in human zzso biopsy zzso In zzso mice, overt zzso induced by zzso free fatty zzso overload, led to mild zzso damage and zzso and activated zzso in zzso zzso zzso urinary zzso In contrast, zzso obesity suppressed zzso zzso and exacerbated zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso mice, resulting from an zzso gene zzso subjected to zzso free fatty zzso overload developed severe zzso zzso damage, suggesting that zzso zzso is zzso zzso target of zzso zzso a potent zzso of zzso was activated in zzso zzso of obese mice, and treatment with an zzso inhibitor ameliorated zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, both zzso zzso and zzso suppression were observed in zzso cells of specimens obtained from obese patients with zzso Thus, in addition to enhancing the understanding of zzso cell vulnerability in the zzso these results suggest that restoring the zzso action of zzso in zzso zzso may improve zzso outcomes in obese zzso
