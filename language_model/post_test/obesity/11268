Very few areas in the realm of diagnostic zzso may be so challenging both for the dermatologist and the zzso as are those related to zzso because of their frequent overlapping zzso patterns and uncertain zzso zzso a zzso zzso key has been proposed according the prevalent involvement of subcutaneous zzso or zzso of the zzso presence or absence of zzso and type of vessel involved, but exceptions to this approach do occur and overlapping forms are sometimes zzso zzso zzso have also been traditionally approached according to this zzso and their microscopic diagnosis may be even more complex when the zzso agent is unknown and underrepresented in the zzso Many types of pathogens are capable to evoke zzso clinical manifestations, which range from zzso to zzso zzso For this reason a tissue biopsy is always mandatory to ascertain the type of zzso and differentiate an infectious process from its many other zzso essentially represented by zzso zzso zzso of zzso changes which characterize distinct infections in the zzso often needs a complete clinical history, physical examination and laboratory studies, especially when few zzso if any are zzso This review will be zzso on the zzso of the zzso tissue in relation to immunity and mechanisms of host zzso The most frequent infectious zzso will then be discussed with special reference to their microscopic pictures, to provide clues to their specific diagnosis and the use of zzso and molecular biology techniques as ancillary zzso
