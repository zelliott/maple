The obese zzso rat zzso a number of zzso and zzso abnormalities which are controlled or modulated by the zzso zzso The zzso of these was examined by subjecting zzso month old male, zzso lean and obese zzso rats to various stresses which are known to activate the zzso system, and by chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment to block zzso zzso Both obese and lean zzso treated rats gained only zzso and zzso of the body weight of their respective control rats during the treatment period, while only the lean rats had a significant reduction zzso in food zzso Control obese rats failed to maintain zzso temperature after 4 zzso at 7 degrees C and their relative output of plasma catecholamines zzso to cold stress, as measured from zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso treatment did not alter this zzso temperature response although it was associated with increased baseline zzso levels (at ambient temperature zzso degrees zzso and relative output of CA in the obese rats, suggesting zzso sympathetic neural activity was increased under these zzso No abnormalities of zzso function, as reflected in plasma CA levels, were found in treated or control obese rats zzso for 1 zzso followed by zzso zzso obtained baseline plasma zzso levels were similar in zzso lean and obese rats, but insulin and zzso levels in the obese rat were zzso and zzso of lean values, zzso During sequential zzso the obese rats became markedly zzso and zzso compared to the lean rats, while insulin levels were decreased more in the obese than lean rats zzso versus zzso of controls, zzso zzso affected insulin levels only in the obese rats, reducing their baseline levels by zzso and stressed induced levels to those seen in the lean control zzso These results suggest that some of the zzso and zzso abnormalities of the obese zzso rat which are modulated by the zzso system can be zzso by procedures which increase zzso zzso
