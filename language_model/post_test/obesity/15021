zzso bone zzso and zzso fluid zzso zzso can lead to life-threatening zzso such as meningitis and zzso zzso has been associated with spontaneous zzso zzso We wished to determine if there were differences in the body mass index zzso of patients with spontaneous zzso bone zzso leaks and zzso zzso bone zzso leaks to help determine if obesity may be associated with their zzso 

Single institution retrospective zzso 

zzso and clinical information was obtained from 20 patients treated for surgically confirmed zzso bone zzso leading to zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed on patients with spontaneous and zzso zzso leaks to determine if there were differences in the degree of obesity between these zzso 

zzso bone zzso was spontaneous in 11 patients, related to chronic infection in 4 patients, zzso in 3 patients, zzso in 1 patient, and because of massive zzso in a final zzso The average zzso for patients with spontaneous zzso was zzso zzso The average zzso for patients with zzso zzso was zzso zzso This difference was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso 

Although several previous studies have demonstrated an association of obesity with spontaneous zzso or zzso zzso this study is one of the first to demonstrate a statistically significant increase in zzso for patients with spontaneous zzso and zzso leaks as compared with patients developing them for other zzso This suggests a potential zzso role of obesity in the development of spontaneous zzso and zzso zzso
