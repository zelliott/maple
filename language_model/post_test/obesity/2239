To assess whether zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso has zzso properties in addition to its zzso zzso 

We performed a retrospective analysis of medical records of 110 obese patients with type 2 diabetes zzso treated with zzso for at least 6 months between March 2010 and April 2011 at our zzso care referral zzso The variables analyzed were body mass index, zzso zzso zzso zzso blood pressure zzso plasma zzso protein zzso zzso and serum zzso 

In our overall study zzso we noted a reduction in mean weight from 120 zzso 5 zzso to 115 zzso 3 zzso and a decrease in mean zzso from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso concentration decreased from 173 zzso 19 zzso to 151 zzso 15 zzso the mean zzso was reduced from 132 zzso 6 zzso zzso to 125 zzso 4 zzso zzso and the mean zzso concentration declined from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso after treatment with zzso for a minimal duration of 6 months and a mean duration of zzso months (for all the zzso changes, zzso These variables decreased whether these patients were previously treated with orally administered zzso agents alone or in combination with insulin or zzso 

Our findings in a clinical practice show that zzso is a potent zzso drug, whether given in combination with orally administered agents or insulin or as a substitution for zzso It lowers body weight, zzso levels, zzso and zzso and zzso zzso
