The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between cardiovascular fitness levels and body mass index zzso status among an ethnically diverse sample of zzso 

The zzso sample consisted of California zzso zzso and ninth graders zzso zzso Data presented included a total of zzso youth zzso zzso zzso F zzso zzso from the following ethnic groups: African American zzso American zzso zzso zzso Asian zzso Filipino zzso Hispanic zzso Pacific Islanders zzso and white zzso zzso Performance on the zzso zzso zzso zzso height zzso and weight zzso measures were taken by physical education staff in public schools across zzso Comparisons of zzso were analyzed with zzso multiple linear regression, controlling for height and weight for each age strata for males and zzso zzso Youth were classified as overweight zzso or zzso 95th zzso or at risk for overweight zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso based on zzso specific zzso growth zzso White zzso served as the comparison group for each zzso 

Overall, significant zzso zzso differences were observed between white zzso and their ethnic peers for each zzso strata for zzso For zzso zzso differences among ethnic groups minimized with increasing age, while differences in zzso increased for females with increasing zzso zzso ratios calculated by zzso zzso indicated that for both zzso being Hispanic was associated with the greatest likelihood of being at risk or overweight, whereas being Asian and female was associated with a preventive zzso 

These data suggest 1) disparities in zzso exist among ethnic groups, after controlling for zzso and 2) the variation observed in zzso is similar to those observed for physical zzso
