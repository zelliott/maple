Evidence regarding the association of variation within zzso the gene zzso the zzso zzso 2 zzso with obesity and hypertension is zzso zzso Despite negative reports, functional impacts of individual genetic zzso have been zzso Also, functional zzso as well as zzso combinations affecting expression levels in zzso of zzso zzso and protein as well as zzso sensitivity have been zzso The aim of the present study was therefore to evaluate if variations within zzso as zzso or as zzso combinations zzso an increased prevalence of obesity and hypertension among zzso 

We zzso five zzso required to capture common variation in a region including the zzso locus in a zzso study of zzso zzso middle-aged zzso zzso of the zzso were estimated in zzso The variations were then investigated for their combined association with zzso hypertension and related quantitative zzso The present study did not find consistent evidence for an association of zzso zzso with either obesity or hypertension when variations were zzso in a zzso zzso The same lack of impact was also seen in the quantitative trait zzso apart from nominal differences on zzso ratio and zzso blood pressure between specific zzso zzso 

In a zzso sample of zzso zzso we found no consistent associations between five common zzso which tag the zzso locus and prevalence of obesity or hypertension neither when zzso as individual zzso nor as zzso zzso
