In order to check whether reduced zzso zzso as found in obese subjects depends on insulin resistance, the study tested whether the zzso response to zzso in a group of obese subjects and a group of normal weight subjects differed from that obtained using an zzso zzso such as zzso Nine obese subjects and 6 control subjects were included in the zzso An oral zzso tolerance and zzso tolerance test (75 zzso was performed in all subjects on different zzso Energy expenditure was calculated both in zzso conditions and during the test zzso zzso rate: zzso using indirect zzso expressed per zzso of lean weight, as assessed using zzso measurement zzso Blood samples were collected to zzso zzso and zzso zzso show that increased zzso induced by zzso was significantly reduced in the group of obese subjects compared to zzso In the same group of obese subjects, zzso was found to be significantly higher following zzso in comparison to the zzso response but did not differ from that in zzso Data confirm the existence of reduced zzso in obese subjects induced by zzso The fact that this phenomenon was not recorded in the same subjects following the zzso tolerance test, whose metabolism is zzso supports the hypothesis that reduced zzso zzso in obese subjects may depend on insulin zzso
