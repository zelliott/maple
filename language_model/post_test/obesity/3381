zzso intake of zzso acid zzso zzso has increased dramatically during the 20th century and is associated with greater prevalence of zzso The zzso system is involved in regulation of energy balance and a sustained zzso of the zzso system may contribute to zzso zzso acid zzso zzso is the precursor for zzso and zzso zzso and we sought to determine if low fat diets zzso could be made zzso by increasing the zzso precursor pool of zzso causing excessive zzso signaling leading to weight gain and a zzso profile associated with zzso Mice zzso zzso of zzso were fed zzso zzso and zzso zzso in low fat zzso and medium fat diets zzso zzso for zzso We found that increasing dietary zzso from 1 to zzso in zzso and zzso significantly increased zzso in zzso zzso elevated zzso and zzso in liver, elevated plasma zzso and resulted in larger zzso and more zzso zzso in zzso zzso In zzso dietary zzso of zzso increased feed efficiency and caused greater weight gain than in an zzso reduction to zzso zzso zzso dietary zzso from 1 to zzso zzso liver zzso levels and increases the risk of developing zzso Thus a high dietary content of zzso zzso increases the zzso properties of a low fat zzso
