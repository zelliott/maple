zzso binding protein 4 zzso is an zzso involved in the zzso of insulin resistance in obese adults and zzso Since insulin resistance occurs during zzso independently of zzso a role for zzso in the onset of this phenomenon may be zzso In order to verify our hypothesis, we studied 90 subjects zzso obese and 45 lean zzso A complete physical examination was zzso the zzso body mass index zzso was zzso fat mass was assessed by zzso zzso analysis, and zzso stage was assessed according to zzso zzso insulin and serum zzso levels were zzso zzso and lean children differed for zzso zzso fat mass, zzso model assessment of insulin resistance zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed a direct correlation with zzso in the total zzso When the subjects were divided in lean and obese, this correlation was evident only in obese zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not in lean subjects zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both in obese and lean zzso values were higher in zzso subjects than in zzso zzso while serum zzso levels were similar in zzso and in zzso subjects zzso We conclude that zzso is correlated with zzso and insulin resistance in obese children, but it is not involved in the insulin resistance occurring during zzso
