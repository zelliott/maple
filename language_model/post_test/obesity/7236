To examine the effect of zzso frequency on weight change and body zzso 

zzso study based on findings from a zzso zzso controlled zzso weight loss zzso Data collected at baseline and 6 zzso 

Metropolitan community-based zzso 

zzso obese zzso Mean age zzso years, zzso percent white, and zzso zzso Mean body mass index at baseline was zzso zzso 

Change in weight and body zzso 

General linear model zzso was used to assess the effect of zzso on outcomes of zzso zzso significance was set at alpha level zzso Treatment group and baseline values of dependent variables included as zzso in all zzso 

Participants who increased their frequency of zzso over the zzso period demonstrated significantly better weight loss outcomes than those who maintained or decreased their frequency of zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso F zzso zzso P zzso zzso There were no significant associations between zzso frequency and body satisfaction at 6 months zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

These findings support frequent zzso for weight zzso There appears to be little or no effect of zzso on body zzso Future research should replicate these findings across a larger, more diverse population of overweight zzso
