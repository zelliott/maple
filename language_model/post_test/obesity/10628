Little evidence exists concerning the effects of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso under energy zzso Thus, the effects of this zzso zzso on zzso tissue size, liver zzso as well as on expression and activity of zzso zzso I zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso fed an zzso diet were zzso 

zzso were fed a high-fat diet for 7 zzso and then subjected to zzso zzso diets supplemented with zzso zzso acid or zzso zzso zzso for 3 zzso zzso insulin, zzso and zzso fatty acid levels, liver zzso protein and water zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso expressions and zzso activities were zzso 

Energy restriction reduced liver size, serum levels of insulin, zzso and zzso fatty acid and increased zzso zzso Liver composition was not zzso No differences were found between both restricted groups, with the exception of zzso and zzso zzso zzso activities, which were greater in zzso fed the zzso zzso 

Energy restriction does not cause zzso zzso to induce liver zzso Although this zzso zzso increases liver zzso and zzso activities, this effect does not result in reduced zzso zzso content or decreased zzso tissue zzso zzso this zzso zzso seems not to be a useful tool for inclusion in body weight loss strategies followed during obesity zzso
