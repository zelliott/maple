zzso zzso is a common disease zzso therapy for the treatment of zzso arthritis zzso Prior research suggests that zzso may reduce the risk of diabetes zzso in patients with zzso To investigate the mechanism of this effect, we examined the effect of zzso on insulin resistance, insulin sensitivity, and pancreatic zzso zzso of insulin in zzso obese zzso 

We recruited 13 obese, zzso subjects without systemic inflammatory conditions for an zzso zzso study of zzso zzso zzso per zzso per day for six zzso zzso underwent an oral zzso tolerance test at three time zzso 0 weeks zzso with zzso 6 weeks (at the end of the zzso zzso and 12 weeks (6 weeks post zzso The zzso zzso zzso Index zzso zzso and zzso were compared across zzso 

The mean age of the cohort was 49 years, zzso females and median body mass index was zzso zzso After 6 weeks of zzso therapy, zzso increased from a median zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso and zzso decreased from a median of zzso zzso to zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso All these variables returned toward baseline at week zzso 

zzso use for 6 weeks in non diabetic obese subjects was associated with a significant increase in zzso and trends toward reduced insulin resistance and insulin zzso These data suggest that zzso a common medication used to treat zzso possesses beneficial effects upon insulin zzso Further study of the insulin zzso effects of zzso in patients with zzso is zzso
