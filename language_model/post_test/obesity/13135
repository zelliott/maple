There is significant evidence that altered zzso activity plays a role in seasonal affective disorder zzso The current study examined three separate genetic hypotheses for zzso related to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso a zzso associated with decreased affinity for zzso We examined the possible contribution of zzso to the overall expression of zzso attention deficit disorder zzso zzso and body weight zzso As part of an ongoing genetic study of increased eating behavior and mood in female subjects, 108 women with winter zzso and zzso zzso gain were administered the zzso zzso zzso to measure childhood zzso symptomatology, and a questionnaire to assess zzso lifetime body mass index zzso To test for an association between zzso and the zzso diagnosis of zzso the transmission zzso test zzso was used in a zzso of zzso providing familial zzso Standard zzso tests were used to compare childhood zzso symptoms and zzso lifetime zzso across the two zzso groups defined by the presence or absence of zzso The zzso found no initial evidence for an association between zzso and the zzso diagnosis of zzso However, zzso carriers reported significantly greater inattention and dysphoria in childhood zzso and zzso zzso and a higher zzso lifetime zzso zzso than did zzso without this zzso Furthermore, excluding zzso with extreme obesity zzso zzso a strong correlation was found linking childhood inattentive symptoms and zzso lifetime zzso zzso zzso In zzso women with zzso the zzso zzso of zzso may be associated with a unique zzso trajectory characterized by zzso deficits and dysphoria in childhood and mild to moderate obesity in zzso This zzso course may reflect different manifestations of the same underlying vulnerability related to central zzso zzso Given the possibility of population zzso when studying zzso zzso future use of zzso controls and replication of our findings in other zzso and/or zzso populations are needed to confirm these initial zzso
