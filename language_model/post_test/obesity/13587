The association between plasma zzso level and blood pressure remains zzso Because obese subjects may have different mechanisms to regulate blood pressure, we hypothesized that obesity may be an important zzso In order to minimize zzso effects from unidentified factors, a zzso design was employed to explore the zzso 

A total of zzso subjects from zzso Chinese or Japanese families with a mean age of zzso zzso zzso years were included (the zzso zzso Pacific Program in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Blood pressure was recorded automatically and the average of the last two out of three consecutive readings was used in the zzso A subject with zzso was defined as one with a zzso blood pressure zzso or zzso zzso zzso or a zzso blood pressure zzso or zzso zzso zzso or who was already on medication for zzso zzso was defined as having a body mass index zzso or zzso zzso The updated zzso model assessment was used for calculating the zzso of insulin sensitivity zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso was determined using zzso 

zzso with hypertension had significantly lower plasma zzso levels than those without hypertension zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso Plasma zzso level correlated zzso with hypertension after adjusting for age, sex, and zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso In subjects without hypertension zzso zzso zzso the plasma zzso level correlated zzso with zzso in those who were obese, after adjustment for age, sex, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The association was not significant in those without zzso 

Plasma zzso level zzso zzso with zzso In subjects without hypertension, the relationship between plasma zzso level and zzso depends on the presence of zzso
