zzso obesity caused by zzso during pregnancy increases zzso to zzso risks in adulthood, such as zzso insulin resistance, and type 2 zzso however, whether and how it affects the cognitive system associated with the brain remains zzso Here, we report that pregnant obesity induced by exposure to excessive high fatty or highly palatable food specifically impaired reversal learning, a kind of zzso behavior, while leaving serum zzso metrics intact in the offspring of rats, suggesting a much earlier functional and structural defects possibly occurred in the central nervous system than in the zzso system in the offspring born in zzso zzso nutritional zzso zzso we found that above mentioned cognitive zzso might be associated with significant zzso zzso including impaired zzso zzso and disrupted zzso signaling in the adult zzso These collective data add a novel perspective of understanding the adverse zzso zzso in central nervous system induced by zzso programming and the related molecular mechanism through which zzso of risk for zzso disorders may occur during early zzso
