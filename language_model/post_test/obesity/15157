zzso zzso is implicated in the zzso of zzso fatty liver disease zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso to zzso and liver damage progression in NASH and chronic zzso C zzso by still undefined mechanisms, possibly involving regulation of zzso tissue zzso zzso of this study was to evaluate whether the zzso zzso zzso influences serum zzso in liver diseases and healthy zzso 

To this end, we considered 144 consecutive Italian patients with zzso 261 with zzso 35 severely obese subjects, and zzso healthy controls with very low probability of zzso all with complete clinical and genetic zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were evaluated by zzso zzso serum zzso by zzso zzso zzso levels were evaluated by quantitative real-time zzso in the visceral zzso tissue zzso of 35 obese subjects undergoing zzso zzso 

zzso levels were independently associated with the risk of zzso and with the zzso severity of the zzso zzso levels decreased with the number of zzso zzso zzso at risk of NASH both in patients with zzso zzso and in healthy subjects zzso At zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso were associated with low zzso levels zzso median zzso independently of zzso diagnosis, age, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for each zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was associated with decreased zzso zzso levels in the zzso of obese patients zzso even in the absence of zzso In contrast, in zzso characterized by zzso resistance, low zzso was associated with male gender and zzso but not with zzso and zzso zzso and viral zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso levels in patients with zzso and in healthy subjects, but in the presence of zzso resistance not in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso may represent a genetic zzso of serum zzso zzso zzso of serum zzso might be involved in zzso the zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso in carriers of the zzso zzso zzso without zzso with potential therapeutic zzso
