As many patients with zzso arthritis zzso have increased fat mass zzso and increased frequency of cardiovascular diseases we evaluated if total physical activity zzso had impact on body composition and cardiovascular risk factors in women with zzso 

zzso zzso zzso women, zzso zzso years, answered a self-administered zzso to estimate total daily physical activity during the previous zzso Physical activity level was given as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Diet content was assessed by a food frequency questionnaire and body composition by zzso zzso X-ray zzso Blood lipids and zzso against zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso percent of the women had zzso 25, zzso were centrally obese and zzso had zzso zzso The median zzso total physical activity was zzso zzso zzso the same activity level as healthy Swedish women in the same zzso Total physical activity did not significantly correlate with disease activity, zzso or zzso Disease activity, zzso and zzso did not differ between those in the lowest zzso of total physical activity and those in the highest zzso However, the women in the lowest zzso of physical activity had lower HDL zzso zzso zzso zzso A1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso natural zzso zzso zzso zzso and higher levels of insulin zzso zzso zzso and higher frequency of insulin resistance than those in the highest zzso Women in the lowest zzso consumed larger quantities of saturated fatty acids than those in the highest zzso zzso zzso zzso which was associated with high oxidized zzso zzso zzso 

This cross zzso study demonstrated that zzso women with fairly low disease activity, good functional capacity, high zzso and high frequency of central obesity had the same total physical activity level as healthy Swedish women in the same zzso The amount of total physical activity was not associated with functional capacity or body zzso However, low total physical activity was associated with zzso insulin resistance, low levels of zzso zzso and consumption of saturated fatty zzso which is of interest in the context of increased frequency of cardiovascular disease in zzso
