To determine the time course of changes in insulin action and zzso that occur early during the development of zzso we studied children before the onset of zzso The reason for choosing the zzso stage of development is that it is metabolically characterized by both a high sensitivity to insulin and low zzso zzso insulin zzso Fifteen obese zzso (8 zzso female, age 10 zzso zzso years, body mass index zzso 31 zzso zzso zzso zzso Stage I) with a duration of obesity of less than 5 years and 10 non-obese zzso (6 zzso female, age 10 zzso zzso years, zzso 18 zzso zzso zzso matched for gender were zzso In a zzso analysis, we compared responses in obese zzso with those in obese adolescents and obese adults with a longer duration of zzso The zzso zzso clamp with zzso zzso zzso and indirect zzso were used to zzso insulin action and the zzso clamp used to assess zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso measured at two zzso levels of zzso zzso 180 and zzso zzso was reduced by 20 and zzso in all three groups of obese compared to non-obese subjects zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso metabolism were observed in all three groups of obese subjects at the higher insulin infusion zzso The ability of insulin to inhibit zzso zzso was impaired in all three obese groups at both levels of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso insulin levels during the zzso clamp mirrored the reductions in zzso zzso during the insulin clamp in all obese zzso These results indicate that insulin resistance and zzso co-exist in zzso children with moderate to severe zzso
