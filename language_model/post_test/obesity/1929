In the present study the effect of long-term zzso (6 zzso on obese zzso gene expression was examined in nine severely obese females of 34 zzso 3 years and with a body mass index of zzso zzso zzso zzso Six days of zzso induced a significant weight loss zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin infusion rate zzso zzso per zzso was markedly reduced following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso P zzso zzso zzso concentration in fat zzso from abdominal subcutaneous zzso tissue was unchanged after 6 days of zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso arbitrary units, not zzso whereas serum zzso levels decreased significantly from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during the same zzso No significant correlations were found between zzso zzso zzso and serum zzso zzso either prior to the fast or after the zzso zzso zzso levels were unchanged by zzso for 3 h during the clamp prior to the fast, while zzso for 3 h after 6 days of zzso increased serum zzso by zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, 6 days of zzso reduced serum zzso by about zzso In contrast, zzso zzso in abdominal subcutaneous zzso tissue was zzso Furthermore, after 6 days of zzso insulin was able to increase the serum level of zzso significantly, indicating that the effect of insulin on the level of zzso is dependent on the nutritional zzso
