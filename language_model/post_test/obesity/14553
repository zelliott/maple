zzso has classically been a wasting zzso However, in the United States, obesity is increasingly common among zzso individuals receiving effective zzso zzso The risks of obesity are unclear in zzso although the increased prevalence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in the presence or absence of obesity causes growing zzso This study aimed to assess the effects of weight loss (through energy restriction combined with zzso and resistance zzso on body zzso body fat distribution, resting energy zzso quality of life zzso strength and zzso and zzso risk factors in obese, zzso zzso zzso zzso women with a body mass index of 30 or more completed a zzso weight loss zzso Before and after the intervention, body composition and fat distribution by dual energy zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging, resting energy expenditure by indirect zzso zzso strength, and fitness were zzso zzso sensitivity by intravenous zzso tolerance test and circulating cardiovascular risk factors (including zzso tissue zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor 1) were measured in a subset zzso zzso zzso Daily food intake and total body weight decreased zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso 477 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Weight lost was zzso fat by dual energy zzso zzso or zzso L of subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso L visceral zzso zzso and zzso L skeletal muscle by magnetic resonance zzso zzso energy expenditure fell approximately zzso zzso strength and fitness increased by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, and zzso improved in 11 of 13 zzso There was significant insulin resistance in the subset with zzso zzso at zzso and at follow-up there was no improvement in zzso zzso insulin, or insulin sensitivity, nor was there any change in zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso or zzso zzso inhibitor zzso There was no significant change in zzso count or zzso viral zzso In conclusion, moderate weight loss achieved by a short-term program of diet and exercise in obese zzso women appears safe and zzso loss of zzso in both the subcutaneous zzso tissue and visceral zzso tissue zzso Despite reduced food zzso weight and fat loss, as well as improvements in strength, zzso and zzso the lack of improvement in zzso parameters suggests that additional interventions may be necessary to reduce the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in this zzso
