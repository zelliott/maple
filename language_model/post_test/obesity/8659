Increased plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are characteristic for subjects with insulin resistance and could contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk in this zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of zzso a zzso of the nuclear zzso zzso zzso activated zzso on zzso expression and zzso in human zzso 

We used two models: in zzso differentiated subcutaneous and zzso zzso cultured under zzso conditions and isolated subcutaneous and zzso fat cells kept in suspension zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was measured by zzso zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso 

Exposure of in zzso differentiated subcutaneous zzso from young zzso females to 1 zzso zzso for 72 h caused a reduction of both zzso zzso (by 29 zzso zzso p zzso and zzso zzso expression (by 26 zzso zzso p zzso In cultures from severely obese subjects, zzso induced a decrease of zzso zzso zzso from newly differentiated zzso zzso by 49 zzso zzso zzso zzso and from subcutaneous zzso by 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso Exposure of freshly isolated subcutaneous and zzso zzso in suspension culture to zzso induced a similar reduction of zzso concentration in the culture medium (by 35 zzso zzso p zzso and 33 zzso zzso p zzso compared with control, zzso 

This study provides evidence that zzso reduces zzso production in human zzso probably at the zzso zzso This observation could point to a new beneficial effect of zzso particularly in obese subjects, which could be associated with a reduced cardiovascular zzso
