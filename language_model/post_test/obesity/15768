The aim of the present study was to assess the plasma fatty acid composition of the total plasma lipids and zzso zzso in obese zzso children with and without zzso syndrome zzso Thirty-four obese zzso children were zzso 17 who met zzso criteria and 17 who did not; and zzso zzso children of normal zzso zzso zzso insulin resistance (by zzso model assessment zzso and plasma zzso (by zzso were zzso zzso of zzso zzso was performed by liquid zzso and the concentration of fatty acids in total plasma lipids and zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in total plasma lipids zzso zzso and of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly higher in obese zzso versus zzso zzso Increased risk of zzso was positively associated with plasma concentration of zzso and zzso associated with proportion of zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso OR zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso were associated with zzso (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso with zzso (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso In conclusion, increased zzso of zzso and decreased proportions of zzso and zzso in plasma lipids appear to be early markers of zzso in children at zzso zzso
