Changes in zzso zzso in pregnant diabetic women are potential zzso of increased zzso of the zzso The aim of this study was to characterize diabetes zzso changes in genes for zzso energy metabolism in relation to fetal zzso 

zzso of women with type 1 diabetes zzso zzso diabetes zzso zzso or no complications were analyzed by zzso zzso The pattern of gene expression was assessed in primary zzso cell zzso 

Diabetes zzso was associated with 49 zzso in gene expression at key steps in zzso energy zzso with zzso of the zzso related to zzso pathways and zzso of the zzso related to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes was observed in pregnancy with zzso Type 1 diabetes zzso induced fewer zzso modifications but an enhancement of zzso and zzso zzso zzso enhanced expression of genes for fatty acid zzso and the formation of zzso droplets 3 times as much as zzso in cultured zzso zzso 

These results point to fatty acids as preferential zzso zzso for zzso cells and suggest that genes for zzso zzso metabolism are enhanced selectively in zzso The recruited genes may be instrumental in increasing zzso zzso zzso and the delivery of zzso zzso for fetal zzso
