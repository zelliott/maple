The purpose of this study was to assess differences in measures of zzso zzso zzso clearance between obese men with abdominal fat patterning zzso and men of desirable weight zzso It was hypothesized that the zzso men would have impaired zzso zzso zzso 

A comparative design was zzso 

Data were collected in a research laboratory with access to blood analysis zzso 

Fourteen healthy, physically active, zzso men (7 zzso and 7 zzso were zzso 

Each subject consumed an oral fat load (78 grams of zzso and blood samples were collected every hour for 8 zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso zzso incremental zzso area, total zzso area, time to peak zzso zzso zzso change in zzso zzso and time to return to baseline zzso zzso 

zzso men had significantly greater total area under the zzso curve zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso hours, p zzso zzso and greater maximum zzso change zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso following the oral fat zzso Additionally, the total area under the zzso curve was positively correlated with baseline zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso correlated with baseline zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso correlated with time to return to zzso baseline zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso profiles and regular physical activity do not zzso zzso men from having pronounced zzso zzso
