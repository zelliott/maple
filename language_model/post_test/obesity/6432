To analyze the heart rate zzso in patients with mild to moderate systemic zzso zzso 

zzso healthy zzso I) and 70 systemic zzso zzso zzso zzso individuals, divided according to age (40 to 59 and 60 to 80 years old, zzso and with a similar distribution by sex were zzso Thirty-one had left zzso zzso zzso 22 were overweight, and 16 had Type II diabetes zzso zzso alcohol zzso and sedentary habits were the same between zzso zzso in heart rate was analyzed in the time domain, using standard zzso of normal zzso intervals zzso and the differences between zzso zzso and zzso zzso during sustained zzso Analysis of the frequency band of the power spectrum between zzso and zzso zzso at rest and during controlled zzso was chosen for analysis of the frequency zzso 

In both time and frequency zzso variables were lower in group II than in group zzso Within groups, statistically significant variables were only found for individuals in the 40 to 59 year old zzso The presence of zzso overweight, or diabetes zzso did not influence the zzso in heart rate to a significant zzso 

zzso in heart rate was a valuable instrument for analyzing zzso zzso of the heart in zzso zzso The zzso system zzso significant losses in zzso capacity, more evident in subjects between 40 and 59 years zzso In those over 60 years old, reduced zzso in heart rate imposed by aging was not significantly influenced by the presence of systemic zzso zzso
