The human gut harbors a vast ensemble of bacteria that has zzso with the human host and performs several important functions that affect our physiology and zzso The human gut is sterile at birth and is subsequently zzso with bacteria from the mother and the zzso The complexity of the gut zzso is increased during childhood, and adult humans contain zzso more bacterial genes than human zzso Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technology and zzso testing in zzso mice have identified the gut zzso as an environmental factor that contributes to zzso zzso mice are protected against developing zzso obesity and the underlying mechanisms zzso the gut zzso contributes to host metabolism are beginning to be zzso The obese zzso is associated with increased microbial zzso and energy zzso however, other zzso modulated mechanisms contribute to disease progression as zzso The gut zzso has profound effects on host gene expression in the zzso system, including genes involved in immunity and zzso For example, the gut zzso affects expression of zzso proteins in the gut, which zzso zzso metabolism in peripheral zzso In addition, the gut zzso is also a source of zzso molecules that augment zzso inflammation and zzso recruitment by signaling through the innate immune zzso zzso zzso zzso are integral parts of the innate immune system and are expressed by both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso dramatically zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso in the gut may alter the gut microbial composition that may have profound effects on host zzso zzso zzso the gut zzso or its function, in early life may have beneficial effects on host metabolism later in zzso
