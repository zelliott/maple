zzso data indicate that the human zzso is zzso Today's adult is greater in zzso body mass and fat zzso zzso measurement of body composition is necessary to maintain surveillance of obesity within the population and to evaluate associated zzso The aim of the present study was to construct and validate zzso equations for percentage body fat zzso prediction from zzso in zzso adult men and zzso zzso values for zzso were obtained using zzso X-ray zzso zzso thickness zzso at ten sites and zzso zzso at seven sites were measured on zzso men and women aged zzso years zzso zzso zzso zzso was employed to construct prediction equations from age and zzso zzso and G zzso These equations were then zzso on a cohort of 400 subjects of similar age and zzso The following zzso equations were found to most accurately predict zzso zzso (age zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso error of the zzso zzso zzso limits of zzso - zzso + zzso zzso (age zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso error of the zzso zzso zzso limits of zzso - zzso + zzso These zzso zzso equations accurately predict zzso and are suitable for the measurement of zzso in adult men and women of varying levels of zzso across the zzso
