zzso zzso zzso beta cell zzso has been implicated in the zzso zzso of zzso diabetes zzso These zzso effects may be zzso by zzso oxide zzso Since zzso fatty acids zzso like zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso and enhance NO generation in zzso it seemed possible that zzso might be protected from zzso damage by lowering their zzso zzso We found that zzso NO production varied directly and zzso cell viability zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of obese rats were most vulnerable to zzso while moderately zzso zzso of zzso normal rats were less vulnerable than those of zzso normal zzso zzso zzso zzso of rats made chronically zzso by zzso zzso gene transfer resisted zzso zzso even at 300 zzso the zzso zzso zzso lowered zzso zzso in cultured zzso from both normal rats and obese, zzso rats and reduced NO production and enhanced cell zzso We conclude that measures that lower zzso zzso content protect against zzso NO production and zzso zzso or zzso could provide in zzso protection against zzso diabetes zzso
