zzso therapy zzso increases the risk of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and stroke is higher in older, overweight, and obese women using zzso However, the impact of age and obesity on zzso zzso among zzso users is not well zzso 

We measured serum levels of zzso total and free zzso and zzso in 180 zzso women participating in the zzso in the Prevention of zzso Trial zzso 91 receiving zzso therapy zzso and 89 taking zzso every 6 months over 2 zzso Mean zzso levels of zzso and zzso were compared across age, body mass index zzso and waist to hip ratio categories among zzso users and zzso zzso 

Among the zzso users, total zzso zzso zzso and free zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly directly associated with zzso adjusted for zzso zzso was zzso related to waist to hip ratio adjusted for age zzso zzso zzso Age was not associated with any of the zzso or zzso zzso in zzso or zzso zzso zzso was positively associated with zzso zzso among older but not younger zzso users zzso for interaction zzso zzso 

zzso and obese women using zzso attain greater zzso of zzso compared to women with normal zzso whereas zzso users with abdominal obesity attain lower zzso zzso zzso older women using zzso have the highest concentration of zzso It may be useful to consider age and obesity when prescribing zzso to minimize the risk of zzso zzso or stroke in zzso zzso Further research regarding relationships among circulating hormone levels and risk for these conditions is required to substantiate this zzso
