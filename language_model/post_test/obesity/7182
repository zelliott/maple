zzso tissue inflammation has recently been linked to the zzso of obesity and insulin zzso C1 complex zzso three distinct zzso zzso zzso and zzso involves the key initial zzso of the classic zzso of complement and plays an important role in the initiation of inflammatory zzso In this study, we investigated zzso expression and regulation of C1 complement zzso and C1 zzso regulator zzso in obesity and insulin zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso tissue was increased consistently in zzso mice, zzso obese rats, and high zzso obese zzso zzso zzso was found to increase in expression in zzso obese rats and zzso mice but decrease in zzso zzso After zzso administration, zzso and zzso expression was reversed in zzso obese rats and zzso zzso Increased expression of C1 complement and zzso was observed in both primary zzso and zzso vascular cells isolated from zzso obese zzso zzso of zzso and zzso expression was also perceived in zzso cells from zzso zzso Furthermore, expression of C1 complement and zzso is zzso in zzso insulin resistance in zzso zzso and cultured rat zzso cells as they become insulin resistant after zzso zzso These data suggests that both zzso and immune cells are the sources for abnormal zzso tissue production of C1 complement and zzso in zzso Our findings also demonstrate that excessive zzso of the classic zzso of complement commonly occurs in zzso suggesting its possible role in zzso tissue inflammation and insulin zzso
