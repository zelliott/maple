The use of animal models in diabetes research requires reliable tests for evaluation of insulin sensitivity and zzso zzso zzso are being increasingly used in zzso research, and the aim of this study was to compare different tests and indexes for evaluation of insulin sensitivity and zzso function in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso intravenous zzso and oral zzso tolerance tests zzso and a modified insulin tolerance test were performed in zzso fed either low- or zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso parameters was zzso Previously described insulin sensitivity indexes zzso zzso infusion zzso zzso concentration from clamp zzso oral zzso insulin sensitivity zzso and zzso from zzso zzso from minimal model analysis of zzso and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index from zzso zzso were calculated together with an insulin sensitivity index from the modified insulin tolerance test zzso and a new simple index zzso derived from the first 30 zzso of the zzso zzso function was assessed from the zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso parameters was calculated as median zzso zzso of variation zzso correlated significantly only with zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso and the two indexes from zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso No correlation was found between zzso function indexes from zzso and zzso The median zzso of the new zzso index was zzso In conclusion, the new simple index of insulin sensitivity, zzso was revealed to be useful for evaluation of insulin sensitivity in zzso
