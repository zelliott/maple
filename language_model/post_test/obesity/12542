zzso increases plasma zzso activity and zzso II levels, leading to vascular damage, elevated blood pressure, diabetes zzso and zzso zzso Because genetic deletion of crucial parts of the zzso system protect against zzso cardiovascular zzso we hypothesized that zzso zzso zzso rats, a model of chronically low plasma zzso activity and zzso II levels, would be protected against vascular defects during zzso obesity compared with zzso zzso rats showing normal zzso system zzso We evaluated vascular function in middle cerebral arteries of SS or zzso rats fed high-fat zzso zzso from zzso versus zzso diet for 15 to 20 weeks from zzso zzso relaxation in response to zzso zzso to zzso zzso was restored in middle cerebral arteries of high-fat SS rats versus zzso diet controls, whereas zzso to zzso was dramatically reduced in high-fat SS zzso rats versus zzso diet zzso These findings support the hypothesis that zzso levels of zzso II play an important role in maintaining normal vascular relaxation in cerebral arteries and suggest that the cerebral zzso of the SS rat model is genetically protected against zzso dysfunction in zzso zzso
