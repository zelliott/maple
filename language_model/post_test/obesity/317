The use of activity monitors zzso zzso to estimate total energy expenditure in zzso is dependent on the zzso of resting energy expenditure zzso However, the zzso estimated by activity monitors has not been validated against more precise techniques, such as indirect zzso zzso zzso the objective of the present study was to compare zzso estimated by the zzso activity monitor zzso to that measured by zzso and standard prediction equations of zzso Fifty healthy adults between 18 and 43 years of age were measured for weight and percentage of body fat using a digital scale and zzso zzso The zzso estimated by the zzso was only 129 zzso higher, but not statistically different zzso than the zzso measured with zzso Using multiple linear regression, there was a positive relationship for men, but not for women, between fat mass zzso and percentage of body fat and the difference in zzso estimated by the zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso in the cohort zzso the use of an activity monitor to estimate zzso is valid when compared to zzso but not to a standard prediction equation of zzso
