To delineate the hormonal mechanism of zzso changes in sodium balance, the role of insulin and zzso in zzso of fast was evaluated in obese subjects submitted to a total zzso and given either zzso or zzso infusion on day 4 of zzso While large amounts of zzso (1 zzso over 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sodium losses, the zzso lower amounts of zzso induced an increase in zzso zzso body and sodium zzso without any significant change in zzso It was concluded, therefore, that elevated plasma zzso level may enhance zzso sodium loss in zzso states, through a direct zzso effect reducing zzso zzso body zzso hence increased zzso and zzso It appears nevertheless that decreased insulin zzso rather than an increase in plasma zzso level must be considered as a key hormonal factor responsible for zzso attending zzso Indeed, the zzso reduction in plasma zzso and insulin levels, resulting from zzso infusion on day 4 of fast, was followed by significant increase in zzso The latter observation supports several previous studies indicating that insulin stimulates sodium zzso by the kidney and that the reduction in insulin zzso may induce an increase in zzso sodium zzso It was concluded, therefore, that not only sodium intake but also the zzso content of the diet should be reduced in an attempt to induce a negative sodium balance and to correct hypertension in obese zzso
