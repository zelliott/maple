zzso with obesity and abdominal zzso are at higher risk for zzso insulin resistance, and zzso This study was therefore designed to investigate the relationship of obesity with zzso stress and the role of abdominal zzso on obesity induced zzso stress, and further to explore the possible mechanism of obesity associated zzso zzso 

A total of 150 subjects zzso men and 30 zzso aged zzso years of both zzso were zzso Body Mass Index and zzso zzso were taken as a measure of generalized obesity and abdominal zzso The zzso tests done included zzso blood zzso zzso zzso profile zzso serum zzso (as a zzso of zzso zzso and serum zzso 

The concentration of serum zzso zzso increased with increasing levels of zzso (as per the zzso zzso which was found to be zzso statistically in overweight subjects while obese zzso and zzso subjects exhibited a statistically significant zzso zzso higher level of serum zzso as compared to zzso zzso Furthermore, according to the present study groups, on comparison with zzso subjects zzso obese subjects with abdominal zzso zzso had statistically significant zzso zzso higher serum concentration of zzso while a zzso difference was observed in obese subjects without abdominal zzso zzso Even within the subset of obese subjects, a statistically significant zzso zzso difference was zzso suggesting the role of abdominal zzso Karl zzso zzso of correlation revealed a statistically significant negative correlation of zzso with zzso zzso zzso - zzso p zzso 

zzso subjects exhibit increased systemic zzso stress, which is enhanced when obesity is associated with abdominal zzso and, moreover, increased zzso stress is associated with zzso zzso
