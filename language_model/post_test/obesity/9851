The aim of this study was to determine the effect of maternal obesity and zzso diabetes zzso zzso on zzso the circulating zzso of zzso in zzso and maternal zzso and zzso gene expression and release of zzso from human zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were measured in maternal and zzso plasma from 62 normal zzso tolerant women zzso and 69 women with zzso at the time of term zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso tissue expression and release of zzso was measured from 22 zzso and 22 zzso zzso 

There was no effect of maternal obesity or zzso on maternal zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly higher in zzso plasma from women with maternal zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso women zzso correlated with the zzso of maternal insulin zzso There was no effect of zzso on maternal and zzso zzso zzso and on the release of zzso from zzso and zzso zzso 

At the time of term zzso section, zzso maternal zzso and its associated insulin resistance, is associated with higher zzso plasma zzso zzso
