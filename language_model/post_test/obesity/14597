zzso presents a risk factor for zzso complications in zzso tissue breast zzso In this study, an animal model was developed to examine this zzso zzso zzso based on a superficial inferior zzso zzso were elevated in an experimental group of obese zzso zzso rats zzso zzso zzso mean weight, 413 zzso and in their lean zzso zzso zzso 9; mean weight, 276 zzso zzso tissue was harvested from a subset of both groups for baseline zzso including zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were then evaluated for survival by zzso at 4 and 7 days zzso zzso survival 7 days zzso was reduced in obese zzso zzso zzso versus lean zzso zzso zzso rats zzso zzso At zzso zzso tissue of obese animals had decreased zzso content relative to lean counterparts zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso whereas zzso zzso was higher in obese zzso tissue versus zzso zzso viability of obese zzso may be attributable to decreased baseline energy stores due to zzso zzso zzso by zzso This study is the first to introduce a promising animal model for examining the effect of obesity on increased zzso complications in breast reconstruction using zzso zzso
