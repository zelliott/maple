zzso has been used in traditional zzso medicine for treating zzso Based on the recipe of traditional zzso formula zzso we have developed zzso which has been in phase 2 clinical zzso To study the mechanisms by which zzso ameliorates diabetes, we examined whether treatment with zzso improves zzso zzso and obesity in type 2 diabetic zzso mice and whether this is associated with an improvement of zzso differentiation and insulin zzso 

zzso zzso zzso or distilled water was administered to zzso diabetic zzso and zzso zzso mice for 8 zzso zzso resistance index, body weight and levels of serum blood zzso zzso insulin and zzso were zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in skeletal muscle and liver zzso were determined with real-time zzso and western zzso The zzso expressions of insulin zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in skeletal muscle and liver zzso were determined with real-time zzso zzso of liver has been zzso 

Treatment of zzso for 8 weeks ameliorated zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso also zzso expression of zzso in liver zzso However, it had no effect on regulation of expression of zzso in muscle zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with the in zzso results, zzso study demonstrated that zzso alleviated zzso changes of the liver induced by high-fat zzso 

These results first indicate that zzso can be beneficial for reducing zzso zzso and obesity through its potency of regulating zzso differentiation and insulin zzso
