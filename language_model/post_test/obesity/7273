zzso evidence suggests a zzso association between zzso stress and type 2 diabetes zzso zzso zzso stress, as measured by oxidized LDL zzso has been correlated with visceral zzso We examined the relationship between zzso and zzso and zzso traits in a zzso sample of zzso subjects at baseline and after 7 years of zzso 

We examined six zzso traits zzso status, zzso zzso zzso insulin, zzso and zzso as well as six zzso traits zzso status, zzso zzso % body fat, visceral and subcutaneous fat zzso using zzso and linear zzso zzso 

In all subjects at zzso zzso was positively associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (all p zzso The strength and magnitude of these associations did not differ much between blacks and zzso In both blacks and zzso zzso was also associated with obesity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and three of its related traits zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for % body fat, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for visceral zzso all p zzso Furthermore, of four traits measured after 7 years of follow-up zzso zzso zzso zzso and % zzso their relationship with zzso was similar to baseline zzso No significant association was found between zzso and incident zzso Interestingly, zzso was significantly associated with % change in zzso and zzso traits in whites but not in zzso 

Our data suggest that systemic zzso stress may be a novel risk factor for zzso and zzso
