zzso liver is common in zzso obese individuals and in lean people who consume alcohol zzso Although fatty liver is typically benign, a subset of individuals with zzso develop zzso and eventually zzso The disparate outcomes of fatty liver suggest that it reflects a generally zzso zzso response to obesity or alcohol-related stress, but may also increase zzso vulnerability to other zzso Thus, both protective factors zzso zzso and zzso and factors that promote zzso death by zzso zzso zzso or necrosis zzso zzso may be increased in fatty zzso To evaluate this possibility, zzso zzso zzso and the expression of factors that regulate cellular viability were assessed in two models of fatty liver zzso genetically obese zzso mice and ethanol zzso lean zzso zzso in mice with fatty zzso were compared with lean, control mice that did not have zzso zzso zzso showed striking induction of zzso proteins that promote zzso zzso and inhibit zzso zzso and zzso zzso in both groups with fatty zzso Both models of fatty liver also increased zzso transcripts for zzso a zzso zzso zzso and the protein itself was induced in zzso zzso Despite the zzso of factors that threaten cell zzso zzso death was not increased in either zzso or zzso mice, confirming that the zzso protective responses were sufficient under the conditions zzso However, if zzso induction reduces the efficiency of zzso zzso zzso zzso this initially harmless response might enhance the vulnerability of zzso to zzso
