zzso results have emerged over the nature of zzso nervous system abnormalities in human zzso This present study was designed to investigate the zzso activities and their responsiveness to acute cold exposure in zzso and zzso obese and non-obese young zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and non-obese young women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Plasma zzso insulin, zzso and zzso zzso were measured at zzso The sympathetic zzso and zzso zzso nervous system activities were assessed by means of power spectral analysis of heart rate zzso zzso for 15 zzso under control zzso degrees zzso or acute cold exposure (10 degrees zzso zzso The very low zzso frequency zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso power) indexes were used to evaluate zzso sympathetic function, and cardiac sympathetic and zzso nervous activities, zzso 

Plasma zzso concentration was significantly greater in the obese than in the control group zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso There was a highly positive correlation between plasma zzso concentration and percent of body fat zzso zzso zzso P zzso During the resting condition, there was no significant difference in any of the parameters of the zzso between the obese and control zzso Upon acute cold exposure, the zzso frequency component associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso as well as its responsiveness zzso degrees C delta zzso 17 zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso were significantly lower in the obese than in the control zzso 

Our data indicate that a reduced zzso especially sympathetic responsiveness associated with zzso and possibly zzso resistance might be zzso factors of obesity in young zzso
