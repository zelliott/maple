zzso hormone zzso has been proposed as a clinical predictor of improvements in zzso function following weight loss in overweight and obese women with zzso zzso syndrome zzso This study aimed to assess whether baseline and/or change in zzso levels with weight loss predict improvements in zzso function in overweight and obese women with zzso 

zzso overweight and obese women with zzso and zzso impairment (age zzso zzso zzso years, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso followed a zzso weight loss zzso zzso weight, zzso zzso and zzso function were assessed at baseline and zzso 

Participants who responded with improvements in zzso function zzso zzso 26) had lower baseline zzso levels zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and experienced greater weight loss zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso compared with those who did not respond zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that weight loss and baseline zzso were independently related to improvements in zzso function zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso zzso levels did not change with weight loss in both zzso and zzso 

In overweight and obese women with zzso and zzso dysfunction, a zzso weight loss intervention resulted in improvements in zzso function but no change in zzso zzso
