Development of zzso intolerance in genetically obese zzso rats was zzso Comparisons were made with lean zzso control zzso zzso zzso tolerance tests were performed in zzso weeks, zzso weeks, zzso weeks and zzso weeks old zzso zzso of age, the obese rats showed impaired zzso tolerance and insulin sensitivity compared with zzso lean zzso While in zzso rats only minor changes of zzso insulin zzso and zzso tolerance were observed with progression of age, zzso intolerance in obese animals became more pronounced with zzso zzso rats older than zzso weeks showed no further progression of zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso increased with aging, but zzso zzso was zzso zzso we conclude that zzso intolerance and insulin resistance in genetically obese zzso rats is almost completely developed with approximately 12 zzso
