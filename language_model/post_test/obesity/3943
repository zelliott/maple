zzso HD patients zzso zzso mean age: zzso zzso zzso years, mean HD zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were divided into three groups according to body mass index zzso normal weight zzso zzso zzso overweight zzso zzso zzso obese zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso parameters and zzso composition using zzso and zzso zzso were compared between three zzso 

zzso zzso patients were zzso 40 zzso were zzso and 28 zzso were zzso Average mean zzso thickness zzso zzso zzso zzso circumference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso were all significantly greater in the zzso group than in the zzso zzso Compared to the zzso patients, the zzso group had significantly higher serum levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso total cholesterol zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but significantly lower serum zzso zzso zzso zzso and blood zzso nitrogen zzso zzso zzso The zzso group also had significantly higher white blood cell count zzso zzso zzso and serum zzso zzso zzso zzso than the zzso zzso 

The results suggest that zzso zzso composition is correlated with body mass zzso In addition, obesity is associated with elevated zzso and white blood cell count and lower serum zzso level in HD zzso
