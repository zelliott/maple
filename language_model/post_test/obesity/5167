The zzso responses to electrical nerve zzso zzso or zzso additions were studied using continuous monitoring of zzso zzso state by zzso zzso of zzso brown zzso zzso from control and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The responses to these stimuli were all greatly decreased already 3 days after zzso zzso indicating a reduced cell capacity to zzso free fatty zzso zzso of zzso brown zzso tissue composition 4-5 weeks after zzso zzso showed a decrease of both DNA concentration and total content, indicating some tissue zzso It is concluded that the involvement of the zzso zzso in the zzso of brown zzso tissue provided a possible anatomical clue concerning pathways connecting zzso and weight zzso
