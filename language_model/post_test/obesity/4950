The aim of the study was to describe serum zzso levels in a zzso sample of women with different degrees of zzso tolerance and to examine if the zzso in serum zzso was explained by family history of diabetes, zzso insulin resistance, zzso and zzso zzso oral zzso tolerance tests were used in a screening procedure of a cohort of zzso women to identify those with diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso and impaired zzso tolerance zzso zzso zzso A random sample of women with normal zzso tolerance zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso The examination included history of first-degree relatives with diabetes, zzso measurement of circulating zzso zzso acid zzso zzso blood zzso zzso insulin, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso model zzso zzso zzso concentration was lowest among diabetic women, highest in the zzso zzso group, and intermediate in the impaired zzso tolerance zzso This difference was partly explained by zzso model assessment, zzso family history, and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso P zzso but obesity and zzso did not contribute to this zzso in serum zzso A family history of diabetes was associated with low serum zzso concentration independently of zzso zzso or insulin sensitivity zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso diabetic women zzso zzso 17) had similar serum zzso as the zzso group in spite of zzso In conclusion, serum zzso was lowered in women with type 2 diabetes zzso and this difference could only be partly explained by insulin resistance, insulin zzso family history of diabetes, and zzso Family history of diabetes was independently associated with zzso zzso diabetic women did not have low zzso zzso
