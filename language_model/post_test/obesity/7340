The role that the components of energy expenditure play in the zzso of childhood obesity has highlighted the need for greater accuracy and standardized protocols for the measurement of resting energy expenditure zzso However, protocols used to assess zzso in children are zzso and consensus on a suitable method for measuring zzso in children has not been zzso This study was undertaken to determine the effect of measurement time and measurement device zzso or zzso on zzso in healthy zzso 

Following a 12-hour fast and zzso from exercise, 23 children zzso zzso zzso completed two zzso zzso one with a face mask and the other with a zzso Energy expenditure was measured continuously via indirect zzso while device zzso was assessed using a 6-point comfort rating zzso 

zzso measures zzso indicated that there was no significant difference in zzso when measured after 10, 15, 20, or 25 minutes of rest compared to 30 minutes for either the mask or zzso zzso range, zzso zzso zzso of the percentage zzso of zzso zzso zzso in energy expenditure for each time period by device showed that the least variation existed after 20 minutes of measurement using the mask zzso zzso zzso zzso test analysis indicated significantly less discomfort when wearing the mask compared to the zzso 

It would appear that a 20-minute protocol using a mask may increase compliance and prove to be a more practical protocol for measuring zzso in zzso
