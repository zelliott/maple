There are substantial variations in cardiovascular disease zzso risk and outcomes among zzso We sought to determine geographic variation in risk factor prevalence in a contemporary sample of zzso zzso 

Using zzso Sister to Sister zzso free heart screening data from 17 zzso cities, we compared rates of obesity zzso mass index zzso hypertension zzso zzso zzso low zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso and zzso zzso with national zzso 

In zzso women zzso age zzso years, 37% black, zzso white, zzso zzso compared to overall zzso rates, significantly higher rates were observed for obesity in Baltimore zzso Atlanta zzso Dallas zzso and Jacksonville zzso for zzso in Atlanta zzso Baltimore zzso and New York zzso for zzso in Jacksonville zzso Philadelphia zzso and Tampa zzso and for zzso zzso in Phoenix zzso Dallas zzso and Jacksonville zzso Compared to national American Heart Association zzso 2010 update rates, most zzso cities had higher rates of zzso and low zzso 

In a large, community-based sample of women nationwide, this comprehensive analysis shows remarkable geographic variation in risk factors, which provides opportunities to improve and reduce a woman's zzso zzso Further investigation is required to understand the reasons behind such variation, which will provide insight toward tailoring preventive interventions to narrow gaps in zzso risk reduction in zzso
