This study tested the hypothesis that 12 weeks of air board exercise would enhance zzso fitness and vascular compliance and reduce % body fat in obese Korean zzso 

Twenty-two obese boys zzso body zzso were zzso They were divided into 2 zzso an zzso exercise group zzso which trained 3 zzso 50 zzso for 12 weeks, and a control group zzso Control subjects only performed activities involved in their physical education zzso Body zzso cardiovascular fitness (20 m zzso endurance test zzso and vascular compliance were assessed before and after the completion of exercise zzso 

The % changes in body fat zzso zzso zzso fat mass zzso zzso zzso and performance on the cardiovascular fitness test zzso zzso zzso were greater in the exercise group than in the controls Compared to controls, % increases in vascular compliance were greater in the arms and legs of the exercise group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso left zzso zzso zzso zzso right zzso zzso zzso zzso right zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso suggest that exercise training can reduce % body fat and enhance vascular compliance in obese male zzso changes that may reduce the risk for later development of cardiovascular zzso
