The zzso and zzso effects of a physical activity zzso and a mildly zzso low-fat diet zzso follow-up program after a long-term dietary restriction were studied in 12 men and 8 zzso 

The dietary restriction zzso 700 zzso was accompanied by a zzso zzso zzso or zzso treatment for 15 weeks, whereas the mean duration of the zzso follow-up was 18 zzso 

The long-term dietary restriction reduced body weight zzso and zzso zzso zzso fat mass zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso resting zzso rate zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in men and women, zzso A decrease in zzso mass zzso was also observed in women zzso zzso zzso The zzso follow-up preserved weight stability at a reduced body weight and caused an additional significant decrease in zzso for men zzso zzso zzso This part of the intervention also caused an increase in daily zzso for men zzso zzso zzso to the point where this value no longer differed from the zzso restriction zzso In contrast, zzso was further reduced in women zzso zzso to the point where it significantly differed from initial values zzso zzso seated heart rate was reduced by the zzso follow-up in men leading it to differ significantly from both zzso and zzso restriction values zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

In conclusion, these results suggest that a zzso follow-up has the potential to permit body weight stability and may even accentuate fat loss in the zzso zzso Moreover, resting energy expenditure is increased under such conditions in zzso These stimulating effects seem to be specific to energy metabolism since seated heart rate was either further reduced or remained stable in response to the zzso zzso
