zzso has been related to a chronic zzso state affecting white zzso tissue zzso which has a great impact on zzso zzso and energy zzso In turn, the zzso of zzso zzso derived from the zzso of excess lipids in zzso further contributes to the development of insulin resistance and can be associated with zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to determine whether sexual zzso found in the systemic insulin sensitivity profile is related to sex differences in a high-fat diet zzso response of zzso zzso at zzso function and inflammatory profile zzso zzso rats (10 weeks old) of both sexes were fed a control zzso diet (3 % zzso zzso zzso 8 for each zzso or a zzso (24 % zzso zzso zzso 8 for each zzso zzso insulin sensitivity zzso zzso expression levels of inflammatory factors and the protein content of insulin and zzso zzso pathways were zzso as well as the levels of the main markers of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the present study, the zzso depot exhibits a greater zzso capacity, along with a lower hypoxic and zzso state, without signs of zzso dysfunction or changes in its zzso In contrast, zzso fat has a much more pronounced zzso hypoxic and zzso profile accompanied by changes in zzso zzso probably associated with zzso zzso zzso Thus, this explains the worse serum insulin sensitivity profile of male zzso
