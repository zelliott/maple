The effect of zzso on the expression of zzso hormone zzso was investigated in lean and genetically obese zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso infused using zzso zzso The treatment period extended to 7 days and the daily dose of zzso delivered was 100 zzso of body zzso In zzso zzso was used to assess the effects of zzso infusion on the expression of zzso zzso zzso levels in the brain zzso and the remaining zzso zzso and zzso were measured by zzso coupled to zzso of selected tissue zzso zzso significantly reduced final body weight, weight of brown zzso zzso daily food intake in obese mice but not in lean zzso In obese mice, zzso led to a rapid reduction in food intake which reached statistical significance after only 24 h and which led to a significant reduction in the body weight after 3 days of zzso zzso restored the normal circulating levels of zzso and insulin in obese zzso The present results mainly provide evidence for a stimulating effect of zzso infusion on the zzso zzso zzso The zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso were higher in mice treated with zzso than in mice infused with zzso zzso The stimulation of zzso zzso appeared particularly intense in obese mice, in which the effects of zzso infusion led to the reduction in zzso content of zzso fibers and zzso zzso did not affect zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the light of the acknowledged zzso effects of zzso the results of this study questioned the direct role of zzso in the action of zzso on energy zzso The increase in zzso expression following zzso could occur as a mechanism to compensate the decrease in energy deposition led to by zzso It may also indicate that zzso mediates the zzso actions of zzso indirectly or else that zzso influences actions of zzso other than those related to the regulation of energy zzso
