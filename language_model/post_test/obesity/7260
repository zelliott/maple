Previously, the zzso zzso within the promoter of the zzso zzso gene was reported to be associated with overweight and zzso the factors significantly associated to increased zzso cancer zzso zzso has been described to play an important role in signal zzso in zzso cancer cells indicating that zzso promotes zzso cancer growth and zzso and implicating the zzso and zzso pathways as critical zzso of zzso zzso The aim of the study was to investigate the possible associations of zzso zzso zzso with zzso cancer and its related zzso 

Using zzso with following restriction analysis, we studied 67 zzso cancer cases zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso that were enrolled in the study along with 67 controls matched for age, zzso and ethnic origin zzso age zzso zzso zzso an additional cohort of zzso healthy individual was recruited to investigate the general population zzso 

The present study revealed no significant differences between the zzso or zzso of investigated zzso for zzso cancer risk or its related traits (age of zzso menopause, number of spontaneous abortions in personal history or waiting time till the onset of the disease) among the groups, thus indicating that the genetic zzso of zzso zzso is not a relevant marker of zzso cancer risk in this Czech zzso 

To zzso the zzso zzso zzso doesn't seem to represent a major genetic marker for zzso cancer in the studied Czech population; however, it was associated with zzso which finding is in accordance with previous zzso
