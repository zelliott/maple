zzso for treating overweight and obesity have been suggested by the World Health Organization and other expert zzso We asked whether most men and women targeted in obesity guidelines would already be included in existing clinical recommendations for the prevention of coronary heart disease zzso or whether a new group of patients would be added to current zzso 

In 1997 the Norwegian National Health zzso Service examined zzso risk factors in subjects aged zzso y living in three zzso We studied zzso men and zzso women who did not report treatment for diabetes, hypertension or the presence of cardiovascular zzso zzso 10 y risk of zzso was calculated using the zzso zzso 

The prevalence of single risk factors zzso blood zzso or zzso zzso zzso blood zzso or zzso zzso total cholesterol zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso ranged between 0 and zzso among subjects with body mass zzso or zzso zzso Adding low HDL cholesterol zzso zzso for men, zzso zzso for zzso and 10 y risk zzso risk to the classical risk factors increased prevalence to zzso (one or more risk factors or 10 y zzso or zzso zzso and zzso of using body mass index zzso or zzso and waist circumference as a screen for elevated zzso risk ranged between 22 and zzso zzso for 10 y zzso risk zzso or zzso or one or more risk factors among men and screening for one or more risk factors among women gave positive zzso values of zzso however, the positive zzso value of screening for 10 y zzso risk zzso or zzso was only zzso among zzso Compared with men with zzso zzso or waist circumference zzso zzso those with zzso equal to or above these levels had statistically significantly higher adjusted odds ratios of elevated zzso risk zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these associations were not observed among zzso 

Using zzso and waist circumference to screen for zzso risk yields low positive prediction values, thus doubling the number of men and adding even more to the number of women seen by the practitioner for prevention of zzso
