The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between visceral zzso tissue zzso estimated with the zzso index obtained from zzso X-ray zzso zzso with zzso risk factors before and after a weight loss program and compare it with zzso measured with zzso zzso zzso zzso The study population for this analysis included 92 zzso overweight and obese sedentary zzso women zzso zzso zzso zzso years, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso participating in a weight loss intervention that consisted of a caloric restricted diet with and without resistance training zzso We measured zzso zzso using CT zzso zzso body composition zzso zzso from which the zzso index was zzso zzso zzso risk factors such as insulin sensitivity zzso the zzso clamp zzso peak oxygen consumption, blood pressure, plasma zzso zzso protein as well as zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels for both methods significantly decreased after the weight loss zzso Furthermore, no differences in zzso levels between both methods were observed before zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the weight loss zzso In addition, the percent change in zzso levels after the weight loss intervention was similar between both methods zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, similar relationships were observed between both measures of zzso with zzso risk factors before and after the weight loss zzso Finally, results from the zzso zzso analysis consistently showed that fat mass and lean body mass were independent zzso of zzso and zzso levels for both methods in our zzso In conclusion, estimated visceral fat levels using the zzso index may be able to trace variations of zzso after weight zzso This index also shows comparable relationships with zzso risk factors when compared to zzso measured using CT zzso
