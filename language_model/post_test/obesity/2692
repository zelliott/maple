The increase in zzso levels in obese patients with zzso zzso and its zzso expression in zzso tissue of obese animals are one of the most interesting consequences of zzso zzso Thus, part of zzso zzso effects could be related to an enhancement of zzso zzso and its consequence on the zzso of insulin action, as well as energy zzso The present study investigated the effects of zzso in zzso knockout mice zzso exposed to zzso obesity zzso zzso zzso male mice and their zzso zzso controls zzso were fed a high-fat diet for 7 zzso During the last month, animals were administered daily either with vehicle or zzso by mouth (10 zzso zzso feeding induced weight gain by about zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso was associated with zzso and insulin zzso Treatment with zzso led to a significant and similar decrease in body weight in both zzso and zzso mice compared with zzso zzso In addition, zzso significantly improved insulin sensitivity in zzso mice compared with zzso zzso mice by decreasing zzso zzso production and increasing zzso zzso index in both visceral and subcutaneous zzso zzso In contrast, zzso failed to improve insulin sensitivity in zzso mice, despite the loss in body zzso zzso effect on body weight appeared independent of the zzso pathway, whereas zzso seems required to mediate zzso improvement of insulin sensitivity in zzso
