zzso and zzso growth factor I zzso have been implicated in zzso zzso zzso zzso is closely related to zzso and zzso with its zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso has been shown to inhibit the binding of zzso to its zzso The authors evaluated the role of insulin in the regulation of serum levels of zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso disease zzso zzso zzso levels during an oral zzso tolerance test zzso were measured in 15 zzso (8 obese and 7 zzso patients and in 10 healthy control zzso The zzso level of zzso zzso was decreased in zzso zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso standard zzso zzso zzso zzso and obese zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso less than zzso as compared with healthy controls zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso patients and normal controls demonstrated a significant decrease in zzso zzso following zzso An zzso decrease in zzso zzso may allow an increased pool of zzso able to bind to its zzso This would provide a mechanism for increased zzso zzso production via zzso stimulation of its zzso
