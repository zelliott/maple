Several reports have shown that obesity is associated with increased risk of zzso failure after radical zzso However, limited information is available regarding the impact of obesity on prostate cancer progression after zzso The current study sought to determine whether obesity was an independent predictor of zzso failure zzso and clinical recurrence zzso among patients treated with zzso zzso zzso 

A retrospective analysis was performed on 873 patients receiving zzso as the sole treatment for localized prostate cancer between 1988 and zzso The zzso method, zzso test, and Cox zzso hazards analyses were zzso 

Of the 873 patients, zzso were mildly obese and zzso were moderately to severely zzso zzso was related to younger age at diagnosis zzso zzso more recent year of diagnosis zzso zzso zzso and race zzso zzso zzso with African-American men having the highest obesity zzso During a mean follow-up of 96 months, 295 patients experienced zzso and zzso had zzso On zzso analysis, controlling for clinical and treatment zzso increased body mass index zzso significantly predicted zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso with a positive trend by zzso category zzso zzso zzso Similar results were found when the outcome was zzso zzso remained an independent predictor of progression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a statistically significant trend by increased zzso category zzso zzso zzso 

The current findings validate the important role of zzso not only on zzso but also on zzso and suggest a link to the zzso basis of tumor progression that can be zzso zzso
