zzso was initially described as a zzso factor for zzso zzso More recently, the protein has also been reported to be an zzso regulating zzso differentiation in zzso via its zzso zzso and to be correlated with zzso and other parameters of the zzso syndrome in zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the zzso axis in the regulation of metabolism in zzso using a mouse knockout zzso model for zzso zzso in a zzso genetic zzso Body weight and zzso tissue mass did not differ significantly in young animals, but were significantly higher in zzso zzso mice aged above 12 zzso zzso tolerance was zzso No significant modifications in the levels of blood lipids were observed and no increase in the levels of inflammatory markers was observed in the zzso tissue of zzso zzso A high-fat diet did not exacerbate the obese zzso in zzso zzso zzso No obvious zzso in zzso differentiation was zzso while a marker of zzso activity zzso zzso was found to be zzso In conclusion, the zzso system does not appear to play a major role in zzso differentiation in zzso but it may be involved in zzso tissue zzso
