zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is one of two known zzso zzso that catalyze the final step in zzso zzso zzso zzso mice are resistant to zzso obesity through a mechanism involving increased energy zzso Here we show that these mice have decreased levels of tissue zzso as well as increased sensitivity to insulin and to zzso zzso zzso zzso protects against insulin resistance and obesity in zzso yellow mice, a model of severe zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso did not affect energy and zzso metabolism in zzso zzso mice, possibly due in part to a zzso zzso of zzso expression in the absence of zzso Our results suggest that zzso of zzso may be useful in treating insulin resistance and zzso resistance in human zzso
