zzso fatty liver disease zzso is closely associated with abdominal zzso zzso hypertension, and Type 2 diabetes, which are all features of the zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to zzso whether zzso is associated with carotid zzso 

The study population comprised zzso subjects without zzso B and C infections and who did not consume zzso zzso zzso of liver were detected by abdominal zzso and zzso thickness zzso and plaque prevalence were estimated by carotid zzso 

The mean values of zzso and zzso pressures, body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, total cholesterol, zzso high density zzso zzso cholesterol, zzso zzso zzso insulin, zzso model of assessment zzso index, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso differed significantly between patients with zzso zzso and normal controls zzso The carotid zzso was zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso and zzso zzso in normal controls zzso The prevalence of carotid plaques was higher in patients with zzso zzso than in normal controls zzso zzso This association persisted significantly after adjusting for age, sex, zzso zzso index and individual factors of zzso syndrome by multiple zzso zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso are at a high risk of carotid zzso regardless of zzso syndrome and classical cardiovascular risk zzso zzso the detection of zzso should alert to the existence of an increased cardiovascular zzso Moreover, zzso might be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular zzso
