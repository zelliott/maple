This review zzso the feasibility of using zzso index zzso as a predictor of zzso hunger and zzso by surveying published human intervention zzso We also discuss the relationship between zzso and two zzso control hormones, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso food increased hunger and lowered zzso in short-term human intervention zzso This effect may be attributed to the rapid decline in blood zzso level following a zzso response caused by a sharp and transient increase in blood zzso level that occurs after the zzso of zzso food, which is defined as the zzso zzso However, zzso hunger and zzso after the zzso of foods with varying zzso were inconsistent among long-term human intervention zzso From the few relevant long-term studies available, we selected two recent zzso examples for analysis, but they failed to elicit clear differences in zzso and zzso responses between zzso and zzso meals zzso of a combination of different foods or key zzso foods incorporated into habitual zzso One of the reasons that these studies could not predict zzso response to mixed meals is presumably that the zzso of each particular food was not reflected in that of the mixed meals as a zzso Thus, it is difficult to conclude that the zzso values of foods or mixed meals are a valid long-term predictor for zzso hunger and zzso Both insulin and zzso zzso zzso and metabolism in zzso tissue affect blood zzso concentration and its zzso zzso zzso zzso level is suppressed by zzso meals, presumably via zzso and zzso zzso zzso foods may not necessarily increase zzso or suppress appetite and/or hunger because of the lack of zzso zzso stimulation and zzso zzso However, zzso zzso stimulation and zzso suppression per zzso is not consistent among zzso thus we were not able to identify a clear relationship among zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
