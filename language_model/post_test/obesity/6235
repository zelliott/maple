In order to evaluate the effectiveness of a gastric implant in an animal model of dietary zzso silicone implants zzso zzso were inserted into the zzso of male rats maintained on a zzso or zzso zzso At the time of zzso the cafeteria fed rats weighed zzso more than zzso fed zzso zzso cafeteria fed animals lost weight in response to the gastric zzso whereas control zzso fed animals did zzso Both implant groups had significant increases in stomach weights in contrast to sham implant groups, but the increase was much less in the cafeteria diet zzso The zzso plasma levels of the gastrointestinal hormones, zzso and pancreatic zzso and zzso (a marker of zzso zzso zzso were measured by zzso zzso fed sham or implanted animals had significantly higher zzso levels of plasma zzso and zzso and significantly lower plasma levels of pancreatic zzso than the zzso fed zzso These studies demonstrate that the gastric implant has more effect on weight in overweight animals on a palatable mixed diet, perhaps related to both mechanical and neural zzso
