zzso in patients with zzso fatty liver disease zzso is due to an imbalance between zzso zzso zzso production and zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate zzso metabolism in zzso tissue and liver in zzso 

zzso acid, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were assessed by using stable isotope zzso in 14 zzso obese subjects with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 14 zzso obese subjects with normal zzso content zzso zzso zzso zzso matched on age, sex, body mass index, and percent body zzso 

Compared with the normal zzso group, the zzso group had greater rates of zzso release from zzso tissue into plasma zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso rates were not different between zzso The increase in zzso zzso was primarily due to an increased contribution from zzso fatty zzso presumably derived from zzso of zzso and zzso fat and de zzso zzso zzso zzso rate increased zzso with increasing zzso content in subjects with normal zzso but reached a plateau when zzso content zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso 

zzso persons with zzso have marked zzso in both zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acids derived from zzso sources are responsible for the increase in zzso zzso However, the increase in zzso zzso export is not adequate to zzso zzso zzso
