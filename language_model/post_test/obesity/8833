Increased zzso is a zzso risk factor for zzso knee zzso zzso however, the contributions of the components of body zzso body fat distribution, and height to this association are not zzso 

We examined zzso zzso or zzso 45 years of age from the Johnston County zzso zzso Body composition was assessed using zzso and zzso was defined as zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso models examined the association between zzso and the fourth compared with the first zzso of zzso body zzso and fat distribution measures adjusting for age, ethnicity, and prior knee zzso 

The adjusted odds ratios and zzso confidence zzso of zzso and weight were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In separate models, higher odds of zzso were also found for fat mass zzso zzso zzso percent fat mass zzso zzso zzso lean mass zzso zzso zzso and waist circumference zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio was not associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and percent lean mass was associated with lower odds zzso zzso zzso Taller women had higher odds of zzso after adjustment for zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This study confirms that zzso and weight are strongly associated with zzso in women and suggests that precise zzso of body composition and measures of fat distribution may offer no advantage over the more simple measures of zzso or weight in assessment of risk of zzso
