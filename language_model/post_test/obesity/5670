The separate independent statistical contribution of abdominal distribution of fat, zzso and muscle zzso to zzso intolerance and zzso was zzso in 88 obese zzso In zzso analyses the zzso circumference ratio zzso body fat and lean body mass were all positively zzso and zzso levels were zzso associated with insulin and zzso zzso Muscle zzso areas were positively correlated with insulin but not with zzso zzso Adjustment for other variables did not remove the positive association between zzso and zzso insulin and zzso zzso zzso free testosterone and type zzso zzso areas were, however, significant zzso factors in the relationship between zzso and summed insulin and zzso zzso We conclude that fat distribution in obese women is associated with zzso zzso and zzso independently of zzso and muscle zzso zzso but that reduced zzso zzso and increased type zzso zzso areas may partly explain increased zzso and insulin responses to an oral zzso load in zzso obese zzso
