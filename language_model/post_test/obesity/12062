zzso zzso zzso zzso activity during the progression of late-stage type 2 diabetes was measured in zzso zzso zzso fatty zzso zzso Compared with zzso rats subjected to zzso food zzso zzso zzso rats exhibited spontaneous zzso zzso insulin resistance, zzso zzso and increased plasma zzso activity during the early phase of the experiment (up to zzso zzso zzso their plasma zzso activity as well as their body weight, body fat, and plasma insulin concentration declined to control levels during the late phase, resulting in excessive zzso zzso zzso pancreatic zzso zzso zzso and diabetes, which changed from zzso diabetes to zzso diabetes secondary to progressive zzso zzso and their zzso blood zzso level remained zzso Since plasma zzso activity demonstrated significant positive correlations with body weight and the zzso plasma insulin level but not with the zzso blood zzso level during the late stage of diabetes, body fat and zzso plasma insulin levels may be useful factors for predicting the control of plasma zzso zzso In contrast, pancreatic zzso activity was significantly increased, and the expression of pancreatic insulin was significantly reduced in late-stage diabetic zzso rats, suggesting that a relationship exists between the zzso of pancreatic zzso and insulin depletion in pancreatic zzso zzso In conclusion, it is suggested that plasma zzso activity changes in accordance with the progression of zzso obesity and pancreatic zzso zzso zzso activity may play an important role in insulin zzso
