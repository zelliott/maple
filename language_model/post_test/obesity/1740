Human biologists are increasingly engaging with current global trends toward zzso However, little is considered about how variation in cultural views of zzso might shape the biology of zzso such as through pathways related to socially induced zzso Recent research indicates elevated levels of explicit zzso in middle income nations, suggesting potentially high levels of zzso stress around zzso zzso We use the case of zzso to test if high levels of explicit prejudice around zzso zzso also suggest zzso of those ideas in ways that might predict stress zzso 

Using a sample of women in zzso (N zzso zzso we test if the statement of zzso beliefs on standard scales zzso with similarly strong level of cognitive bias against fat based on an implicit association zzso We confirm reasonable zzso of the findings to prior published studies by collecting data for zzso undergraduates (N zzso zzso using the same set of zzso 

Women in zzso reveal high levels of explicit zzso bias in an interview on a standard zzso to zzso zzso scale, suggesting a shared cultural norm of zzso However, zzso women display, on average, no zzso zzso in cognitive zzso 

In contrast to what has been observed in zzso nations, the high levels of explicit zzso does not necessarily correlate with high levels of implicit zzso This means that pathways between zzso zzso stress, and health outcomes may be very different across zzso zzso
