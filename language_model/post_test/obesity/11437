We assessed the impact of an exercise and diet program for two weeks in a specialized institute and six weeks at home on body composition and exercise metabolism in obese zzso 

Fourteen obese adolescents took part in the two-week training course and seven continued exercise and diet at zzso The zzso crossover point and the zzso fat zzso point zzso zzso were determined before and after the program, using indirect zzso zzso exercise training at zzso max was programmed over the two zzso 

At the end of the two-week program, all adolescents showed a decrease in weight zzso Only the seven subjects who continued exercise training at home showed improved exercise fat use zzso crossover point of zzso zzso 3 zzso and zzso max of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The teenagers who had performed this targeted regular training for two months exhibit an increase in their ability to zzso lipids at zzso This increase is no longer found in those treated by diet zzso The efficiency of this targeted training protocol based on zzso for the treatment of teenager obesity will require longer studies on greater samples of zzso
