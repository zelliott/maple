zzso and its receptors are zzso related to the degree of obesity and have been identified as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of zzso In this study, we evaluated the effect of zzso delivery of zzso and/or its zzso 2 zzso genes on controlling the development of obesity and insulin resistance in zzso mice fed a high-fat zzso An increase in zzso and zzso gene expression by zzso gene delivery prevented zzso weight gain, reduced fat zzso in liver and zzso zzso and improved insulin zzso zzso effects were seen with reduced zzso in the liver and zzso in the liver, white zzso tissue and skeletal zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated zzso of zzso and zzso significantly suppressed zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso effects were zzso by zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso These results prove that zzso of zzso and/or zzso expression via gene transfer is an effective approach in managing obesity zzso
