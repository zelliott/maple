Previously, our group has reported a suggestive linkage evidence of zzso with body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso The tumor necrosis factor zzso 2 zzso at zzso is an excellent zzso and functional candidate gene for zzso In this study, we have investigated the linkage and association between the zzso gene and obesity zzso in two large independent samples, using the quantitative transmission zzso tests zzso The first group was made up of zzso individuals from 79 zzso zzso The second group was a randomly zzso set of 636 individuals from 157 US Caucasian nuclear zzso zzso zzso tested include zzso fat mass, and percentage fat mass zzso A significant result zzso zzso zzso was observed for linkage with zzso in the sample of the zzso zzso Our data support the zzso gene as a quantitative trait locus zzso underlying zzso variation in the Caucasian zzso
