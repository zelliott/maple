We conducted a zzso zzso study to evaluate the possible involvement of zzso and zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso syndrome zzso 

zzso zzso patients and 40 zzso women matched for zzso and degree of obesity were zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels, anthropometrical and hormonal zzso the 45 zzso and 276 zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were reduced in zzso patients compared with controls zzso zzso zzso irrespective of the degree of zzso whereas serum zzso levels were increased in overweight and obese women compared with lean subjects zzso zzso zzso irrespective of their zzso or controls zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were not associated with zzso and did not influence serum levels of zzso zzso and other clinical and hormonal zzso In a multiple zzso model, the zzso ratio, free testosterone levels and age, but not insulin resistance, were the major zzso of zzso 

zzso patients present with zzso in relation with abdominal zzso and zzso Our present results suggest that zzso and abdominal zzso by reducing the serum levels of the insulin zzso zzso zzso might contribute to the insulin resistance of zzso
