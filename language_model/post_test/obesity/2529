This study was designed to investigate the effects of prolonged zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso on zzso zzso and the potential molecular mechanisms involved in these processes in white zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso were incubated with zzso zzso zzso for 15 zzso Also, zzso zzso were isolated 15 h after zzso was injected zzso zzso zzso body zzso in zzso zzso were zzso for various zzso zzso and for determination of gene expression and protein zzso zzso in zzso plasma zzso zzso were zzso zzso treatment significantly increased zzso zzso inhibited zzso and increased zzso zzso This was accompanied by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was first zzso but then increased, both in zzso and in zzso with prolonged zzso zzso Exposure to zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso content and zzso release, despite zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we provide evidence that prolonged zzso zzso zzso can zzso zzso metabolism by zzso pathways that favor energy dissipation versus zzso storage in zzso Additionally, we show novel zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso on zzso which involves zzso zzso of zzso and zzso
