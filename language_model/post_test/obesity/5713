The zzso male zzso when zzso for the zzso gene zzso is zzso and prone to zzso Both male and female zzso rats have markedly elevated serum levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, zzso cultures of zzso were prepared from male and female, zzso and lean, zzso There was a marked zzso of all very low density zzso zzso zzso and zzso components from zzso zzso The increased zzso most likely accounts for the increased levels of zzso lipids and zzso previously observed in zzso In contrast, there was no difference between the zzso and lean zzso in their zzso of high density zzso zzso lipids and zzso The difference in zzso zzso between the lean and zzso cells was sustained even when the cells were cultured for 24, 48, and 72 h prior to the experiment, by which time the hormonal differences between the zzso and lean animals would have been largely zzso The magnitude of the difference in zzso zzso did not diminish with increasing time in zzso The zzso basis responsible for the zzso of zzso has not yet been zzso However, preliminary results suggest that there is an inherent difference in zzso metabolism in the two types of zzso
