The aim of this study was to evaluate cardiovascular zzso function in a zzso obesity model induced by zzso zzso injections during the first seven days of zzso 

The animals were assigned to control zzso zzso zzso 10) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso weeks after birth, zzso and zzso zzso were implanted for zzso pressure zzso drug administration, and blood zzso zzso sensitivity was evaluated according to the zzso and zzso responses induced by sodium zzso and zzso infusion, zzso zzso and zzso effects were determined by administering zzso and zzso 

Body weight, Lee index, and zzso white zzso tissue values were higher in the zzso zzso group in comparison to the control zzso The zzso zzso rats displayed insulin resistance, as shown by a reduced zzso index zzso an increased area under the curve of total insulin zzso during zzso overload zzso and zzso zzso The mean zzso pressure values were higher in the zzso zzso rats, whereas heart rate zzso zzso zzso zzso responses zzso zzso and zzso zzso and sympathetic effects zzso were reduced as compared to the control zzso 

Our results suggest that obesity induced by zzso zzso zzso treatment zzso cardiac zzso function and most likely contributes to increased zzso pressure and insulin zzso
