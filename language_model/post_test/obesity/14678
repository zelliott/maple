zzso between body weight and disease are not zzso Central obesity appears to be a relatively greater cardiovascular risk factor than generalized zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate body mass index zzso and waist circumference and the association of obesity distribution with blood zzso levels zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

The study cohort consisted of zzso zzso women enrolled in the Women's zzso zzso zzso zzso undergoing zzso for evaluation of suspected zzso 

Both zzso and waist circumference were positively associated with all three blood zzso levels zzso zzso with the highest zzso levels found in the obese women with large zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso analyses confirmed significant associations of zzso and waist circumference with the zzso zzso 

These results demonstrate differing relationships between blood zzso levels and obesity distribution in a cohort of zzso women with chest pain undergoing coronary zzso The differing levels by general and central obesity may help explain in part observed zzso relationships between obesity and zzso
