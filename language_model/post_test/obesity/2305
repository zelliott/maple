zzso studies show breaking up prolonged sitting has beneficial associations with zzso risk zzso but intervention studies are required to investigate zzso We examined the acute effects on zzso zzso and insulin levels of uninterrupted sitting compared with sitting interrupted by brief bouts of zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso adults zzso zzso zzso aged zzso years, were recruited for a zzso zzso zzso acute crossover zzso 1) uninterrupted zzso 2) seated with zzso bouts of zzso walking every 20 zzso and 3) seated with zzso bouts of zzso walking every 20 zzso A standardized test drink was provided after an initial zzso period of uninterrupted zzso The positive incremental area under zzso zzso for zzso and insulin zzso zzso zzso for the 5 h after the test drink (75 g zzso 50 g zzso were calculated for the respective zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso h after both zzso conditions was reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both P zzso compared with uninterrupted sitting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso h was also reduced with both zzso conditions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso compared with uninterrupted sitting zzso zzso 

zzso sitting time with short bouts of zzso or zzso walking lowers zzso zzso and insulin levels in zzso zzso This may improve zzso metabolism and potentially be an important public health and clinical intervention strategy for reducing cardiovascular zzso
