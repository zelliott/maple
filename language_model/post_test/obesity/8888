The purpose of this review is to highlight recent zzso advances that have helped us to understand the role of intramuscular zzso in human health as well as prevention and treatment of zzso In addition to both invasive zzso zzso and zzso methods, techniques to assess other lipids within muscle will be zzso 

In addition to intramuscular zzso other lipids contained within skeletal muscle such as zzso and zzso may have an important role in human zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso methods to obtain serial zzso of these muscle lipids as a result of experimental zzso have recently provided unique insight into their respective roles in human zzso 

zzso zzso within skeletal muscle has received considerable interest due to its potential role in insulin resistance and fatty acid metabolism of zzso aging and type 2 zzso Observations that zzso themselves may be used as a fuel source for exercising muscle, and thus may not be zzso in all circumstances, has in part prompted the development and zzso of zzso methods to zzso the fatty acid composition of muscle zzso as well as other zzso species within muscle, zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso and magnetic resonance imaging methods have been applied to examine the serial effects of intervention on muscle zzso
