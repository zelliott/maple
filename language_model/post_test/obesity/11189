The zzso in the gastrointestinal tract zzso of individuals receiving antibiotics and those in obese subjects undergo compositional shifts, the zzso effects and linkages of which are not clearly zzso zzso we set to gain insight into these effects, particularly with regard to zzso zzso and to contribute to unravel the underlying mechanisms and consequences for health zzso We measured the activity level of zzso zzso zzso toward 23 distinct zzso in adults patients zzso zzso 2) receiving zzso zzso therapy and in obese zzso zzso 7) and lean zzso zzso 5) zzso We observed that both 14 d zzso and obese subjects showed higher and less balanced sugar anabolic zzso with zzso carbohydrates being zzso processed as compared with zzso and lean zzso zzso zzso reconstructions confirmed that the impaired zzso of zzso zzso throughout the zzso zzso zzso which had adverse consequences for the zzso status of the zzso zzso The results point to an zzso positive association between zzso zzso activity and the body mass index, zzso blood zzso and insulin resistance zzso ( 2) zzso zzso Moreover, antibiotics altered the active fraction of zzso controlling the zzso composition and consistency of the zzso zzso Our data and analyses provide zzso insights into the effects of zzso usage on the dynamics of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso links to zzso The knowledge and the hypotheses generated zzso lay a foundation for zzso systematic research that will be paramount for the design of zzso dietary and therapeutic interventions to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
