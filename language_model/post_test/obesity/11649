Childhood overweight has increased dramatically, particularly among young zzso zzso and environmental factors produce the overweight zzso zzso environments appear to account for a substantial proportion of the population zzso in overweight but remain largely unspecified and zzso 

Our goal was to evaluate the influence of maternal control in zzso an aspect of zzso family environment, on zzso eating and relative zzso 

zzso equation modeling was used to test models that describe maternal influences on zzso eating and relative zzso The participants were 197 white, zzso families with zzso zzso The zzso own dietary restraint and their perceptions of their zzso risk of overweight were used to predict maternal control in zzso which was used to predict the zzso eating and weight zzso 

zzso body mass index was a modest predictor of zzso relative zzso The addition of the zzso zzso provided a good fit and showed zzso independent prediction of zzso relative zzso zzso dietary restraint and perceptions of their zzso risk of overweight predicted maternal zzso practices, which in turn predicted zzso eating and relative zzso 

zzso aspects of the family environment, including zzso zzso practices and perceptions of their zzso risk of overweight, may represent important, zzso environmental influences on zzso eating and relative zzso The environmental effects noted were modest but comparable in magnitude to the direct association between maternal and child weight, which indicates that measuring family environmental factors can enhance our understanding of the zzso of childhood zzso
