To test the hypothesis that in young, zzso obese subjects, physical activity at a zzso moderate zzso causes a more pronounced zzso effect than in lean zzso 

24 subjects (12 with zzso zzso 12 with zzso zzso zzso underwent a zzso physical activity protocol zzso at 100 zzso Blood pressure and oxygen consumption were monitored zzso 

In the obese subjects, physical activity caused a more pronounced increase in both zzso blood pressure zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso in lean zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso in lean zzso zzso In zzso zzso these differences were only partly explained by small differences in resting blood zzso 

Healthy obese subjects show an enhanced zzso response of both zzso and zzso blood pressure to zzso physical zzso
