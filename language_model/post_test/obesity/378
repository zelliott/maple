The aim was to investigate the impact of zzso zzso syndrome zzso on the regulation of zzso by zzso and for the first time zzso zzso zzso zzso before and after 16 zzso of zzso zzso 

Eight zzso obese women with zzso zzso 25 zzso 1 zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and seven healthy zzso controls zzso Studies were performed before and after a zzso exercise training program in women with zzso and zzso in a group of zzso zzso 

zzso was measured in zzso in isolated zzso and in zzso by zzso of zzso abdominal zzso tissue before and during a zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso baseline and zzso zzso and zzso zzso was markedly reduced in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso however, was remarkably increased after training, independent of changes in body weight and sex zzso These functional improvements were supported by an increased 1) zzso sensitivity for zzso zzso P zzso 2) zzso responsiveness for zzso zzso P zzso and 3) zzso agent zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso P zzso In zzso the zzso responsiveness to zzso was also reduced in zzso and tended to increase after exercise zzso The insulin suppression of zzso during the zzso zzso clamp was also reduced in zzso 

Together, these data show that the regulation of zzso by the main zzso hormones is impaired in women with zzso These zzso defects can be partly reversed by zzso exercise training independent of changes in body fat mass and sex zzso
