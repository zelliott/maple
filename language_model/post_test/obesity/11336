zzso is a zzso tool that zzso and identifies the complete set of zzso zzso This zzso science is playing an increasing role in understanding the mechanisms involved in disease zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether a zzso zzso approach could be applied to investigate zzso differences between obese rats fed a high-fat zzso zzso diet for 9 weeks and control zzso zzso Animals fed with the zzso diet became obese, zzso zzso zzso and resistant to zzso zzso samples of zzso animals were analyzed by zzso zzso technique, and 49 zzso were identified and zzso The zzso changes observed suggest that major zzso processes like zzso zzso zzso zzso acid cycle, Kennedy pathway, and zzso zzso metabolism were altered in obese zzso The circulating levels of most zzso acids were lower in obese zzso zzso levels of zzso acid, zzso acid, zzso zzso fatty zzso and total zzso fatty acids also decreased in zzso zzso The circulating levels of zzso six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two zzso compounds zzso and zzso were also significantly reduced by the zzso diet zzso This study offers further insight of the possible mechanisms implicated in the development of zzso zzso It suggests that the zzso zzso zzso is responsible for the decrease in the circulating levels of zzso zzso and many zzso zzso despite an increase in serum zzso zzso
