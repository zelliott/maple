We provide an overview of zzso clinical and zzso research in the field of zzso dysfunction and important research priorities presented at the 2009 National Institute of Diabetes and zzso and zzso Diseases symposium on Urological zzso of Diabetes and zzso 

Experts in molecular biology, zzso zzso clinical trials, epidemiology and zzso surgery highlighted current knowledge on zzso dysfunction associated with diabetes zzso and zzso 

zzso associations between zzso dysfunction, and poor diabetic control and modifiable risk factors, including body mass index, have not yet been translated into zzso trials in the United zzso The relationship between zzso dysfunction and zzso syndrome, and surrogate markers for zzso dysfunction requires further zzso Basic research aimed at discovering disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets has focused on zzso zzso vascular dysfunction, smooth muscle zzso function and zzso However, significant gaps exist in regard to the integration of zzso cellular and functional zzso Animal models of type 2 diabetes and obesity associated zzso dysfunction require investigation because most basic science studies have used zzso models of type 1 zzso 

Studies are needed to zzso a systems biology understanding of zzso zzso and characterize and zzso zzso models of zzso dysfunction associated with type 2 diabetes and zzso Clinical studies are needed of promising intervention and prevention zzso zzso existing and future cohort zzso and biological samples is needed for risk factor analysis, zzso discovery and zzso wide association zzso
