Despite evidence that zzso for zzso represents the most common zzso physical activity, the exercise intensity associated with zzso for zzso in the obese has not been zzso 

Heart rate zzso perceived exertion zzso and walking speed were assessed for 30 obese and 20 non-obese adults as they completed two 2 zzso tests on alternate days and were compared with a third 2 zzso walk with subjects walking zzso fast as zzso 

Despite both obese zzso and non-obese zzso groups rating the intensity of zzso for zzso as zzso zzso and zzso data for only the NO group complied with definitions of zzso intensity zzso zzso for zzso was zzso by a higher absolute (15 zzso P zzso and relative zzso of predicted zzso P zzso zzso in the O group, which was representative of the transition between zzso and zzso intensity zzso The findings in the third, zzso trial were comparable across groups for all zzso 

zzso exerts a relative zzso effect on the cardiovascular system at walking speeds consistent with zzso for zzso zzso for zzso is sufficient to improve cardiovascular fitness in obese, but not zzso zzso
