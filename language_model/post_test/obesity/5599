To evaluate whether there is one central zzso contributing to the conditions associated with the zzso syndrome zzso or whether one zzso is contributing on multiple zzso 

We recruited 145 Chinese subjects aged zzso y with varying degrees of zzso zzso 33 healthy, 59 with type 2 diabetes zzso 32 essential zzso and 21 zzso IS was evaluated by the short insulin sensitivity test using a zzso zzso intravenous zzso dose of zzso Blood pressure, zzso measures and zzso parameters associated with IS were also zzso zzso factor analyses zzso were performed in the entire group of 145 subjects and in the 76 with normal zzso zzso 

zzso in all 145 subjects defined three zzso independent zzso Factor 1 was interpreted as general and central zzso impaired IS and zzso zzso Factor 2 was associated with hypertension and general and central zzso whilst Factor 3 was strongly related to low zzso and high zzso zzso and zzso to waist zzso In patients with impaired zzso zzso only two factors were zzso factor 1 related to reduced zzso impaired zzso zzso zzso and general and central zzso and factor 2 which was related to blood pressure and general and central zzso 

These models suggest that the zzso of variables in zzso is a result of multiple factors linked by zzso and not a single zzso Furthermore, increases in blood pressure are related to obesity in these Chinese subjects rather than decreased IS per zzso
