The aims of this study were to generate composite measures zzso a household's zzso potential and to examine the relationship of the composite variables with older children's eating, physical activity zzso and small screen zzso 

Data were from surveys with zzso zzso pairs in which the child was in grade 6, 8, or 10 zzso age: 14 zzso Composite measures of the zzso household environment were generated from 11 measures using zzso principal components zzso zzso between the composite measures and the children's healthy and zzso food zzso zzso and screen time were tested zzso for demographic zzso 

Two scales were zzso zzso zzso control, which clustered together factors that mitigate zzso and zzso zzso zzso Higher scores on the control scale were associated with higher adolescent intake of healthy foods, lower intake of zzso foods, higher zzso and less screen zzso Higher scores on the risk scale were associated with lower adolescent intake of healthy foods, higher intake of zzso foods, lower zzso and more screen zzso There were significant zzso interactions between the scales for soft drink consumption and zzso 

zzso zzso potential may be zzso as 2 factors reflecting cumulative risk and control zzso These factors have both additive associations with zzso behaviors and, in some cases, modify each other, suggesting that a healthy home environment requires attention to zzso Health promotion messages could incorporate these 2 different but interacting factors that parents can use to modify the zzso potential of their zzso
