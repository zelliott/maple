The rat was used as an animal model to explore the mechanism responsible for the development of zzso and zzso which commonly occur after zzso zzso zzso zzso 300 to 350 zzso were divided into three groups of 12 zzso Six of the 12 rats per group served as study animals and six as zzso The first six were subjected to zzso zzso bypass and the six controls were zzso and zzso In the second group, six animals were subjected to zzso zzso zzso and six controls were zzso and zzso Six animals in the third group were underfed so that their weights zzso that of the zzso animals and six controls were fed ad zzso After 8 zzso the animals were zzso Liver zzso zzso protein content, and serum protein and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso of proteins and zzso were measured using incorporation of zzso and zzso respectively, into zzso and medium proteins by liver zzso zzso animals demonstrated zzso decreased serum proteins and zzso and increased zzso protein zzso While both protein and zzso synthesis remained normal, the zzso of these proteins into the medium appeared to be zzso zzso changes did not occur after zzso zzso or after zzso This study suggests that the impairment of zzso and protein zzso may be a contributing factor in the increased liver weight and protein content in conjunction with decreased serum protein observed in the zzso zzso
