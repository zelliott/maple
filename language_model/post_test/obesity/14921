We hypothesized that obese chronic heart failure zzso patients, who are known to have less cardiac dysfunction, could show preserved muscle protein zzso The aim of this study was to relate muscle protein balance and cardiac function to body mass index zzso in order to provide further insight to the obesity paradox in zzso zzso 

Thirty stable zzso patients were zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and underwent zzso zzso right heart zzso to determine cardiac zzso and zzso zzso and zzso blood sampling to measure zzso and zzso levels of essential zzso acids zzso and to calculate zzso differences zzso zzso zzso negative zzso zzso Muscle protein zzso was assessed by muscle release of the zzso zzso Plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso Twenty healthy subjects, matched for age, served as controls and underwent zzso artery and vein sampling zzso 

zzso zzso patients had normal muscle protein balance, muscle zzso release, and zzso zzso zzso Among the non-obese patients, normally weighted ones had more pronounced muscle protein zzso and greater reduction of zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso release zzso than overweight zzso zzso zzso levels correlated zzso with zzso zzso zzso and positively with zzso zzso zzso Within zzso zzso chain zzso acids were positively associated with stroke volume index zzso zzso 

Only obese patients with zzso have balanced muscle protein zzso This may contribute to explain the obesity zzso
