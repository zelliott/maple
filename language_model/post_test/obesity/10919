To ascertain in obesity the role of body fat distribution (the strongest predictor of zzso and mortality in obese subjects) in determining the degree of zzso dysfunction, an early marker of zzso zzso 

18 zzso women with uncomplicated obesity excluding other cardiovascular risk factors and 12 zzso slim healthy zzso 

zzso zzso studied as diameter variation in response to an increase in zzso was evaluated in the right common zzso artery of obese and slim subjects by a non invasive approach and compared to zzso zzso To characterize better the vascular functional and/or structural properties, we studied the zzso wall zzso by an zzso zzso zzso tissue regional distribution was determined by zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso was significantly impaired in obese subjects zzso versus non-obese subjects) while zzso zzso and zzso zzso were similar in the two zzso In our obese subjects zzso zzso was zzso correlated to body fat distribution zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso parameters (except zzso response during oral zzso tolerance test zzso zzso zzso zzso blood pressure values and body weight did not correlate with the zzso zzso 

Uncomplicated obesity per zzso is zzso by an zzso of the zzso zzso the degree of this vascular damage is predicted by body fat distribution independently of body weight and zzso and other zzso zzso and zzso with an index of insulin zzso
