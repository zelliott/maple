zzso zzso insulin zzso is observed during the development of type 2 diabetes and zzso over time in a manner that is difficult to zzso Here, we found that plasma zzso levels in genetically diabetic zzso mice fed a high-fat diet were markedly increased in young zzso However, the levels started to decrease at 22 weeks of age and returned to normal levels at around 40 weeks of zzso These changes were accompanied by a marked increase in insulin levels from week 25 zzso zzso energy intake and suppressed fat pad zzso were observed at zzso weeks of age compared with those at zzso weeks of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso decreased the insulin levels required to compensate for zzso zzso disposal was significantly enhanced despite impaired insulin sensitivity in zzso zzso mice without or with zzso zzso In conclusion, the present results provide further evidence that zzso is involved in the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso in type 2 zzso Our results also indicate that zzso mice fed a high-fat diet constitute an animal model suitable to study zzso zzso zzso
