zzso zzso zzso zzso content in obesity and type 2 diabetes is associated with impaired cardiac zzso Previous studies suggest that zzso could be mobilized through lifestyle zzso We assessed influences of moderate dietary weight loss in non diabetic obese and overweight women on zzso content and cardiac zzso 

We selected a zzso of 38 women from the zzso study zzso The zzso study compared weight loss and associated zzso and cardiovascular markers with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso subjects had completed a cardiac magnetic resonance zzso scan including imaging and zzso zzso to assess cardiac structure and function as well as zzso zzso 

An average weight reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso at six months was associated with a relative decrease of zzso of zzso (from zzso zzso zzso at baseline to zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso The response was similar with zzso and fat zzso zzso function expressed as ratio of peak filling rate in zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso of left zzso size (from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso ratio of zzso and early zzso lengthening zzso zzso (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and fat free mass (from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reflected altered cardiac volume loading after diet, but did not correlate to zzso zzso 

zzso dietary weight loss significantly reduced zzso content in women with uncomplicated overweight or zzso zzso composition of the diet did not significantly affect the extent of zzso zzso
