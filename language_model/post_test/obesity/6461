While measurement of electrical zzso provides one way of zzso body composition in live animals, the accuracy of methods based on this principle requires further zzso In this work, we evaluate the effect of the ambient conditions and sample geometry on the response given by an zzso model zzso apparatus as well as the zzso of the zzso over zzso A 2 degrees C variation of the sample temperature (a normal range for living zzso can result in a zzso variation in the zzso When the zzso mass of a sample is increased in zzso the response of the apparatus does not increase once the sample length reaches half the length of the measurement zzso zzso having the same zzso mass but different shapes can show up to a zzso variation in zzso The geometry of the sample itself appears to be of prime importance for determining the strength of the zzso We find that the reference phantom provided by the manufacturer is inadequate for zzso and is unable to detect the zzso variation over time of the signal of the zzso Until these problems are zzso the usefulness of the zzso zzso to investigate body composition accurately is zzso
