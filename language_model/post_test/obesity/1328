In the zzso zzso besides fatty acid synthesis zzso from zzso which includes several zzso steps, zzso from zzso has been zzso zzso from zzso takes place in the zzso through the backward zzso of zzso cycle zzso and is due to the sequential action of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is presence of zzso converts zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which converts zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which splits zzso to yield the zzso needed for zzso We studied the zzso involved in zzso in zzso of human zzso zzso In normal subjects, the zzso activity zzso zzso was: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contained less or no activity, values being 20, 9, 11, and zzso of total for ATL, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are more active than the zzso limiting zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In the obese patients, zzso zzso and zzso were increased zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso compared to normal, while zzso was not changed zzso could not be zzso Similar changes were obtained by expressing zzso activity per fat cell zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
