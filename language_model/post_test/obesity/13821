zzso is a novel gastric hormone recognized in 1999 as a zzso of growth hormone zzso Since growth hormone is zzso an important function of zzso may be to coordinate energy needs with the growth zzso zzso discovered zzso roles of zzso imply that it may have other important zzso functions as zzso This is a review of recent clinically relevant, yet less well-known, zzso actions of zzso 

zzso has profound zzso zzso and zzso properties, increasing food intake and body zzso zzso predominantly from the stomach, zzso is the natural zzso for the growth hormone zzso zzso in the zzso zzso thus fulfilling criteria of a zzso zzso The zzso axis is the zzso of zzso by regulating growth, zzso and metabolism via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the wide tissue distribution of zzso suggests that it may have other functions as zzso 

zzso literature review of all zzso citations between 1999 and August 2003 focusing on clinically relevant zzso and zzso characteristics of zzso 

zzso is an important component of an integrated regulatory system of growth and metabolism acting via the zzso zzso and is implicated in a variety of altered energy states such as zzso eating disorders, zzso and zzso It also enhances immune responses and potentially zzso zzso zzso zzso role as a zzso zzso emphasizes the significance of zzso zzso fibers as a major zzso to the brain, serving the purpose of maintaining zzso zzso 

The discovery of zzso has increased our understanding of feeding regulation, nutritional zzso and zzso zzso Further characterization of zzso functions will likely generate new pharmacological approaches to diagnose and treat different disease entities including those related to the zzso of obesity and the zzso response to surgical zzso
