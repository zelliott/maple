The purpose of this study was to determine whether lean zzso zzso rats which exhibit greater zzso efficiency in response to a high zzso fat diet also exhibit zzso lean zzso and zzso obese zzso zzso rats were fed low zzso zzso and high zzso zzso fat zzso Food intake and weight change were recorded weekly to obtain an index of energy zzso After 6 zzso direct zzso blood pressure was measured in conscious, unrestrained zzso zzso blood was collected for analyses of plasma insulin and zzso The high fat diet had no effect on blood pressure in obese rats, although obese animals fed both diets had significantly higher blood pressure than lean zzso High fat feeding in lean rats unmasked a zzso in blood zzso Blood pressure in this group was significantly correlated with weight change, energy efficiency ratio and plasma zzso zzso zzso rats fed the high fat diet with blood pressures above the group median exhibited significantly greater plasma insulin zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso concentration and energy efficiency ratios zzso zzso than those with lower blood zzso Thus, it appears that there were two groups of lean animals present, one of which was more zzso sensitive to high fat feeding than the zzso This suggests a possible gene dosage effect of the zzso zzso in the zzso rat zzso
