In human zzso plasma zzso zzso toxin zzso the zzso of an apparently single 40 zzso zzso The same protein was also observed in Western blots by using an zzso which identifies the zzso zzso of zzso alpha zzso zzso of zzso In analogous experiments, zzso toxin and an zzso raised against the zzso zzso of zzso alpha zzso zzso of zzso were used to identify two proteins of 42 and 45 zzso the former of which was more zzso A method was developed to estimate the relative amounts of zzso and zzso in crude zzso plasma zzso in a single zzso by using the two zzso In animal models, changes in the amounts of zzso have been suggested to explain zzso in zzso in zzso and zzso However, the amounts of zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso zzso patients who had been without hormone substitution for 4 zzso In zzso plasma zzso prepared from markedly obese subjects, the amounts of both zzso alpha and zzso alpha as calculated per zzso of protein were zzso but the zzso ratio remained zzso in comparison with control zzso
