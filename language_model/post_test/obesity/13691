Despite growing attention to central obesity as a predictor of clinical coronary heart disease zzso there are few reports about the association between directly measured visceral obesity and zzso coronary zzso in elderly zzso We examined this association in elderly, zzso adults without clinically recognized zzso 

zzso adults zzso men, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 220 women, zzso zzso zzso zzso aged zzso years zzso 69 zzso with no history of zzso or coronary zzso had an electron beam zzso zzso zzso to measure coronary artery zzso score zzso an estimate of coronary plaque zzso zzso and subcutaneous zzso were assessed by a zzso zzso scan at the zzso 4-5 disc level and zzso weight, and waist and hip zzso were zzso 

In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso no measure of obesity or body fat distribution, including zzso zzso ratio, waist zzso and visceral and subcutaneous fat by zzso was significantly associated with zzso before or after adjusting for multiple zzso of zzso zzso smoking, alcohol zzso exercise, pulse pressure, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio, and zzso plasma zzso 

In elderly adults without clinically recognized zzso body weight and fat distribution do not predict coronary artery plaque zzso These results raise questions about the value of weight reduction diets for preventing heart disease in elderly survivors without clinical heart zzso
