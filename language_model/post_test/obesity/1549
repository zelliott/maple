zzso zzso factor zzso belongs to the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso and is among the most abundant zzso zzso by zzso In zzso and mouse in zzso data revealed zzso as a candidate zzso of zzso insulin zzso zzso we assessed whether common genetic variation within the zzso locus contributes to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

A population of zzso White European individuals at increased risk for type 2 diabetes was characterized by an oral zzso tolerance test with zzso and insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for five tagging zzso covering zzso of common genetic variation zzso zzso frequency zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In addition, a zzso of zzso subjects underwent a zzso clamp and a zzso of 340 magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso 

After adjustment for gender and age and zzso correction for the number of zzso tested, zzso zzso revealed significant association with zzso total zzso tissue mass zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as nominal associations with zzso zzso percentage of body fat zzso and zzso insulin sensitivity zzso The association with insulin sensitivity was completely abolished by additional adjustment for body fat zzso Moreover, the fat zzso zzso of zzso zzso was significantly associated with elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso levels were robustly and positively associated with all body fat parameters measured and with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In humans at increased risk for type 2 diabetes, a functional common genetic zzso in the gene locus zzso zzso contributes to overall body zzso zzso insulin resistance, and circulating zzso zzso
