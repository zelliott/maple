zzso clamp studies were carried out on 13 zzso and 12 zzso diabetics zzso Based upon the body mass index zzso they were further divided into obese zzso greater than or equal to 27 zzso and zzso groups zzso less than 27 zzso All received zzso insulin clamp study zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were done every five minutes for zzso of plasma zzso zzso and zzso insulin zzso Steady state plasma zzso zzso was obtained zzso minutes and kept for 100 more zzso The data of final 40 minutes of clamp were used for zzso Variations in zzso and zzso clearance rate of zzso zzso instead of zzso infusion rate zzso value were used to assess the insulin zzso The results showed that insulin resistance was noted in obese zzso and diabetic subjects as well as in non-obese diabetic patients, as evidenced by higher zzso zzso and lower zzso than non-obese normal zzso zzso analysis revealed that there was no correlation between the reduction of zzso and the zzso in either zzso or diabetic zzso There was a strong negative correlation between zzso and the ambient zzso plasma zzso in the diabetic group, whereas this correlation was not found in the zzso zzso In conclusion, obesity with or without diabetes did have remarkable insulin zzso In zzso obese subjects the insulin resistance did not go up as the zzso increased zzso In diabetic patients, both obesity and zzso contributed significantly insulin zzso
