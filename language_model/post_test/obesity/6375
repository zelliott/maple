For several years zzso zzso and pediatric zzso in zzso have been collaborating closely to achieve early detection of growth zzso As a result of this collaboration a zzso was established in September 1998 into which height and weight zzso were entered and related to age and zzso This well established network of zzso in practice, pediatric zzso and the zzso zzso functions zzso 

All data are zzso and continually zzso By September 2000, the data for zzso children had been zzso The data were evaluated using the German zzso Norm zzso for body height and German normal data for zzso zzso of growth dynamics was assumed when change in height zzso was greater than zzso height zzso 

Analysis showed that zzso children zzso had a height greater than the zzso zzso and zzso children zzso had a height less than the 3rd zzso of the zzso zzso zzso above the zzso zzso was found in zzso children zzso and below the 3rd zzso in zzso children zzso When assessing growth development zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed acceleration and 155 zzso showed zzso of zzso 

The computer-based monitoring system is useful to document short-term and long-term changes of growth and weight zzso in the general zzso The presence of growth disorders and/or disturbed weight gain can be detected early in the individual zzso
