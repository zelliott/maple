zzso zzso zzso zzso for men zzso zzso for women have been proposed by an expert panel as zzso for identifying increased risk for the development of obesity zzso for most zzso The aim of this investigation was to examine the zzso values of these zzso zzso for zzso low concentration of high zzso and high concentration of low zzso density zzso cholesterol, zzso type 2 diabetes, and hypertension in overweight American zzso Data from zzso III were zzso for the zzso zzso abilities were determined by calculating sensitivity, zzso positive zzso and negative zzso zzso values in overweight subjects with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was stronger for high zzso compared to other risk factors with the highest values recorded in the zzso and zzso year age groups in men and women, zzso zzso of zzso zzso for zzso type 2 diabetes, and hypertension were low in men compared to zzso zzso tended to increase with age, from zzso zzso to zzso year age groups in zzso zzso and Hispanic zzso In men, the highest zzso were recorded for zzso in the zzso years old groups, with values of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and Hispanics, zzso The zzso risk factor associated with the highest zzso in women was diabetes with values of zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso with a value of zzso in the zzso year age group in zzso Among Black men zzso years of age, only zzso of a population of overweight zzso were detected by the zzso zzso and among Black women, zzso years of age, only zzso were zzso Given the low sensitivity of these zzso for detecting hypertension, one of the major zzso of zzso these zzso failed to provide adequate evidence for the use of zzso in determining or evaluating patients as to zzso zzso We recommend further studies to determine a set of specific zzso associated with increased risk of zzso in different population zzso
