zzso is a known risk factor for type 2 zzso However, most obese individuals do not develop diabetes because they adapt to insulin resistance by increasing zzso mass and insulin zzso zzso pathology in type 2 diabetes is characterized by zzso loss, zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso stress zzso successful versus unsuccessful zzso adaptation to insulin zzso 

To address this, we fed zzso zzso and human zzso transgenic zzso rats either 10 weeks of regular zzso or a high-fat diet and zzso examined the relations among zzso mass and zzso zzso zzso stress, insulin zzso and insulin zzso 

A high-fat diet led to comparable insulin resistance in zzso and zzso zzso zzso rats compensated with increased insulin zzso and zzso zzso In zzso rats, in contrast, neither zzso function nor mass compensated for the increased insulin demand, leading to zzso The failure to increase zzso mass in zzso rats was the result of zzso zzso zzso zzso that increased in proportion to zzso insulin zzso 

zzso zzso stress zzso the successful versus unsuccessful zzso adaptation to a high-fat diet in zzso These studies are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso zzso contribute to increased zzso zzso and zzso failure in humans with type 2 zzso
