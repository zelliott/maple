To investigate whether there is a relationship between hiatus zzso zzso and zzso or obesity in elderly Japanese zzso 

The causes of zzso in the elderly are zzso 

We enrolled 147 consecutive patients aged over 50 years in this zzso zzso assessment of the size of zzso was performed by using a modified zzso zzso with grades from 1 (no zzso to 4 zzso zzso The zzso zzso valve zzso was also graded from I to zzso zzso was evaluated from a lateral photograph by measuring the modified Cobb angle zzso and calculating the zzso index zzso Body mass index zzso was used to evaluate zzso 

In women, there were significant differences of both the CA zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso test, zzso between each grade of zzso zzso of the CA zzso and zzso zzso were also seen between the grades of zzso None of these differences were detected in zzso In women, the CA zzso zzso and zzso zzso were positively correlated with age, but this was not so in zzso Neither sex showed an association between zzso and the grade of either zzso or zzso However, there was a weak negative correlation between age and zzso in women zzso zzso and men zzso zzso 

The size of zzso is associated with the severity of zzso not with zzso in elderly Japanese zzso Age is a risk factor for both zzso and zzso
