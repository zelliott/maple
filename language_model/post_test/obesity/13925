zzso individuals tend to be both insulin resistant and at increased risk to develop cardiovascular disease zzso Given the increased prevalence of obesity in the US population, we thought it important to define the relationship between degree of obesity and zzso zzso disposal in the population at large, as well as the relationship between zzso insulin resistance, and zzso risk in these zzso To do this we zzso zzso zzso disposal in 465 healthy volunteers by determining the zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso at the end of a zzso infusion of zzso insulin, and zzso zzso was estimated by body mass index zzso and the relationship between zzso and zzso zzso In addition, a series of zzso risk factors were measured, including blood pressure, plasma zzso and insulin zzso before and after 75 g of oral zzso and zzso plasma zzso and zzso zzso The results indicated that zzso concentration and zzso were significantly correlated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of individuals in the most zzso zzso were obese zzso zzso zzso However, zzso of those in the most zzso zzso were of normal weight zzso zzso zzso Although zzso risk factors were zzso in general with progressive increases in either zzso or zzso zzso important differences were zzso Thus, the higher the zzso zzso the more the increase in plasma zzso insulin, and zzso zzso zzso whereas the greater the zzso the higher the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, while zzso risk factors increased significantly with each zzso of insulin resistance, significant differences in zzso risk were only apparent when the lowest zzso zzso was compared with the other 2, with the values in the middle and upper zzso differing from each zzso These results show that while zzso and insulin resistance are zzso they are not zzso and that they make independent and different contributions to increasing zzso zzso
