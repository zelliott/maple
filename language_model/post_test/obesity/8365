In a recent study, we found that zzso Inuit children had a more adverse zzso profile than Danish zzso zzso fitness and zzso could only partly account for the zzso zzso we set out to evaluate and compare plasma zzso and zzso levels in Danish and Inuit zzso 

In total, zzso Inuit and 132 Danish children zzso zzso had examinations of zzso body fat content, zzso staging, zzso blood and zzso zzso 

Plasma zzso was higher in Danish boys zzso zzso zzso zzso geometric mean zzso zzso compared to both northern zzso zzso zzso zzso and southern zzso zzso zzso zzso living Inuit boys and higher in Danish girls zzso zzso compared to southern living Inuit girls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tended to be higher compared to northern living Inuit girls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Plasma zzso was higher for both Danish boys zzso zzso zzso zzso geometric mean zzso zzso and girls zzso zzso compared to southern living Inuit boys zzso zzso and girls zzso zzso (both p zzso zzso All differences remained after adjustment for body fat percentage zzso zzso zzso age and zzso The zzso ratio was higher in Danish boys and tended to be higher in Danish girls compared to northern living Inuit boys and girls, zzso These differences were eliminated after adjustment for zzso zzso zzso age and zzso 

In contrast to our hypothesis, plasma zzso was higher in Danish children despite a more healthy zzso profile compared to Inuit zzso As expected, plasma zzso was lowest in Inuit children with the most adverse zzso zzso
