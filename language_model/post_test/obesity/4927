zzso mouse models for zzso type 2 diabetes zzso more accurately reflect the most common manifestations of the human zzso Two zzso mouse strains zzso and zzso separately contributed zzso zzso zzso quantitative trait zzso to F1 zzso Although chronic administration of zzso zzso in diet zzso zzso effectively suppressed F1 diabetes, zzso was an zzso side zzso Three zzso zzso strains zzso zzso zzso and zzso developed on the zzso background carry variable numbers of these quantitative trait zzso that elicit differential weight gain and male zzso intolerance syndromes of variable zzso We previously showed that zzso and zzso mice responded to chronic zzso therapy without severe zzso whereas zzso males were moderately zzso In contrast, another zzso zzso strain, zzso responded to zzso therapy with the extreme zzso observed in the zzso zzso changes in multiple plasma zzso including insulin, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso allowed profiling of the differential zzso responses in zzso F1 and zzso males zzso the resistant zzso and zzso or moderately sensitive zzso Of these zzso zzso most effectively predicted adverse drug zzso zzso mean zzso zzso were higher in zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso profiling of multiple plasma zzso identified zzso as a useful zzso to monitor for differential zzso responses to zzso in these new mouse models of zzso
