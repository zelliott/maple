To determine whether the dramatic reduction in expression and functional activity of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso originally observed in zzso tissue of the zzso zzso zzso mouse are general features of all models of zzso and whether zzso differences in zzso zzso expression occur between zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso tissue zzso expression from four mouse models of zzso zzso the zzso mouse zzso zzso the zzso mouse zzso zzso the zzso mouse zzso zzso and the zzso mouse zzso zzso and in a model of high-fat zzso obesity in zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso was measured by Northern zzso zzso in white and brown zzso zzso 

In the severely obese zzso and zzso mice, zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in white zzso tissue zzso were decreased zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso More modest effects on zzso expression were observed in brown zzso tissue zzso decreased by 20 - zzso In less severe forms of zzso as found in the zzso and zzso zzso mice, and in zzso obese B6 mice, zzso expression was decreased in zzso by up to zzso with more modest decreases in zzso BAT zzso Changes in zzso zzso zzso were more zzso zzso zzso levels did not differ in most cases, with the exception that there was a zzso increase in BAT for both zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso is a general feature of both genetic and dietary obesity in zzso The degree of obesity is correlated with the extent of loss of zzso and zzso expression in zzso The distinct zzso abnormalities associated with these obesity models may be responsible for the degree of impaired zzso zzso zzso
