While a significant body of research has demonstrated high zzso rates between depression and zzso the vast majority of this work has considered depression as a zzso zzso Given that increased appetite and weight gain are highly characteristic of the zzso zzso of depression, while classic depression is characterized by decreased appetite and weight loss, it would be important to examine whether increased obesity risk is consistent across the major zzso zzso of depression or is limited to the zzso zzso 

Using data from the zzso National zzso zzso on Alcohol and Related zzso zzso we identified zzso US adults with past or current major depression based on zzso criteria and 1,500 zzso zzso Each depressed subject was designated as having classic, zzso or zzso depression based on core zzso zzso zzso zzso models examined rates of current obesity zzso as a current body mass index zzso 30) across the 3 depressive zzso and zzso controls, adjusting for demographic zzso To limit the possible effect of current depressive symptoms on observed obesity rates, secondary analyses were completed in individuals with past depression zzso 

zzso with zzso depression had markedly elevated obesity rates compared to population controls and to other depressed subjects, with corresponding zzso odds ratios consistently greater than zzso zzso zzso In contrast, obesity rates were not significantly different in subjects with classic depression and zzso zzso These results were manifest in individuals with either current or past depression and were independent of gender and zzso 

While many individuals with classic depression will present with obesity due to the high prevalence of both disorders, only zzso depression is associated with an elevated risk of obesity relative to the population at zzso Refining the target zzso for future work on depression and obesity might improve our understanding, zzso and treatment of this complex clinical zzso
