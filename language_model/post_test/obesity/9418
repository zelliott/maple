zzso zzso zzso is the zzso therapy for the induction of zzso in zzso women with zzso zzso syndrome zzso but zzso of patients are zzso The aim of the current study was to test the hypothesis that a zzso intervention that consisted of structured exercise training zzso and zzso diet increases the probability of zzso after zzso in overweight and obese zzso zzso zzso 

A cohort of 96 overweight and obese zzso zzso patients was enrolled zzso in a zzso randomized, zzso controlled, zzso clinical zzso The three interventions were: zzso plus zzso diet for 6 weeks zzso zzso 2 weeks of observation followed by one cycle of zzso therapy zzso zzso and zzso plus zzso diet for 6 weeks, with one cycle of zzso after the first 2 weeks zzso zzso The primary zzso was the zzso zzso Other zzso data, as well as zzso hormonal and zzso data, were also collected and considered as secondary end zzso 

After 6 weeks of zzso plus zzso diet, the zzso rate was significantly zzso zzso higher in Group C zzso zzso than in Groups A zzso zzso and B zzso zzso with relative risks of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso compared with Groups A and B, zzso Compared with zzso in Groups A and C, a significant improvement in clinical and zzso zzso and insulin sensitivity indexes was zzso In the same two groups, the insulin sensitivity index was significantly zzso zzso better than that in Group zzso 

In overweight and obese zzso zzso patients, a zzso intervention of zzso and a zzso diet was effective in increasing the probability of zzso under zzso zzso The study was registered at Clinical zzso
