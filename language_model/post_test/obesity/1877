Many women in zzso countries are zzso Excess body fat is associated with excess morbidity and mortality from zzso and zzso In some cases, zzso also is implicated with increased zzso of breast cancer, but the results of these studies are not zzso Human breast cancer is usually distinguished as either zzso or zzso In this review, we focus on literature that presents body mass index zzso zzso ranges and identifies zzso zzso The majority of the relevant prospective studies support an inverse relationship between zzso and the relative risk zzso of developing zzso breast zzso In contrast, a positive relationship between zzso and the zzso of developing zzso breast cancer is reported in only half of all prospective studies on this zzso Those studies that do not show a positive zzso in general, have used younger zzso women, and their body weights were obtained prior to zzso Many zzso studies also report an inverse association between zzso and the zzso of developing zzso breast cancer, and a positive association between zzso and the zzso of developing zzso breast zzso Other studies do not find these associations, but a number of these studies have used small sample sizes and, for the zzso subjects, have represented populations with low obesity and/or breast cancer zzso Other factors that might play a role in breast cancer development, such as body fat distribution, weight at earlier ages, and weight gain, are also zzso as well as the effect of obesity in breast cancer zzso In addition, limited data available for animal studies related to this topic, as well as potential mechanisms by which body fat may play a role in breast cancer development, are zzso Finally, the need for better animal models in which to perform controlled dietary and/or drug intervention studies to test rigorously the proposed mechanisms by which body fat may contribute to breast cancer development is zzso
