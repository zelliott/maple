zzso resistance is a key characteristic of first-degree relatives of patients with type 2 zzso We therefore treated young, zzso relatives with the insulin action zzso zzso in order to determine the effects on insulin sensitivity, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Relatives were zzso in a zzso manner and treated for 12 weeks with either 200 zzso zzso or zzso Before and after treatment, an oral zzso tolerance test zzso and a zzso clamp (40 zzso zzso zzso were performed, including zzso zzso infusion, zzso flux calculations, indirect zzso and muscle zzso 

Twelve relatives received zzso and 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso years, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso means zzso zzso Area under the curve zzso for plasma zzso at the second zzso was unchanged after zzso In contrast, zzso reduced zzso (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso plasma insulin zzso zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso P zzso Additionally, zzso plasma zzso were reduced by zzso (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso disposal increased in the zzso group (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso mainly due to increased zzso storage (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso which took place without altering zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso first-degree relatives, treatment with zzso improved insulin sensitivity almost zzso primarily due to increased zzso zzso It is suggested that the use of insulin action enhancers can be especially valuable in this group of subjects with a known high risk for developing type 2 zzso
