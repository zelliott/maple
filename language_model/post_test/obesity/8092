The effects of different amounts of omega zzso fatty acids in diets with normal or high content of fat on zzso and zzso metabolism were zzso 

Mice were fed for 8 weeks on diets enriched with fish oil or zzso at zzso or zzso of zzso Energy balance and energy expenditure were zzso zzso acid zzso zzso capacity of the liver and the activity of zzso involved in this zzso were zzso 

Fish zzso mice had lower body weight and zzso compared with zzso animals, despite having lower rates of oxygen zzso Mice fed diets containing fish oil also displayed lower zzso reduced fat content in the liver, and improved zzso tolerance compared with zzso zzso The fish zzso diets increased markers of zzso zzso content and increased the generation of zzso derived from zzso zzso in liver zzso In contrast, no changes were observed in the content of zzso electron transport chain proteins or zzso zzso zzso in the liver, indicating little direct effect of fish oil on zzso zzso 

zzso our findings suggest that the energy inefficient zzso of zzso in zzso may be an important mechanism underlying the protection against obesity and zzso intolerance of fish oil zzso
