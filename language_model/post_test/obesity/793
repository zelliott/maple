Little is known about how simpler and more available methods to measure change in body zzso compare with criterion methods such as zzso X-ray zzso zzso in zzso 

Our objective was to determine the ability of zzso zzso zzso and formulas based on zzso zzso thickness zzso and zzso zzso analysis zzso to estimate changes in body fat over time in zzso 

Eighty-six zzso and overweight boys zzso zzso 34) and girls zzso zzso zzso with an average age of zzso zzso zzso y underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to estimate body zzso at baseline and 1 zzso zzso y zzso Recent equations were used to estimate percentage body fat by zzso measurement zzso zzso and by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Percentage body fat estimates by zzso zzso zzso and zzso were compared with those by zzso 

All methods were highly correlated with zzso zzso zzso No mean bias for estimates of percentage body fat change was found for zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso for all subjects examined together, and agreement between body fat zzso by zzso and zzso did not vary with race or zzso zzso bias was present for zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso Estimates of change in percentage body fat were systematically overestimated by zzso equations zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso accounted for only zzso of the zzso in percentage body fat zzso 

Compared with zzso there appears to be no zzso and simple method to measure changes in children's percentage body fat accurately and precisely, but zzso performed better than did zzso or zzso zzso could prove useful for measuring changes in zzso in zzso
