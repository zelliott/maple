Total body volume is an important health metric used to measure body density, shape, and zzso body composition but is currently only available through underwater weighing or air displacement zzso zzso The objective of this investigation was to derive an accurate body volume from zzso X-ray zzso zzso measures for advanced body composition zzso Volunteers received a whole body zzso scan and an zzso measure at baseline (N zzso 25) and 6 zzso (N zzso zzso zzso measures were used to zzso body volume from the reported zzso masses of fat, lean, and bone mineral zzso A second population (N zzso zzso from the National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso was used to estimate the zzso precision of regional zzso legs, head, and zzso and total body zzso Overall, we found that zzso was highly correlated to zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso change in total zzso was highly correlated to change in zzso zzso zzso zzso The root mean square percent zzso of variation precision of zzso measures ranged from zzso zzso to zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso method can measure body volume accurately and precisely, can be used in body composition models, could be an independent health zzso and is useful as a prospective or retrospective zzso of body zzso
