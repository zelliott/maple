The body zzso index zzso hip circumference zzso zzso - zzso has recently been shown to demonstrate a stronger correlation with percentage body fat zzso than that between the zzso and zzso in Mexican-American zzso Here, we compare the zzso between zzso from zzso X-ray zzso zzso and zzso and between zzso and zzso in zzso adults zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso was assessed using Lin's zzso zzso zzso where values zzso are considered zzso In the sample as a whole, the agreement between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was far better than that between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but was nonetheless relatively zzso There were large mean differences in zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso particularly at lower levels of zzso zzso and further the zzso overestimated zzso in males and underestimated zzso in zzso zzso the zzso formula for our sample only marginally improved zzso zzso of the present study show that zzso provides a better indicator of zzso in zzso adults than does zzso but does not provide valid estimates of zzso particularly at lower levels of body zzso Further research is warranted to investigate the zzso ability of zzso for various health zzso
