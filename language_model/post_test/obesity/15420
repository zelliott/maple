We determined the effect of zzso periods of physical training zzso and zzso on percent fat zzso zzso and bone density of children with zzso 

zzso were 79 7- to 11-year-old children with zzso 34 were white, 44 were black, and 1 was Asian, 26 were male and 53 were zzso They were randomly assigned to two groups: group 1 engaged in zzso for the first 4 months, while group 2 engaged in zzso during the second 4 zzso Body composition was measured with dual energy zzso and diet was measured with 4 days of recall for each zzso zzso zzso was offered 5 zzso for 40 zzso heart rate monitors were worn, and no dietary information was zzso mean attendance was zzso and mean heart rate per session was 157 zzso 

Group by time interactions across the three zzso (from analysis of zzso were significant for percent fat zzso zzso zzso and bone density zzso zzso zzso Both groups declined in percent fat during the periods of zzso by an average of zzso fat zzso in the 4 months after zzso of zzso group 1 increased by zzso zzso In both groups, bone density increased more during periods of zzso zzso zzso than during periods of no zzso zzso zzso No significant zzso zzso zzso differences were found for dietary intake of energy, zzso or zzso 

This study suggests that regular exercise, without dietary intervention, can enhance the body composition of children with zzso
