About zzso of zzso women of zzso age are obese, a condition linked to offspring obesity and zzso This study zzso an zzso model of maternal obesity in which zzso are overfed to induce obesity at conception and throughout zzso At zzso fetuses from these obese zzso are zzso zzso and zzso and they exhibited markedly increased pancreatic weight and zzso numbers compared with fetuses of zzso fed to zzso This study was conducted to establish fetal pancreatic zzso and function in late gestation and at term in this zzso zzso zzso zzso were fed a control zzso zzso National Research Council zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso diet from 60 days before conception to zzso at day 135 of gestation or to zzso No differences were observed in fetal size or weight on day 135 or in lamb birth weights between C and zzso zzso In contrast to our previously published results at zzso pancreatic weights zzso zzso and zzso numbers zzso zzso of zzso fetuses were markedly lower than those from C zzso whereas the zzso zzso rate was increased zzso zzso in day 135 zzso versus C zzso At birth, blood insulin concentration was lower zzso zzso and zzso level was higher zzso zzso in newborn zzso from zzso versus C zzso These data demonstrate differential impacts of maternal obesity on fetal pancreatic growth and zzso numbers during early and late zzso During the first half of gestation there was a marked increase in pancreatic growth, zzso zzso and insulin zzso followed by a reduction in pancreatic growth and zzso numbers in late zzso resulting in reduced circulating insulin at zzso It is speculated that the failure of the zzso to return to a normal cellular composition and function zzso could result in zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso and diabetes in zzso zzso
