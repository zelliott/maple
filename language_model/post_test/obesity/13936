To investigate zzso zzso in cultured zzso from obese patients and its relationship with zzso zzso blood pressure, and the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso 

zzso including zzso body composition zzso and blood pressure, were performed in 61 overweight or obese women zzso 28 to 68 zzso A subcutaneous abdominal zzso tissue biopsy was used for zzso size determination and zzso of zzso zzso in the medium of cultured zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined using zzso chain zzso zzso length zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso 140 to zzso zzso zzso zzso was not significantly correlated with zzso body fat, or blood pressure and did not vary according to the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso was associated with zzso size zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso m in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso p zzso after adjustment for age and fat zzso An association between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso size zzso zzso adjusted for sex, age, and zzso was found in another independent sample of 106 obese subjects zzso ratio, zzso zzso zzso 29 to 70 zzso 

In cultured zzso from obese subjects, zzso zzso was not associated with body fat zzso blood pressure, or fat cell zzso However, results from two independent studies suggest an association between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
