This study comprised 2 experiments that tested the hypothesis that a zzso starch diet zzso would improve body weight and zzso control relative to a zzso starch diet zzso in rats with zzso zzso After inducing obesity with a high-fat and zzso diet zzso 1), male zzso rats zzso zzso zzso were divided into 4 groups and given free or restricted access to either an zzso or an zzso diet for 4 zzso zzso zzso After 3 zzso rats from each group underwent an oral zzso tolerance zzso At the end of the experiment, zzso rats were killed by zzso and blood and zzso were collected for zzso zzso led to lower total energy zzso weight gain, fat pad mass, and zzso response but higher insulin sensitivity index than zzso only when consumed ad zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso led to higher zzso zzso and zzso zzso responses and zzso levels, independent of feeding paradigm zzso zzso The zzso levels of key zzso systems involved in the regulation of food intake were affected only by energy zzso On the other hand, zzso resulted in higher expression of zzso zzso in the brown zzso tissue than zzso in rats that consumed food zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso appear to be zzso by its high resistant starch content rather than its zzso zzso We conclude that zzso high in zzso can be effective in weight and zzso control in zzso
