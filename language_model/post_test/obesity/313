To evaluate the impact of abdominal fat and insulin resistance on zzso hypertension of non-obese zzso 

Thirty-five non-obese women zzso age zzso years were zzso and divided into two groups according to the presence of hypertension zzso 140 zzso 90 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso measurement and oral zzso tolerance test zzso to assess insulin were performed in these zzso A zzso was used to evaluate visceral zzso and subcutaneous abdominal fat zzso The Central fat distribution index zzso was proposed to evaluate the impact of subcutaneous abdominal fat on central fat distribution in zzso zzso 

When compared to zzso zzso zzso 17) group, zzso zzso zzso zzso showed higher blood pressure levels zzso and zzso greater zzso area zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso greater zzso area zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso higher zzso index zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso higher zzso index zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso and higher zzso level zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso hypertension in non-obese women is associated with insulin resistance, central fat distribution and higher zzso zzso
