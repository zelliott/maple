A low zzso concentration is an independent risk factor for zzso Studies have suggested that zzso consumption may be zzso and a zzso impact on circulating zzso zzso has been suggested to partially explain this zzso The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of consuming increasing daily doses of low-calorie zzso juice cocktail zzso on the plasma zzso profile of zzso obese zzso For that purpose, thirty men zzso age 51 zzso 10) zzso consumed increasing doses of zzso during three successive periods of 4 weeks zzso zzso 250 zzso 500 zzso Before the study and after each phase, we measured changes in physical and zzso zzso We noted a significant increase in plasma zzso concentration after the consumption of 250 zzso zzso zzso zzso 0 zzso zzso zzso an effect that zzso during the last phase of the study zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 0 zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that changes in plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were the only variables significantly contributing to the variation in plasma zzso concentration noted in response to the zzso No variation was observed in total as well as in LDL and zzso zzso The present results show that daily zzso consumption is associated with an increase in plasma zzso zzso in zzso obese zzso We zzso that zzso compounds from cranberries may be responsible for this effect, supporting the notion that the consumption of zzso foods can be zzso
