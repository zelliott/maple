There is a need to measure energy expenditure in man for a period of 24 h or even several zzso The zzso chamber offers a unique opportunity to reach this zzso It allows the study of energy and zzso zzso from the latter, acute changes in body composition can be zzso The zzso chamber built in zzso is an zzso room (5 m long, zzso m zzso and zzso m zzso which forms an open circuit zzso indirect zzso The physical activity of the subject inside the chamber is continuously measured using a radar system based on the zzso zzso Energy expenditure of obese and lean women was continuously measured over 24 h and zzso zzso was assessed by using an approach which allows one to subtract the energy zzso for physical activity from the total energy zzso zzso in absolute terms, total energy expenditure was more elevated in the obese than in the lean zzso zzso zzso rate was also higher in the obese than in the controls, but zzso zzso was found to be blunted in the zzso In a second study, the effect of changing the zzso content of the diet on fuel zzso was assessed in young healthy subjects with the zzso zzso After a zzso adaptation to a zzso low-fat diet, the fuel mixture oxidized matched the change in zzso zzso A last example of the use of the zzso chamber is the zzso response and changes in body composition due to a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso on the last day of zzso zzso balance was reached by zzso of 50% of the zzso zzso the remaining 50% being converted into zzso
