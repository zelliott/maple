It is conceivable that toxic metals contribute to obesity by influencing various aspects of zzso such as by substituting for essential zzso and vital metals, or by inducing zzso zzso zzso of the essential metal zinc decreases zzso in humans and zzso models, whereas deficiencies of zzso copper, iron, and zzso increases zzso This study zzso the zzso zzso data to explore the association between waist circumference and body mass index with the body burdens of selected toxic metals zzso cadmium, zzso zzso zzso lead, zzso zzso and zzso Some of the associations were significant direct relationships zzso and zzso and some of the associations were significant inverse relationships zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso had mostly insignificant associations with waist circumference and body mass zzso This is novel result for most of the toxic metals zzso and a surprising result for lead because high stored lead levels have been shown to correlate with higher rates of diabetes, and obesity may be a key risk factor for developing zzso These associations suggest the possibility that environmental exposure to metals may contribute to variations in human weight zzso Future research, such as prospective studies rather than the zzso studies presented here, is warranted to confirm these zzso
