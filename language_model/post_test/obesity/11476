Children with birth weight appropriate for zzso age zzso who also demonstrate rapid weight gain in infancy have a greater risk of being overweight or obese during zzso A concurrent advancement in skeletal maturity would account for their greater size and would, therefore, not necessarily pose a threat of greater risk during adolescence and early zzso This study aims to determine whether children with rapid weight gain during infancy have advanced skeletal maturity during zzso 

One hundred and zzso African children zzso zzso zzso girls zzso zzso of normal birth weight and zzso age were assessed from birth to 9 zzso Body composition was assessed at 9 years of age by zzso zzso and skeletal maturity was assessed using the zzso II zzso Rapid weight gain in infancy was defined as a zzso change in zzso zzso between birth and 2 zzso 

Rapid weight gain was experienced by over zzso of the zzso Children with rapid weight gain were significantly lighter at birth and significantly taller, zzso and zzso throughout zzso zzso age and zzso II technique skeletal ages at 9 years were not significantly different between groups or between sexes within zzso 

Because zzso children with rapid weight gain have a greater risk of overweight and obesity but are not advanced in skeletal maturity, later adolescent adjustments toward average weight and zzso values are zzso The identification and monitoring of such children is of importance in reducing their risk of zzso
