zzso invasive surgery offers advantages for management of obese patients, but technical difficulty often deters its zzso Compared to zzso robotic surgery should allow comparable staging and improved surgical zzso zzso we evaluated outcomes in robotic and zzso zzso of obese women with zzso cancer at our zzso 

zzso robotic and zzso zzso of obese women zzso zzso 30 zzso undergoing surgical management of primary zzso cancer from March 2006 to March 2009 were formulated utilizing a computerized zzso Patient zzso operative statistics, zzso zzso and zzso details were collected in an intent to treat zzso zzso or zzso exact test and zzso were used for statistical zzso 

73 women underwent robotic surgical management, zzso converted to zzso Mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso number of previous surgeries zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso performed zzso zzso zzso zzso were similar between zzso Total zzso zzso obtained were not statistically different between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Total operative time and room time was significantly longer for robotic zzso however, estimated blood loss, the percentage of patients receiving zzso hospital length of stay, wound complications zzso zzso zzso zzso and other complications zzso zzso zzso zzso were improved for the robotic zzso 

zzso management of obese women with zzso cancer yields acceptable staging results and improved surgical zzso Although operating time is longer, hospital time is zzso zzso surgery may be an ideal approach for these zzso
