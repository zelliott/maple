The prevalence of the zzso syndrome among a number of Asian populations as defined by several current criteria has been increasing rapidly and appears to resemble that among Western zzso 

We review 25 surveys of the zzso syndrome in Asian populations zzso China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Philippines, Singapore) that report adequate information published during the last 5 zzso 

Using zzso definitions of obesity zzso or zzso 25 zzso and increased waist circumference (for zzso or zzso 90 zzso for zzso or zzso zzso prevalence appears to be between 10 to zzso Those with the syndrome are more likely to have a history of diabetes and cardiovascular zzso The risk of developing Type 2 diabetes is 10 times higher among middle-aged Japanese men with the zzso syndrome compared to healthy zzso In Chinese and Japanese zzso people who have the zzso syndrome are 3 to 10 times more likely to develop cardiovascular zzso zzso in prevalence estimates of the zzso syndrome even within the same country result from differences in sampling and possibly from zzso 

The outstanding conclusion from recent surveys across the zzso region is that of a consistent increase in the prevalence of the zzso zzso associated with abdominal zzso that lead to high risk of morbidity and zzso
