zzso zzso may not merely be zzso to zzso zzso but, under appropriate zzso conditions, may act in a paradoxically positive manner to sensitize zzso responsiveness to zzso hormone zzso SS infusion withdrawal zzso produces a rebound zzso rise in humans and increases zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leaves the zzso cell in a situation of low zzso zzso In zzso there is markedly decreased zzso zzso In both children and adults, the greater the body mass index zzso the lower the zzso response to provocative zzso It has been zzso that increased zzso zzso zzso is the main mechanism responsible for the blunted zzso zzso of zzso There are no data evaluating zzso responsiveness to zzso plus zzso in obese zzso The aim of the present study was to evaluate the zzso response to zzso plus zzso in a group of control subjects and a group of obese zzso 

Seven obese patients (six female, one zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso As a control group, seven normal subjects (six female, one zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were also zzso Two tests were zzso On one day, zzso zzso zzso infusion zzso zzso from zzso zzso was performed followed by a zzso zzso zzso 90 zzso after SS withdrawal zzso On another day, SS zzso infusion zzso zzso from zzso zzso was performed followed by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 90 zzso after SS zzso A second group of seven obese patients (six female, one zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso As a second control group, seven normal healthy subjects (six female, one zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were also zzso On one day, saline infusion was performed followed by a zzso zzso zzso at 90 zzso On another day, saline infusion was performed followed by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 90 zzso Blood samples were taken at appropriate intervals for determination of zzso zzso zzso was measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed by zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso in normal subjects showed a mean peak of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso control subjects had a mean peak of zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso When zzso was administered after zzso there was an increased zzso zzso with a mean peak of zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly greater than the response after zzso alone zzso zzso and zzso alone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in obese patients was decreased with a mean peak of zzso zzso zzso zzso In obese patients, zzso zzso after zzso was markedly decreased with a mean peak of zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso was administered after zzso an increase in zzso zzso was observed with a mean peak of zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly greater than zzso alone zzso zzso but not zzso alone zzso zzso zzso and significantly less than in normal subjects zzso zzso 

This study demonstrates a significantly blunted peak zzso response to zzso infusion withdrawal plus zzso in obese patients compared to normal zzso In this theoretical situation of decreased zzso tone, there is persistence of zzso zzso in zzso suggesting the existence of multiple defects responsible for decreased zzso zzso in zzso We also found that in obese patients, in contrast to normal subjects, zzso did not increase zzso zzso zzso
