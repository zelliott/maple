Although hip zzso is a common disabling condition, an incomplete understanding of all factors that contribute to hip zzso disability zzso The objective of the study was to improve our understanding of potentially preventable factors that might influence hip zzso disability by examining the prevalence and impact of selected zzso factors potentially associated with the progression and severity of hip joint zzso among patients with zzso hip zzso 

The medical records of 1,000 hip zzso surgical patients were assessed to specifically identify the presence or absence of zzso conditions of the zzso vascular or respiratory zzso The association between the patient's functional status before and after surgery, and the presence or absence of these zzso conditions, was zzso 

Over zzso of the sample had at least one zzso condition, such as hypertension or cardiac zzso After controlling for age, zzso type of surgery and gender zzso those with two or more zzso were found to have greater degrees of functional impairment before surgery, and lower zzso functional status after surgery than those with no zzso disease zzso 

Patients with zzso hip zzso exhibit a high prevalence of zzso zzso The disability of patients with hip zzso is increased in the presence of two or more related zzso zzso These findings suggest a novel focus for primary, secondary and zzso preventive zzso
