The zzso programming effects of nutritional modifications in the immediate zzso life are increasingly recognized to independently contribute to the development of zzso syndrome in later zzso Adjustment of litter size in zzso has been used to induce either zzso or zzso in the immediate zzso life of the zzso While zzso led to growth zzso in the zzso zzso produced increased body weight gains, zzso and zzso zzso during the zzso period induced several adaptations in the energy zzso in the zzso of the offspring zzso them for the onset of obesity later in zzso Another approach for a nutritional modification in the immediate zzso period is the artificial rearing of newborn rat zzso on a zzso zzso milk formula without changes in the total calorie zzso zzso immediately evident in the HC zzso persisted in the zzso period even after withdrawal of the HC zzso zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso supported chronic zzso in the HC zzso zzso in the gene expression of zzso zzso zzso to zzso were evident during the period of the HC dietary zzso The persistence of these zzso adaptations supported the obese zzso in adult HC zzso A zzso effect gave rise to the development of chronic zzso and zzso obesity in the offspring of the HC female zzso Other studies have shown that zzso by a zzso obese or zzso mother resulted in predisposition for the onset of zzso disorders in the zzso These observations from animal studies on the zzso programming effects due to altered nutritional experiences in the immediate zzso life strongly suggest that altered feeding practices for infants zzso feeding and early introduction of infant zzso could contribute to the rising zzso of zzso in children and zzso
