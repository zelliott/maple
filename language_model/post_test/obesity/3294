A hypothesis is presented that addresses the zzso of diabetes in the zzso Evidence from many areas of research suggests that ready availability of free fatty acids for zzso by muscles and other zzso may lead to impairment of zzso zzso and lead to zzso intolerance as is seen in obesity and obese zzso In addition, free fatty acids can stimulate zzso zzso and alter pancreatic insulin release and subsequent zzso which may be the zzso mechanism for these changes in obese zzso It is zzso that there are different zzso forms of obesity and that risk of diabetes is much greater in those with abdominal rather than zzso zzso It may be that fat cells in abdominal zzso (in these zzso are more metabolically active, releasing greater amounts of free fatty acids (even after feeding when they should be zzso and the metabolism of these fatty acids leads to the changes described here, leading to overt zzso
