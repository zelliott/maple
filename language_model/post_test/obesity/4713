The aim of this study was to determine the zzso and progression rates of diabetic zzso and their associations in Japanese individuals with type 2 zzso 

This is a part of the Japan zzso zzso Study zzso a zzso zzso trial of type 2 diabetes patients aged zzso years with an 8 year zzso There were zzso patients without diabetic zzso at zzso zzso of diabetic zzso was defined as the development of any diabetic zzso There were 410 patients with mild zzso diabetic zzso at zzso progression of diabetic zzso was defined as the development of severe zzso diabetic zzso or zzso diabetic zzso We used zzso zzso Cox hazard models, and zzso additive models were also applied to identify potential threshold zzso 

The zzso and progression rate of diabetic zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Higher zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso longer duration of diabetes zzso per 5 year period zzso zzso zzso zzso higher zzso blood pressure zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and higher body mass index zzso per 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were associated with incident diabetic zzso The association between zzso and incident diabetic zzso was zzso the association with duration of diabetes increased rapidly between 5 and 10 zzso Higher zzso was also associated with progression of diabetic zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and progression rates of diabetic zzso seemed lower than that in western zzso zzso was the only factor associated with both zzso and progression of diabetic zzso The strength of the association between duration of diabetes and zzso of diabetic zzso increased rapidly during a period of 5 to 10 years duration of zzso
