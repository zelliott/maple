The roles of the zzso zzso II type 1 zzso zzso in the changes in white zzso tissue were explored in an animal model of zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso mice and zzso mice were zzso zzso of markers for zzso differentiation and inflammation was determined by real-time zzso zzso chain zzso 

zzso tissue weight and zzso size in zzso white zzso tissue were increased in zzso mice and zzso zzso In the zzso tissue of these models, expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which induce zzso zzso and expression of zzso factors of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso of inflammatory markers and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso mice and administration of an zzso zzso blocker, zzso to zzso mice reduced zzso zzso tissue weight and zzso size zzso zzso of the zzso zzso also reduced the expression of inflammatory zzso and zzso stress zzso Moreover, zzso zzso deletion in zzso mice and zzso zzso blockade in zzso mice prevented the decrease in expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also increased zzso zzso induced by insulin in zzso tissue of zzso zzso 

These results suggest that enlargement and weakened differentiation of zzso are observed in zzso and diabetes, and that zzso zzso blockade prevented zzso enlargement and promoted zzso differentiation in these zzso
