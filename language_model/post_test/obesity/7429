zzso zzso and insulin resistance are zzso features of patients with zzso zzso syndrome zzso Women with zzso have excess zzso of zzso fat and zzso zzso Recent findings suggest that peripheral fat may have zzso protective zzso The aim of this study was to investigate body fat distribution in patients with zzso and associations of peripheral fat with zzso and hormonal zzso 

The study included 24 patients with zzso and a control group of 13 zzso zzso evaluation and zzso X-ray zzso to determine body composition was zzso Plasma zzso and hormonal profiles were zzso 

Patients with zzso have increased proportion of central to peripheral fat ratio zzso when compared to controls zzso zzso zzso There was a positive correlation among zzso fat, insulin, zzso and zzso (all p zzso Regarding to peripheral fat there was no difference between groups, a trend to negative correlation to insulin zzso Positive correlation between free zzso index and zzso zzso zzso zzso and a negative correlation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

Patients with zzso showed an zzso pattern fat distribution when compared to zzso zzso fat contribution and its relations to zzso in this context could not be zzso zzso pattern of fat distribution showed inverse correlation to zzso levels, suggesting that zzso may be related to fat zzso
