zzso zzso rats are zzso and mildly zzso Because insulin and zzso are involved in zzso and zzso metabolism and they act via their zzso we investigated the role of insulin and zzso receptors in obese and lean female zzso zzso Because dietary zzso is more zzso than zzso we also studied the effect of dietary carbohydrates on the zzso zzso zzso effect zzso greater than zzso was observed on plasma levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of insulin and zzso to liver plasma zzso was significantly lower in obese rats than in lean zzso Lower insulin binding was due to a lower number of receptors as well as a lower zzso whereas the lower zzso binding was due only to a lower zzso zzso zzso binding in lean rats but not in obese rats was lower in zzso than in zzso zzso Diet had no effect on zzso zzso We propose that in obese zzso rats, in addition to zzso impaired zzso activity as zzso by decreased zzso binding to target zzso may be an important contributor to the zzso and zzso
