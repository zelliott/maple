To estimate the impact of body mass index zzso on surgical outcomes in patients undergoing robotic zzso 

A retrospective cohort data analysis zzso Task Force zzso zzso 

zzso teaching zzso 

A total of 77 consecutive patients from January 2005 through November 2008 with symptomatic zzso 

zzso zzso zzso 

Body mass index zzso expressed as zzso was zzso from the medical charts of all patients undergoing robotic zzso Data on estimated blood loss, procedure time, length of hospital stay, diameter of the largest zzso and zzso weight were also zzso zzso patient demographics between the groups were zzso zzso patients zzso were obese or zzso obese zzso The parameters analyzed for associations with the continuous measure of zzso included length of zzso hospital stay zzso estimated blood loss zzso and procedure zzso Median zzso procedure time among all patients was zzso minutes, zzso zzso estimated blood loss was zzso zzso zzso zzso and length of hospital stay was (1 day, zzso zzso No associations were determined between zzso and LOS zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or procedure duration zzso zzso with zzso zzso The size of the largest zzso diameter did not affect these zzso 

zzso obesity is not a risk factor for poor surgical outcome in patients undergoing robotic zzso
