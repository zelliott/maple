zzso zzso levels are a risk factor for cardiovascular zzso zzso protein 4 zzso is a zzso factor that raises plasma zzso levels by zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso individuals, the zzso coding zzso zzso has been associated with lower plasma zzso levels while the zzso zzso has been associated with more modest effects on zzso zzso The objective of this study was to determine whether zzso zzso and zzso are associated with zzso levels in the setting of obesity and zzso and whether modification of zzso levels by these genetic zzso is altered by a lifestyle intervention designed to treat zzso 

The association of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso levels was investigated in zzso participants from the Look AHEAD Clinical zzso all of whom had zzso and were at least zzso Further, we tested for an interaction between zzso and treatment effects on zzso zzso 

Among zzso White Look AHEAD participants, zzso zzso carriers had mean zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lower than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the minor zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lower than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The association of the zzso with zzso remained significant even after removing zzso carriers from the analysis zzso zzso zzso There was no interaction between the weight loss intervention and zzso on zzso zzso 

This is the first study to demonstrate that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso are associated with lower zzso levels in the setting of zzso In addition, our findings demonstrate that zzso zzso status does not alter zzso response to a lifestyle intervention in the Look AHEAD zzso
