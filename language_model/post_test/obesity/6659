The zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso is a key zzso of zzso stress responses caused by consuming a high-fat diet, including the development of zzso To test the role of zzso we examined zzso obesity in mice with targeted zzso of zzso genes in the anterior zzso zzso These mice exhibited an increase in the zzso expression of zzso hormone zzso an increase in the blood concentration of zzso hormone zzso increased energy zzso and markedly reduced obesity compared with control zzso The increased amount of zzso zzso was caused by reduced expression of type 2 zzso zzso zzso a gene that is required for zzso negative feedback regulation of zzso zzso These data establish a molecular mechanism that accounts for the regulation of energy expenditure and the development of obesity by the zzso signaling zzso
