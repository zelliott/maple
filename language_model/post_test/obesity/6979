Many patients undergoing zzso zzso or zzso fusion procedures are obese, but the contribution of obesity to complications in spine surgery has not been zzso The authors zzso assessed the prevalence of obesity in a cohort of patients undergoing zzso and zzso fusion and correlate the presence of obesity with the zzso of operative zzso 

A retrospective review of consecutive patients treated by a single surgeon zzso over a zzso period at either Rush University Medical Center or the Neurological and zzso Institute of Chicago was zzso The authors identified 332 zzso zzso and zzso spine surgery zzso the cohort was restricted to include only patients with symptomatic degenerative conditions in need of an zzso zzso or combined zzso zzso Cases of zzso zzso and infection and any case in which the procedure was performed for emergency indications were zzso A total of 97 cases were zzso of these 86 procedures performed in 84 patients had adequate follow-up material for inclusion in the present zzso A broad definition of complications was zzso zzso were divided into adverse events zzso and significant complications zzso based on their impact on patient zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to identify which variables had a significant effect on the risk of zzso zzso considered were body mass index zzso zzso weight, age, sex, presence or absence of diabetes zzso zzso and/or hypertension, number of levels fused zzso compared with zzso and type of surgery zzso The mean zzso for the cohort was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso 60 patients zzso were considered overweight or obese zzso or zzso zzso There were 42 complications in 31 patients zzso this included 19 significant complications in 17 patients zzso zzso zzso revealed that the probability of a significant complication was related to zzso zzso zzso the chance of a significant complication was zzso with a zzso of 25, zzso with a zzso of 30, and zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso were only found in extremely obese patients zzso or zzso zzso The probability of minor complication occurrence increased with age zzso zzso not zzso The rate of complications was independent of sex as well as the presence of zzso or zzso A standard collection of complications occurred, including wound infection (three zzso zzso fluid leakage zzso cases, one requiring zzso deep vein zzso zzso zzso cardiac events (four zzso symptomatic zzso (one zzso pneumonia (three zzso prolonged zzso zzso zzso zzso issues zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso pain zzso zzso 

zzso is a prevalent condition in patients undergoing zzso fusion for degenerative spinal conditions and may increase the prevalence and zzso of zzso zzso In their analysis, the authors correlated increasing zzso and increased risk of significant zzso zzso The correlation of obesity and zzso complications may assist in the zzso evaluation and selection of patients for zzso
