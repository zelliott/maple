In most centers, Upper zzso series zzso following zzso zzso zzso zzso is performed to rule out zzso zzso zzso According to the introduction of robotic technology associated with a hypothetical decrease of zzso zzso we aim to assess the zzso and cost effectiveness of early routine zzso following zzso zzso 

Between July 2006 and December 2010, 167 zzso zzso were performed at a single zzso All data were collected zzso in a zzso database and reviewed zzso Patients underwent a zzso zzso at zzso day 2 to exclude zzso leak or zzso 

None of the 167 patients who underwent an early zzso experienced leak zzso and zzso The only zzso abnormalities were two zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso all treated conservatively with zzso zzso cost for the 167 zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In most zzso the risk of zzso leak has been the rationale for obtaining an zzso following zzso However, provided low leak rates as for our experience with robotic zzso the authors show this exam to be expensive and of limited zzso A zzso zzso for on demand zzso has been developed according to patient's characteristics and is now under zzso
