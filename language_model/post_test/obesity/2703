To study whether increased maternal weight and other factors of importance is associated with higher birth weights of the children over a period of almost 25 zzso 

zzso cohort zzso 

zzso zzso in southeast zzso 

A total of zzso delivered women and their children from the years 1978, 1986, 1992, 1997, and zzso 

Analysis of zzso was used to evaluate the importance of the mother's body mass index zzso on the children's birth weights during the study years and smoking, parity, zzso zzso age, and the age of the mothers were adjusted zzso 

Weight of the offspring in relation to maternal zzso and possible zzso such as smoking, parity, zzso zzso age, and the age of the zzso 

Between 1978 and 1992, there was an increase in birth weight in each of the four zzso categories zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso even after adjustments were made for relevant background characteristics zzso However, between 1992 and 2001, the birth weight for children whose mothers had a zzso of less than 20 or between 20 and zzso decreased zzso For almost every study year, the zzso zzso was of significant influence on the children's birth zzso However, the proportion of zzso explained by the models zzso the adjusted zzso was not substantially altered when the mother's zzso was excluded from the zzso 

zzso zzso is of significance to explain trends in zzso birth weight over time, but not of sole zzso
