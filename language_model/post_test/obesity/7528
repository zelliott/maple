There is a strong rationale for intervening in early childhood to prevent zzso Over a quarter of infants gain weight more rapidly than desirable during the first six months of life putting them at greater risk of obesity in zzso However, little is known about UK zzso zzso zzso approach to primary zzso This study explored zzso knowledge of UK zzso and the beliefs and current practice of general practitioners zzso and practice nurses in relation to identifying infants at risk of developing childhood zzso 

zzso of UK zzso zzso practice zzso health visitors, zzso community and children's zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rated their confidence in providing infant feeding advice and completed the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interviews with a zzso of 12 zzso and 6 practice nurses were audio recorded, taped and transcribed zzso zzso analysis was applied using an zzso zzso zzso 

zzso were less confident about giving advice about infant feeding than health visitors zzso zzso zzso and nursery nurses zzso zzso zzso but more knowledgeable about the health risks of obesity zzso zzso than nurses zzso zzso zzso zzso who were consulted more often about feeding were less knowledgeable about the risks associated with obesity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso There was no relationship between zzso ratings of confidence in their advice and their knowledge of the obesity zzso main themes emerged from the zzso 1) zzso of childhood obesity to family environment, 2) zzso feeding advice as the health zzso role, 3) Professional reliance on anecdotal or experiential knowledge about infant zzso 4) zzso with recognition of, or lack of concern for, infants zzso zzso of becoming obese, 5) zzso relationship with parent over best practice in infant feeding and 6) Lack of shared understanding for dealing with early years' zzso 

zzso is needed to improve health visitors and nursery nurses' knowledge of obesity risk and zzso and practice nurses' capacity to identify and manage zzso at risk of developing childhood zzso zzso value strategies that maintain relationships with vulnerable families and interventions to improve their zzso around infant feeding need to take account of zzso Further research is needed to determine optimal ways of intervening with infants at risk of obesity in primary zzso
