The diabetes zzso and obese zzso zzso zzso induce a progressive, zzso condition within the zzso of the female zzso tract that promotes zzso and premature organ zzso in zzso zzso The current studies focus on the zzso changes that occur within the zzso and zzso layers of the zzso zzso during the progressive expression of these zzso which induce a zzso zzso state and promote tissue zzso and zzso Control zzso zzso diabetes zzso and obese zzso zzso groups were prepared for high resolution light zzso and transmission zzso microscopic analysis of zzso tissue samples collected from 4 zzso to 20 zzso mice, allowing for the progressive influences of the zzso aberrations on zzso structure to be zzso Compared to controls, both zzso and zzso zzso induced a dramatic increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which increased in density between 4 and 20 weeks of zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso regions of zzso cells in response to the zzso conditions typical of both zzso and zzso zzso Progressive zzso movement of the zzso pools induced a zzso isolation from surrounding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso forced zzso zzso into peripheral cell compartments and altered the zzso zzso cell profile relative to zzso These studies define the progressive, zzso zzso of zzso pools which induce a transformation of normal zzso cell types into zzso zzso The zzso zzso in cell structure disrupt normal tissue continuity and function, culminating in zzso and overt female zzso zzso
