zzso in the human gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso are associated with obesity in rare cases and the gene zzso with a reported quantitative trait zzso zzso for variations in circulating zzso levels and fat mass on human zzso zzso In this study we have used zzso chain reaction zzso and single strand zzso zzso zzso analysis, to test whether variations in the human zzso gene are associated with human zzso 

zzso zzso analysis was performed on the coding region of the zzso gene and 500 zzso of the putative promoter region, by single strand zzso analysis and sequencing, in 56 subjects with juvenile onset obesity zzso mass index zzso or zzso 31 zzso at the draft board zzso The prevalence of two zzso were further studied in 156 obese and 205 control subjects, and in a population based cohort of 380 extensively characterized young healthy zzso 

We have identified a total of six gene zzso five were silent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of which one was prevalent zzso and one zzso changed an zzso acid zzso zzso The zzso acid substitution was only seen in one zzso Comparing the prevalence of the frequent zzso silent zzso in an association study zzso 156 subjects with juvenile onset obesity and 205 randomly sampled control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso did not show any relationship to zzso Also, comparing the prevalence of a known zzso zzso zzso in the coding region of the gene between obese and lean, showed no association to zzso Furthermore, analyzing a population based cohort of 380 young healthy Caucasians for the prevalent zzso zzso as well as the 9 zzso zzso zzso did not show any association to zzso in body fat contents or zzso serum zzso zzso 

In conclusion, it is unlikely that variations in the coding region and the putative promoter of the zzso gene are a major cause of juvenile onset human zzso
