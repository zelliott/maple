Mean zzso volume zzso is zzso increasing interest as a new independent cardiovascular risk zzso 

To provide a comprehensive review on the biological significance, the main zzso and the zzso implications of zzso 

A literature search was performed using key terms, such as zzso or zzso zzso zzso together with zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso 

Large zzso are likely more zzso elevated zzso values are associated with a shortened bleeding time and increased zzso B2 plasma zzso Thus, zzso could be considered an indicator of zzso zzso zzso size is mainly determined in the bone zzso during zzso and subsequently does not substantially zzso zzso is only partially regulated by zzso in fact, growth factors and zzso may also elicit the production of larger and more zzso zzso in the bone zzso in the presence of conditions capable of increasing their zzso such as zzso zzso dysfunction and possibly zzso and cerebral zzso This phenomenon could play an important role in vascular zzso In fact zzso is zzso of stroke, acute zzso zzso zzso and zzso of coronary zzso is increased in the presence of zzso diabetes zzso zzso syndrome, zzso and stroke and has been shown to have a zzso significance in patients with stroke and zzso 

In assessing whole blood count, zzso should not be undervalued, as its increase should suggest a careful assessment of cardiovascular zzso
