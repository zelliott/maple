zzso fatty liver disease zzso is characterized by excessive zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso protein zzso is increased in zzso but whether this is zzso linked to zzso zzso metabolism is zzso We zzso that a reduction in zzso would zzso zzso zzso and improve insulin zzso 

zzso deficient zzso and zzso obese zzso mice were treated with zzso zzso zzso against zzso and effects on zzso and serum lipids and zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso specifically decreased zzso zzso and protein levels in the zzso of zzso and zzso mice, without altering the levels of other zzso zzso zzso that is, zzso and zzso zzso zzso suppressed expression of zzso zzso reduced liver zzso content without affecting cholesterol, attenuated zzso zzso and decreased serum zzso and zzso zzso zzso The reduction in zzso zzso by zzso zzso was associated with improvement in zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso 

This study demonstrates a crucial role for the zzso zzso protein zzso in regulation of zzso zzso Reduction in zzso zzso level using an zzso zzso reverses zzso zzso zzso and insulin resistance in obese mice, suggesting that zzso may be targeted for the treatment of zzso and associated zzso and zzso zzso
