zzso zzso a natural zzso extracted from zzso zzso has been used as an zzso zzso However, little is known regarding its potential action on skeletal muscle, the major site of zzso zzso zzso the purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of zzso treatment on skeletal muscle zzso transport activity in both zzso lean zzso and zzso obese zzso zzso zzso zzso was administered zzso zzso body weight by zzso 2 hours before an oral zzso tolerance test zzso Whereas the zzso incremental area under the curve zzso was not affected by zzso in lean zzso rats, the insulin incremental area under the curve zzso and the zzso index zzso of zzso and insulin zzso and zzso related to zzso insulin zzso were decreased zzso by zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, in the obese zzso zzso zzso also reduced the zzso by zzso and significantly decreased the zzso zzso and the zzso index zzso Muscle zzso transport was assessed following in zzso zzso zzso In lean zzso rats, zzso zzso transport in type I zzso and type zzso zzso muscles was not altered by zzso to zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso (2 zzso zzso transport in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso At zzso zzso or higher, the zzso effect was zzso Similarly, zzso zzso transport in zzso and zzso muscles in obese zzso rats was not changed by lower doses of zzso zzso to zzso zzso However, these lower doses of zzso significantly increased zzso zzso transport in both obese zzso and zzso zzso to zzso In conclusion, acute oral zzso increased zzso insulin sensitivity, and low zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso modestly improved in zzso insulin action on skeletal muscle zzso transport in both lean and obese zzso zzso These results indicate that one potential site of action of zzso is the skeletal muscle zzso transport zzso
