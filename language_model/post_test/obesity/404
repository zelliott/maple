zzso E zzso is a zzso factor, playing an important role in the regulation of food intake and body zzso We previously reported that zzso was present in the zzso but it is unclear which type of the cells in this brain area expressing zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso levels were significantly reduced in both genetically obese zzso zzso zzso mice and high-fat zzso obese zzso zzso rats, raising the possibility that deficient zzso signaling might be related to the change in zzso gene zzso In the present studies, using zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso is mainly present in zzso To characterize the effect of zzso on zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso mice were treated with zzso mouse zzso (3 zzso daily, zzso or vehicle for 5 zzso We found that the increased zzso zzso zzso levels occurred only in zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso or zzso mice, indicating that zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression depends upon an intact zzso zzso and this effect is not related to the changes in food intake and body zzso The reduced zzso gene expression caused by zzso which also results in relatively lower zzso level, is restored by zzso administration of zzso In addition, zzso was significantly less zzso in zzso zzso mice because these animals consumed more food and lost less weight following zzso treatment, compared with zzso zzso These observations imply that zzso zzso at least zzso mediates the zzso effects of zzso on zzso
