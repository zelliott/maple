For many years, genetically obese mouse strains have provided models for human zzso The zzso zzso one of the oldest obese mouse models, is characterized by zzso obesity and diabetes as a result of zzso expression of the zzso protein hormone, zzso zzso zzso protein is normally expressed in hair zzso to regulate pigmentation through antagonism of the zzso zzso but zzso studies have demonstrated that the hormone also has potent zzso activity for the zzso zzso zzso zzso development of the zzso knockout mouse model demonstrated that zzso plays a role in weight zzso as these mice zzso the zzso defects of the zzso zzso Further evidence for this hypothesis was obtained from pharmacological studies utilizing peptides with zzso zzso activity, that inhibited food intake (when administered zzso Additional studies with zzso zzso have now implicated the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Finally, evidence that the zzso may play a role in human obesity has been obtained from the identification of a zzso zzso of the zzso in genetically obese zzso
