The possible influence on blood zzso zzso zzso functions of the small zzso shunt operation for obesity was studied in 10 zzso overweight zzso They were investigated prior to operation and for 9 months afterwards, when they had lost an average of 32 zzso body zzso zzso they showed reduced zzso zzso capacity and increased zzso adherence compared with controls of normal zzso During the first zzso months zzso all patients displayed a gradually increasing zzso capacity, which then reached levels similar to the controls and remained so for the rest of the follow-up zzso This enhancement was more easily assessed by a new in zzso zzso in which each zzso was provided with zzso bacteria, than by a standard zzso using zzso bacteria per zzso zzso adherence decreased during the first zzso months and then returned to zzso zzso The changes in zzso functions were not statistically related either to each other or to the continuous loss of body zzso Thus, impairment of zzso killing function occurring in extremely obese patients became zzso after small zzso shunt operation, while the high adherence remained zzso
