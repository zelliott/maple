zzso zzso zzso risk is increased by obesity and physical activities zzso which mechanically stress the zzso We examined the associations of zzso zzso with body mass index zzso and activity exposure across adult life and their zzso 

Data are from a UK birth cohort of zzso participants with a clinical assessment for zzso at age zzso At ages 36, 43 and 53 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and occupational activity zzso zzso zzso zzso assigned using a zzso zzso were zzso zzso were explored using the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was strongly and positively associated with zzso in men and zzso Men and women in manual zzso also had greater odds of zzso there was a weak suggestion that zzso risk was higher among men exposed to lifting or kneeling at zzso For men, the only evidence of a zzso interaction between zzso and activities was for lifting zzso zzso zzso at age zzso zzso zzso higher zzso risk among those zzso to lift at work zzso per increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For women, the only evidence of an interaction was between zzso and zzso PA zzso zzso zzso at age zzso zzso zzso higher zzso risk among those at higher PA levels zzso per increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

At the very least, our study suggests that more active individuals (at work and in zzso may see a greater reduction in risk of zzso from avoiding a high zzso than those less zzso
