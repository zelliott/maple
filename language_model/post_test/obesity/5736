zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso zzso zzso increased visceral fat and zzso zzso fatty liver disease) all of which may contribute to zzso dysfunction, an early marker of zzso zzso disease) zzso Our objective was to examine the relationships between zzso dysfunction in zzso the volume of AT zzso zzso compartments and the size of zzso zzso zzso pools in liver and skeletal zzso A total of 19 women with zzso zzso zzso zzso and 16 control women zzso zzso were zzso zzso function was assessed in the zzso artery using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and abdominal SAT zzso zzso volume were determined by whole body zzso and liver and skeletal muscle zzso by zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso fitness and zzso zzso model assessment of zzso were also zzso zzso between groups were zzso using independent zzso zzso tests and zzso zzso of zzso zzso was impaired in zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and this difference decreased only slightly to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when zzso was adjusted for individual differences in visceral and SAT and zzso This magnitude of impairment was also similar in lean and obese zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso dysfunction in zzso is not explained by body fat distribution or zzso zzso might be a useful independent zzso tool to assess zzso risk in this zzso
