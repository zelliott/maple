We addressed this issue using a zzso database and zzso reviewing the complete medical records of all zzso cases of diabetes among Rochester, Minnesota, residents from 1950 to 1989 with a discharge diagnosis of zzso This zzso study describes the consequences of the widespread change in treatment zzso outside the confines of a controlled clinical zzso 

Among the diabetes incident zzso there were 59 subjects with confirmed first episodes of zzso during zzso 29 of 30 subjects treated with zzso occurred before zzso All 29 zzso cases occurred between 1976 and zzso Sex, zzso diabetes zzso and age at zzso were similar for the two zzso The proportion of obese individuals zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso differed between zzso The zzso group exhibited higher zzso values zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and lower zzso values zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso upon zzso The mean quantity of insulin administered was higher in the zzso group than in the zzso group zzso zzso 140 and 99 zzso 70 zzso P zzso The outcome of zzso occurred more frequently in the zzso group than in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The proportion with zzso neurological deficit, zzso zzso or mortality did not differ significantly between zzso 

Our findings suggest the introduction of zzso was accompanied by a decreased zzso of zzso
