There is evidence that zzso reduces the risk for development of diabetes and cardiovascular zzso The mechanism underlying the zzso effect is however not zzso We hypothesized that zzso observed by zzso may be the consequence of a diminished generation of zzso zzso 

zzso and obese zzso rats received a diet containing zzso zzso for 7 zzso A part of the rats was treated with zzso (15 zzso in zzso Blood zzso plasma insulin, zzso zzso and as a more specific marker of zzso stress, zzso were zzso As cellular markers of zzso stress we determined the activities of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso heart, and zzso In addition, zzso zzso activity zzso was measured in zzso 

zzso feeding of obese zzso rats resulted in increased blood zzso levels, plasma insulin, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso the activities of zzso and zzso were zzso Treatment of obese zzso rats with zzso largely prevented these changes, whereas it had no effect in lean zzso fed zzso 

zzso in obese zzso rats zzso feeding is associated with an increased zzso zzso The data provide IN zzso evidence that zzso play a role in the generation of zzso oxygen species zzso in insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso may be an important zzso of vascular dysfunction in insulin zzso Treatment with zzso is helpful to prevent the increase in zzso stress and vascular dysfunction induced by zzso
