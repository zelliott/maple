Previously we reported that zzso lean zzso zzso zzso rats had a number of zzso tissue zzso intermediate between those of zzso lean zzso and obese zzso zzso However, in young adult male rats maintained on a low-fat diet, these differences were no longer apparent zzso values for the two lean zzso were zzso In the present study we determined whether the zzso effect of the zzso gene was dependent on the consumption of a high-fat zzso Mother rats were fed high-fat diets containing either zzso zzso or coconut zzso oil throughout mating and zzso zzso lean male and female rats were zzso as well as obese male and lean zzso female zzso zzso rats were studied at 17 days of zzso Additional male rats were maintained on the same diet as their mothers until zzso weeks of zzso zzso zzso rats had higher body weights than lean zzso zzso fat pad weights and zzso weight ratios followed the pattern of obese greater than lean zzso zzso that were greater than lean zzso zzso A similar relationship was found for zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso At zzso weeks of age, zzso followed the general pattern of obese rats having greater values than lean rats zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rats had higher zzso zzso zzso activities than zzso zzso In addition, zzso rats had higher fat cell numbers than zzso zzso These results suggest that specific fatty acids can alter zzso proliferation and/or differentiation in zzso In addition, there appears to be a zzso of fatty acid regulation in zzso of genetically obese zzso The zzso effect of the zzso gene in zzso zzso rats was zzso However, high-fat feeding did not result in a zzso effect in young adult lean male zzso We will next evaluate the role of sex on this zzso
