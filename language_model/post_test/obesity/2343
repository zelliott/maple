zzso growth associations with genetic zzso identified for adult zzso may provide insights into the timing of obesity zzso 

The objective was to explore associations of known zzso zzso with measures of body size from birth to zzso 

A total of zzso individuals from a zzso British birth cohort were zzso for 11 genetic zzso robustly associated with adult zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We derived an zzso score, zzso the sum of zzso zzso in each individual, and examined this for an association with birth weight and repeated measures of weight, zzso and zzso zzso scores zzso at 11 time points between ages 2 and 53 zzso 

The zzso score showed borderline significant association with birth weight zzso zzso P zzso zzso and was more clearly associated with higher weight and zzso at all time points between ages 2 and 53 zzso the strongest associations with weight occurred at ages 11 and 20 y (both zzso zzso In zzso zzso the score was positively associated with weight gain only between birth and 11 y zzso zzso per year; zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso score was associated with taller height at 7 y zzso zzso P zzso zzso and greater height gains between 2 and 7 y zzso zzso per year; P zzso but not with adult height zzso zzso zzso 

The combined effect of adult obesity zzso zzso on weight gain was confined to zzso These zzso zzso a faster tempo of height growth that was evident before the zzso zzso
