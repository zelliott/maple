zzso zzso zzso is a common condition, associated with raised mortality and risk of major zzso and is predicted to increase due to an aging zzso 

To update earlier research of zzso zzso using UK zzso 

zzso analysis of adults aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of zzso in practices registered with the General zzso Research Database zzso in the zzso 

Using the zzso a zzso analysis was performed using zzso zzso to compare zzso incident zzso cases to zzso controls, for medical history and prior use of zzso The association between time since start of diagnosis or drug use and zzso risk was zzso using zzso zzso 

The following were confirmed as risk factors for zzso heart failure zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso heart disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso hypertension zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso being a heavy drinker zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso cerebrovascular accident zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and obesity zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso Current use of oral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso were identified as significant risk factors, and statins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso as a significant protective zzso No effect was found for current use of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso system zzso agents zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso or zzso derivatives zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso analysis found the effect of heart failure, zzso use of oral zzso and use of statins on the likelihood of developing zzso was sustained over a number of zzso 

These findings update the risk factors that are associated with zzso and confirm the protective properties of statins and the risks of zzso zzso in developing zzso but not the supposed protective qualities of zzso and zzso zzso
