To validate a zzso Disease zzso zzso system for assigning risk level for diabetes, and zzso and cardiovascular disease zzso zzso 

Two large national zzso zzso and zzso III, were used to validate zzso zzso Stage zzso metabolically zzso Stage 1: one or two zzso syndrome risk factors zzso than impaired zzso zzso zzso Stage zzso zzso or impaired zzso tolerance zzso or zzso syndrome (without zzso Stage zzso two of three zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso and Stage zzso type 2 diabetes zzso 

In the zzso study, compared with Stage 0 metabolically healthy subjects, adjusted risk for diabetes zzso increased from Stage 1 zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to Stage 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to Stage 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for trend zzso In zzso III, both cumulative zzso and multivariable adjusted zzso markedly increased for both zzso and zzso mortality with advancement of the risk stage from zzso 0 to zzso Adjustment for body mass index zzso minimally affected the risks for diabetes and zzso mortality using zzso 

zzso can discriminate a wide range of risk for diabetes, zzso zzso and zzso mortality independent of zzso and should be studied as a risk assessment tool to guide interventions that prevent and treat zzso zzso
