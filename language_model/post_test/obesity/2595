Dead zzso are at the heart of zzso structures zzso which represent a still relatively novel interface of zzso and zzso tissue zzso zzso and may be significant to human health conditions such as zzso insulin resistance, diabetes zzso zzso and cardiovascular zzso In order to provide a concise and pertinent discussion, this review highlights recent reports examining zzso and projects the likely directions of future research in this budding and fascinating zzso 

In mice, there is recent progress in understanding the differences in distribution of two distinct zzso of zzso classes with respect to dead zzso Furthermore, a detailed zzso of fat zzso differences in zzso size and CLS prevalence has begun in two genetic models of mouse zzso In humans, fat cell aging and turnover have been zzso The correlation between human zzso and early cardiovascular disease has also been zzso The zzso zzso zzso in obese humans may be zzso which would contrast with the zzso zzso of obese mouse zzso Finally, zzso has been established in both humans and mice as an important zzso zzso to dead zzso in addition to zzso zzso protein 1 and zzso motif zzso zzso zzso 

Recent updates in research on dead zzso and the biology of zzso with clinical implications for zzso dysfunction are zzso
