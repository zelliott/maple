To determine the relative rates of zzso metabolism in muscle and zzso zzso in zzso we measured zzso and zzso of free zzso or zzso into tissue slices in zzso We also measured zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso muscle and zzso zzso zzso Muscle took up more liquid from zzso than from free zzso zzso at 6 and 12 zzso of age, whereas zzso took up more from zzso The relative zzso of zzso in zzso decreased from twofold that of muscle at 6 zzso to zzso of muscle at 12 zzso zzso from zzso in zzso was faster than in zzso at both zzso zzso of zzso muscle at 12 zzso was higher than that of zzso zzso protein was higher in zzso tissue than in muscle at 12 zzso Muscle oxidized zzso of zzso obese muscles more than lean at 12 zzso AT zzso fast decreased lean zzso zzso zzso zzso did not affect obese zzso zzso zzso and decreased obese zzso zzso zzso In zzso muscle, zzso zzso is as active as in zzso zzso muscles at 12 zzso oxidized more zzso than lean and respond to a short fast by increasing the percent zzso zzso
