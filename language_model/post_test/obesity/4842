zzso and diabetes during pregnancy are associated with increased insulin resistance and higher zzso zzso In turn, insulin resistance triggers inflammatory pathways with zzso of zzso zzso 

To determine zzso signals that translate into development of excess zzso zzso we investigated the role of zzso zzso zzso as targets of inflammatory zzso 

The study was conducted at Case Western Reserve University, Department of zzso zzso 

Volunteers gave informed written consent in accordance with the Institutional Review Board zzso zzso and zzso blood samples were obtained at the time of zzso zzso section in 15 term zzso 

Neonatal zzso zzso were performed within 48 h of zzso zzso were grouped based on zzso percentage body fat as obese zzso zzso or zzso zzso and lean control zzso fat zzso zzso zzso 

The primary outcomes were zzso zzso expression and fatty acid zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso the main zzso zzso was greater zzso zzso in zzso of obese compared with control zzso and was associated with increased zzso and zzso omega-3 zzso fatty zzso zzso and zzso content was increased zzso in zzso of obese zzso zzso and zzso both induced a zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso of omega-3 fatty acids through zzso zzso zzso is associated with high zzso zzso We propose that the generation of zzso zzso zzso through zzso and zzso stimulation represents a key mechanism to favor excess fetal fat zzso
