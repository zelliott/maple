To investigate long-term effects of zzso zzso zzso weight-loss supplement, on zzso and zzso fatty liver disease in obese zzso 

zzso zzso mice were fed a high-fat diet zzso 45 zzso zzso with or without zzso zzso zzso for 16 zzso The zzso contained 45 zzso fat, 20 zzso protein and 35 zzso zzso They were given free access to food and distilled water, and food consumption and body weight were measured daily and weekly, zzso Data were expressed as the mean zzso zzso zzso analyses were performed using the statistical package for the social science software zzso zzso zzso test was used to assess the differences between the zzso zzso significance was considered at P zzso 

There were no significant changes in body weight and food intake between the zzso However, the supplementation of zzso significantly lowered visceral fat zzso and zzso size via zzso of fatty acid zzso activity and its zzso expression in visceral zzso zzso along with enhanced zzso activity and gene expression involved in zzso fatty acid zzso Moreover, zzso supplementation resulted in significant reductions in zzso intolerance and the plasma zzso level in the zzso zzso However, we first demonstrated that it increased zzso collagen zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels of genes related to zzso stress zzso zzso and zzso zzso and inflammatory responses zzso necrosis zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as plasma zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels, although zzso zzso zzso was not zzso 

zzso protects against zzso obesity by modulating zzso fatty acid synthesis and zzso but zzso zzso fibrosis, inflammation and zzso zzso
