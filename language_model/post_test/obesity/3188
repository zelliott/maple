Our aim was to estimate the national prevalence of overweight and obesity in Swiss primary schoolchildren and to determine if zzso is increasing in this age zzso 

We used a zzso zzso zzso cluster sampling of primary schools throughout Switzerland to obtain a representative national sample of zzso year old children zzso zzso zzso Height and weight were measured and used to calculate body mass index zzso zzso references from the zzso Centers for Disease Control and Prevention zzso and the International zzso Task Force zzso were used to define zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso thickness zzso was measured and used to calculate body fat percentage zzso zzso and zzso were compared to data from zzso year old Swiss children in the zzso and zzso 

zzso and zzso were well correlated in both boys and girls zzso zzso zzso Using the zzso references, the prevalence of overweight and obesity was zzso and zzso in boys and zzso and zzso in zzso Using the zzso references, the prevalence of overweight and obesity was zzso and zzso in boys and zzso and zzso in zzso There was no significant age or gender difference in the prevalence of overweight or zzso At all ages, boys and girls had zzso higher mean zzso than Swiss children from the zzso and zzso Using the current zzso zzso references, the prevalence of overweight has increased more than zzso in Swiss children since the zzso 

These findings suggest there has been a striking increase in zzso and the prevalence of overweight and obesity in Swiss children in the last two zzso
