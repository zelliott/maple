The zzso rhythm of zzso metabolism in liver and skeletal muscle was studied in lean and gold zzso zzso zzso zzso The active forms of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the total activity of these zzso were measured every three hours over a 24 h period in mice fed ad zzso zzso and muscle zzso content displayed a marked zzso rhythm that was similar in lean and obese zzso In skeletal muscle the zzso content, zzso and zzso were not significantly different in lean and obese animals over the 24 h zzso The activities of muscle zzso and zzso were constant in both groups despite the zzso variation in the muscle zzso zzso The absence of an increase in the zzso content of skeletal muscle despite the pronounced zzso and zzso in the obese mice, may indicate the degree of insulin resistance in this tissue or the zzso capacity of muscle tissue to store zzso In liver, zzso concentration and total zzso storage were higher in obese zzso Unlike muscle, both zzso zzso and zzso underwent significant changes in activity over the 24 h zzso zzso zzso was lower and zzso was higher in obese zzso The zzso rhythm in zzso activities was independent of both blood zzso and insulin zzso The total zzso storage and the activities of total zzso and zzso were significantly increased in the liver from zzso obese mice over a 24 h period and could be implicated in the development of insulin resistance and zzso intolerance in this model of zzso
