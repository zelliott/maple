The zzso nucleus of the zzso zzso is a key component of zzso pathways regulating energy balance, and zzso is required for normal development of zzso zzso zzso obesity zzso has a zzso mode of zzso and zzso individuals develop the zzso syndrome when a moderate amount of fat is added to the zzso Here we demonstrate that rats selectively bred to develop zzso which are known to be zzso resistant before they become obese, have defective zzso projections that persist into zzso Furthermore, the ability of zzso to activate zzso signaling in zzso zzso in zzso and to promote zzso zzso outgrowth in zzso is significantly reduced in zzso zzso Thus, animals that are genetically predisposed toward obesity display an abnormal organization of zzso pathways involved in energy zzso that may be the result of diminished responsiveness of zzso zzso to the zzso actions of zzso during zzso zzso
