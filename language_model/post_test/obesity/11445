To determine the prevalence of elevated zzso protein zzso in the Sandy Lake zzso an zzso community residing in the Sioux zzso zone of Northwestern Ontario, Canada, and to determine the associations of obesity and diabetes with zzso in a community with a very high prevalence of type II zzso 

We surveyed 512 community members aged 18 y and older to determine the prevalence and the zzso of elevated zzso in Sandy zzso 

Clinical zzso zzso of obesity and serum zzso of zzso insulin, serum zzso A zzso and zzso zzso 

The prevalence of zzso zzso was significantly higher in women than in men zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis determined that body mass index and zzso were independent zzso of zzso concentration in women and waist circumference and zzso were independent zzso of zzso concentration in zzso Diabetes was associated with elevated zzso in both zzso but was only a moderate strong zzso in zzso concentration in zzso zzso zzso 

The prevalence of elevated zzso in this zzso community is remarkably zzso These data further demonstrate that the association between zzso and specific zzso of obesity and metabolism vary according to gender and zzso zzso
