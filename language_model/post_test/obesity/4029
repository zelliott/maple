This study evaluated the possibility that zzso bypass surgery alters energy balance and regulation of body zzso In two sets of experiments, male zzso rats underwent bypass or sham bypass zzso In experiment 1, half of each group was overfed and half was zzso zzso reduced net calorie intake zzso - zzso zzso at 2 zzso but not at 6 zzso Body weights were maintained at a much lower level in the bypass rats, yet apparent energy expenditure was zzso In experiment 2, bypass rats were compared with sham bypass and sham bypass who were food restricted for zzso to bypass zzso zzso Net calorie intake and body weights of bypass and sham bypass followed a similar pattern as in experiment zzso At similar levels of body weight zzso bypass rats required more calories per zzso than did the zzso zzso suggesting that bypass zzso downward the level at which body weight is zzso zzso requirements correlated with food intake better than with absolute body zzso Further studies to determine the mechanism of altered energy expenditure may provide methods for weight loss without extensive zzso
