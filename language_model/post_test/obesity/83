zzso zzso and zzso synthesis were examined in young rats of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both lean and obese zzso rats were zzso zzso state 3 zzso was highest in zzso from zzso rats and least in zzso from obese zzso zzso zzso state 3 zzso was highest in the zzso group and least in the zzso zzso There appeared to be no relationship between oxygen consumption and the genetic tendency for zzso zzso zzso synthesis was greatest in the obese zzso rats and least in the zzso zzso zzso in liver weights and zzso yields may explain, in part, these observed strain differences in zzso zzso
