To evaluate the effect of risk factors for coronary artery disease zzso on zzso zzso zzso expression on zzso 

A total of 106 patients were enrolled and divided into five zzso groups: zzso with hypertension, zzso with zzso zzso with hypertension + zzso zzso with zzso + obesity and thirty with hypertension + zzso + zzso zzso healthy volunteers were recruited as control zzso zzso expression of zzso and mean zzso intensity index zzso zzso of zzso were measured by flow zzso zzso 

No difference in zzso zzso expression was detected between hypertension and control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso expression was raised to zzso zzso zzso in zzso group, a zzso and a zzso increase compared with those in hypertension zzso and control group zzso zzso When combined with zzso zzso expression was elevated further to zzso zzso zzso in hypertension + obesity group, zzso zzso zzso in zzso + obesity group and zzso zzso zzso in hypertension + zzso + obesity group, all having statistical significance compared with control group or hypertension group zzso The results were the same when corrected by age, zzso and zzso zzso zzso Index was increased from zzso zzso zzso in control group to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso group and hypertension + obesity group, respectively, zzso Linear zzso analysis revealed a significant correlation between zzso expression and zzso concentration in zzso group, zzso zzso 

zzso expression was elevated on zzso in patients with risk factors for zzso zzso and obesity may contribute to the increase of zzso zzso
