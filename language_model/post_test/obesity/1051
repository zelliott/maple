zzso children and adults, particularly those with abdominal zzso have an elevated serum zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso are generally higher in whites than in blacks, and the relation of obesity to zzso zzso may be stronger in zzso However, there is little information on the relation of obesity to the metabolically distinct zzso of zzso in zzso 

The objective was to examine possible differences between blacks zzso zzso zzso and whites zzso zzso zzso in mean zzso of zzso in mean zzso of small and large zzso and in the relation of waist circumference to zzso of zzso and zzso zzso 

We measured zzso zzso zzso and assessed the relation of various obesity indexes to zzso in a zzso study of zzso to zzso 

The mean zzso concentration was zzso zzso zzso zzso higher in white than in black children, primarily because of a zzso zzso difference in mean zzso of large zzso In contrast, the mean zzso of small zzso differed by only zzso zzso zzso In addition, the relations of waist zzso to zzso of zzso and large zzso were zzso to zzso stronger among white children than among black zzso Although white children had higher zzso of large zzso than did black children, this difference increased from zzso to zzso zzso across zzso of waist zzso zzso circumference was not significantly related to zzso of small zzso 

These contrasting associations with zzso which differ between white and black children, suggest that information on zzso zzso could provide additional information on the risk of zzso zzso heart zzso
