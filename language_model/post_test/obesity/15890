To investigate the role of zzso in zzso male zzso and zzso obese mice were treated with a zzso zzso zzso zzso or control zzso at 25 zzso or saline zzso for 6 and 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso and activity by zzso in liver and fat zzso in both zzso Compared with controls, treatment with zzso zzso did not change food intake but lowered body weight, fat pad weight, and whole body fat zzso The treatment increased zzso zzso In addition, the treatment markedly reduced plasma cholesterol levels and improved liver zzso and insulin zzso These positive observations were accompanied by the following zzso 1) increased zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso 2) reduced zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso in zzso and 3) reduced zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso and increased levels of zzso and zzso by more than twofold in zzso zzso zzso mice demonstrated reduced levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and increased levels of zzso zzso in liver and fat in response to zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso showed decreased rates of de zzso zzso and fatty acid synthesis and an increased rate of fatty acid zzso These results indicate that zzso of zzso expression in major peripheral zzso can improve zzso via increasing fuel combustion and decreasing zzso and could therefore provide clinical benefit for the treatment of obesity and related zzso zzso
