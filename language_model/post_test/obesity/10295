zzso determining rates of energy expenditure zzso under zzso conditions is important in understanding the mechanisms involved in the development and prevention of zzso zzso carts are not portable enough for most zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to compare a portable, handheld indirect zzso device zzso zzso Golden, zzso to a zzso cart zzso zzso Corporation, zzso zzso during 3 different zzso zzso 

zzso was measured by both the handheld zzso zzso minutes) and the zzso cart zzso minutes) in 20 healthy subjects zzso years of zzso zzso were made during 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso rest zzso zzso zzso rest zzso energy zzso zzso and zzso while walking in place zzso energy zzso zzso 

There were no significant differences between the means of the cart vs the hand-held device for zzso zzso zzso SE; zzso 1552 zzso 64 vs zzso zzso zzso FEE zzso zzso 99 vs 1825 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 218 vs zzso zzso zzso The range over which the techniques were tested was zzso zzso The agreement between the 2 methods was excellent for zzso zzso p zzso FEE zzso p zzso and zzso zzso p zzso 

Compared with the zzso cart, the handheld device provided similar estimates of energy expenditure during resting, zzso and physically active zzso This suggests that portable indirect zzso devices can provide reliable and valuable information in zzso research situations for which zzso energy expenditure is zzso zzso
