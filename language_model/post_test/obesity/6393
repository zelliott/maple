Fourteen pairs of obese female zzso twins were recruited for a study of genetic influences on serum and zzso fatty acid zzso zzso Following 1 zzso of zzso stabilization, zzso serum and zzso tissue obtained by surgical zzso were analyzed by zzso and gas zzso zzso zzso zzso for individual zzso were assessed by zzso rank correlation and by analysis of zzso and were found in serum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso With two exceptions zzso zzso and zzso zzso these zzso were limited to the zzso zzso zzso had significant zzso in four zzso zzso in serum zzso and zzso zzso zzso was strongly correlated with multiple measures of zzso In contrast to other zzso zzso serum zzso zzso zzso had 12 zzso of which 6 were essential zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The PC zzso could not be explained by analysis of zzso zzso food zzso After dividing the pairs into two groups differing and zzso according to fat intake of individuals in the pair, there was no evidence of a zzso interaction between fat intake and zzso zzso The zzso for zzso zzso indicate that there is active genetic control of either food choices or zzso zzso zzso The high level of zzso in the PC fraction in contrast to the other zzso zzso suggests strong genetic influence over selection of specific zzso for this membrane fraction independent of zzso
