Previous studies showed an association of the common functional zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene with survival in heart failure zzso and/or coronary artery disease zzso The aim of the study was to search for other zzso in selected regions of the zzso gene in Polish zzso and zzso patients, and to analyze their associations with obesity and zzso zzso 2, 3, 5, and 7 of zzso were scanned for zzso in 97 patients with zzso without zzso zzso zzso 104 patients with zzso zzso and 200 newborns from zzso Poland using zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso chain zzso zzso length zzso zzso and direct zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso as well as novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequence zzso were similar in the three groups, but zzso zzso zzso was less frequent in the combined zzso zzso and zzso groups than in the controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with lower zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso and zzso with higher zzso zzso prevalence of diabetes or zzso in relation to zzso zzso zzso obesity was more frequent in zzso patients than in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Nine genes containing zzso linked with zzso zzso zzso were found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso nonsense zzso is associated with reduced prevalence of diabetes and obesity in patients with zzso or zzso but zzso substitution seems to exert opposite zzso effects and should always be accounted for in the studies of the zzso zzso
