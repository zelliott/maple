zzso syndrome zzso zzso is one of the risk factors of zzso vascular diseases related to visceral fat zzso However, it is well known that morbidity and mortality of zzso zzso patients are associated with zzso and zzso rather than zzso representing zzso zzso The risk of visceral fat zzso or Met S in HD patients remains zzso zzso we evaluated zzso and Met S in HD patients using various markers of obesity by means of zzso zzso analysis zzso and zzso zzso 

The subjects comprised 52 patients who were undergoing maintenance zzso In addition to a general physical examination and routine blood tests, zzso insulin zzso zzso model assessment for insulin resistance zzso serum zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso measured before zzso Furthermore, we measured various body fluid zzso such as the ratio of zzso water to total body water zzso body fat mass zzso percent body zzso and visceral fat zzso zzso using a body composition zzso zzso zzso zzso as a marker of zzso 

There was no significant difference between HD patients with and without Met S for zzso zzso was positively correlated with age, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso correlated with serum zzso level, zzso and serum zzso However, no significant correlations were observed between zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso P product, zzso zzso zzso and zzso The serum zzso level was significantly lower in Met S than in zzso zzso In addition, the zzso level was positively correlated with zzso and zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso and various markers of obesity zzso zzso zzso and zzso In a multiple zzso analysis for zzso the zzso ratio and serum zzso level, as well as age and zzso zzso were independent zzso for the enhancement of zzso in HD zzso 

The present study demonstrated that the zzso ratio and low serum zzso level, but not Met S or zzso could be risk factors for the acceleration of zzso in HD zzso In addition, the results showed that the relationship between zzso an zzso factor, and body fat or zzso metabolism were also maintained in HD zzso
