An automatic zzso control system zzso zzso was used to calculate the insulin area zzso required to keep zzso within the normal range during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was calculated by adding total zzso insulin to insulin infused by the zzso system zzso zzso zzso During the test, zzso was obliged to follow a mean normal curve using an insulin infusion according to a special zzso which automatically adapted to individual zzso variations during the different stages of zzso Fourteen blood samples were collected to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and hormones zzso C zzso zzso Data on zzso and zzso were used to calculate the respective areas under the total and incremental curve zzso expressed in zzso zzso and zzso expressed in zzso an insulin resistance index was then calculated zzso and zzso using the following formula: zzso zzso zzso This test allows us: a) to evaluate the insulin zzso response to a standard zzso stimulus represented by a zzso curve within the normal zzso b) to calculate the quantity of insulin necessary to maintain the zzso curve within the normal zzso c) to evaluate the body's total insulin resistance according to an index calculated on the basis of the insulin area zzso zzso to compare the calculated insulin resistance index with zzso and zzso data obtained during the zzso zzso to identify the exact evolution of these events over time during zzso
