We sought to study zzso zzso function and carotid zzso thickness zzso both early markers of zzso in overweight compared to normal zzso 

zzso zzso 

A total of 36 zzso overweight children zzso mass index zzso mean zzso aged 9-12 y and 36 zzso and zzso zzso healthy children zzso from a school zzso 

The key parameters were: zzso zzso zzso function zzso zzso zzso and carotid artery zzso The secondary parameters measured included body fat content, zzso ratio zzso blood pressures, blood zzso insulin and zzso 

The two groups were well matched for blood pressures, cholesterol and zzso levels, but zzso zzso body fat zzso zzso zzso zzso blood insulin zzso and zzso levels zzso were higher in obese zzso zzso was associated with impaired zzso zzso function zzso vs zzso zzso and increased carotid zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso The degree of zzso dysfunction correlated with zzso zzso on zzso zzso 

zzso even of zzso degree, is independently associated with abnormal zzso function and structure in otherwise healthy young zzso
