The zzso administration of a 4 zzso dose of zzso zzso zzso to zzso leads to zzso death in the zzso zzso nucleus, which leads in turn to obesity in the adult zzso However, few studies have investigated the effects on the enteric nervous zzso This study evaluated the effects of the zzso administration of zzso on the frequency and zzso of the zzso as well as the zzso wall zzso of adult zzso male zzso 

zzso preparations of zzso samples were stained by the zzso or zzso zzso zzso For zzso processing, zzso and zzso zzso was zzso 

The treatment with zzso led to zzso as shown by the higher values for Lee's index and the weights of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso revealed a significantly larger zzso density in the zzso group, which is explained by smaller physical growth and a reduction in the weight of the small zzso The mean zzso profile did not change between zzso The zzso zzso zzso kept its zzso density but its average cellular profile was reduced in the zzso zzso A zzso analysis of the zzso wall, muscular layer, zzso and zzso zzso showed that their characteristics did not zzso 

The treatment with zzso did not cause zzso of the total zzso population of the zzso but it influenced the zzso zzso From the maintenance of the zzso parameters of the zzso zzso wall, we zzso that zzso function was preserved in obese zzso
