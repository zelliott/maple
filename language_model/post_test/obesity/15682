In the last decade, the zzso zzso Quality Initiative zzso zzso have enhanced the longevity of patients with zzso zzso disease zzso on zzso zzso surgeons are increasingly challenged to provide vascular access for patients in whom options for access in the upper zzso have been zzso This situation is even more problematic in the zzso obese patient on zzso Our group previously reported a high rate of infection and need for secondary interventions in obese patients with prosthetic zzso zzso We now report a series of patients who underwent placement of a prosthetic zzso loop zzso This study presents our technique and evaluates our results, particularly as they relate to the obese zzso 

From January 1998 to May 2006, 34 prosthetic zzso loop zzso were placed in 32 patients with zzso Eleven patients (12 zzso were obese, as defined by a body mass zzso zzso Median follow-up was 16 zzso zzso analysis was used to determine primary and secondary zzso as well as patient survival for the entire cohort and for the obese and zzso patient zzso Survival zzso were compared using the zzso test for equality over zzso 

The secondary zzso rate was 59% at 1 year zzso 18 zzso The zzso patient survival was zzso zzso occurred in zzso zzso zzso of the obese vs zzso zzso demonstrated no statistically significant difference in zzso primary zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso or secondary zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso There were no infections in the obese zzso 

These data show that the prosthetic zzso loop access has acceptable outcomes and should be considered the zzso vascular access procedure of choice in the obese patient on zzso
