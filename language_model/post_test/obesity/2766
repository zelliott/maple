Recent studies have demonstrated that zzso fatty acid binding proteins zzso may play a role in the zzso of insulin zzso The aim of our study was to assess serum zzso levels in obese patients with type 2 diabetes zzso zzso before and after 3 months of treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso and to explore the relationship of zzso to zzso parameters and measures of insulin sensitivity assessed by zzso zzso We measured zzso parameters by standard laboratory methods, insulin sensitivity by zzso clamp and serum zzso of zzso by commercial zzso kit in 11 obese females with zzso before and after three months of treatment with zzso zzso zzso and in 10 lean healthy control women zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso higher in zzso group relative to C and were not affected by zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso before zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso p zzso for C zzso zzso before zzso zzso during the clamp significantly suppressed zzso levels in both C and zzso zzso zzso levels positively correlated with zzso zzso levels, blood zzso zzso zzso zzso index and insulin zzso An inverse relationship was found between zzso and HDL levels, zzso clearance rate of zzso zzso and zzso sensitivity zzso We conclude that zzso levels are closely related to zzso parameters of insulin sensitivity, HDL levels and measures of diabetes zzso This combination makes zzso a valuable marker of zzso disturbances in patients with type 2 diabetes zzso
