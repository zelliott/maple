zzso tissue in obesity is thought to be exposed to various zzso predominantly in zzso zzso We recently reported that zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso and zzso zzso zzso are more highly expressed and activated in human zzso zzso zzso tissue in zzso 

The aim was to investigate upstream components of the pathways that culminate in zzso of zzso and zzso 

zzso and expression of zzso were studied in paired samples of zzso and zzso zzso tissue from lean and obese subjects of two different zzso zzso zzso 36 and zzso zzso zzso by Western and real-time zzso zzso The association with fat distribution, zzso zzso insulin sensitivity, and zzso metabolism was assessed by correlation zzso 

The amount of zzso forms of the zzso provided evidence for an activated zzso zzso consisting of the zzso zzso (but not zzso or zzso and the zzso zzso zzso (but not zzso specifically in zzso zzso zzso was more highly expressed in predominantly zzso obese persons and most strongly correlated with estimated visceral zzso Diabetes was associated with higher zzso zzso only in the lean zzso In zzso zzso zzso strongly correlated with zzso but the zzso increase in zzso could largely be attributed to the zzso cell zzso Finally, zzso zzso analyses revealed zzso as an independent predictor of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

An zzso zzso reflects zzso stress associated with zzso tissue zzso linking visceral zzso to zzso insulin resistance in zzso
