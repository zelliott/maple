zzso originates from a failure of the zzso control systems, which may be affected by changing environmental zzso Basically, the obesity risk depends on two important zzso factors: zzso genetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exposure to environmental risks zzso physical activity zzso Common zzso zzso at candidate genes for obesity may act as effect zzso for environmental zzso More than zzso candidate genes for obesity have been reported and there is evidence to support the role of zzso genes in at least five different zzso zzso interactions imply that the zzso between zzso and environment deviates from either the additive or zzso effect (the underlying model needs to be specified to appraise the nature of the zzso zzso the details of these interactions is a complex zzso zzso should be placed on the accuracy of the assessment methods for both zzso and lifestyle zzso zzso study design zzso zzso is crucial in avoiding false zzso and ensuring that studies have enough power to detect significant zzso the ideal design being a zzso zzso study within a zzso A growing number of studies are examining the influence of zzso interactions on obesity in either zzso zzso or intervention zzso Positive evidence has been obtained for genes involved in zzso zzso metabolism or energy regulation such as zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso or zzso proteins 1, 2 and zzso zzso on other genes relating to appetite regulation such as zzso and zzso receptors have also been zzso Examples of some zzso interactions are zzso
