In high income countries there has been little improvement in zzso rates over the past two zzso Previous studies have indicated an ethnic disparity in the rate of zzso This study aimed to determine whether maternal ethnicity is independently associated with late zzso in New zzso 

Cases were women with a zzso late zzso zzso 28 zzso zzso without zzso zzso born between July 2006 and June 2009 in zzso New zzso Two controls with ongoing zzso were randomly selected at the same gestation at which the zzso zzso Women were interviewed in the first few weeks following zzso or at the equivalent gestation for zzso zzso demographic data were zzso The study was powered to detect an odds ratio of 2, with a power of zzso at the zzso level of significance, given a prevalence of the risk factor of zzso A multivariable zzso model was developed which adjusted for known risk factors for zzso as well as significant risk factors identified in the current study, and adjusted odds ratios and zzso confidence intervals were zzso 

zzso zzso cases and zzso zzso controls zzso Pacific ethnicity, overweight and zzso zzso not being married, not being in paid work, social zzso exposure to tobacco smoke and use of recreational drugs were associated with an increased risk of late zzso in zzso zzso zzso overweight and zzso zzso zzso not being married and not being in paid work were independently associated with late zzso in multivariable analysis, whereas Pacific ethnicity was no longer significant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Pacific ethnicity was not found to be an independent risk factor for late zzso in this New Zealand zzso The disparity in zzso rates between Pacific and European women can be attributed to zzso factors such as maternal obesity and high zzso
