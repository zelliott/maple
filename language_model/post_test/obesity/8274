zzso evidence exists regarding whether obesity is independently associated with coronary artery calcium zzso a measure of coronary zzso We examined an independent association of obesity with prevalent zzso among samples of zzso groups whose background populations have varying levels of obesity and coronary heart disease zzso 

We zzso a zzso sample of zzso men, aged zzso years free of clinical cardiovascular disease recruited in zzso 310 Japanese in Japan zzso zzso Koreans in South Korea zzso 300 Japanese Americans zzso and 308 zzso in the USA zzso We defined prevalent zzso as an zzso score of zzso zzso zzso was calculated by zzso of the body mass index zzso in each ethnic group and was plotted against the corresponding median of zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso was conducted to examine whether an association of the zzso was independent of conventional risk zzso The median zzso and crude prevalence of zzso for JJ, zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 12, 11, 32, and 26 zzso zzso Despite the absolute difference in levels of zzso and zzso across groups, higher zzso was generally associated with higher prevalent zzso in each zzso After adjusting for age, smoking, alcohol, hypertension, zzso and diabetes zzso the zzso was positively and independently associated with prevalent zzso in JJ, zzso zzso but not in zzso 

In this zzso study, obesity was independently associated with zzso stage of coronary zzso among men aged zzso years regardless of the zzso zzso
