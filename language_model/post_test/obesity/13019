zzso studies in humans provide a method to test hypotheses about the biological roles of specific zzso So far, ten published papers have chosen to examine the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso influence energy expenditure and/or body fat zzso These genes were chosen because they are candidate energy expenditure zzso based on their zzso to zzso Studies of zzso and zzso are zzso intertwined because the two genes are separated by only zzso base pairs on human zzso zzso zzso studies in families have suggested that zzso and/or zzso or a closely linked zzso may influence resting zzso rate zzso Some association studies using a 3' untranslated region zzso zzso of zzso have produced statistically positive evidence for association with body mass index zzso and zzso In contrast, association studies of zzso using an Ala to Val zzso at zzso acid 55 have produced negative zzso Positive results have also been reported for association of a zzso zzso zzso with respiratory zzso in African zzso In addition, no studies have reported linkage or association of zzso or zzso with zzso Overall, the results suggest that some zzso of zzso and zzso may be associated with obesity traits in some zzso The zzso to date, show positive results in associations with obesity traits but not with diabetes zzso Further work will be needed to settle the role of zzso and zzso zzso in human body weight zzso
