Similar to the zzso zzso zzso the chicken zzso zzso zzso gene consists of four zzso separated by three zzso and encodes a 132 zzso acid protein termed the zzso fatty zzso protein zzso In the current study, a novel zzso zzso in zzso 3 of the chicken zzso gene was identified associated with different chicken breeds that leads to either zzso or zzso at zzso acid 89 of the zzso zzso The zzso chicken averages zzso abdominal fat and expresses the G zzso zzso 89 zzso while the zzso chicken typically has zzso abdominal fat and expresses the A zzso zzso 89 zzso zzso corresponding to the two zzso zzso were cloned and expressed in zzso coli as zzso zzso zzso by using zzso zzso zzso zzso and evaluated for zzso binding using the fluorescent surrogate zzso zzso zzso acid zzso The results showed that zzso zzso exhibited a lower zzso affinity with apparent zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso while the zzso zzso zzso bound zzso with an apparent zzso constant of zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso may influence chicken zzso function and ultimately zzso deposition through changing the zzso activity of zzso
