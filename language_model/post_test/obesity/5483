zzso in older persons is characterized by increased zzso blood pressure, and isolated zzso hypertension zzso is the most common type of hypertension in this zzso It is thought that zzso results from zzso vascular stiffening and reduced compliance that can be revealed and zzso by analysis of zzso pressure zzso zzso of pulse wave zzso and other related measures has shown that zzso zzso increases with advancing age and other cardiovascular zzso risk factors including hypertension, the zzso syndrome, diabetes, zzso zzso and elevated zzso zzso Many of these relationships have been demonstrated in patients without clinical zzso disease and are independent of patient zzso zzso zzso is significantly and independently associated with both target organ damage and increased risk for zzso morbidity and zzso The mechanisms underlying zzso and zzso zzso stiffening are not fully zzso However, assessment of changes in gene expression associated with increased zzso zzso and gene zzso that increase the risk for vascular stiffening suggests that components of the zzso system, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso components may all be involved in this zzso zzso aimed at these targets may reduce vascular zzso lower zzso blood pressure, decrease the prevalence of zzso and improve outcomes for patients zzso older zzso with hypertension or other zzso zzso
