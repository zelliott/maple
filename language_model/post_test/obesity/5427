The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of zzso zzso zzso in the gene zzso the human zzso zzso zzso on obesity and insulin action in zzso 

We screened 24 individuals for zzso in zzso Six zzso zzso were zzso in 188 lean and 176 obese otherwise healthy women for whom common blood chemistry zzso were also zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso in a subset of 117 lean and 174 obese zzso 

The zzso zzso which is located in the zzso region of zzso was associated with zzso zzso of zzso and stimulation of zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso Three zzso zzso were associated with circulating levels of zzso None of the six zzso zzso or zzso zzso were associated with zzso calculated percent body fat, waist zzso circulating levels of zzso or insulin, or zzso model assessment of insulin resistance, which was used as an estimate of in zzso insulin zzso 

Our results are in agreement with a threshold model of zzso for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, in which specific genetic zzso regulate intermediate molecular zzso When an zzso set of zzso zzso at such zzso exceeds a zzso clinical disease zzso zzso in zzso appears to be a zzso that is particularly sensitive to variation in zzso
