Mechanical joint stress imposed by high body mass index zzso is associated with increased risk of knee and hip zzso This prospective study investigated the independent and joint association of zzso and physical exercise on risk of knee and hip zzso 

The study includes zzso women and zzso men in the Norwegian HUNT Study without pain or physical impairment at zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was assessed at 11 years of zzso 

zzso was positively related to risk of knee zzso zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso in women and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso in men, comparing obese and normal weight zzso No clear association was observed for hip zzso zzso increased the risk of severe zzso zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso in women and men, zzso Physical exercise did not modify the above associations zzso Exercise intensity was not associated with risk of zzso in any zzso zzso that is, obese persons reporting high-intensity exercise had an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for severe zzso compared with inactive zzso 

High zzso increases the risk of knee zzso and severe zzso Physical exercise does not increase the risk of zzso at any level of zzso suggesting that exercise could be encouraged also among individuals with excessive body mass, without concern for an increased risk of zzso
