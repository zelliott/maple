zzso zzso syndrome zzso and obesity are associated with cardiovascular disease, but it is unclear to what extent they contribute zzso zzso zzso might link obesity and zzso to cardiovascular zzso 

Our objective was to investigate whether zzso in the presence or absence of obesity is linked with zzso zzso 

We conducted a zzso study, including 31 obese (18 with zzso and 39 lean zzso with zzso zzso 

Estimates of zzso zzso were obtained by zzso zzso and compliance of zzso zzso and zzso zzso carotid elastic zzso and zzso zzso and pulse wave transit time analyses zzso pulse wave zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso women, with or without zzso had stiffer arteries than lean zzso After adjustment for zzso mean zzso pressure and age, obesity was zzso associated with the zzso zzso and carotid zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and with the zzso and carotid compliance zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso but not with the zzso compliance zzso zzso zzso zzso Young's elastic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pulse wave zzso and zzso zzso index zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with waist circumference as key independent variable gave broadly similar zzso In contrast, zzso was not associated with zzso zzso estimates after adjustment for the presence of zzso 

In young obese women with zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso itself, is associated with increased zzso zzso These data emphasize that, from the perspective of cardiovascular risk reduction, the focus should be on central fat mass reduction in obese women with zzso
