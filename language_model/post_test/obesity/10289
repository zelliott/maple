Although there is increasing interest in how environmental factors influence food zzso there are mixed results and misunderstandings of how proximity and visibility influence consumption volume and contribute to zzso The objective of this paper is to examine two questions: first, how does the proximity and zzso of a food influence consumption zzso Second, are zzso foods consumed more frequently because they are zzso or are they consumed more frequently because people lose track of how much they zzso 

The zzso study involved the chocolate candy consumption of 40 adult zzso The study zzso a 2 zzso 2 zzso design where candy proximity was crossed with zzso Proximity was manipulated by placing the chocolates on the desk of the participant or 2 m from the zzso zzso was manipulated by placing the chocolates in covered bowls that were either clear or zzso Chocolates were replenished each evening, and placement conditions were rotated every zzso Daily consumption was noted and follow-up questionnaires were distributed and zzso 

There were main effects for both proximity and zzso People ate an average of zzso more candies each day when they were visible, and zzso candies more when they were zzso placed on their desk vs 2 m zzso It is important to note, however, that there was a significant tendency for participants to consistently underestimate their daily consumption of zzso placed candies zzso and overestimate their daily consumption of less zzso placed candies zzso 

These results show that the proximity and visibility of a food can consistently increase an zzso consumption of zzso In addition, these results suggest that people may be biased to overestimate the consumption of foods that are less zzso and to underestimate those that are more zzso Knowing about these zzso tendencies is important for those attempting effectively monitor their consumption of fat and zzso
