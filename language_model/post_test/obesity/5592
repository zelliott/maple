In this study, the authors assessed the zzso system and zzso tolerance in obese and non-obese women chronically treated with typical antipsychotic drugs zzso In particular, we tested the hypotheses that these subjects display zzso and increased insulin resistance compared to healthy zzso controls, as these abnormalities create a tendency towards excessive body weight zzso Twenty-six zzso women were matched with 26 healthy women by age, body mass index and day of the zzso zzso The following serum variables were evaluated in each zzso zzso tolerance after an oral zzso overload, insulin, zzso zzso zzso hormones, adrenal steroids and zzso Compared to controls, zzso women displayed significantly higher levels of zzso zzso insulin after 60 zzso of the zzso overload, zzso zzso stimulating hormone and zzso with lower levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso and zzso did not differ between the zzso Thus, women treated with typical zzso appeared to display more insulin resistance than healthy controls, zzso them to excessive weight zzso zzso sensitivity might be further impaired when the subject switches to zzso zzso zzso zzso and related agents may reduce body weight in these zzso The high levels of the zzso zzso suggest that zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso might be useful as zzso Even though the zzso phase of the zzso cycle appears to be severely zzso the normal serum levels of zzso and zzso do not support the proposal derived from animal experimental studies about the use of zzso or tamoxifen to counteract zzso zzso
