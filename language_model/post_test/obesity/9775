Growth differentiation zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that is increased in obesity and established type 2 zzso We assessed whether zzso can predict future insulin resistance and impaired zzso control in obese zzso zzso 

Plasma zzso zzso were measured with an automated zzso zzso at baseline and after 4 years in zzso obese zzso individuals zzso men, median age 48 years, median body mass index zzso zzso zzso enrolled in the zzso in the prevention of Diabetes in zzso subjects zzso zzso 

The median zzso concentration at baseline was zzso zzso zzso range zzso zzso zzso was related to body weight, zzso zzso ratio, and insulin resistance zzso model assessment of insulin resistance zzso (all P zzso Changes in zzso from baseline to 4 years were related to changes in body weight, zzso zzso ratio, and zzso (all P zzso zzso zzso was associated with the risk to have zzso or diabetes at 4 years by zzso analysis zzso ratio zzso FOR 1 unit increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso and after zzso adjustment for age, zzso treatment allocation zzso vs zzso zzso zzso ratio, and zzso control at baseline zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, baseline zzso was independently associated with zzso at 4 years zzso 

This first zzso study of zzso in a large cohort of obese individuals indicates that zzso is related to abdominal obesity and insulin resistance and independently associated with future insulin resistance and abnormal zzso zzso
