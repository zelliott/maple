In this study we describe the contribution of zzso and zzso effects on the zzso body weight, and on the weights of individual fat pads in zzso male mice derived from an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice become obese after 12 weeks on a high-fat diet, whereas zzso mice remain relatively zzso Here we report that mice with zzso maternal and zzso paternal zzso have significantly larger zzso and zzso fat pads than those with zzso maternal and paternal zzso However, zzso strain had no effect on the overall zzso zzso or the weights of the zzso subcutaneous or zzso fat zzso The strain of the paternal grandparents had a small but significant effect on body zzso These effects can be attributed to in zzso effects, zzso effects, zzso and/or Y zzso transmission of factors controlling body zzso We also describe the presence of a quantitative trait locus zzso on zzso X, close to zzso which is linked to zzso body weight, and to the weights of the individual fat zzso However, this zzso is not responsible for the zzso strain effects described zzso
