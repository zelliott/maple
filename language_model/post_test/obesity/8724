To explore the abnormalities of serum zzso zzso zzso in a large group of patients with zzso zzso syndrome zzso and to evaluate the influence of body mass index zzso age, zzso and zzso on serum zzso zzso 

Prospective zzso 

zzso zzso unit of an academic medical zzso 

zzso women with zzso were compared with 24 healthy zzso 

Blood sampling was performed in the early zzso phase in patients and in control zzso 

zzso levels of zzso A, zzso B, zzso zzso zzso precursor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were assessed in all zzso 

zzso zzso levels together with zzso zzso and A levels were significantly increased in women with zzso zzso zzso A levels were lower in patients with zzso than controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso B levels did not differ between the groups zzso zzso zzso zzso 108 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso A and B levels were zzso correlated with zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso displayed significantly lower zzso A and zzso B levels and a higher zzso A ratio than zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso In this last zzso the mean zzso B level was significantly higher than in controls zzso zzso zzso 144 zzso zzso zzso 108 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis, after controlling for age and zzso demonstrated that in patients with zzso zzso levels were positively and independently correlated with zzso and A zzso 

Among women with zzso the trend toward an excess serum zzso B level is observed exclusively in zzso zzso The higher zzso levels and the lower zzso A levels might reflect a zzso in the processing of zzso specific to zzso zzso In addition, our data suggest that zzso originates from the zzso cells and could participate in control of the zzso production by these zzso
