To evaluate the impact of a zzso health behavior intervention known as Planet Health on obesity among boys and girls in grades 6 to zzso 

zzso controlled field trial with 5 intervention and 5 control zzso Outcomes were assessed using zzso zzso zzso and follow-up measures zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso of zzso 

A group of zzso ethnically diverse grade 6 and 7 students from public schools in 4 Massachusetts zzso 

Students participated in a zzso interdisciplinary intervention over 2 school zzso Planet Health sessions were included within existing zzso using classroom teachers in 4 major subjects and physical zzso Sessions focused on decreasing television viewing, decreasing consumption of high-fat foods, increasing fruit and vegetable zzso and increasing moderate and vigorous physical zzso 

zzso was defined as a composite indicator based on both a body mass index and a zzso zzso value greater than or equal to zzso and zzso zzso zzso Because schools were randomized, rather than students, the generalized zzso equation method was used to adjust for zzso zzso under cluster zzso 

The prevalence of obesity among girls in intervention schools was reduced compared with controls, controlling for baseline obesity zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso with no differences found among zzso There was greater zzso of obesity among intervention girls zzso control girls zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso The intervention reduced television hours among both girls and boys, and increased fruit and vegetable consumption and resulted in a smaller zzso in total energy intake among zzso zzso in television viewing predicted obesity change and zzso the intervention zzso Among girls, each hour of reduction in television viewing predicted reduced obesity prevalence zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Planet Health decreased obesity among female students, indicating a promising zzso approach to reducing obesity among zzso
