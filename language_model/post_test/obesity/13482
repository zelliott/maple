We zzso that zzso zzso zzso may be associated with age at zzso and adult overweight and zzso potentially contributing to breast cancer zzso 

We assessed age at zzso by questionnaire among 204 healthy Norwegian women, aged zzso zzso zzso of body composition included body mass index zzso zzso waist circumference zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso and fat percentage dual energy X-ray zzso zzso Daily zzso zzso zzso zzso were collected throughout one entire zzso cycle and assessed by zzso zzso Linear zzso analyses and linear mixed models for repeated measures were used and potential zzso factors and effect zzso were zzso 

Among women with an early age at zzso zzso zzso zzso the overall mean zzso zzso concentration increased by zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso with each zzso zzso (1 zzso increase in zzso which represents a zzso change in the mean for the total zzso Among the same early zzso a 1 zzso zzso change in zzso was directly associated with a zzso change in mean zzso concentration for the total zzso 

Our findings support the hypothesis that early age at zzso together with adult overweight and zzso result in high levels of zzso throughout the zzso zzso
