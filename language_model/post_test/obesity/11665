Although there are changes in the zzso zzso responses of obese patients, these are closely associated with high zzso zzso zzso This study of 17 zzso zzso zzso obese subjects zzso mass index, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 33 zzso controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was done to examine their zzso responses to an oral fat loading test containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and to evaluate the possible association between clinical and biological features of obesity and/or insulin resistance and zzso zzso 

Blood samples were taken before giving the fat load and at zzso and 8 h after zzso zzso sensitivity was assessed using zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were measured each zzso 

The areas under the zzso zzso of zzso zzso for the obese and controls were not different, indicating adequate zzso zzso By contrast, the zzso for zzso zzso was significantly greater in the obese than in the controls zzso zzso 135 vs zzso zzso 141 zzso P zzso In addition, the zzso for zzso in this same fraction was significantly lower in the obese than in the controls zzso zzso 55 vs 157 zzso 88 zzso zzso P zzso suggesting that the zzso from zzso zzso accounted for most of the increase in zzso in the non zzso zzso zzso related to obesity showed no relationship with these zzso zzso whereas zzso which zzso between the groups, partly explained zzso zzso P zzso the significant increase in zzso zzso 

zzso obese patients with a zzso zzso in the normal range and not different from the zzso zzso of lean controls had an abnormal zzso zzso response, indicated by a significantly greater zzso in the zzso zzso than in zzso These zzso may be partly due to zzso changes in zzso zzso as a consequence of insulin zzso
