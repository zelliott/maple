zzso shock leads to a higher risk of mortality and morbidity in obese patients, however the mechanisms for these outcomes are zzso We hypothesized that following severe zzso blood pressure control in conscious obese zzso rats zzso is zzso 

zzso were performed in conscious lean zzso rats zzso and zzso Blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac zzso total peripheral resistance zzso plasma zzso activity zzso plasma zzso hormone zzso and blood zzso were measured before and after severe zzso zzso of the total blood zzso 

zzso blood pressure, cardiac zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels were not different between zzso and zzso Compared to zzso zzso exhibited impaired zzso control of heart rate and showed higher levels of vascular zzso zzso One hour after the zzso zzso and zzso exhibited similar decreases in cardiac zzso However, blood pressure, heart rate, zzso zzso and zzso levels were lower in zzso than in zzso 

These results indicate that conscious zzso has impaired blood pressure compensation after zzso due to a blunted increase in zzso This is due at least in part to an impaired regulation of zzso zzso To our knowledge, the current study is the first to demonstrate that zzso responses and associated hormone zzso are impaired in a conscious obese zzso
