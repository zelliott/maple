zzso dietary fibers promote zzso benefits on body weight and zzso control, but underlying mechanisms are poorly zzso Recent evidence indicates that zzso zzso zzso has beneficial effects on zzso and energy zzso Here, we show that the zzso fatty acids zzso zzso and zzso which are generated by zzso of soluble fiber by the gut zzso activate zzso via complementary zzso zzso activates zzso gene expression through a zzso zzso while zzso itself a zzso of zzso activates zzso gene expression via a zzso neural circuit involving the fatty acid zzso zzso The zzso benefits on body weight and zzso control induced by zzso or dietary fiber in normal mice are absent in mice deficient for zzso despite similar modifications in gut zzso zzso Thus, the regulation of zzso is necessary for the zzso benefits associated with zzso and soluble zzso
