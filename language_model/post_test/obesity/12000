Although obesity traditionally has been considered a condition of low risk for zzso this classic view has recently been zzso The aim of this study was to assess bone zzso and turnover in a mouse model of high-fat zzso zzso zzso male zzso mice zzso zzso zzso were zzso into 3 diet zzso One third zzso zzso 6) received a low-fat diet for 24 weeks, one third was kept on an extended high-fat diet zzso and the remaining was switched from low-fat to high-fat zzso 3 weeks before sacrifice zzso zzso levels of insulin, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of type I collagen zzso were zzso In addition, bone zzso was analyzed by zzso zzso and zzso spine bone density was assessed by zzso zzso zzso The zzso body weight, insulin, and zzso were significantly elevated in obese animals zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso body weight, insulin, and zzso showed a negative correlation with bone density and bone zzso Interestingly, short-term high-fat zzso caused similar bone loss as extended high-fat zzso Bone volume was decreased by zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso Bone mineral density was zzso zzso and zzso zzso lower when compared with control mice on low-fat zzso As assessed by the structure model index, bone zzso changed from zzso to zzso appearance upon high-fat zzso zzso and cortical thickness remained zzso zzso and extended high-fat zzso obesity caused significant bone loss in male zzso mice mainly because of zzso changes in zzso zzso
