Although the zzso zzso 6) gene product is now known to be involved in the regulation of fat mass and insulin sensitivity in mice, its zzso functions in humans have yet to be zzso 

zzso from the zzso French zzso Study zzso were zzso for single zzso zzso zzso in zzso and associations with zzso or zzso zzso were looked zzso 

On evaluating the frequency of 17 zzso zzso in 100 randomly selected subjects on the basis of linkage zzso zzso four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to cover more than zzso of the known zzso genetic zzso zzso from the entire zzso Study were then zzso for these four zzso No significant association was detected for zzso and zzso In contrast, the G zzso of zzso was associated with lower plasma zzso levels zzso Also, obese subjects carrying the G zzso of zzso had higher plasma insulin levels than AA subjects zzso Moreover, the G zzso of zzso tended to be associated with a zzso higher risk of the zzso syndrome zzso However, when false discovery rate testing (40 zzso was applied, these associations were no longer statistically zzso 

These findings constitute the first study in humans of zzso genetic zzso Although there was no evidence that zzso in zzso might be significantly associated with the zzso zzso zzso a weak association of these zzso with these parameters cannot be zzso Further association studies are needed to arrive at any zzso zzso
