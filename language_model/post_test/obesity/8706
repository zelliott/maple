The traditional methods for the assessment of insulin sensitivity yield only a single index, not the whole zzso curve zzso This curve is typically characterized by a zzso zzso zzso clearance zzso and an insulin concentration at zzso response zzso We developed an approach for zzso the whole zzso curve with a single in zzso test, based on the use of zzso zzso and zzso insulin administration zzso steps of 20 and 200 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso The effect of insulin on plasma zzso clearance was calculated from zzso data by use of a circulatory model of zzso zzso and a model of insulin action in which zzso clearance is represented as a zzso function of insulin concentration with a delay zzso In seven zzso subjects, the model predicted adequately the zzso concentration: the model zzso were zzso and their zzso of variation was similar to the expected measurement error zzso zzso indicating that the model did not introduce significant systematic zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) and obese zzso zzso 3) subjects had similar zzso for insulin action zzso zzso 25 zzso 9 zzso 25 zzso 8 zzso and zzso responses zzso zzso zzso zzso 46 zzso zzso zzso 259 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively), whereas zzso was 240 zzso 84 zzso in the lean zzso 364 zzso 229 zzso in the obese zzso zzso zzso and the insulin sensitivity index zzso initial slope of the zzso zzso but not zzso were related to body zzso and fat distribution with r of zzso zzso zzso Thus, despite the small number of study subjects, we were able to reproduce information consistent with the zzso In addition, among the lean individuals, zzso was positively related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso We conclude that the test here zzso based on a more elaborate representation of zzso zzso and insulin action, allows a reliable zzso of the insulin zzso curve for whole body zzso zzso in a single session of relatively short zzso
