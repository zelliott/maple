zzso zzso sleep zzso zzso patients potentially defend zzso lung volume zzso during zzso via increased zzso zzso activity zzso A reduction in zzso and zzso at sleep onset could, therefore, increase upper airway zzso via reduced zzso zzso The aim of this study was to establish if zzso is greater in obese zzso patients zzso zzso controls during zzso and to compare zzso and zzso changes at sleep onset between groups as a function of stable breathing, zzso zzso zzso events developing within the first few breaths after sleep zzso Eight obese men with zzso and eight zzso men without zzso were studied in the zzso position while zzso with an zzso zzso to measure zzso and zzso coils to assess changes in zzso While zzso expressed as zzso activity was not significantly different between groups during zzso zzso patients experienced a greater fall in zzso following sleep onset zzso zzso breath, P zzso and a greater decrease when respiratory events accompanied sleep zzso zzso zzso breath, P zzso The decrease in zzso by the third zzso onset breath was small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso controls, zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso with the decrease significantly greater in zzso patients over time zzso zzso breath, P zzso zzso There was a greater decrease with more severe events zzso zzso breath, P zzso with zzso decreasing by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the onset of zzso in the zzso zzso These data support that zzso tone and zzso frequently decrease following sleep zzso with greater falls at transitions accompanied by respiratory zzso In addition to zzso in upper airway zzso muscle activity, decreasing lung volume potentially contributes to an increased propensity for upper airway collapse in zzso patients at sleep zzso
