zzso and its related complications have emerged as global health zzso however, the zzso mechanism of obesity is still not fully zzso In this study, zzso mice were fed a normal zzso or high-fat diet zzso for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 20, and 24 weeks and the time course was zzso analyzed specifically for the zzso zzso zzso Genes that were zzso expressed in the zzso mice were clustered into 49 clusters and further classified into 8 different expression zzso long-term zzso zzso 1), long-term zzso zzso zzso early zzso zzso zzso early zzso zzso zzso late zzso zzso zzso late zzso zzso zzso early zzso and late zzso zzso zzso and early zzso and late zzso zzso 8) zzso zzso Within each pattern, genes related with zzso insulin resistance, and zzso metabolism were zzso and then, a zzso interaction network was zzso The pattern specific zzso was as zzso pattern 1, cellular assembly and organization, and zzso disease, pattern 2, zzso zzso pattern 3, gene expression and inflammatory response, pattern 4, cell zzso pattern 5, zzso zzso molecular zzso and small zzso zzso pattern 6, protein synthesis and zzso cell signaling and interaction and pattern 7, zzso cell zzso cellular growth and zzso and cell zzso For pattern 8, no significant zzso were zzso Taken together, this suggests that genes involved in regulating gene expression and inflammatory response are zzso whereas genes involved in zzso metabolism and protein synthesis are zzso during zzso obesity zzso
