The involvement of zzso axis activity in obesity onset was investigated using the experimental model of treating zzso rats with zzso zzso To access general sympathetic nervous system activity, we recorded the firing rates of sympathetic superior cervical zzso nerves in zzso zzso content and zzso from isolated adrenal zzso were zzso zzso zzso tolerance test was performed, and isolated pancreatic zzso were zzso with zzso and zzso zzso The nerve firing rate of obese rats was decreased compared to the rate for lean zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased whereas zzso zzso induced by zzso elevated zzso zzso and caffeine in the isolated adrenal zzso were all increased in obese rats compared to zzso Both zzso intolerance and zzso were observed in obese zzso zzso strongly inhibited zzso insulin zzso in obese zzso These findings suggest that low zzso activity contributes to impaired zzso control in zzso obese zzso
