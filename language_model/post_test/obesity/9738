Short sleep duration and low diet quality are associated with weight zzso However, little is known about the relationship between sleep duration and the quality of zzso zzso we aimed to compare the diet quality zzso and zzso measures between short and longer zzso 

This zzso study consisted of 410 female youths who were chosen among students of zzso University of Medical Sciences based on zzso random sampling zzso zzso intake assessment was done using a zzso validated food frequency zzso Sleep duration was estimated using zzso nocturnal sleep duration by each zzso zzso measures were done using standard zzso Diet quality zzso (including dietary energy density, dietary diversity scores, healthy eating index, zzso zzso ratio, and mean zzso zzso were calculated using the standard zzso 

zzso who slept less than 6 zzso were more likely to be overweight and obese zzso zzso zzso and also zzso obese zzso zzso zzso They also consumed more dietary energy zzso zzso 825 versus zzso zzso 700 zzso P zzso zzso zzso and carbohydrates zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but a lower amount of fiber (12 zzso 7 versus 18 zzso 7 zzso P zzso zzso fruits zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso whole grains zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and beans zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso All diet quality zzso were significantly lower among short zzso zzso zzso apart from dietary energy density, which did not differ significantly zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings confirm the association of short sleep duration and obesity in young female zzso It might be derived from lower diet quality among short zzso more than longer zzso
