It is recognized that zzso intervals reflect zzso nerve zzso To investigate the clinical usefulness of corrected zzso intervals zzso in assessing zzso nerve function in type 2 diabetes, we measured zzso intervals using zzso formula in 58 type 2 diabetic patients and 20 zzso healthy zzso 

We examined relationships between zzso intervals and the zzso of variation of zzso intervals zzso zzso blood pressure response to standing, and sympathetic skin response zzso whose tests reflect zzso nerve zzso We also studied the correlation between zzso and blood pressure or serum zzso zzso 

zzso intervals in diabetic patients were significantly longer than those in healthy subjects and showed a significant but weak negative correlation with zzso as well as zzso blood pressure response to zzso No significant difference in zzso intervals was observed between patients with and without a zzso zzso zzso intervals showed a significant positive correlation with zzso and zzso blood pressure although it did not correlate with serum zzso zzso zzso also tended to be long in obese diabetic subjects zzso mass zzso zzso 

zzso intervals might also be affected by other factors such as zzso zzso and zzso and not only zzso nerve zzso Therefore it might be considered as an overall index for zzso and not for pure zzso zzso
