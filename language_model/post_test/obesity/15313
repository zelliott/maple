zzso implications of gender may be important in a number of disease zzso We therefore decided to study the influence of gender on zzso in zzso Plasma zzso and zzso zzso levels were determined by zzso exchange zzso and/or affinity zzso zzso in zzso zzso mice during the onset and subsequent decline of zzso In zzso zzso mice, zzso and zzso zzso zzso were equal to those of lean zzso zzso Shortly after zzso plasma zzso in zzso mice increased to reach a maximum between 2 and 3 months of age, then declined over the next several weeks to levels within the range of lean zzso zzso values were closely associated with the zzso zzso Male mice of both zzso consistently had higher values of zzso zzso at a given zzso value than did zzso zzso rates of zzso zzso were slightly higher in lean female mice than in other zzso but after correcting for zzso differences in blood volume, no zzso or gender differences in zzso lifespan were zzso We conclude that there are gender differences in zzso of zzso in mice and that factors other than zzso turnover are associated with the gender effects in both obese and lean zzso
