zzso and zzso zzso pathways are important role players in the zzso of obesity and insulin zzso zzso and type II diabetes are associated with zzso zzso inflammation and elevated zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso There is increasing evidence that zzso may play a critical role in skeletal muscle zzso However, the effects of zzso insulin resistance on these zzso pathways are poorly understood in skeletal zzso zzso the present study addressed the effects of zzso insulin resistance on the activity of the zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso pathways in the zzso muscle and compared these with muscle of standard zzso control zzso Male zzso rats were randomly allocated to a control diet group zzso commercial zzso zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso or a cafeteria diet group zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso for 16 zzso Blood analysis was conducted to determine the impact of the model of obesity on circulating insulin, zzso free fatty zzso zzso and zzso II zzso The experimental animals were zzso heavier and had zzso greater visceral fat mass than their control counterparts and were zzso zzso increases in the zzso zzso and zzso as well as in zzso and zzso zzso zzso were observed in the muscle of obese animals compared with the control zzso We propose that zzso may be a mechanism for the zzso of zzso zzso pathways in obesity and type II diabetes, which will lead to zzso and zzso in skeletal zzso
