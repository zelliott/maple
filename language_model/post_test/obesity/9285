zzso fatty liver disease, one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease, is strongly associated with zzso zzso zzso acid zzso has been reported to inhibit zzso zzso however, the effect of zzso on zzso zzso metabolism remains zzso We evaluated body weight, zzso liver zzso and zzso zzso content in high-fat diet zzso zzso mice treated with zzso In addition, we characterized the underlying mechanism of zzso effects in zzso zzso by Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso reduced weight gain, fat pad mass, and zzso zzso zzso and improved serum zzso parameters in mice fed a zzso for 8 zzso zzso significantly increased zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in the liver and in zzso zzso zzso zzso the level of mature zzso and its target genes zzso zzso and fatty acid zzso but, it zzso expression of genes involved in fatty acid zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The specific zzso inhibitor compound C attenuated the effects of zzso on expression of zzso zzso proteins in zzso zzso The beneficial effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso through zzso signaling zzso suggesting a potential target for preventing zzso
