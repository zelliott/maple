Low serum zzso is likely to be associated with obesity and zzso zzso which are often accompanied by impaired insulin zzso However, it is unclear whether low serum zzso is associated with impaired insulin action in clinical zzso zzso we investigated the associations of low serum zzso with plasma insulin levels, and zzso zzso including zzso 

We measured serum zzso plasma insulin, zzso parameters such as zzso zzso risk factors, and zzso parameters in a zzso study of 54 zzso subjects zzso age zzso who were not being treated for zzso 

Body mass index zzso and plasma zzso at zzso after a zzso oral zzso tolerance test zzso were significantly higher in subjects with low serum zzso zzso zzso than in those with zzso serum zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso correlation analysis, serum zzso was significantly correlated with zzso alone zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso analysis showed that each zzso increase in quantitative insulin sensitivity check index, and each zzso decrease in plasma insulin zzso at 0 and zzso zzso model assessment of insulin resistance zzso and zzso were significantly associated with low serum zzso particularly after adjusting for zzso When subjects were divided into three groups according to zzso serum zzso levels were significantly lower in subjects with zzso zzso compared with subjects with zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso test, zzso but not compared with subjects with zzso zzso zzso Similar trends were observed when subjects were divided according to plasma zzso and zzso plasma insulin zzso 

These results suggest that after adjusting for zzso low serum zzso is associated with decreased zzso insulin levels and insulin zzso as well as high insulin zzso The nature of these associations remains to be zzso in further zzso
