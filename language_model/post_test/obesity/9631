zzso zzso is the most highly elevated zzso zzso in obese mice and is also substantially elevated in patients who have zzso but its role in obesity and zzso dysfunction remains zzso After a zzso zzso is zzso from the zzso binds to a zzso membrane zzso complex, zzso zzso 4 and zzso zzso zzso and mediates zzso responses under zzso conditions, but zzso responses to zzso signaling were shown to be impaired in patients with zzso Here, we show an unexpected functional link between zzso elevated zzso and impaired zzso signaling in zzso In zzso studies show that zzso zzso zzso by binding to the 3' zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in mice decreased zzso zzso levels, impaired zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and altered expression of zzso zzso target zzso zzso with these results, zzso levels were decreased and zzso responses to zzso were severely impaired in dietary obese mice that have elevated zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in obese mice partially restored zzso levels and improved zzso target gene expression and zzso zzso including decreased liver zzso Further, zzso treatment in primary zzso of obese mice restored zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling in a zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso elevated zzso in obesity zzso zzso zzso signaling by directly targeting zzso The zzso axis may present unique therapeutic targets for zzso human diseases, including zzso disorders and zzso
