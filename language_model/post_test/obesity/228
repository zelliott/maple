American Indians have a higher prevalence of zzso than the general population, likely resulting from a combination of environmental and genetic risk zzso To zzso gene regions influencing variation in urinary zzso ratio, we performed a linkage analysis and explored zzso zzso and zzso interactions in a large cohort of American Indian zzso We zzso individuals from 13 American Indian tribes from three centers zzso North and South zzso and zzso We performed zzso zzso component linkage analysis in each center as well as in the entire cohort after controlling for center zzso We used two modeling zzso Model 1 incorporated age, zzso and interaction zzso model 2 also controlled for diabetes, zzso body mass index, zzso LDL, zzso and smoking zzso We evaluated interactions with diabetes, hypertension, and obesity using zzso zzso linkage and zzso zzso zzso suggestive for linkage to urinary zzso ratio included zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso interaction was present with a quantitative trait locus specific to the diabetic stratum in the zzso isolated on zzso to zzso using model 1 zzso of odds zzso zzso zzso interaction was present with quantitative trait zzso specific to the zzso stratum in the zzso on zzso using model 1 zzso of odds zzso zzso and zzso using model 2 zzso of odds zzso zzso These zzso replicate findings from multiple other zzso scans of kidney disease zzso with distinct populations and are worthy of further zzso
