Vitamin D zzso has been consistently associated with zzso However, it is unclear whether vitamin D zzso is the cause or consequence of zzso We investigated this question by evaluating the association between genetic zzso in vitamin D metabolism zzso genes and zzso zzso Using directly zzso and zzso data from a zzso association study of zzso women aged zzso years, we examined the association of 198 zzso zzso zzso in vitamin D zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso component zzso and vitamin D nuclear zzso zzso with body mass index zzso and body zzso zzso zzso beta zzso estimates were calculated for this association using linear zzso models, controlling for age, square of age, zzso status and sample zzso Overall, only two zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso had a zzso significant association with zzso and weight zzso for zzso with no variation observed by zzso status, physical activity or dietary energy zzso None of the zzso examined in the zzso gene were associated with zzso or zzso Our findings suggest that common genetic zzso in vitamin D zzso genes do not have a major role in obesity among Chinese zzso This comprehensive evaluation of genetic zzso in vitamin D zzso genes and zzso traits did not provide strong evidence to support low vitamin D levels as a cause of zzso
