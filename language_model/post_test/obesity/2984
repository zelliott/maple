A study of zzso cell metabolism was made at ages 5, 7, 10, and 14 zzso of age in genetically obese zzso zzso zzso samples were surgically removed and used for in zzso zzso cell zzso and for characterization of zzso zzso zzso capacity from zzso and zzso normally associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso followed the same pattern of zzso At 5 zzso of age, the zzso cells of obese animals had a greater capacity for fat synthesis than the lean zzso At all other ages zzso activity and zzso levels were either similar or less than the zzso lean zzso zzso zzso by isolated fat cells was zzso however, zzso tissue zzso was elevated in obese rats at 14 zzso of zzso It was concluded that there was no apparent change in specific zzso capacity of fat cells from the obese rat when compared to its lean zzso It was also concluded that increased zzso zzso activity in obese rats represented a secondary shift in zzso
