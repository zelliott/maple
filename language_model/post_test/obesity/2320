To determine the feasibility of and acute toxicity associated with zzso whole breast radiation zzso after zzso surgery in patients excluded from or underrepresented in zzso trials comparing zzso with conventional zzso zzso 

A review was conducted of all patients zzso treated with zzso at the University of zzso All patients were treated to zzso zzso in zzso zzso daily zzso in either the prone or zzso zzso Planning was performed in most cases using wedges and large segments or a zzso zzso Breast volume was estimated using zzso zzso of the planning target volume zzso zzso parameters of zzso zzso zzso zzso and maximum zzso were recorded for each treatment zzso Acute toxicity was scored for each treated zzso 

Between 2006 and 2010, 78 patients were treated to 80 breasts using zzso Most women were overweight or obese zzso with a median body mass index of zzso zzso Median breast volume was zzso zzso Of the 80 treated zzso the maximum acute skin toxicity was mild zzso or zzso in zzso zzso dry zzso in zzso zzso and focal moist zzso in zzso zzso zzso acute toxicity occurred after the completion of radiation in zzso of zzso zzso zzso was not associated with increased zzso Breast volume was the only patient factor significantly associated with moist zzso on multivariable analysis zzso zzso zzso Patients with breast zzso zzso experienced focal moist zzso in zzso of cases compared with zzso in patients with breast volume zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is feasible and safe in patients with zzso zzso and in patients with large breast volume when employing modern planning and positioning zzso We recommend counseling regarding expected increases in skin toxicity in women with a zzso zzso zzso
