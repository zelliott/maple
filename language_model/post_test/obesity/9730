To estimate the associations between maternal zzso body mass index zzso or zzso weight change zzso during pregnancy and offspring zzso at 3 years of age, while taking several zzso zzso factors into zzso 

The Norwegian Mother and Child zzso Study is a zzso pregnancy cohort study of women recruited from all geographical areas of zzso 

The study includes zzso women enrolled between 2000 and 2009 through a postal invitation sent to women at zzso weeks of zzso Data collected from zzso of the fathers were zzso MAIN zzso zzso zzso zzso at 3 years was the main outcome measured in this zzso 

Mean maternal zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso in the first 30 weeks of gestation was zzso zzso zzso zzso and mean offspring zzso at 3 years of age was zzso zzso zzso zzso Both maternal zzso zzso and zzso were positively associated with mean offspring zzso at 3 years of zzso zzso zzso and zzso also zzso and the strength of the interaction between these two factors was strongly associated with the increase in offspring zzso among mothers who gained the most weight during pregnancy and had the highest zzso zzso Our findings show that results could be biased by not including zzso paternal zzso 

This large zzso study showed that both maternal zzso zzso and zzso were positively associated with mean offspring zzso at 3 years of zzso
