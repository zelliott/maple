To estimate zzso metabolism in patients with absolute or relative insulin zzso elimination of an zzso zzso load zzso zzso was determined in 5 zzso zzso in obese zzso zzso 5) as well as in ideal weight maturity onset diabetics zzso zzso zzso Following zzso administration a marked rise of plasma insulin levels in obese zzso but lack of insulin response in zzso diabetics was observed compared to healthy controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was similar in controls zzso zzso 5 zzso in obese (40 zzso 4 zzso and in ideal weight maturity onset diabetics zzso zzso 2 zzso but significantly prolonged in zzso diabetics zzso zzso 3 zzso P less than zzso Thus in obese diabetics elevated plasma insulin levels and near normal elimination zzso of zzso suggest peripheral insulin resistance regarding zzso zzso In zzso zzso however, it appears that insulin zzso is associated not only with elevated plasma zzso levels, but also with delayed elimination by peripheral zzso following administration of this zzso zzso
