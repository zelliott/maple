In zzso zzso cancer surgery, some authors still report increased conversion rates, operative duration and zzso morbidity with longer hospital stay in obese zzso In our department, we had the impression that zzso surgery in the obese was feasible and safe, leading to this study in which we evaluate zzso surgery for zzso zzso in the obese and measure the impact on short-term zzso 

In the period from November 2004 to May 2010, 425 patients were zzso operated for a colon or zzso cancer in our zzso zzso patients had a body mass index zzso zzso data and short-term outcome in patients with a zzso were compared to the same data in patients with a zzso 

The median operative time was significantly longer zzso zzso zzso zzso and the mean blood loss was significantly higher zzso zzso zzso zzso in the group of patients with zzso No other significant differences, including conversion to open surgery and zzso zzso were found between the two zzso 

zzso zzso cancer surgery is feasible and safe in obese patients with a zzso above 30, without the patients experiencing an increased risk of zzso morbidity or zzso
