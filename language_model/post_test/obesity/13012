A global epidemic of obesity is developing, but its causes are still zzso In Denmark, two periods of steep increases in prevalence of obesity have occurred among young men born in the 1940s and zzso This study investigated the preceding changes in prevalence of obesity and in the entire body mass index zzso zzso zzso distribution by birth zzso calendar time and age among Danish school zzso 

Children attending Copenhagen schools zzso had annual health zzso from which we computerized zzso zzso of height zzso and weight zzso of zzso boys aged zzso zzso zzso was defined as zzso zzso exceeding the zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso among those born zzso the latter corresponding to the prevalence of obesity among the young men in these zzso The zzso standard zzso zzso and the 5th, 25th, 75th and 95th zzso of the zzso zzso were estimated for each birth zzso 

The prevalence of zzso defined by the zzso zzso increased at all ages during the same birth years as among the young men, and, zzso at earlier calendar zzso The prevalence of zzso defined by the zzso zzso showed a distinctly different zzso a sharp increase, irrespective of age, during the calendar years zzso and thereafter a stable level until the 1970s, where a further modest increase zzso The prevalence defined by the zzso zzso showed a mixture of the trends in those defined by the zzso and zzso zzso The median zzso showed small zzso parallel at all zzso The standard zzso and zzso zzso increased until birth year 1950, but were almost stable zzso The pattern of changes in the zzso mostly reflected those in the zzso 

The prevalence of obesity defined by the zzso or zzso zzso has increased in Danish boys born in the 1940s and since the mid 1960s, without corresponding changes in the central part of the zzso zzso When defining obesity by the zzso zzso there was a sharp distinct zzso increase in the late zzso The development of the obesity epidemic is a zzso phenomenon that has involved changes in environmental influences starting at preschool ages and affecting different zzso of the population, either because of selective exposure or particular zzso
