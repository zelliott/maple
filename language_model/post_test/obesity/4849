We recently showed that zzso zzso release is considerably enhanced in obese women in proportion to the size of their visceral fat zzso zzso release is inhibited by zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso and dietary zzso loss are associated with increased zzso signaling in zzso zzso we hypothesized that enhanced zzso release in obese humans would be reversed by weight zzso To evaluate this zzso we measured zzso plasma zzso zzso at zzso intervals in 11 obese zzso women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso before and after weight loss zzso reduction of zzso absolute weight loss, using a very low-calorie zzso in the zzso phase of their zzso zzso The zzso zzso concentration profiles were analyzed by a peak detection program zzso and a wave zzso zzso technique zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly reduced in obese women zzso daily release, before 128 zzso 24 zzso after weight loss 110 zzso 17 zzso distribution volume zzso zzso 24 zzso P zzso zzso Body weight loss particularly blunted zzso zzso burst mass zzso area, before 230 zzso 28 zzso after weight loss 221 zzso 31 zzso zzso 24 zzso P zzso zzso whereas burst frequency was unaffected zzso of zzso before 11 zzso 1 zzso after weight loss 12 zzso 1 zzso zzso P zzso zzso Thus elevated zzso zzso rate in obese women is significantly reduced after loss of 50% of zzso We speculate that zzso of deficit zzso zzso and/or zzso of circulating zzso levels might be involved in the physiology of this zzso
