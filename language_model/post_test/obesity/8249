Besides differential zzso DNA zzso variation has recently been proposed and demonstrated to be a potential contributing factor to cancer zzso Here we aim to examine whether differential zzso in zzso is also an important feature of zzso a typical zzso common complex zzso We analyzed zzso zzso profiles of over zzso zzso in peripheral blood samples from 48 obese and 48 lean African-American youth aged zzso y zzso A substantial number of zzso variable zzso sites zzso using statistics based on zzso as well as a substantial number of zzso zzso zzso sites zzso using statistics based on means, were zzso Similar to the findings in zzso zzso generally exhibited an zzso structure and were more variable in cases than in zzso By randomly splitting the current sample into a discovery and validation set, we observed that both the zzso and zzso identified from the first set could independently predict obesity status in the second zzso Furthermore, both the genes harboring zzso and the genes harboring zzso showed significant enrichment of genes identified by zzso association studies on obesity and related diseases, such as hypertension, zzso type 2 diabetes and certain types of zzso supporting their roles in the zzso and zzso of zzso We generalized the recent finding on zzso zzso in cancer research to obesity and demonstrated that differential zzso is also an important feature of zzso zzso zzso Future studies on the zzso of obesity will benefit from both statistics based on means and statistics based on zzso
