The aim of the present study was to compare zzso and zzso knee extension strength between obese and zzso zzso Ten zzso and 12 severely obese adolescent boys of similar zzso age, maturity status, and height were zzso Total body and regional soft tissue composition were determined using zzso X-ray zzso zzso zzso zzso maximum voluntary contraction zzso zzso was measured using an zzso zzso at a knee angle of zzso zzso is full zzso Absolute zzso zzso was significantly higher in obese adolescents than in zzso However, although zzso zzso expressed per unit of body mass was found to be significantly lower in obese adolescent boys, no significant difference in zzso zzso was found between groups when zzso to zzso zzso zzso when correcting for thigh lean mass and estimated thigh muscle mass, zzso zzso was significantly higher in the obese group zzso and zzso zzso P zzso To zzso our sample of obese adolescent boys had higher absolute and relative knee extension strength than our zzso zzso However, further studies are required to ascertain whether or not relative strength, measured with more accurate in zzso methods such as magnetic resonance imaging, is higher in obese adolescents than in zzso zzso
