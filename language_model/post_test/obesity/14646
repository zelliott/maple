The impact of cardiovascular risk factors on zzso but measurable left main coronary artery zzso zzso is not well zzso 

We analyzed 150 consecutive patients with first-time coronary artery disease presentation undergoing intervention of a left anterior descending coronary artery or left zzso zzso with motorized zzso ultrasound zzso zzso that included a zzso zzso Framingham, zzso and European SCORE risk assessments were determined in 107 patients zzso years of age (because the Framingham, zzso and European SCORE studies excluded zzso years zzso zzso ultrasound zzso were compared in patients with zzso vs zzso to zzso risk of zzso 

zzso volumes were greater in patients with higher risk zzso P zzso zzso in patients with zzso to zzso zzso risk, P zzso zzso in patients with zzso to zzso zzso risk, and P zzso zzso in patients with zzso to zzso SCORE risk zzso zzso zzso The mean arc of zzso calcium (12 degrees zzso 25 degrees zzso correlated with plaque volume zzso zzso 28 zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso and with the number of coronary risk factors zzso zzso zzso and ranged from zzso degrees zzso zzso degrees in patients with 0 to 1 risk factors to zzso degrees zzso zzso degrees in patients with 2 to 4 risk factors to zzso degrees zzso zzso degrees in patients with 5 to 7 risk zzso zzso analysis showed obesity and age were the most important factors contributing to zzso zzso 

zzso ultrasound measurable zzso in zzso zzso zzso with conventional primary coronary risk zzso Left main coronary artery calcium zzso both with zzso plaque volume and risk zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso may be a marker for events that are predicted by commonly used primary zzso zzso
