This study evaluated the effects of gender on response to a behavioral intervention that rewarded increases in physical activity zzso with increases in access to TV zzso 

We performed a secondary analysis of a clinical trial that zzso 30 overweight or obese, 8- to 12-year-old children to an intervention (8 boys, 6 zzso or control (7 boys, 9 zzso zzso Participants wore zzso every day for 8 weeks and attended biweekly meetings to download the activity zzso For the intervention group, accumulating 400 counts of PA on zzso earned 1 hour of TV time, which was controlled by a zzso TV electronic zzso zzso wore activity monitors but had free access to zzso 

Compared with girls, boys in the intervention group exhibited greater increases in overall daily PA counts zzso versus zzso P zzso and minutes per day of zzso physical activity zzso zzso versus zzso P zzso Neither boys nor girls in the control group showed significant changes in overall PA or intensity of zzso 

Wearing an zzso in combination with rewarding PA with TV might be a more effective intervention for increasing overall PA and time spent in zzso in overweight and obese boys than it is for overweight or obese zzso
