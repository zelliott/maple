To determine the course of zzso zzso fatty liver disease zzso and the cardiovascular risk factors of hypertension, zzso and disturbed zzso metabolism in zzso obese zzso 

zzso children were examined zzso at baseline and 1 year zzso 

zzso zzso 

A total of zzso zzso obese children; zzso were girls, the mean age was zzso years, and the mean body mass index zzso as weight in zzso divided by height in meters zzso was zzso 

zzso model assessment of insulin resistance zzso values and prevalence of hypertension, zzso impaired zzso zzso level, and zzso 

At zzso zzso of obese children had hypertension, zzso had zzso zzso had impaired zzso zzso levels, and zzso had zzso These zzso as well as weight status, remained stable at the zzso follow-up zzso zzso zzso in prevalence of hypertension zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and impaired zzso zzso level zzso zzso as well as mean zzso value zzso zzso were observed in 62 children entering zzso In contrast, mean decreases zzso in hypertension zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso impaired zzso zzso level zzso zzso and zzso prevalence zzso zzso as well as mean zzso value zzso zzso were observed in 50 children entering late zzso zzso zzso for change of zzso status in the zzso zzso Changes in zzso values were only zzso related to changes in prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors or zzso levels zzso zzso 

zzso risk factors worsened at onset of zzso and improved in late zzso in obese children whose weight status did not zzso The weak correlation between zzso value and cardiovascular risk factors suggests that other characteristics may affect these zzso
