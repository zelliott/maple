zzso is regarded as a possible link between zzso and insulin zzso The aim of the study was to determine zzso levels of zzso for zzso and zzso receptors zzso in non-obese women with zzso zzso syndrome zzso and to assess whether the zzso and receptors are related to insulin resistance in zzso zzso tissue obtained from eight non-obese women with zzso zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso for zzso zzso and 2 were zzso using the zzso reverse zzso chain zzso Eight zzso zzso and zzso healthy women served as zzso The level of zzso zzso in non-obese women with zzso were lower than in controls, but the difference was not statistically zzso However, zzso and 2 zzso levels in non-obese women with zzso were significantly lower than in zzso There was a significant negative correlation between 2 h insulin levels and zzso or zzso zzso levels in non-obese women with zzso ( r zzso zzso and zzso respectively, P zzso The present study demonstrates that zzso zzso expression is zzso by zzso in non-obese women with zzso resulting in zzso zzso
