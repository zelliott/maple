zzso To investigate whether plasma zzso zzso differ between subjects with and without the genetic zzso to zzso and zzso to investigate the effect of dietary zzso on plasma zzso in these zzso 

zzso and zzso plasma zzso zzso were measured before and after 14 days' ad zzso intake of a zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso On day 15 ad zzso breakfast and lunch were given and blood sampled regularly until 6 zzso 

Eight zzso zzso women and 10 matched controls zzso mass index, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso insulin, appetite ratings, dietary zzso body weight and zzso 

zzso zzso concentration on day 1 or 15 did not differ between zzso and zzso However, after meal intake zzso increased in zzso compared with controls on all three zzso In both groups zzso and zzso zzso zzso were greater after zzso compared with FAT and zzso 

A larger zzso zzso concentration was observed in zzso subjects than in zzso This may be related to greater insulin sensitivity in zzso tissue in the zzso Furthermore, increased zzso zzso were found after a zzso diet in both groups, possibly related to larger zzso insulin zzso on this zzso Both zzso should, however, be validated by further zzso
