To assess the reliability of zzso zzso analysis zzso for predicting total body water zzso and zzso water zzso in obese zzso 

zzso of five prediction models based on: zzso body weight zzso zzso the zzso zzso index zzso zzso zzso zzso the association of zzso and zzso zzso the body surface area zzso to zzso ratio zzso and, zzso the body volume zzso to zzso ratio zzso 

Thirty obese and 25 control children of zzso zzso zzso y of zzso 

zzso and zzso were assessed by zzso and zzso zzso Z was measured at zzso of zzso and 100 zzso 

In controls, zzso explained zzso more zzso of zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso I, zzso zzso zzso and the association of zzso and zzso improved the prediction of zzso only slightly zzso zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso I, zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso indexes explained 6 and zzso less zzso of zzso respectively as compared to zzso zzso In obese subjects, zzso explained zzso more zzso of zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso I, zzso zzso zzso and the zzso ratio was the most accurate predictor of zzso zzso zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso I, zzso zzso zzso However, the increase in the explained zzso of zzso associated to the use of the zzso ratio was of only zzso as compared to the association of zzso and zzso The zzso ratio explained zzso less of zzso of zzso as compared to zzso In both control and obese subjects, the association of zzso and zzso offered the best prediction of zzso zzso zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso I and zzso zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso I, zzso However, the values of zzso were much higher in controls than in obese children zzso vs zzso zzso to their lower zzso and greater zzso in zzso zzso was the most accurate predictor of zzso on the pooled sample zzso zzso 55; zzso zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, it was a poor predictor of zzso on the same sample zzso to its high zzso zzso zzso 55; zzso zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso I, zzso zzso zzso 

The body surface area to zzso ratio is the most accurate predictor of zzso in obese children but the association of zzso and zzso may be of more interest when zzso is used to estimate both zzso and zzso The zzso index offers a good prediction of zzso but not of zzso in children with different levels of zzso
