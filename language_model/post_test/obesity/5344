To examine the association between zzso zzso zzso zzso and the activity of the zzso zzso zzso as evaluated by a zzso zzso suppression test, in obese zzso 

In a zzso study, we examined 54 obese, otherwise healthy, individuals with a negligible or zero daily alcohol zzso 

HS (by zzso zzso tolerance status (by oral zzso zzso insulin resistance zzso zzso model assessment zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso suppression cortisol levels were zzso 

zzso with zzso HS zzso zzso zzso had markedly less suppressed circulating cortisol levels than those without HS zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso In addition, subjects with zzso HS had significantly higher values of zzso resistance score and circulating liver zzso than their counterparts without zzso Age, body mass index zzso zzso ratio, plasma zzso concentration (both at zzso and after zzso zzso lipids and blood pressure values did not differ significantly between the zzso zzso were more represented among those without zzso The marked differences in zzso suppression cortisol levels that were observed between the groups were little affected by adjustment for sex, age, zzso zzso ratio, zzso resistance score, plasma lipids and liver zzso zzso Similarly, in a zzso zzso analysis, cortisol levels significantly predicted the presence of zzso HS zzso zzso zzso independently of potential zzso 

These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso is closely correlated with a zzso chronic zzso of the zzso axis in obese, otherwise healthy, zzso
