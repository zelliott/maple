The binding of insulin to its zzso has been studied under various zzso and pathological zzso zzso studies have involved human circulating cells such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells, and cultured cells such as zzso and transformed zzso In animals, other target zzso such as liver and muscle have been studied and correlated with the human zzso Various zzso conditions such as zzso rhythm, diet, age, exercise and the zzso cycle affect insulin zzso in addition, many drugs zzso the zzso zzso Disease affecting the insulin zzso can be divided into five general zzso zzso zzso zzso involves diseases characterized by zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso state usually leads to zzso zzso regulation as seen in zzso type II diabetes, zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso such as seen in anorexia zzso or type I diabetes may lead to elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bind to the zzso and competitively inhibit insulin zzso They may act as zzso zzso or partial zzso zzso zzso diseases which produce fixed zzso in both freshly isolated and cultured zzso zzso Diseases of zzso specificity where insulin may bind with different affinity to its own zzso or related receptors such as receptors for zzso growth zzso zzso Disease of affinity zzso where physical factors such as zzso temperature, zzso zzso may modify zzso In this review, we have considered primarily zzso in insulin zzso zzso There are numerous other functions of the zzso such as zzso and transmission of the biological zzso These mechanisms are frequently referred to as zzso events, but more properly should be referred to as zzso events since the zzso zzso other functions in addition to recognition and binding of zzso 

This article reviews the literature on insulin zzso binding under various zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies have involved human circulating cells such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells, and cultured cells such as zzso and transformed zzso zzso binding is affected by zzso conditions such as zzso rhythm, age, diet, exercise, and the zzso zzso In addition, many drugs disturb the zzso zzso zzso zzso for example, appear to abolish the normal variation in insulin binding during the zzso cycle due to reduced zzso zzso Diseases affecting the insulin zzso can be divided into 5 zzso 1) zzso regulation, including diseases characterized by zzso or zzso 2) zzso zzso that bind to the zzso and competitively inhibit zzso 3) genetic diseases that produce fixed zzso in both freshly isolated and cultured zzso 4) diseases of zzso specificity where insulin may bind with different affinity to its own zzso or related zzso and 5) diseases of affinity zzso where physical factors such as zzso temperature and zzso modify zzso
