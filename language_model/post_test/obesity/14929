Although the existence of metabolically healthy obese zzso individuals has been zzso little is known regarding zzso health status in these subjects over zzso Thus, we evaluated zzso changes in zzso parameters among zzso subjects compared with metabolically healthy, zzso zzso zzso 

A cohort study was performed on zzso Korean men, zzso years of age, with no evidence of fatty liver disease on ultrasound and no traits of zzso syndrome at zzso zzso was zzso based on criteria for Asian zzso Study participants were followed annually or zzso between 2002 and zzso At each visit, the fatty liver on ultrasound was assessed and zzso abnormalities were zzso zzso Cox models and a pooled zzso zzso models were used to evaluate the relationships of zzso with incident zzso zzso 

During zzso zzso of zzso zzso participants developed zzso zzso After adjusting for age, smoking, alcohol intake and exercise, higher baseline zzso categories predicted increased zzso of zzso abnormalities in a zzso zzso The hazard ratios zzso confidence zzso for zzso zzso zzso low zzso zzso fatty liver, elevated high zzso zzso zzso elevated zzso model assessment of insulin resistance, any zzso zzso and zzso syndrome among the zzso subjects compared with the zzso subjects were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

In this study, zzso individuals showed higher zzso of zzso abnormalities compared with zzso zzso This suggests that initially zzso individuals undergo adverse zzso changes associated with obesity over zzso
