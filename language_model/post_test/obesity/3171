The purpose of this study was to determine the zzso zzso and risk factors for the development of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso artery and to compare the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

A total of 190 zzso and zzso zzso artery specimens obtained from patients who underwent zzso zzso were exposed to zzso and zzso zzso The severity of disease was evaluated on the basis of the percentage of zzso zzso zzso thickness index, and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and 22 zzso zzso zzso artery segments were indicated as zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso zzso revealed a lesser degree of zzso zzso and zzso narrowing in the zzso segments compared with the zzso segments zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso arteries was zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso zzso regression, we have identified three significant zzso for zzso zzso zzso as an odds ratio with a zzso confidence zzso these included zzso age greater than 50 years zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso smoking zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso hypertension zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso associated with an increased likelihood of zzso zzso and zzso included a history of smoking, diabetes, zzso peripheral zzso disease, and chronic zzso failure zzso zzso 

The great majority of zzso artery zzso indicate zzso zzso zzso mostly affecting the zzso zzso Therefore in cases of longer diseased segments of zzso zzso the discarded segments should be the zzso zzso Care should be taken when selecting zzso artery as a zzso in zzso zzso particularly in elderly zzso zzso smokers, zzso patients, and in those with associated peripheral vascular zzso
