zzso zzso zzso channels are present in many cell types and link cellular metabolism to the membrane zzso These channels are zzso composed of two zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso are targets for drugs that are zzso or zzso of the zzso channels, while the inwardly zzso zzso zzso zzso form the zzso zzso Two different zzso genes zzso and zzso and two different zzso genes zzso and zzso have been zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso have been zzso We have previously performed expression profiling on pooled human zzso tissue and found high expression of zzso Others have reported expression of zzso in human zzso The aim of this study was to characterize the expression of the zzso zzso complex components in human zzso zzso zzso analysis, verified by restriction zzso zzso and DNA sequencing, showed that zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso are expressed in human zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso was expressed at higher levels in subcutaneous compared with zzso zzso tissue in paired zzso obtained from seven obese men zzso zzso Analysis of tissue distribution showed that zzso expression in zzso tissue was lower than that in muscle, similar to that in heart and liver, while the expression in zzso was zzso The effect of caloric restriction was tested in obese men zzso zzso 10) treated with very low calorie diet for 16 weeks, followed by a gradual zzso of ordinary food for 2 zzso zzso were taken at week 0, 8 and zzso There was no consistent effect of weight reduction on zzso or zzso zzso We conclude that the necessary components for a local zzso system are expressed in human zzso tissue and that the zzso zzso complex in this tissue is composed of zzso and zzso The expression of zzso was higher in subcutaneous compared with zzso zzso tissue and was not affected by weight zzso
