zzso has become a worldwide epidemic that is driving increased morbidity and mortality from zzso disorders such as zzso zzso stroke, and zzso zzso zzso prevention and treatment of zzso in obese patients is limited by an incomplete understanding of the underlying zzso mechanisms and by uncertainties about risks, benefits, and dosing of zzso drugs in this patient zzso 

This review summarizes our current understanding of established and emerging mechanisms contributing to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso impact of chronic inflammation and impaired zzso in zzso zzso zzso is zzso Recent data demonstrating the zzso expression of zzso and zzso which appear to function as key zzso of zzso and zzso pathways in zzso are also zzso Finally, some challenges and new approaches to the prevention and management of zzso disorders in obese and overweight patients are zzso 

zzso chronic inflammation and impaired zzso appear to be major zzso mechanisms of zzso in zzso The zzso and zzso effects of obesity may be exacerbated by zzso expression and zzso of zzso and zzso which further increase the risk of zzso and suggest new potential targets for zzso
