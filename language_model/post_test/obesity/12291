zzso obesity results in zzso zzso whereas the impact of paternal obesity is zzso In the present study, the effects of parental obesity on zzso zzso cell cycle length and zzso zzso were zzso zzso and paternal obesity were assessed independently by zzso zzso from normal or obese zzso female mice zzso with normal Swiss male mice zzso zzso or from normal Swiss female mice zzso with normal or obese zzso male mice zzso zzso zzso were cultured in zzso and development was then assessed by zzso zzso and metabolism determined using zzso zzso obesity was associated with a significant delay in zzso cell cycle zzso from the zzso zzso A significant increase in zzso consumption by zzso from obese compared with normal females occurred after zzso although zzso remained zzso Similarly, paternal obesity led to significant delays in cell cycle progression during zzso zzso zzso However, this zzso delay was observed from the second zzso stage zzso following embryonic zzso zzso zzso from obese males showed disproportionate changes in zzso zzso with significantly increased zzso Overall, zzso changes were not zzso to zzso zzso however, zzso cell numbers were significantly lower when either parent was zzso These data suggest that both maternal and paternal obesity significantly impacts zzso zzso zzso
