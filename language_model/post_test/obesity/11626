The accuracy of waist to hip zzso ratio zzso in assessing zzso abdominal fat distribution has not yet been clearly established in the obese zzso The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between zzso and zzso fat distribution, both assessed by computerized zzso zzso in a group of 28 obese patients (15 male, 13 zzso Furthermore, 33 normal weight or slightly overweight subjects zzso male, 10 zzso were studied as a control zzso zzso subjects of both sexes were found to have higher values of zzso than zzso zzso zzso fat area ratio zzso values did not differ zzso zzso correlation between zzso and zzso was present both in males zzso zzso zzso P zzso and in females zzso zzso zzso P zzso In normal weight males significant correlations between zzso and visceral fat area or zzso were zzso In obese males these correlations were much zzso In normal weight females a significant correlation was found between waist circumference and visceral fat area, whereas in obese females no positive correlations were found between zzso zzso and CT zzso of visceral fat zzso In conclusion, zzso cannot be considered as a reliable index of zzso fat distribution in obese patients, particularly if they are zzso
