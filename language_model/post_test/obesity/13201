The degree of obesity of Asians is less than that of zzso It has been suggested that Japanese, zzso as having normal weight zzso as defined by WHO (2000), have a tendency toward increased zzso of zzso and zzso Our objective was to analyze parameters zzso zzso disorders in overweight Japanese and zzso with a body mass index zzso of zzso and to assess the suitability for Asians of the Regional Office for Western Pacific Region of WHO criteria pertaining to obesity zzso criteria, zzso 

zzso study in a workplace zzso 

A total of zzso Japanese men and zzso Japanese women, and 102 Mongolian men and 155 Mongolian zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso waist zzso hip circumference and blood zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso increases in zzso of Japanese and zzso were positively associated with body fat percent, waist zzso hip circumference and zzso zzso The Japanese were zzso as zzso overweight, zzso obese I, zzso obese zzso the zzso rated as zzso overweight, zzso obese I, zzso obese II, based on the zzso zzso zzso The zzso had a higher prevalence of obesity and a higher body fat percent, but a lesser zzso of zzso than did the zzso Japanese zzso zzso Japanese zzso zzso in comparison to normal Japanese zzso zzso had significant differences in zzso blood pressure, zzso and zzso in men, and in zzso and zzso blood pressure, zzso zzso insulin and zzso model zzso resistance in zzso In contrast, the zzso showed no significant differences in zzso parameters between overweight and normal subjects, except for zzso blood zzso 

Since the relationship between abdominal fat mass and zzso is zzso a universal zzso zzso point is inappropriate for Asian populations such as the Japanese and zzso The present investigation suggests that, while the zzso criteria are suitable for Japanese, the WHO criteria are more appropriate for zzso
