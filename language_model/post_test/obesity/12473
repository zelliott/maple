Does maternal obesity affect zzso growth factor zzso axis protein expression patterns in maternal and zzso zzso 

zzso obesity zzso zzso blood expression of zzso protein zzso 

The zzso axis plays a critical role in fetal growth and zzso zzso obesity compromises zzso axis protein expression in fetal zzso which is consistent with the findings of zzso studies suggesting that maternal obesity has an independent effect on fetal growth signals during in zzso zzso 

This zzso zzso study involved 12 lean zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso and 12 obese zzso zzso women and their zzso at zzso At the completion of the study, zzso axis protein expression and hormone zzso in both maternal and zzso blood were zzso 

We obtained zzso serum samples from cases and controls matched for age, zzso mode of delivery, parity and zzso tolerance prior to and immediately following zzso zzso zzso The corresponding zzso zzso blood was also collected at zzso 

zzso comparisons revealed elevated maternal insulin zzso and zzso zzso zzso in obese zzso After adjustment, the maternal zzso model of zzso resistance zzso score was positively correlated with both maternal zzso and zzso levels zzso zzso zzso blood levels of zzso showed an inverse trend to maternal zzso zzso but were directly related to the zzso weight ratio zzso In zzso serum from obese mothers, zzso expression was attenuated compared with the controls zzso 

The limitations of our study include the zzso design and relatively small sample zzso 

Our results provide preliminary evidence for the zzso of our findings to other ethnic groups when pregnancy is complicated by zzso
