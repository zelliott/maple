In zzso offspring of two type 2 diabetic parents, low insulin sensitivity zzso and low zzso zzso effectiveness zzso predict the development of diabetes one to two decades zzso To determine whether low zzso low zzso or low acute insulin response to zzso are zzso of diabetes in a population at low genetic risk for disease, 181 zzso individuals with no family history of diabetes zzso and 150 zzso offspring of two type 2 diabetic parents zzso underwent zzso zzso tolerance testing zzso between the years zzso During 25 zzso 6 years zzso zzso zzso person years, the zzso cohort (54 zzso 9 zzso had an zzso zzso rate of type 2 diabetes of zzso per 1,000 person years, similar to that in other zzso studies, but significantly lower than zzso for the zzso zzso Even when the two study populations were subdivided by initial values of zzso and zzso derived from zzso performed at study entry, there was a zzso to zzso difference in zzso zzso rates for diabetes in the zzso zzso zzso individuals with low zzso and low zzso The acute insulin response to zzso was not zzso of the development of diabetes when considered independently or when assessed as a function of zzso zzso the zzso disposition zzso These data demonstrate that low zzso disposal rates are robustly associated with the development of diabetes in the zzso individuals, but insulin resistance per zzso is not sufficient for the development of diabetes in individuals without family history of disease and strongly suggest a familial factor, not zzso in our current measures of the dynamic responses of zzso or insulin to an zzso is an important risk factor for type 2 zzso Low zzso and low zzso both measures of zzso zzso interact with this putative familial factor to result in a high risk of type 2 diabetes in the zzso individuals, but not in the zzso zzso
