zzso advances have made remarkable progress towards our understanding of body weight zzso Much of our current knowledge has come from the cloning and zzso of the genes responsible for obesity syndromes in the zzso and the identification of zzso zzso causing rare forms of obesity in zzso Gene targeting experiments in mice have been instrumental in confirming the importance of many genes in the zzso of zzso and the existence of a fundamental zzso zzso that controls energy balance is becoming zzso The genetic zzso that zzso common forms of human obesity are largely zzso with most genes producing small zzso Thus, zzso the many genetic zzso of obesity is a current challenge for modern zzso Despite the inherent difficulties, progress has been made through zzso studies and a genetic map of quantitative trait zzso for human obesity is beginning to zzso zzso research is now very much in a transition zzso Not so long ago, access to high zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso techniques, was zzso expensive and available only to the zzso In recent years, these technologies have become more accessible to the larger scientific community and, in this paper, we will discuss how such technological advances are likely to drive the next wave of progress in obesity zzso For example, large-scale zzso screens in zzso coupled with high zzso screening are likely to emerge as important technologies for identifying genes previously unexpected to be involved in body weight zzso Furthermore, applications of zzso and zzso techniques will further refine our understanding of currently known peptides as well as identify novel pathways and molecules which are involved in energy zzso
