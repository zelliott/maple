Recent studies have suggested a role for zzso oxide zzso in the regulation of food zzso The obese zzso mouse is a genetic model of zzso Previously, it has been demonstrated that zzso mice show a marked weight reduction when treated with a zzso oxide zzso zzso In the studies reported here, we demonstrate increased levels of zzso oxide zzso zzso and its zzso in the zzso of genetically obese zzso mice compared to their lean zzso controls zzso zzso levels were zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso total zzso in zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso These studies further support the possibility of a role for zzso oxide in the regulation of food zzso
