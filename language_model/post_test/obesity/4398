The outcome of total hip replacement zzso is potentially affected by the body mass index zzso of the zzso We studied the outcome of zzso consecutive primary zzso zzso performed for zzso The mean follow-up was zzso years zzso to zzso and no patient was lost to follow-up for survival zzso The patients were divided into two groups according to their zzso as zzso non-obese zzso zzso zzso and obese zzso or zzso 30 zzso The obese patient undergoing surgery was found to be significantly younger zzso zzso The zzso test for equality of survival showed no difference in the zzso survival zzso zzso zzso with an estimated survival at 11 years of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso in the non-obese and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso in the obese zzso The clinical and zzso outcome was determined in a zzso study performed on zzso obese individuals closely matched with zzso non-obese zzso The non-obese group was found to have a significantly higher zzso Harris hip score zzso zzso and an increased range of movement, but overall satisfaction with surgery was comparable with that of the obese zzso zzso analysis of the zzso and zzso components showed no significant differences with regard to zzso lines, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso inclination angle or alignment of the zzso zzso Our results suggest that the survival of zzso zzso is not adversely affected by zzso zzso patients can therefore be zzso that despite a lower clinical score, they should expect to be satisfied with the result of their zzso with a zzso survival rate equivalent to that of non-obese zzso
