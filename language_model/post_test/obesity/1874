zzso impact on zzso metabolism was compared with that of insulin in isolated rat zzso zzso zzso zzso (20 zzso induced a zzso more pronounced zzso over zzso zzso zzso activity than insulin (10 zzso zzso zzso into zzso in zzso activity zzso lithium, zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin, zzso zzso zzso P zzso In zzso zzso was less efficient than insulin in stimulating zzso transport zzso per minute zzso lithium, zzso zzso 19 zzso insulin, zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso release zzso lithium, zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin, zzso zzso zzso P zzso and similar increments were induced in zzso synthesis zzso zzso into zzso lithium, zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin, zzso zzso zzso not zzso Full zzso of zzso effects and divergent dependency on zzso zzso zzso provided further evidence for different mechanisms of zzso In muscle from zzso obese zzso rats zzso failure of zzso to reverse deficits in zzso metabolism suggested a primary deficit in muscle zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso Hence zzso distinctly stimulates zzso zzso activity in skeletal muscle and may therefore be regarded as a candidate for the treatment of disorders associated with primary deficits in the zzso zzso
