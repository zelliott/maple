To determine whether hormonal status may affect zzso Y zzso zzso and zzso release in zzso women and in young zzso 

Forty-eight zzso women aged zzso years and 35 young women aged zzso years were zzso 

Plasma zzso zzso increased with increasing body mass index in both young and zzso women and were significantly higher in obese zzso women than in obese young women zzso zzso Plasma zzso levels in obese young and zzso women were significantly higher than in lean women zzso zzso and p zzso zzso and were significantly higher in obese and zzso zzso women than in young women zzso zzso and p zzso zzso Plasma zzso levels in zzso women, both lean and overweight, were significantly lower than in young women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In obese zzso women, plasma zzso zzso were lower without differing significantly from those in obese young zzso However, they were significantly higher than that in lean zzso women zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that the differences is plasma zzso zzso and zzso between zzso women and young women may be related to body mass index rather than to differences in hormonal status and that the higher zzso levels in both lean and obese zzso women than in young women indicate that factors other than body mass index may be zzso
