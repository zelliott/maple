zzso binding and degradation have been studied in isolated rat zzso cells of increasing zzso zzso at 24 degrees C reaches a steady state by zzso zzso in the absence of significant zzso At 37 degrees C, binding reaches only a transient maximum by zzso zzso because insulin is rapidly zzso Cellular enlargement is associated with increasing zzso binding per cell at 24 degrees C, and increasing maximum binding and degradation per cell at 37 degrees C, in spite of increasing plasma insulin zzso in the rats from which cells were zzso zzso zzso studies at 24 degrees C, however, fail to delineate the mechanism of these zzso Although zzso experiments are consistent with the presence of a small degree of zzso cooperative binding site interaction, its magnitude is unchanged with increasing cell zzso Furthermore, binding levels per unit cellular surface at 24 degrees C, at least at those insulin zzso zzso a biological response, remain relatively zzso None of the zzso in insulin binding observed here can explain the enlarged zzso cell's markedly decreased zzso response to zzso
