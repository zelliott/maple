A relatively high percentage of energy intake as protein has been shown to increase zzso and decrease energy efficiency during zzso 

To investigate whether addition of protein may improve weight maintenance by preventing or limiting weight regain after weight loss of zzso in moderately obese zzso 

In a zzso parallel design, 148 male and female subjects (age zzso zzso zzso zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso body fat zzso zzso zzso followed a very low-energy diet zzso zzso during 4 zzso For subsequent 3 months zzso assessment, they were zzso according to age, zzso body weight, restrained eating, and resting energy expenditure zzso and zzso over two zzso Both groups visited the University with the same frequency, receiving the same counseling on demand by the zzso One group zzso received zzso zzso additional protein to their zzso zzso at zzso after weight loss, and after 3 months weight maintenance were body weight, body zzso zzso zzso appetite profile, eating attitude, and relevant blood zzso 

Changes in body mass, waist zzso zzso respiratory zzso zzso total energy expenditure zzso dietary restraint, zzso zzso insulin, zzso zzso zzso zzso and free fatty acids were significant during weight loss and did not differ between zzso During weight zzso the zzso zzso showed in comparison to the zzso group 18 vs 15 zzso protein zzso a 50% lower body weight regain only consisting of zzso mass, a 50% decreased energy efficiency, increased zzso while energy intake did not zzso and a lower increase in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso and increases in other blood parameters measured did not zzso 

A zzso higher protein zzso that is, zzso of energy vs zzso of energy during weight maintenance after weight loss, resulted in a 50% lower body weight zzso only consisting of zzso mass, and related to increased zzso and decreased energy zzso
