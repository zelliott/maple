To investigate the relative contributions of insulin zzso and insulin resistance to the development of zzso intolerance in Japanese zzso 

A zzso study of zzso Japanese subjects zzso zzso 226 zzso was zzso A zzso oral zzso tolerance test zzso was given, and subjects were classified according to the World Health Organization zzso criteria zzso zzso tolerance zzso impaired zzso tolerance zzso and zzso zzso insulin zzso was assessed by the zzso index (the ratio of the zzso of insulin to that of plasma zzso zzso 30 zzso after a zzso load zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Total insulin zzso was assessed by mean zzso insulin zzso during the zzso and insulin resistance was assessed by use of the zzso model zzso 

zzso insulin zzso was significantly decreased in zzso compared with patients with zzso in both the zzso and obese subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso However, mean zzso and zzso in both zzso and obese subjects with zzso and zzso were not statistically zzso zzso with diabetes showed a significant decline in zzso and total insulin zzso and a significantly higher level of insulin resistance than did subjects with zzso When the zzso zzso zzso exceeded 100 zzso zzso insulin decreased zzso The zzso relationship between zzso and mean zzso did not show an zzso zzso and mean zzso decreased progressively when zzso exceeded zzso zzso The pattern of changes in insulin zzso and insulin resistance associated with the progression of zzso intolerance was similar in both the zzso and obese zzso 

The worsening from zzso to zzso in Japanese subjects may be associated with a decrease in zzso insulin zzso in zzso as well as in obese zzso zzso in zzso is not zzso We suggest that impaired zzso insulin zzso may be the initial zzso in the development of zzso intolerance in Japanese zzso zzso resistance may be a consequence of zzso and/or zzso
