zzso in zzso function are well documented in response to diabetes and zzso Nonetheless, clinical manifestations of zzso dysfunction are diverse and the efficacy of available therapy is zzso Since the zzso is only 1 component of the lower urinary zzso we explored existing evidence for the potential zzso of other major lower urinary tract structures to diabetes and obesity related zzso dysfunction, namely the prostate and the zzso 

We performed a zzso database search of the relevant zzso 

A relatively large literature exists on zzso dysfunction and the zzso However, when additional search terms were added, such as zzso diabetes and zzso there was a dramatic decrease in the number of retrieved zzso These observations are consistent with the vanishingly small available literature on the impact of diabetes on zzso biology and zzso function, and their potential impact on zzso zzso The available literature documents significant zzso in zzso biology and zzso function in the setting of diabetes and/or zzso 

The observed diversity in diabetes and obesity related zzso dysfunction, and the variable efficacy of currently available treatments may be related at least in part to the differential impact of these disease states on the complex integration of zzso function with other structural components of the lower urinary zzso namely the zzso and the zzso More comprehensive investigations of this system should lead to improved understanding of the zzso basis for the observed zzso and identify novel treatment zzso
