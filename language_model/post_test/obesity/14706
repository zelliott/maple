To evaluate the zzso plasma zzso and zzso response of trans fatty acids in obese and control children at zzso age in order to detect potential associations with childhood zzso 

zzso study, clinical dietary intervention with a zzso zzso standardized breakfast and zzso 3 h zzso follow-up for trans fatty acid plasma zzso 

zzso children aged zzso years of both zzso 34 obese zzso mass zzso zzso for age and zzso and 20 non-obese zzso zzso at zzso period zzso zzso 

Various zzso parameters and sex hormones, zzso insulin and zzso zzso of dietary trans fatty acid intake and their plasma zzso in zzso conditions, and for 3 h following intake of a standardized zzso 

zzso trans fatty acid intake was less than zzso of total energy in both groups, with a trend towards higher intake in obese zzso zzso plasma trans fatty acid zzso and percentages were similar in both zzso However, trans fatty acid levels at zzso h were significantly higher than at 0 h in obese children, but not in controls zzso 0 zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso controls, 0 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fatty acid zzso were not significantly affected by the zzso zzso zzso children exhibited zzso and insulin zzso however, trans fatty acid intake or their plasma levels were not associated with zzso 

There is a low intake of trans fatty acids in Southern Spanish children, which is supported by their low zzso in zzso No difference in trans fatty acid intake is observed between obese and control children, although plasma levels remain higher in obese than in control children after 3 h of a zzso A marked insulin resistance is seen in obese, but it is not correlated with either trans fatty acid intake or plasma zzso
