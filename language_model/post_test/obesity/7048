zzso necrosis factor alpha zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso insulin action and alters zzso zzso We investigated the effects of genetic zzso of zzso on circulating zzso of insulin resistance and zzso metabolism during an zzso zzso profile test and a zzso oral zzso tolerance test in subjects with type 2 diabetes zzso zzso (N zzso zzso recruited were type 2 diabetic men zzso zzso zzso and women zzso zzso zzso aged 36 to 75 years with a body mass index of at least 25 zzso Blood samples were collected to determine zzso changes in circulating zzso levels and zzso of insulin zzso zzso were zzso by zzso chain zzso zzso length zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Compared with subjects who were zzso for the zzso zzso carriers of the zzso zzso had an altered ability to suppress zzso free fatty acids as shown by an increased net incremental area under the curve zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso during the zzso zzso profile zzso This effect was observed in obese zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not in non-obese zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso Among obese subjects, carriers of the zzso zzso had greater insulin resistance as estimated by the zzso model assessment of insulin resistance index zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but no differences were observed among non-obese subjects zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso alter circulating free fatty acids and insulin resistance in obese subjects with type 2 diabetes zzso
