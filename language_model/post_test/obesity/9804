Few studies have examined associations between zzso risk factors and short-term mortality after first zzso zzso zzso zzso of 5 traditional zzso risk factors at presentation zzso hypertension, smoking, zzso and family history of premature heart disease) and hospital mortality were examined among zzso patients with first zzso in the National zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso On initial zzso zzso history of hypertension zzso was most common, followed by smoking zzso The least common risk factor was diabetes zzso Crude mortality was highest in patients with zzso with diabetes zzso and hypertension zzso and lowest in those with smoking histories zzso and zzso zzso The inclusion of 5 zzso risk factors in a zzso zzso model contributed little toward predicting hospital mortality over age alone zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso After extensive zzso adjustments for clinical and zzso factors, patients with zzso with diabetes had higher odds of dying zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso than those without diabetes and similarly for hypertension zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso family history zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and smoking zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso were associated with decreased mortality zzso zzso zzso for the full zzso In conclusion, in the setting of acute zzso histories of diabetes and hypertension are associated with higher hospital zzso but the inclusion of zzso risk factors in models of hospital mortality does not improve zzso ability beyond other major clinical and zzso zzso
