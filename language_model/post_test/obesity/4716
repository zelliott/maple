zzso of the zzso zzso zzso represents a potential approach for treating zzso zzso a potent and selective zzso zzso zzso was studied in zzso models to assess its effects on alpha zzso 

Studies were conducted with zzso to examine the effects on zzso zzso its effects in combination with a zzso zzso zzso zzso and the extent and zzso of alpha cell zzso associated with zzso antagonism in mouse zzso 

zzso treatment with zzso resulted in effective and sustained zzso lowering in mouse models in which zzso zzso zzso was replaced with human zzso zzso Treatment with zzso also led to stable, moderate zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso levels, which were completely zzso and not associated with a zzso zzso following termination of zzso When combined with a zzso zzso zzso led to additional improvement of zzso control correlated with elevated active zzso levels after zzso zzso In contrast to zzso mice in which alpha cell zzso was zzso chronic treatment with zzso in obese zzso mice did not result in gross zzso changes in pancreatic zzso 

A zzso lowered zzso effectively in diabetic models without significant alpha cell zzso during or following chronic zzso Treatment with a zzso may represent an effective approach for zzso control in patients with type 2 diabetes, which could be further enhanced when combined with zzso zzso
