zzso is one of the few trace minerals for which a specific cellular mechanism of action has not been zzso Recent in zzso studies suggest that zzso supplementation may improve insulin sensitivity by enhancing insulin zzso zzso but this has not been demonstrated in zzso We investigated the effect of zzso supplementation on insulin zzso signaling in an zzso rat model, the zzso zzso Male zzso rats (4 zzso of zzso were randomly assigned to receive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lean zzso or vehicle zzso zzso lean zzso for 3 zzso The zzso was provided in the water, and based on calculated water zzso rats zzso to zzso received 80 zzso At the end of the study, skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso were obtained at baseline and at 5, 15, and 30 zzso zzso stimulation to assess insulin zzso zzso rats treated with zzso had significantly improved zzso disposal rates and demonstrated a significant increase in zzso zzso of insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity in skeletal muscle compared with obese zzso The increase in cellular signaling was not associated with increased protein levels of the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso However, protein zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were significantly lower in obese rats administered zzso than obese zzso When corrected for protein content, zzso activity was also significantly lower in obese rats administered zzso than obese zzso Our data suggest that zzso supplementation of obese, zzso rats may improve insulin action by enhancing zzso zzso
