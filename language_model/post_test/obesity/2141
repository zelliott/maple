Historically, zzso disease zzso was associated with a zzso survival of just zzso Although advances in CD management have seen mortality rates improve, outcome from zzso surgery zzso the current zzso treatment, varies significantly between zzso 

The aim of the study was to define outcome including mortality in a cohort of CD patients treated with zzso over 20 zzso 

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 80 patients who underwent zzso to treat CD between 1988 and zzso In 72 cases, data on clinical features and outcomes were collected from medical zzso In eight patients, records were zzso but in all cases mortality data were obtained from National Health Service zzso zzso and recorded as standardized mortality zzso 

The study was conducted in a United Kingdom zzso referral zzso 

Adult patients confirmed to have CD participated in the zzso 

All patients underwent zzso 

Patients were subdivided into groups based on disease response after initial zzso zzso according to zzso was also zzso 

Median follow-up for clinical data was zzso zzso Three outcome groups were zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso persistent disease, zzso (12 of zzso and disease zzso zzso zzso of zzso Median time to recurrence after initial zzso was zzso zzso zzso range, zzso zzso Mean follow-up for mortality was zzso zzso Thirteen of 80 patients had zzso five of 52 in the cure group, two of eight in the disease recurrence group, two of 12 with persistent disease, and four of eight of those followed up by zzso registry search zzso Overall, the standardized mortality ratio was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso whereas in the cure group it was zzso zzso zzso zzso and it was zzso zzso zzso zzso for disease zzso disease zzso 

We report long-term cure rates in excess of zzso zzso is increased in CD and may be higher in patients with zzso disease compared to patients cured after initial zzso
