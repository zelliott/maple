zzso is a well-established risk factor for zzso pulmonary zzso zzso drugs and the effect of obesity on respiratory mechanics are responsible for these zzso changes, but zzso zzso with muscle relaxation may also zzso This study evaluates the influence of airway management, zzso zzso zzso zzso mask airway zzso on zzso lung volumes and zzso oxygen zzso in the early zzso zzso 

We zzso studied zzso moderately obese patients zzso 30) undergoing minor peripheral zzso They were randomly assigned to zzso zzso or zzso during general zzso with mechanical zzso zzso general zzso and respiratory settings were zzso While breathing air, we measured zzso oxygen zzso by pulse zzso zzso and zzso lung function was measured preoperatively zzso and at 10 zzso zzso 2 and 24 h after zzso with the patient zzso in a 30 degrees zzso zzso The two groups were compared using zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso significance was considered to be zzso 

zzso pulmonary mechanical function was significantly reduced in both groups compared with zzso zzso However, within the first 24 zzso lung function tests and oxygen zzso were significantly better in the zzso group zzso zzso 

In moderately obese patients undergoing minor surgery, use of the zzso may be preferable to zzso zzso with respect to zzso zzso and lung zzso
