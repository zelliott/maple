The zzso environment may influence the development of zzso but as yet, the long-term effect of growth in zzso is zzso We studied maternal smoking during pregnancy to gain insight on how an insult affecting fetal growth might subsequently influence obesity risk through childhood to age zzso 

Data from the 1958 British birth cohort (all zzso in England, Wales and Scotland, zzso March zzso including body mass index zzso maternal smoking during pregnancy and several potential zzso zzso We assessed obesity risk at ages 7, 11, 16, 23 and 33 associated with maternal zzso zzso odds ratios zzso for obesity at age 33 were estimated for zzso men and zzso women with complete zzso 

zzso of mothers who smoked in pregnancy were lighter at birth than infants of zzso but from adolescence (age 11 for zzso 16 for zzso they had an increased risk of being in the fattest zzso of zzso The OR for obesity associated with maternal smoking increased with age, suggesting strengthening of the relationship over zzso At age 33 the OR was zzso zzso zzso : zzso for men and zzso zzso zzso : zzso for zzso This was robust to adjustment for factors in early life, childhood and zzso 

An elevated risk of obesity among the offspring of smokers was not accounted for by other known zzso zzso are consistent with a long-term effect of zzso environment on zzso possibly through fetal nutrition, although other mechanisms should be investigated in future studies of zzso
