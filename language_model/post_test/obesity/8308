zzso is a major cause of morbidity and mortality during pregnancy worldwide and is among the leading causes of maternal mortality in zzso It is a complex, zzso disease, in which interaction of genetic and environmental factors should not be overlooked if the goal is proper risk assessment to support personalized preventive genetic counseling and more effective prenatal care to prevent pregnancy zzso 

zzso the contribution to zzso of interaction between a zzso zzso and adverse environmental factors in pregnant women in a zzso zzso zzso 

This was the exploratory phase of a zzso zzso study, using January zzso 2009 patient records from the zzso zzso University Hospital, a provincial zzso hospital in zzso Eighty pregnant women diagnosed with zzso and 160 controls were zzso The main variables were age, parity, nutritional status zzso by zzso alcohol use, tobacco use, and history of zzso in relatives of the pregnant woman zzso or of her zzso zzso zzso square and Fisher exact test were used to assess statistical significance of associations between variables and odds ratio as a measure of association zzso zzso zzso was studied and a zzso design used to assess zzso interaction, using zzso and additive zzso 

Among the environmental risk factors zzso alcohol showed the strongest effect on zzso risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso risk was increased for both first-degree zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and second-degree zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso relatives as well as for husband's relatives zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was evidence of interaction between alcohol consumption and family zzso 

zzso zzso of the disorder was demonstrated, the first Cuban zzso evidence of genetic and zzso contributions to zzso zzso zzso zzso among the husband's relatives demonstrates the fetal zzso importance in genesis of zzso The interaction of environmental risk factors with genetic ones produces increased zzso risk, compared to expectations based on independent action of these zzso zzso zzso zzso of pregnancy, pregnancy outcome, environment, zzso zzso interaction, genetic zzso zzso
