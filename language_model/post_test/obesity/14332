zzso in adulthood is associated with a higher occurrence of zzso zzso zzso children, without zzso hypertension, may be a unique clinical opportunity to evaluate the effect of zzso per se, on zzso zzso function, excluding the influence of possible zzso We sought to define the zzso effects of obesity on the zzso function of healthy children with excess weight who have no other clinically appreciable cause of heart disease, by using the more sensitive zzso strain zzso and S rate zzso 

We studied 320 children divided into two groups: obese children zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso age 12 zzso 3 zzso and healthy lean children, comparable for age, sex, and zzso stage zzso zzso zzso zzso mean age 12 zzso 3 zzso 

zzso blood pressure zzso and zzso zzso as well as 24-hour zzso zzso and 24-hour zzso zzso were comparable between zzso Left zzso zzso and left zzso dimensions were increased zzso zzso in group O zzso zzso 12 zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso 14 zzso Standard zzso zzso of global left zzso zzso function were similar in the two zzso zzso children showed zzso peak zzso S rate zzso zzso zzso zzso values lower zzso zzso than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso in both left and right zzso In multivariable analysis, average peak zzso zzso S was significantly correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso and left zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our study demonstrated that zzso in absence of hypertension, is associated with reduced zzso zzso deformation properties already in childhood involving both right and left zzso
