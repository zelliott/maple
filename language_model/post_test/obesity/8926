To evaluate the degree of obesity and plasma high sensitivity zzso protein zzso levels in relation to insulin resistance status among school children in zzso 

After zzso zzso we randomly selected zzso children zzso boys and 737 zzso with the mean age of zzso years (from 12 to zzso in Taipei in zzso zzso measures and plasma zzso variables (including zzso profiles, zzso and zzso were measured using standard zzso Plasma zzso levels were measured using zzso zzso We calculated insulin resistance zzso index using zzso methods and further calculated a zzso insulin resistance syndrome zzso summary score by adding the zzso ranks from the distribution of zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso high density zzso zzso and insulin levels of each zzso A high zzso summary score zzso to higher levels of zzso zzso and insulin levels and lower levels of zzso 

Boys were taller, zzso had larger zzso zzso zzso summary score and zzso than zzso however, there is no difference in plasma zzso insulin levels, and zzso index between zzso Plasma zzso levels were positively correlated with zzso measures, zzso insulin levels, zzso index, and zzso summary score and zzso correlated with zzso zzso measures, plasma zzso insulin levels, zzso index and zzso summary score were significantly higher in children with higher plasma zzso levels zzso for trend zzso After adjustment for age, heart rate, smoking and drinking, zzso continued to be positively associated with zzso variables zzso and zzso insulin levels, and zzso index and zzso correlated with zzso in both zzso Plasma zzso levels were also positively associated with zzso and zzso summary score in boys and zzso in zzso However, after further adjusting for zzso the association of zzso on zzso insulin levels, zzso index and zzso summary score disappeared in boys and on body weight, zzso insulin level and zzso index disappeared in zzso 

Plasma zzso levels are positively related to zzso zzso such as body weight and zzso insulin levels, zzso index and zzso summary score and zzso related to zzso in Taiwanese zzso Moreover, the degree of body fat status (as measured by zzso plays a more significantly role on insulin resistance status than zzso levels among Taiwanese zzso
