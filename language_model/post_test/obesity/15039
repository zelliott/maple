zzso changes due to obesity may complicate mechanical ventilation during general zzso The ideal ventilation strategy is expected to zzso gas exchange and pulmonary mechanics and to reduce the risk of respiratory zzso 

zzso search zzso zzso to March 2012, all zzso was performed for zzso trials testing zzso ventilation strategies in obese patients zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso and reporting on gas exchange, pulmonary mechanics, or pulmonary zzso zzso were performed when data from at least three studies or 100 patients could be zzso 

Thirteen studies zzso obese surgical zzso reported on a variety of ventilation zzso zzso or zzso ventilation zzso zzso various tidal volumes, and different zzso or recruitment zzso zzso and combinations zzso zzso and reporting of zzso were zzso In five trials zzso zzso zzso added to zzso compared with zzso alone improved zzso zzso ratio zzso mean difference zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and increased respiratory system compliance zzso 14 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pressure remained zzso In four trials zzso zzso comparing zzso with zzso there was no difference in zzso ratio, tidal volume, or zzso zzso zzso of further ventilation strategies or combination of other outcomes was not zzso Data on zzso complications were seldom zzso 

The ideal zzso ventilation strategy in obese patients remains zzso There is some evidence that zzso added to zzso compared with zzso alone improves zzso zzso and compliance without adverse zzso There is no evidence of any difference between zzso and zzso
