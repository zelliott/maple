We looked for zzso expressed genes at different stages of zzso differentiation and examined their functions, based on DNA zzso of zzso obtained from healthy subjects undergoing zzso zzso We downloaded gene expression profile zzso from the Gene zzso zzso database and identified the zzso expressed genes with packages in R zzso The selected zzso expressed genes were further analyzed using zzso zzso Comparing gene expression at different stages of zzso zzso we found that expression of zzso and zzso genes were altered in middle and late stages compared with the early stage, zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso expressed genes were mainly related to fatty acid zzso processes in the former two zzso
