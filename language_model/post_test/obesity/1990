zzso evidence of energy balance in laboratory rats is provided through the study of zzso body weight variations in two zzso zzso obese beta and zzso zzso from birth to zzso days of age, with different feeding patterns from 25 to 75 days of zzso zzso weight gain zzso was the gain recorded after the dark phase, in direct relation to the acquisition of zzso calories in excess of the current zzso expenditure at zzso zzso weight variation was either weight gain during zzso zzso or weight loss from weaning zzso zzso recorded after the light zzso zzso is in direct relation to daytime energy zzso when zzso expenditure exceeds the low rate of acquisition of zzso zzso The correlation between averaged individual zzso and zzso absolute values was highly significant at every age zzso An increase in absolute zzso values with age was observed and at adulthood zzso was compensated for equivalent zzso This increasing energy output with age during zzso is most likely related to the maintenance of increasing biomass and consequently, to progressive reduced growth energy zzso The existence of energy zzso and zzso with set points genetically prescribed in adults, is zzso zzso differences between lines found before adulthood give indirect evidence of higher fat zzso in the obese line in those periods of intense growth, known as the active phase of zzso
