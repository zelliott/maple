The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of dietary zzso on zzso zzso responses and zzso and hunger sensation in obese and zzso zzso A total of zzso obese and nine zzso women were recruited for the assessment of plasma zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and insulin and the sensation of zzso and hunger using a visual analogue scale before and during a zzso period after administration of three different zzso test zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso values were decreased in obese women after the consumption of a fatty meal and all the test meals, zzso However, the zzso value after a zzso meal was greater in the obese zzso The zzso value was decreased only after the intake of the protein meal in obese women when compared with zzso zzso After the consumption of the fatty zzso a significant positive correlation between maximum zzso sensation and the zzso value in the obese group and that between minimum hunger sensation and the zzso value in the zzso group were zzso In conclusion, the findings of the present study suggest that: zzso zzso sensation after consumption of zzso and protein meals in the obese group is related to the zzso insulin response, while after consumption of a fatty zzso it is related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso response does not influence the sensation of zzso and zzso zzso the reduced zzso release after the intake of a fatty meal in obese individuals may explain impaired zzso sensation; zzso the impaired zzso zzso response is not related to the consumption of zzso and may be the early indicator of zzso axis dysfunction in obese zzso
