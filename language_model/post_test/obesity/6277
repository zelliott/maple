Mice treated with zzso zzso zzso in the zzso period grow into obese, stunted adults without zzso We have previously demonstrated normal control of brown zzso tissue zzso zzso function in the zzso mouse and have concluded that zzso at a lower than normal body temperature for most of the time is a major cause of its zzso The objective of the present experiments was to find out whether zzso would prevent obesity in the zzso zzso as it does in zzso obese zzso and whether the zzso anomaly would be prevented by this zzso zzso mice that were zzso at 5 zzso of age and studied at 10 zzso of age did not become zzso zzso increased body temperature of zzso mice to normal zzso zzso or almost normal zzso zzso zzso increased BAT zzso zzso zzso binding in zzso mice, indicative of an increased zzso state, but had the same effect in control zzso We conclude that obesity in the zzso mouse is secondary to the high level of zzso in its blood, which raises its zzso efficiency, an effect of zzso also seen in normal lean mice, and causes it to zzso at a low zzso zzso This latter effect is peculiar to the zzso mouse and is not seen in zzso normal zzso
