To assess available blood tests as potential screening tools for impaired zzso tolerance zzso and type 2 diabetes zzso zzso 

We studied zzso obese zzso zzso zzso zzso children, including a zzso with serum zzso insulin levels zzso zzso zzso laboratory tests included zzso of serum zzso and insulin, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso only) zzso An oral zzso test was performed on each patient, and zzso zzso serum zzso and insulin levels were zzso zzso blood zzso zzso zzso Model of Assessment for zzso Resistance zzso zzso and zzso values were used as zzso for exceeding various zzso zzso zzso zzso operator characteristic zzso were fitted to determine zzso values as measures of screening zzso 

In the zzso zzso 3 zzso patients had zzso and 23 zzso had zzso zzso sensitivity and specificity to detect zzso were, respectively, zzso and zzso at zzso zzso and zzso and zzso at zzso zzso zzso with lower values for zzso zzso and the zzso In the entire study group, 9 zzso patients had zzso and 44 zzso had zzso zzso sensitivity and specificity to detect zzso were, respectively, zzso and zzso at zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso at a zzso zzso level of 104 zzso and zzso and zzso at an zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels are good zzso of zzso in obese children, whereas zzso values are zzso zzso and zzso are excellent zzso of zzso in zzso obese zzso
