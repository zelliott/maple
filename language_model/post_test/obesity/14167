We assessed the effect of zzso exercise as a means of preventing childhood obesity using juvenile male rats selectively bred to develop zzso obesity zzso or to be diet resistant zzso when fed a zzso fat zzso zzso Voluntary wheel running begun at 36 days of age selectively reduced zzso in zzso zzso DR zzso Other zzso zzso rats fed a zzso diet and exercised zzso for 13 zzso increased their core temperature, gained zzso less body weight, and had zzso lighter fat pads compared with sedentary zzso zzso When wheels were removed after 6 zzso (6 zzso zzso zzso zzso rats gained less body weight over the next 7 zzso than zzso rats and still had comparable zzso pad weights to zzso zzso In fact, only 3 zzso of exercise zzso to prevent obesity for 10 zzso after wheel zzso zzso the zzso rats had a zzso increase in zzso nucleus zzso zzso expression zzso zzso rats, suggesting that this contributed to their sustained obesity zzso Finally, when zzso rats were zzso restricted for 6 zzso to weight match them to zzso rats (6 zzso zzso zzso zzso they increased their intake and body weight when fed ad zzso and, after 7 zzso more, had higher zzso levels and zzso than zzso zzso Thus, zzso exercise may favorably zzso while early caloric restriction may unfavorably influence, the development of the zzso pathways controlling energy zzso during brain zzso
