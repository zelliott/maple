zzso zzso is a zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso approved for the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes zzso which requires daily subcutaneous zzso In zzso patients, zzso administration is reported to reduce zzso and zzso in association with a modest, but significant weight zzso The aim of present study was to characterize the zzso profile and zzso effects of zzso levels expressed from zzso zzso zzso in zzso following zzso zzso zzso gene therapy in two different animal models of obesity prone to impaired zzso tolerance and zzso specifically, zzso zzso rats and high fed diet zzso zzso Following zzso injection of zzso into the zzso zzso biologically active zzso was detected in the blood of both animal models and expression persisted in zzso zzso zzso cell until the end of the zzso In treated mice, zzso levels averaged zzso zzso on week 6 and in treated rats, mean circulating zzso levels were zzso zzso on week 4 and continued to increase through week zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a significant decreased weight gain in both mice and rats, significant improvement in zzso control and/or insulin sensitivity as well as visceral zzso tissue zzso zzso In conclusion, these results suggest that sustained zzso expression of zzso following zzso gene therapy is feasible and may be useful in the treatment of obesity as well as trigger improved zzso zzso
