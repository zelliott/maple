zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin signaling and is a potential therapeutic target for insulin resistance associated with obesity and type 2 zzso To date, studies of zzso have been limited by the availability of specific zzso however, treatment of zzso with zzso zzso zzso directed against zzso improves insulin sensitivity, zzso zzso gene zzso and reduces zzso zzso in liver and zzso zzso Here we investigated zzso zzso zzso in zzso First, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso and protein expression in cultured monkey zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso expression in liver and zzso tissue of zzso monkeys by zzso and improved insulin sensitivity during an zzso zzso tolerance test zzso In obese, zzso zzso zzso treatment with 20 zzso zzso zzso for 4 zzso reduced zzso zzso of insulin and zzso and reduced insulin responses during an zzso In these animals, zzso zzso were also increased by zzso most of which was an increase of zzso zzso These effects were not observed in monkeys on a lower, zzso regimen zzso zzso over 9 zzso Overall, the increase of zzso zzso during zzso zzso treatment was correlated with the lowering of insulin responses during zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso of zzso with zzso such as zzso zzso may be a viable approach for the treatment and prevention of zzso insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes because they zzso increase zzso zzso in addition to improving insulin zzso
