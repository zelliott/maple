zzso has been characterized as a potent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso potency and zzso of disturbed zzso metabolism were demonstrated in zzso which were accompanied by zzso of zzso zzso and liver zzso To examine the possible therapeutic application of zzso we have now assessed its efficacy in zzso primates with high zzso to zzso For this purpose obese, zzso zzso zzso zzso monkeys were zzso zzso with 0, 1, 3 and zzso per day orally over a period of 4 weeks zzso In addition, the effect of zzso on the zzso compartment was analyzed in zzso monkeys using liver samples obtained following a zzso oral toxicity zzso In zzso zzso the reduction of zzso and improvement of zzso zzso zzso rate indicated zzso of insulin zzso These effects were nearly zzso at a dose of zzso per day, while zzso and body weight were lowered significantly in a zzso zzso This reduction of body weight contrasts sharply with the zzso response observed with zzso another family of zzso zzso In young zzso monkeys at a dosage of zzso per day and more, zzso induced an up to zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso with an zzso to zzso increase in zzso volume zzso This moderate increase in zzso activity by zzso in monkeys is consistent with its role as an zzso zzso and zzso to the observations with zzso in other low zzso zzso zzso The increase in zzso may explain, at least in part, the zzso modulating effect as well as the zzso potency of zzso This pharmacological profile makes zzso a highly promising drug candidate for clinical applications in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, zzso obesity and the zzso zzso
