To examine differences in gait and zzso stability of obese and zzso zzso zzso 

Percentage of gait cycle in double support was examined to determine significant zzso zzso stability was compared using zzso and frequency measures of the center of pressure in zzso zzso 

zzso was examined using zzso on a zzso zzso zzso stability was examined using a measurement zzso 

Ten obese zzso zzso in body mass zzso and 10 zzso (15th to 90th zzso in body mass zzso zzso boys aged 8 to zzso 

Participants were examined at three walking cadences as determined by preferred gait zzso Full vision, darkness, and visually confused conditions were used to accentuate zzso zzso stability zzso 

In the presence of dynamic stability differences zzso zzso stability measures further investigated stability zzso 

zzso boys spent significantly zzso zzso greater percentage of gait cycle in dual zzso zzso boys showed significantly zzso zzso greater sway areas, energy, and zzso primarily in the zzso zzso 

zzso stance differences suggest diminished dynamic stability in obese zzso Greater sway areas in zzso direction in obese boys and the absence of significant frequency measures suggest that the instability observed in obese boys is caused by excess weight rather than underlying zzso zzso
