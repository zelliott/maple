Patients undergoing weight loss treatment require follow-up as part of the treatment zzso zzso solutions may be used for this zzso We have used an zzso design approach to develop a zzso zzso solution for patients undergoing weight loss zzso Our objective is to describe and report on the design process and suggest implications for zzso design of such zzso 

zzso design methods were assessed as part of the design zzso The process involved a field study to gain domain knowledge, followed by needs assessment through a series of participatory design workshops, and system evaluation through a workshop and a number of zzso tests before system zzso 

By using an zzso design approach and by involving patients and zzso professionals throughout the process, letting them hold the roles as informants, design partners, testers and users, we could reveal important aspects throughout the design process that are crucial for system realization and user zzso We found that weight loss patients are vulnerable, requiring that designers take special care when involving them in the design zzso Our findings imply that involving zzso separately during specific zzso activities is important in order to capture zzso but critical aspects of the users' zzso 

zzso zzso methods in the design of zzso solutions requires that designers must take particular considerations when patients and zzso professionals are involved in the design zzso
