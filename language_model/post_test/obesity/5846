Since 1964, the hypothesis of Pedersen has been used to explain fetal zzso observed in zzso diabetes zzso zzso by a mechanism involving maternal zzso zzso zzso However, since the zzso decade, it is known that pregnant women with zzso overweight not suffering from zzso still have a higher frequency of fetal zzso Furthermore, pregnant women with zzso despite being subjected to optimal zzso control, still show unacceptably high zzso of fetal zzso a phenomenon that is concentrated in zzso with overweight or obesity prior to zzso If zzso is not the single zzso responsible for fetal zzso in pregnant women with zzso diabetes that undergo strict zzso control, other nutrients may cause excessive fetal growth in zzso overweight zzso In this review, we propose that zzso zzso could be responsible for this accelerated fetal zzso If this hypothesis is validated in animal models and clinical studies, then normal and pathological ranges of zzso should be zzso and monitoring of zzso levels during pregnancy should be advised as a possible new alternative, besides a good zzso control, for the management of fetal zzso in zzso women with overweight prior to zzso
