zzso increases insulin sensitivity, protects zzso walls against zzso and regulates zzso zzso and is decreased in obese, insulin zzso and type 2 diabetic zzso zzso zzso in plasma as high, zzso and low molecular weight forms zzso zzso and zzso The zzso form was suggested to be closely associated with insulin zzso This study investigated whether zzso changes in insulin sensitivity were associated with changes in zzso zzso zzso 

Twenty obese women with highest and zzso obese women with lowest diet induced changes in insulin sensitivity zzso and zzso respectively), matched for weight loss zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso were selected from zzso women who underwent a zzso zzso diet zzso 600 zzso less than energy zzso Plasma zzso zzso and zzso forms of zzso were zzso using Western zzso zzso 

LCD induced comparable weight reduction in zzso and zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso model assessment insulin resistance index decreased by zzso in zzso and remained unchanged in zzso Total plasma zzso and the quantity of zzso and zzso remained unchanged in both groups, while zzso increased by zzso in zzso No differences between both groups were observed at baseline and after the zzso Total plasma zzso zzso and zzso were zzso associated with zzso insulin levels at zzso 

No differences in total plasma zzso zzso zzso and zzso forms were observed between zzso and zzso following zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is not a major zzso of weight zzso improvements in insulin zzso
