Type 2 diabetes is a major cause of morbidity and zzso and despite treatment advances appears to be increasing in zzso Since individuals at risk for the disease are usually identifiable in the zzso phase of impaired zzso zzso early intervention might prevent diabetes and hence its complications from zzso zzso and sedentary living are powerful zzso of diabetes, and thus lifestyle change is a logical approach to prevention of this zzso Recent clinical trials have now tested the effectiveness of this intervention and form the basis for this zzso 

Three clinical trials have demonstrated that, compared with usual care, lifestyle intervention significantly reduced progression rates to diabetes in zzso zzso Each trial incorporated zzso and repeated long-term contacts with zzso in which dietary and physical activity goal setting and behavior modification were central zzso zzso to diabetes was reduced in the Da zzso study by approximately zzso in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study by zzso and in the Diabetes Prevention Program by zzso The Diabetes Prevention Program included a cost-benefit unit that estimated the per capita costs of the lifestyle intervention to exceed that of the usual care group by zzso zzso which translated to a cost of zzso zzso per case of diabetes zzso Lifetime zzso analysis demonstrated an overall cost of zzso zzso per zzso life zzso 

These findings make the case for translation of research findings to zzso zzso Although there is more to be learned about effective strategies in clinical practice, it seems clear that the intervention needs to incorporate zzso and long-term interaction with trained zzso
