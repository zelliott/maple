Several studies have suggested that the association between obesity and asthma may be stronger in females than in zzso but the reason is still zzso 

The aim of this study was to investigate whether differences in zzso zzso protein zzso levels explain why obesity is associated with asthma in females but not in zzso 

This study zzso enrolled zzso subjects zzso 18 years old from zzso asthma patients and zzso zzso We measured zzso factors zzso mass index zzso waist circumference and zzso zzso zzso and total zzso zzso 

After adjusting for potential zzso factors, we found a significant association between zzso and asthma in females with a significant interaction of gender and zzso on asthma zzso zzso zzso If zzso was added to the zzso model, the interaction was attenuated but still significant zzso zzso zzso After adjusting for zzso we did not find that circulating zzso zzso were significantly associated with asthma in males and zzso 

We found that zzso was associated with asthma in zzso but our results do not support the suggestion that zzso levels contribute significantly to the link between obesity and asthma with respect to gender zzso
