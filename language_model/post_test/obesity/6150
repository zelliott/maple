Regular exercise appears to be one of the best zzso of successful weight zzso Although physical activity and exercise are important components in the prevention and treatment of zzso many obese adults without zzso disorders are unable to exercise due to zzso on zzso As a result they may not participate in regular physical zzso Therefore zzso zzso in obese adults is also an obstacle to the prevention and treatment of obesity and zzso zzso The available data suggest that increased respiratory muscle force generation, and the zzso increase in respiratory neural drive associated with increased ventilation are an important source of sensation of respiratory effort in obese zzso Whether zzso zzso is due to either abnormal respiratory mechanical factors zzso limitation and/or chest elastic zzso or the increased zzso demand of locomotion in zzso or both of these together, the available data indicate that intensity of zzso at any given ventilation and oxygen zzso does not increase in obese subjects as compared with normal weight control zzso Does this mean that respiratory mechanical factors are unlikely to be zzso Nonetheless, the component of zzso cost of breathing may not be accounted for in the measured mechanical work of breathing because of the number of included complex zzso That a decrease in efficiency of the respiratory muscles during exercise contributes to zzso in zzso obese subjects should not be zzso
