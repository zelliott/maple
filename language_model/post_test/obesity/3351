The moderate quality of beta obesity and its relatively slow evolution make it potentially useful for defining the sequence of events that lead to the overt zzso Estimates of food zzso live body weight, deep body temperature, zzso and zzso were obtained at several times during the day in beta genetically obese and alpha zzso control male rats at zzso age, in order to characterize the dynamic phase of this obesity and to attempt the definition of some previous proceedings that eventually produce the full obesity zzso zzso higher food intake in the light cycle preceded its whole day zzso Both zzso showed the normal pattern of predominantly nocturnal zzso A lower light zzso weight loss in beta preceded the zzso Thus, beta rats were not significantly heavier than alpha until the end of the last period zzso when they were 75 days zzso A zzso in zzso zzso in beta zzso is suggested, as values on deep body temperature in relation to alpha were significantly lower at all times of day zzso zzso zzso value between daily net weight gain versus deep body temperature was: r zzso zzso zzso less than zzso suggesting a diminished zzso stimulation in beta brown zzso zzso A sustained zzso in beta at every time of the day studied suggested its zzso zzso zzso in zzso values were not statistically significant between zzso though apparently wider variations in beta could reflect a certain zzso regulation zzso in the obese zzso
