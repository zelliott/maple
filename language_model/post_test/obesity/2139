zzso muscle plays important roles in zzso zzso and fatty acid zzso However, muscle also zzso zzso and growth factors zzso termed zzso that can potentially act in an zzso a zzso and/or an zzso manner to zzso zzso zzso and other zzso Here, we report the identification and characterization of zzso a novel zzso belonging to the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso transcript was highly induced in differentiated zzso and predominantly expressed by skeletal zzso zzso levels of zzso were tightly regulated by the zzso state; zzso zzso but zzso dramatically increased, its zzso and serum zzso Although zzso and circulating levels of zzso were reduced in a zzso obese state, voluntary exercise increased its expression and circulating zzso zzso zzso transcript was zzso by compounds zzso zzso zzso that raise cellular zzso or calcium zzso In zzso zzso zzso forms zzso zzso and when zzso forms zzso complexes with other members of the zzso protein zzso In mice, zzso zzso administration reduced circulating levels of free fatty acids without altering zzso tissue zzso zzso with this, zzso promoted fatty acid zzso in cultured zzso and zzso in part by zzso the expression of genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso that promote zzso zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso links skeletal muscle to zzso zzso in liver and zzso tissue in response to zzso in energy state, revealing a novel zzso zzso zzso
