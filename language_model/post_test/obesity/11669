To determine the relative rates of zzso and zzso following administration of a test meal in lean and obese zzso zzso 

zzso lean and obese zzso rats were zzso overnight, then zzso a test meal of balanced composition amounting to zzso zzso rats and one group of obese zzso or zzso (one group of obese zzso and containing 200 zzso zzso zzso Immediately after the meal the rats were injected zzso with 5 zzso of zzso and killed 1 h zzso 

zzso was calculated from the incorporation of zzso into liver zzso divided by the specific activity of plasma zzso zzso was calculated similarly from the incorporation of zzso into zzso lipids in liver and zzso zzso zzso The proportion of zzso zzso by the indirect zzso via zzso was determined from the ratio of zzso zzso at positions zzso and C2 in the zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis from zzso was determined from the ratio of zzso enrichment in liver zzso to that in plasma zzso 

The rate of synthesis of zzso was considerably lower in the zzso of obese rats than those of lean controls, with the larger meal causing a small but significant increase in zzso The proportion of zzso zzso via zzso showed a zzso increase in the obese rats, while the amount of zzso zzso from zzso was significantly zzso zzso zzso rates were about five times higher in both groups of obese rats than the lean zzso In zzso zzso zzso per g tissue was slightly reduced in the obese rats, although there was clearly an increase in zzso tissue zzso activity per whole zzso The larger meal caused a greater rise in plasma zzso and insulin zzso but did not affect zzso rates, although it did cause a greater suppression of zzso as indicated by a lower plasma zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is zzso predominantly into zzso fatty acid synthesis in obese zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis is suppressed and comes mainly from precursors other than zzso The suppression of zzso zzso synthesis may contribute to the increased energetic efficiency of obese zzso zzso
