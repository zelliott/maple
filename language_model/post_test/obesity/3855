zzso is a risk factor for zzso breast cancer and is associated with poor zzso zzso a zzso zzso in zzso zzso has been implicated as a link between obesity and breast zzso In the present study, the effects of zzso on cell proliferation and proteins associated with zzso signaling and/or breast cell growth were investigated in zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso breast cancer cell zzso zzso and zzso also zzso zzso For proliferation zzso zzso plates were used and for protein zzso cells were synchronized in zzso plates for zzso h in zzso zzso zzso was added at 0, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 zzso for 24 and 48 zzso For Western zzso zzso protein extracts were zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Overall, except for zzso cells, zzso zzso proliferation in all zzso zzso cells expressed higher levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso manner to 50 zzso at 24 zzso and zzso increased at 24 zzso zzso D1 and zzso levels increased with zzso zzso Higher zzso expression was observed at both 24 and 48 zzso In zzso cells, zzso and zzso were increased at 48 zzso whereas zzso and zzso D1 expression increased in zzso cells at 24 and 48 zzso In zzso cells, zzso and zzso were elevated at higher zzso zzso at 24 and 48 zzso However, zzso and zzso demonstrated an increase only in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso D1 exhibited higher expression at both 24 and 48 zzso while zzso expression was lower with increasing zzso of zzso at 48 zzso In zzso cells, zzso and zzso increased at 24 and 48 zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso and insulin levels increased in zzso zzso cells after 48 zzso zzso and zzso were decreased at 24 h and a zzso increase at 48 h was zzso Higher expression of zzso was observed with zzso for 24 zzso In zzso cells, zzso increased at both 24 and 48 zzso A similar trend was found for zzso and zzso zzso Higher levels of zzso and zzso were observed after 24 zzso Interestingly, there was a gradual increase of zzso expression at 24 zzso but a gradual decrease at 48 h in relation to the dose of zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso showed a decline at 24 h and an increase at 48 zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected at 48 h in cells and increased zzso expression was observed at 24 zzso These data indicate that zzso may influence breast cancer development in relation to zzso status as well as to the presence or absence of zzso zzso study on zzso may be helpful for a better understanding of breast cancer development in obese zzso
