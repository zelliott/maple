To examine zzso of community walking performance and walking capacity in people with zzso spinal zzso zzso compared with people with low back pain and zzso control zzso 

zzso zzso 

University spine zzso 

Participants zzso 50 zzso 44 low back pain, 32 zzso control subjects) aged 55 to 80 years were zzso 

Not zzso 

zzso community walking distance measured by zzso zzso zzso and a 15-minute walking test zzso zzso All participants had zzso magnetic resonance imaging, zzso testing, and a history and physical examination, including a history of pain and zzso symptoms, a straight leg raise test, and tests for directional symptoms, zzso strength, and nerve tension zzso The study questionnaire included demographic information, a history of zzso pain, and questions about walking, exercise frequency, and pain level, as well as the standardized Quebec Back zzso zzso zzso 

Body mass index zzso pain, age, and female sex predicted walking performance zzso and walking capacity zzso The diagnosis of zzso itself had no clear relationship with either walking zzso Compared with the zzso group, zzso participants had significantly lower values for all walking zzso with the exception of stride zzso while there was no significant difference between the zzso and low back pain zzso 

zzso pain, female sex, and age predict walking performance and capacity in people with zzso those with low back pain, and zzso control zzso While pain was the strongest predictor of walking capacity, zzso was the strongest predictor of walking zzso Average pain, rather than leg pain, was zzso of walking performance and zzso zzso and pain are modifiable zzso of walking deficits that could be targets for future intervention studies aimed at increasing walking performance and capacity in both the low back pain and zzso zzso
