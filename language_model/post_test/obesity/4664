zzso of zzso of published zzso studies is problematic because of numerous sources of zzso We develop bias assessment, zzso and adjustment methods, and apply them to a systematic review of zzso zzso studies of the relationship between zzso measured physical activity and subsequent change in zzso in zzso 

We separated internal biases that reflect study quality from external biases that reflect zzso to a target zzso Since published results were presented in different formats, these were all converted to correlation zzso zzso were considered as additive or zzso on the correlation zzso Opinions about the extent of each bias in each study, together with its uncertainty, were zzso in a formal process from zzso trained zzso for the internal biases and zzso specialists for the external zzso zzso results for each study were combined across zzso using median zzso and results combined across studies by zzso zzso 

Before adjusting for bias, the pooled correlation is difficult to interpret because the studies varied substantially in quality and design, and there was considerable zzso After adjusting for both the internal and external zzso the pooled correlation provides a meaningful quantitative summary of all available evidence, and the confidence zzso incorporates the zzso uncertainties about the extent of the zzso In the adjusted zzso there was no apparent zzso 

This approach provides a viable method of bias adjustment for zzso of zzso studies, allowing the quantitative synthesis of evidence from otherwise incompatible zzso From the zzso of zzso zzso studies, we conclude that there is no evidence that physical activity is associated with gain in body zzso
