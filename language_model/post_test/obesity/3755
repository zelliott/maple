Eating large amounts of food at a rapid rate, defined as zzso may contribute to excess energy zzso We aimed to evaluate whether altering portion sizes and eating rate could decrease energy intake during an extra-large fast food zzso 

zzso were adolescents zzso zzso zzso 13 to 17 years of age, who reported eating fast zzso or zzso time per zzso zzso exceeded the 80th zzso for all zzso Three feeding conditions were evaluated with a crossover zzso Total amounts and types of foods and zzso served during the meal were held constant across conditions, zzso approximately zzso of that consumed during a baseline assessment visit when subjects were offered unlimited zzso The meal zzso zzso French fries, and zzso was presented as 1 large serving at a single time point zzso A, zzso zzso into 4 smaller servings presented at a single time point zzso B, effects of zzso or zzso into 4 smaller servings presented at 15-minute intervals zzso C, effects of zzso and eating zzso Energy intake across conditions was compared by using analysis of zzso 

Energy intake was not significantly different, whether expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso condition A, zzso zzso zzso zzso condition B, zzso zzso 433 zzso condition C, zzso zzso 500 zzso or relative to total daily energy expenditure zzso zzso zzso condition A, zzso zzso zzso condition B, zzso zzso zzso condition C, zzso zzso zzso 

zzso consumed approximately 50% of energy needs regardless of zzso in portion sizes and eating rate to zzso zzso This finding suggests that nutritional factors inherent to fast food, such as low levels of dietary zzso high zzso high energy density, high fat content, high zzso load, and high content of sugar in liquid form promote excess energy zzso
