We conducted this study to compare the relationships between zzso zzso and zzso syndrome zzso defined by four definitions in Chinese zzso

zzso with zzso defined by zzso and zzso criteria had significantly higher carotid zzso controlling for age, zzso smoking, and serum zzso zzso by zzso partial zzso zzso zzso partial zzso zzso The association between carotid zzso and zzso defined by zzso III or WHO criteria was not zzso zzso with more components of zzso defined by zzso zzso or zzso III criteria correlated to higher carotid zzso in adjusted models zzso for trend, zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso WHO, zzso 

zzso definitions by zzso and zzso criteria are the best among four definitions in detecting zzso zzso in zzso Chinese zzso whereas zzso defined by WHO criteria is the zzso
