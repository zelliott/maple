This study examined the importance of zzso zzso in zzso changes in zzso function and increased mean zzso pressure zzso during the development of zzso obesity in chronically zzso zzso Mean zzso pressure, heart rate zzso and cardiac output zzso were recorded 24 hours per day in lean dogs zzso before and after administration of an zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso twice daily), for 10 zzso After 10 days of zzso treatment, the dogs zzso were given a supplement of cooked beef fat for 5 weeks while zzso was zzso An zzso group zzso was fed a high fat diet for 5 weeks and used as control zzso In lean dogs, zzso decreased zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso rate from zzso to zzso zzso while inducing a small negative zzso balance zzso zzso Plasma zzso activity increased from zzso to zzso zzso zzso per hour and plasma zzso increased from zzso to zzso zzso After 5 weeks of a high fat diet, body weight increased zzso to zzso in zzso and C obese zzso In C dogs, zzso increased by zzso zzso zzso compared with only zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Compared with zzso dogs, the zzso dogs had smaller increases in CO zzso versus zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso rate zzso versus zzso and cumulative zzso balance zzso zzso versus zzso zzso after 5 weeks of a high fat zzso Thus, zzso markedly attenuated zzso zzso sodium zzso and hypertension associated with chronic zzso zzso These observations indicate that zzso plays an important role in the zzso of obesity zzso
