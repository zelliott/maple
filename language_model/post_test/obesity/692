To study overweight and zzso fitness among children in the third and fourth grades of elementary schools in a city in the United States of America zzso Paso, zzso and a city in Mexico zzso zzso that are on or near the border between those two countries, and to compare the results from those two cities with earlier findings for other children in the United zzso 

We followed the El Paso children (427 boys and 385 girls, zzso of them of Mexican zzso from third to fourth grade and assessed the change in their body mass index zzso In the city of zzso we zzso measured the zzso of a sample of third grade children zzso boys and 237 zzso and a sample of fourth grade children zzso boys and 215 zzso zzso and zzso zzso were measured for all the children studied in the two zzso zzso was used to assess risk for overweight (at least the zzso zzso zzso for age and zzso and overweight (at least the 95th zzso zzso for age and zzso in all the zzso The distance that El Paso children ran in nine minutes was used to assess their zzso fitness zzso fitness was not measured in the zzso zzso The data from El Paso were collected in 1999, 2000, and 2001, and the zzso data were collected in 2000 and zzso
