zzso seed zzso extract zzso is a natural zzso that exerts zzso zzso zzso is an inflammatory condition and inflammatory cells and their zzso of zzso molecules contribute to the zzso of zzso zzso arthritis zzso is a chronic zzso disease that is characterized by inflammation of zzso lined by zzso Previously, we demonstrated that obesity zzso arthritis severity in collagen induced arthritis zzso a zzso model of human zzso Here, we investigated whether oral administration of zzso showed zzso and zzso effects in high-fat zzso obese zzso mice and in obese zzso mice, zzso The zzso mechanisms by which zzso zzso weight gain and arthritis severity in zzso were also zzso In zzso mice, zzso administration significantly inhibited weight gain, reduced fat zzso in liver and improved serum zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was associated with increased populations of regulatory T zzso cells and those of decreased zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells was associated with significant zzso of their key zzso factors, zzso and zzso On the contrary, zzso zzso induction was associated with enhanced zzso zzso To identify the zzso effects of zzso zzso was given orally for 7 weeks after type II collagen zzso zzso treatment significantly attenuated the development of zzso arthritis in obese zzso zzso In line with zzso mice, zzso administration decreased zzso cells and zzso increased zzso cells by regulating zzso proteins in zzso arthritis zzso The expressions of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso were significantly inhibited by zzso zzso Taken together, zzso functions as a zzso regulator of T cell differentiation - suppression of zzso cells and induction of zzso in both zzso and obese zzso zzso zzso may act as a therapeutic agent to treat zzso diseases related with enhanced zzso activity such as zzso disorders and zzso zzso
