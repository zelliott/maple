zzso is a major public health problem with strong genetic zzso Multiple genetic zzso have been implicated for obesity by conducting zzso association zzso studies, primarily focused on body mass index zzso Fat body mass zzso is zzso more homogeneous than zzso and is more appropriate for obesity research; however, relatively few studies have been conducted on zzso zzso to identify zzso associated with zzso we carried out zzso of seven zzso studies for zzso traits including zzso and followed these analyses by de zzso zzso The discovery zzso consisted of 21 zzso individuals from diverse ethnic populations and a total of over 4 million zzso or zzso zzso The de zzso replication zzso consisted of zzso subjects from two independent zzso To complement individual zzso association zzso we also carried out zzso zzso analyses in which all variations within a gene were considered zzso Individual zzso association analyses identified a novel locus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that was associated with zzso after the adjustment of lean body mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso significance zzso zzso association analyses identified a novel gene zzso zzso zzso in zzso that was significantly associated with zzso adjusted by zzso In addition, we confirmed three previously reported obesity zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mass and obesity zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso We also found that zzso may exert zzso effects to both zzso and zzso Our results provide additional insights into the molecular genetic basis of obesity and may provide future targets for effective prevention and therapeutic zzso
