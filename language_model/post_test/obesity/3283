The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the zzso effect on pancreatic zzso exerted by zzso zzso and/or by zzso administration is impaired in human zzso For this purpose plasma zzso zzso were measured in 8 obese and 8 zzso zzso subjects during a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was infused at the rate of zzso zzso during the third hour of the zzso zzso plasma zzso was higher in obese than in zzso subjects zzso zzso 32 vs zzso zzso 15 zzso p less than zzso zzso zzso zzso In the last 20 zzso of the zzso infusion period preceding zzso administration zzso zzso of the zzso plasma zzso averaged 195 zzso 26 zzso in obese and 122 zzso 13 zzso in zzso subjects zzso less than zzso with a reduction of 19 zzso zzso in the former and 28 zzso zzso in the latter zzso zzso zzso In both groups zzso infusion did not result in a further decrease in plasma zzso which averaged 192 zzso 27 zzso in obese and 123 zzso 16 zzso in zzso subjects zzso less than zzso in the zzso zzso period of the zzso Also after zzso zzso infusion plasma zzso levels did not zzso These results suggest that in human obesity zzso zzso has a normal zzso effect on pancreatic zzso and that zzso administration has no additive effect on zzso and zzso in either obese or zzso zzso zzso
