To evaluate the long-term effect of changes in body composition induced by weight loss on insulin sensitivity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso effectiveness zzso zzso zzso 

zzso metabolism was evaluated before and after participation in a two-year weight loss trial of zzso zzso zzso combined with an energy and fat restricted zzso 

Twelve obese patients (11 women, 1 zzso age zzso zzso zzso years, body weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

At inclusion and 2 years later an oral zzso tolerance test zzso and a frequently sampled intravenous zzso tolerance test zzso were zzso Body composition was estimated by a zzso X-ray zzso zzso whole body zzso 

The patients obtained varying changes in zzso ranging from a weight loss of zzso zzso to a weight gain of zzso zzso zzso changes in fat mass zzso varied from a zzso reduction to zzso zzso A significant decrease in both zzso zzso zzso zzso and 2 h zzso zzso zzso blood zzso at zzso was zzso The improvement in insulin sensitivity zzso estimated by means of zzso zzso Model, was significantly and zzso correlated to change in total zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso A multiple zzso analysis showed that changes in zzso zzso was the strongest predictor of change in zzso explaining zzso of the zzso First phase insulin response zzso unchanged whereas insulin disposition index increased significantly zzso zzso zzso At inclusion five patients had impaired zzso tolerance of which four, who lost weight, were zzso at the zzso 2 years zzso 

In obese subjects long-term minimal or moderate changes in weight were found to be zzso associated with changes in insulin zzso In obese subjects with impaired zzso tolerance even a minor weight loss was able to zzso zzso zzso
