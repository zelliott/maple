To understand the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in regulating zzso zzso 

zzso was first zzso by continuous infusion of zzso zzso and then the rate of label loss from the zzso zzso pool zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso muscle of awake, zzso obese rats during the subsequent zzso clamp experiments zzso was zzso 

zzso zzso fractional zzso turnover rate in zzso was zzso zzso zzso significantly lower than that in zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso or zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso p zzso a pattern zzso to their zzso pool zzso zzso infusion at 25 zzso per minute resulted in zzso zzso zzso increase over the baseline zzso This caused an increase in zzso turnover by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso but a decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and in zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso activity in heart zzso zzso zzso and zzso fat zzso zzso zzso but not in skeletal muscle zzso zzso The pool size of zzso was not affected by zzso 

The results demonstrated zzso dependence in the response of zzso turnover to zzso in the obesity zzso The zzso insulin effects on zzso turnover in zzso zzso zzso muscle indicated a possibility that zzso muscle contributes more to insulin resistance under zzso if zzso acid zzso is a function of zzso zzso turnover does not seem to regulate zzso pool size zzso
