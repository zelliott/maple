zzso breathing zzso is common, but largely zzso in the general zzso Information on demographic patterns of zzso occurrence and its zzso factors in the general population is needed to target high-risk groups that may benefit from zzso 

The sample comprised zzso zzso men and women aged between 40 and 98 years who were enrolled in the Sleep Heart Health zzso Data were collected by zzso clinical zzso and in-home zzso zzso breathing status was based on the average number of zzso and zzso episodes per hour of sleep zzso index zzso We used multiple zzso zzso modeling to estimate zzso associations of selected participant characteristics with zzso defined by an zzso of 15 or zzso 

Male sex, age, body mass index, neck zzso zzso and repeated breathing pause frequency were independent, significant zzso of an zzso of 15 or zzso People reporting habitual zzso loud zzso and frequent breathing pauses were 3 to 4 times more likely to have an zzso of 15 or greater vs an zzso less than 15, but there were weaker associations for other factors with an zzso of 15 or zzso The odds ratios zzso confidence zzso for an zzso of 15 or greater vs an zzso less than 15 were zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso increments in body mass index and neck zzso As age increased, the magnitude of associations for zzso and body zzso zzso and breathing pauses zzso 

A significant proportion of zzso zzso in the general population would be missed if screening or case finding were based solely on increased body zzso or male zzso zzso pauses and obesity may be particularly insensitive for identifying zzso in older zzso A better understanding of zzso factors for zzso particularly in older adults, is zzso
