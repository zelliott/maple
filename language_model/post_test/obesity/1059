zzso zzso obesity zzso in zzso is associated with zzso and resistance to zzso but the response to agents acting downstream of zzso receptors remains zzso We assessed the response of mice with zzso to treatment with zzso an zzso hormone zzso zzso delivered four times daily by zzso injection to zzso mice produced a zzso effect on food zzso body weight, zzso zzso insulin, and free fatty zzso In zzso mice, administration of zzso 100 zzso zzso zzso markedly suppressed feeding during the first 4 days of treatment, with food intake returning to control levels at day zzso Progressive weight loss also occurred over the first 4 days, after which weight zzso at a level below zzso After 8 days of treatment, zzso zzso mice had major suppression of both zzso and insulin zzso Central administration of zzso for 4 days (10 zzso in zzso mice significantly suppressed food zzso induced weight loss, and increased energy zzso These results indicate that 1) zzso administration to zzso mice causes suppression of food intake and body weight loss, and decreased food intake is primarily responsible for weight zzso 2) peripheral zzso improves insulin resistance in zzso zzso 3) zzso to the effect of chronic zzso treatment on food intake zzso and 4) at least some of the effects of zzso are exerted zzso In conclusion, treatment with a zzso zzso is a promising therapeutic approach to zzso and associated insulin zzso
