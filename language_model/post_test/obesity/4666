A novel approach is explored for improving zzso zzso in zzso studies by comparing zzso from high-income with low- or middle-income countries zzso where zzso structures zzso This is applied to assessing zzso effects of zzso on child blood pressure zzso body mass index zzso and intelligence zzso zzso 

zzso approaches for assessing the zzso structure of zzso by zzso position were applied to the British Avon zzso Study of Parents and Children zzso zzso and Brazilian zzso 1993 zzso zzso This was used to improve zzso zzso regarding associations of zzso with child zzso zzso and zzso zzso were extended to include results from a zzso of five zzso zzso and compared with a zzso trial of zzso zzso zzso Although higher zzso position was strongly associated with zzso in zzso there was little such patterning in zzso In zzso zzso was associated with lower zzso lower zzso and higher zzso adjusted for zzso but in the directions expected if due to socioeconomic zzso In contrast, in zzso zzso was not strongly associated with zzso or zzso but was associated with higher zzso zzso in associations observed between zzso and the zzso zzso were in line with those observed between zzso and zzso but with robust evidence of zzso detected between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Trial data supported the conclusions zzso by the zzso zzso which provided evidence for zzso effects on zzso but not for zzso or zzso 

While reported associations of zzso with child zzso and zzso are likely to reflect residual zzso zzso may have zzso effects on zzso Comparing associations between populations with differing zzso structures can be used to improve zzso zzso in zzso zzso
