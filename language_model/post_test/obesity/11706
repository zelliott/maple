zzso zzso rates are greater after oral zzso than after zzso administration of an equivalent zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso response to an oral zzso load results from the release of mainly two gut zzso gastric zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which zzso zzso insulin zzso Because of their zzso action, their abnormal zzso may be involved in the zzso of the zzso of childhood zzso In this study, we used the zzso clamp with a small oral zzso load to assess the effect of childhood obesity on zzso response in seven zzso lean and 11 zzso obese children and in 14 lean adolescents and 10 obese zzso Plasma zzso was acutely raised to 11 zzso by zzso zzso zzso and kept at this concentration for 180 zzso Each subject zzso oral zzso (30 zzso at 120 zzso and the zzso infusion was adjusted to maintain the plasma zzso zzso zzso insulin and zzso zzso and insulin zzso rates zzso by the zzso zzso were significantly greater in obese children compared with lean children zzso zzso Similarly, during the first 120 zzso of the zzso insulin zzso rates were higher in obese than lean zzso After oral zzso plasma insulin, zzso and insulin zzso rates further increased in all four zzso This zzso effect was zzso greater in obese versus lean adolescents zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso were similar at baseline in all four groups and remained unchanged during the first 120 zzso of the zzso After oral zzso plasma zzso zzso rose sharply in all groups zzso zzso Of note, the rise in zzso was similar in both lean and obese zzso In conclusion, under conditions of stable zzso the zzso of a small amount of zzso zzso equivalent zzso responses in both lean and obese zzso However, despite similar zzso responses, insulin zzso was markedly zzso in obese zzso Thus, in juvenile zzso excessive zzso zzso stimulation may be independent of the increased release of zzso
