The aim of this study was to determine the effect of common zzso gene zzso on dietary zzso changes in zzso levels and zzso model assessment of insulin resistance zzso zzso 

A total of zzso subjects with impaired zzso zzso zzso or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes followed a dietary intervention zzso of cooked refined rice with whole grains and an increase in vegetable zzso and regular walking for 12 weeks without any zzso zzso gene single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were examined in these zzso 

After this dietary intervention, zzso zzso levels decreased in all three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso showed increased zzso levels and decreased zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso carriers of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso carriers of the zzso zzso zzso showed a reduction in the zzso index after adjustment for baseline zzso zzso differences were observed in changes in zzso indexes and zzso zzso according to the zzso zzso zzso in zzso but not in zzso zzso the greatest decrease in zzso indexes and the greatest increase in zzso levels were shown in zzso subjects with the zzso zzso 

zzso genetic zzso can affect circulating zzso levels and insulin resistance indexes in subjects with zzso or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in response to dietary zzso
