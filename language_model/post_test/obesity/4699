The aim of this study was to determine the effect of chronic dietary supplementation of a grape seed zzso extract zzso at a dose of 35 zzso body weight on energy metabolism and zzso function in the skeletal muscle of zzso obese zzso Three groups of 10 animals each were zzso lean zzso lean group zzso rats, a control zzso obese group zzso of rats, and an obese supplemented zzso zzso obese group zzso of rats, which were supplemented with a dose of 35 zzso zzso of body zzso during the 68 days of zzso zzso muscle energy metabolism was evaluated by determining zzso activities, key zzso gene zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso function was analyzed by high-resolution zzso using both a zzso and a zzso zzso In muscle, chronic zzso administration decreased zzso zzso activity, the amount of zzso zzso complexes I and II, and zzso gene zzso without any effects on the zzso zzso zzso This situation was associated with lower zzso oxygen species zzso zzso Additionally, zzso administration enhanced the ability to zzso zzso and it also increased the activity of zzso involved in zzso zzso including zzso c zzso There is strong evidence to suggest that zzso administration stimulates zzso function in skeletal muscle specifically by increasing the capacity to zzso zzso and contributes to reduced muscle zzso generation in obese zzso zzso
