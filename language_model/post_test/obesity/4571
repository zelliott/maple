zzso is associated with insulin resistance in the peripheral zzso and is an important risk factor for coronary artery zzso The current study assessed whether the vascular effects and the signaling pathways of insulin are impaired in coronary arteries from a rat model of genetic zzso zzso arteries from obese zzso rats zzso and lean zzso rats zzso were mounted in zzso zzso to assess insulin zzso effects and the proteins of the insulin zzso were determined by Western zzso The zzso and zzso oxide zzso zzso effect of insulin was similar in arteries from zzso and zzso and blunted by zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso NO zzso zzso but zzso by either zzso activated protein zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso in zzso and insulin increased zzso of zzso and zzso in both zzso and zzso Moreover, insulin enhanced zzso expression in zzso zzso and zzso levels of zzso zzso were lower in zzso and zzso acid reduced these levels in zzso zzso arteries are protected from vascular zzso The results underscore the fact that preservation of zzso zzso along with an zzso of the zzso zzso and an impairment of the zzso cascade account for this zzso
