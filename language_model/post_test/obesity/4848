zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that exerts zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We tested the hypothesis that part of the zzso effect of zzso is zzso through the action of zzso protein zzso zzso First, we determined the effect of acute zzso zzso incubation of zzso zzso with zzso on zzso regulation and zzso zzso Compared with control zzso 200 zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso of zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were increased zzso zzso in these zzso To investigate the effects of chronic zzso treatment on zzso regulation in skeletal muscle in zzso obese zzso rats were randomly allocated into two experimental groups: control and zzso zzso zzso rats were treated with vehicle and acted as a control group for obese zzso zzso zzso were zzso daily for 6 zzso with either vehicle zzso zzso 100 zzso g body zzso or 3 zzso zzso zzso activity was similar in muscle from lean and obese animals and was unaffected by zzso zzso zzso activity was approximately zzso lower in obese zzso lean animals zzso zzso but was zzso to control values after zzso zzso zzso zzso was decreased with obesity zzso zzso but restored to the level of lean controls with zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso restores zzso signaling in skeletal muscle of zzso obese zzso zzso
