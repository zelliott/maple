To zzso the potential benefit to individuals of differing zzso of weight or waist circumference loss in an zzso zzso 

Data were from the Well zzso Health zzso a cohort study in 19 rural zzso communities in Far North zzso zzso data were collected between 1998 and 2000 from zzso people aged 15 to 75, an estimated participation rate of zzso zzso data were collected between 2004 and 2007 from zzso zzso zzso between change in weight and waist circumference for those who were overweight or obese zzso with changes in serum zzso zzso zzso blood pressure and zzso zzso were estimated using linear zzso 

Weight or waist circumference loss was associated in a dose response fashion with blood pressure reduction zzso zzso or greater weight loss compared with no weight loss was associated with reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso Those with greater waist circumference loss had a greater reduction in zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso but there was no apparent increase in zzso reduction with increasing weight loss, although these were measured with low zzso There was no apparent effect of either weight or waist circumference loss on serum lipids and zzso zzso in this zzso 

This study shows potentially large beneficial effects of weight or waist circumference loss over several years in a remote living zzso zzso The associations were large enough to be of clinical benefit, despite weight loss being modest for zzso
