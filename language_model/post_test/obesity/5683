A zzso zzso zzso to an zzso plasma membrane protein zzso zzso was used to examine the differential expression of this protein in genetically lean and genetically obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso implied the differential expression of the 64 zzso protein in zzso plasma zzso having different genetic zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso of genetically lean, genetically obese, and contemporary subcutaneous zzso plasma zzso did not indicate any obvious qualitative differences in protein zzso zzso zzso utilizing zzso confirmed the presence of the 64 zzso protein in contemporary and genetically lean zzso plasma zzso but absence in genetically obese zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso intact zzso isolated from contemporary and genetically lean zzso tissue but did not react with isolated genetically obese zzso The ability to bind to intact zzso indicates that the protein is exposed to the zzso zzso The migration pattern of the protein was not affected by zzso zzso by zzso suggesting that the protein is not zzso if at all, zzso zzso of the 64 zzso protein in genetically lean but not genetically obese zzso plasma zzso indicates the identification of a novel zzso surface protein zzso either directly or secondary to the onset of zzso with genetic zzso for either genetically lean or obese body types in zzso
