zzso identified only relatively recently, are regulators of gene expression with potential medical zzso The combination of zzso and zzso medicine is an emerging interdisciplinary medical field that can yield exciting new possibilities for clinical zzso In this paper, we review the prospects of zzso as future therapies in zzso zzso Recently, researchers have demonstrated the crucial roles of zzso not only in the differentiation and proliferation of stem cells, which have a key function in the zzso and transplantation of zzso but also in zzso Several lines of indirect evidence show that the initiation and maintenance of cancer stem cells might also be under the control of zzso Further, zzso have been indicated to be involved in diverse biological zzso suggesting the potential role of these molecules in the treatment of zzso
