zzso of the indications for nocturnal zzso in the diagnosis of zzso sleep zzso syndrome zzso could lead to significant reductions in health zzso To this end, we assessed the usefulness of zzso obesity zzso in the diagnosis of zzso 

One hundred zzso patients zzso men and 40 zzso referred to our clinic with suspected zzso underwent a complete zzso study and their zzso and zzso obesity zzso were zzso 

zzso of patients defined as zzso with zzso patients, by means of the zzso zzso zzso revealed significant differences in the zzso obesity parameters such as zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso and waist circumference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We found no significant differences between zzso values in the two zzso zzso of zzso obesity were analyzed as zzso factors for zzso using a zzso zzso zzso model that included variable sex, and in which zzso ratio, zzso neck zzso and age were analyzed as zzso zzso According to this model, our patients' risk of suffering from zzso was zzso times greater if the zzso ratio zzso in men zzso in zzso The risk of zzso was also increased if the patients were men or over 52 years of zzso 

zzso simple zzso such as those for zzso obesity may help prioritize the use of zzso in patients with a greater risk of zzso Our results suggest that zzso is not a good predictor of zzso in a group of patients with a high zzso
