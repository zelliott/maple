The effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso on zzso fat distribution and plasma insulin and zzso changes in response to long-term zzso were zzso 

Twenty four men zzso zzso age zzso zzso who constituted 12 pairs of identical twins ate a zzso zzso energy surplus, 6 days a week, for a period of 100 zzso Total body fat was assessed by zzso and total subcutaneous fat by the sum of eight zzso zzso fat areas were measured by computerized zzso zzso Plasma zzso and insulin during zzso and in response to an oral zzso tolerance test zzso were zzso The insulin and zzso areas were zzso using the zzso zzso Plasma zzso was measured with an zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso were identified by zzso or Southern zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with a larger gain zzso zzso in weight zzso and total subcutaneous zzso fat than the zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso induced greater increases in the insulin areas under the curve during the zzso and the zzso plasma level of zzso zzso and zzso zzso among zzso than in the zzso zzso The body composition and zzso changes among the zzso zzso zzso zzso subjects zzso were similar to those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso subjects experienced a decrease zzso while zzso zzso subjects zzso registered an increase zzso zzso of zzso zzso area after the zzso caloric zzso The four carriers of the zzso zzso zzso experienced the same magnitude of changes as the 20 zzso for the zzso zzso In general, comparisons based on the 24 subjects considered as unrelated men and the mean values for each of the 12 pairs yielded similar zzso 

The zzso zzso subjects gained more weight and total subcutaneous zzso and also experienced a greater increase in insulin resistance than zzso subjects with exposure to long-term zzso Similar differences were observed between carriers and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso variation at the zzso locus could thus be one of the factors responsible for the large zzso differences observed in the response to long-term zzso in energy balance and should be further zzso
