Brown zzso tissue zzso plays a key role in the zzso zzso mechanisms underlying energy zzso in zzso It is characterized by fat zzso zzso zzso in diameter and expression of zzso protein one, central to the regulation of zzso In the human zzso BAT zzso are typically grouped around the zzso and solid zzso These zzso maintain body temperature during cold exposure by warming the blood before its distribution to the zzso They also ensure an optimal temperature for zzso reactions within solid zzso BAT had been thought to zzso throughout childhood and zzso Recent studies, however, have confirmed the presence of active BAT in adult humans with zzso residing in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso While human zzso stem cells have been differentiated into functional brown zzso in zzso and brown zzso zzso cells have been identified in zzso skeletal muscle and white zzso zzso zzso metabolically active zzso stem cells from a single depot have not been identified in adult humans to zzso Here, we demonstrate a zzso population of metabolically active BAT stem cells residing in adult humans that zzso zzso be expanded in zzso zzso exhibit zzso differentiation zzso and zzso functionally differentiate into metabolically active brown zzso Our study defines a new target stem cell population that can be activated to restore energy zzso in zzso for the treatment of obesity and related zzso zzso
