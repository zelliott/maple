zzso syndrome zzso and zzso D represent two of the most diffuse condition worldwide, reaching pandemic proportions in zzso countries, and are both strongly associated with zzso This study set out to evaluate the presence of an independent association between zzso D and zzso in an adult population of obese subjects zzso zzso 

We recruited 107 consecutive obese subjects, 61 with zzso zzso zzso years, zzso zzso zzso and 46 without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso comparable for sex, zzso waist circumference and body fat mass, evaluated by zzso zzso vitamin D3 levels were measured by zzso zzso zzso resistance was estimated by zzso blood insulin, zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso levels were significantly lower in zzso obese patients than in obese subjects without zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso Low zzso levels correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso model confirmed that low zzso levels were associated with the diagnosis of zzso in obese patients independently from zzso age, serum zzso and body fat zzso After zzso the study population according to zzso zzso patients in the lowest zzso showed a markedly increased prevalence of zzso compared to those in the highest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A powerful association exists between zzso D and zzso in obese patients independently from body fat mass and its clinical zzso This indicates that the association between low zzso D3 levels and zzso is not merely induced by vitamin D deposition in fat tissue and reinforces the hypothesis that zzso D represent a crucial independent zzso of zzso
