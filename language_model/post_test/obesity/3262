zzso therapy zzso growth during childhood and is believed to lead to a zzso body zzso However, despite zzso repeated courses of zzso children with zzso zzso syndrome zzso have almost normal adult zzso Little information exists on body zzso 

We sought to assess the effect of zzso on height and body composition by comparing children with zzso with concurrent healthy reference zzso We hypothesized that chronic zzso therapy leads to zzso decreased lean mass, and distorted zzso of fat and zzso 

We performed a zzso study of 52 subjects with zzso zzso zzso and 259 reference zzso The evaluation included zzso weight, and zzso zzso Fat and lean masses were assessed by zzso X-ray zzso in all zzso Lifetime zzso exposure was recorded for subjects with zzso Outcomes were expressed as zzso scores zzso 

zzso percent of subjects with zzso were obese zzso mass index zzso 95th zzso but regional fat distribution was zzso Mean total lean zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso higher and mean zzso lean zzso was lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso compared with reference zzso The mean zzso in zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso relative to national reference data, but zzso was significantly decreased given the degree of zzso zzso was positively associated with zzso among subjects with zzso 

zzso therapy for zzso is complicated by obesity and relatively low zzso lean zzso zzso zzso is normal because of a zzso effect of elevated zzso on zzso growth zzso
