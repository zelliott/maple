To compare subcutaneous zzso tissue topography zzso in obese juveniles with zzso zzso zzso 

The optical device zzso zzso Patent zzso zzso enables the zzso zzso safe, and precise measurement of the thickness of subcutaneous zzso zzso Fifteen defined body sites (1 zzso neck to 15 zzso zzso characterize the individual zzso like an individual zzso zzso of zzso juveniles zzso 42 boys, 59 girls, normal zzso zzso boys, zzso zzso from 7 to 19 years of age were zzso For visual comparison, the zzso zzso information was condensed by factor analysis into a two-dimensional factor zzso 

Both female and male obese juveniles had markedly increased zzso tissue layers at 7 zzso upper abdomen, 8 zzso lower abdomen, 5 zzso front chest, and 6 zzso lateral zzso The zzso changes of body shape and fat distribution of the zzso boys and girls zzso show thinner zzso tissue layers on their legs, whereas girls had thicker zzso tissue layers at the zzso were not seen in the obese zzso zzso of age and sex, all of the obese juveniles showed a similar, more zzso body fat distribution with increased trunk zzso 

zzso of the obese juveniles is similar to that of patients with type 2 diabetes, zzso zzso syndrome, and coronary heart zzso Patients with these zzso disorders and obese juveniles are located in the factor plot in the same zzso This body shape may indicate a risk profile for developing zzso zzso syndrome zzso type 2 diabetes, and early zzso (both zzso
