We previously observed zzso zzso insulin resistance and obesity in zzso mice zzso Here we determined whether these zzso were eliminated by diet zzso subsequently testing whether zzso was a primary effect of zzso zzso and caused by zzso of pancreatic zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

First, 24 male zzso and zzso zzso mice (2 months old) were given 3 g zzso or 5 g zzso feed per day for 4 months to compare their zzso zzso zzso several zzso experiments were conducted with zzso and zzso of the two zzso (2 or 6 months old) to zzso for beta cell mass, zzso oxygen species zzso levels, zzso membrane potential zzso and expression profiles of regulatory zzso A functional zzso of zzso was also zzso 

Diet restriction eliminated obesity but not zzso in zzso zzso These mice had greater pancreatic beta cell mass (more than zzso and pancreatic insulin content zzso than the zzso along with an enhanced zzso and zzso insulin zzso in zzso With diminished zzso production, the zzso zzso displayed zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso promoter, elevated zzso and decreased zzso 

zzso of the major zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, caused seemingly beneficial changes in pancreatic zzso and zzso but eventually led to chronic zzso by zzso zzso insulin production and zzso
