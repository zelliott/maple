To examine the hypothesis that zzso zzso is associated with a reduced probability of maintaining an optimal health status among those who survive to older zzso 

Prospective cohort zzso 

The zzso Health zzso United zzso 

zzso women who survived until at least the age of 70, provided information on occurrence of chronic disease, cognitive function, physical function, and mental health at older ages, and were free from major chronic diseases at zzso zzso age was 50 at baseline in zzso 

Healthy survival to age 70 and over was defined as having no history of 11 major chronic diseases and having no substantial zzso physical, or mental zzso 

Of the women who survived until at least age 70, zzso zzso met our criteria for healthy zzso Increased body mass index zzso at baseline was significantly associated with zzso reduced odds of healthy survival compared with usual survival, after adjustment for various lifestyle and dietary variables zzso for zzso Compared with lean women zzso zzso obese women zzso had zzso lower odds of healthy survival zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso In addition, the more weight gained from age 18 until zzso the less likely was healthy survival after the age of zzso The lowest odds of healthy survival were among women who were overweight zzso at age 18 and zzso zzso weight zzso zzso to zzso relative to women who were lean zzso zzso and maintained a stable zzso 

These data provide evidence that zzso in zzso is strongly related to a reduced probability of healthy survival among women who live to older ages, and zzso the importance of maintaining a healthy weight from early zzso
