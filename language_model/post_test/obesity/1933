To identify risk factors in 60 cases of zzso amongst zzso patients zzso subjected to isolated coronary bypass surgery from March 1988 through December 1995, treated by a closed zzso zzso 

The mean age of the 60 patients was zzso zzso zzso years zzso zzso and 55 zzso were zzso Early zzso zzso was performed in all cases immediately after the diagnosis of zzso with zzso of zzso zzso followed by zzso of a zzso irrigation system of the zzso constituted by irrigation zzso and zzso closure of the zzso and skin, and specific systemic zzso zzso The mean zzso between the original surgery and zzso was zzso days zzso zzso zzso No patient required more extensive procedures, namely zzso or muscular zzso Twenty potential risk factors in patients with zzso including diabetes zzso zzso coexistence of peripheral vascular disease, decreased zzso function, use of zzso zzso blood drainage and zzso of double zzso were compared with the group without zzso 

Mean zzso bypass time was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso time zzso zzso zzso h and zzso mechanical ventilation 18 zzso 3 zzso A total of 23 patients zzso received one zzso and 35 zzso two zzso In the zzso period, 7 of the 60 patients zzso had required zzso because of low zzso zzso blood loss was zzso zzso zzso and 9 patients zzso were zzso zzso were positive in 40 cases zzso and the most frequent infecting agent was the zzso zzso in 25 cases zzso followed by zzso zzso and zzso and zzso species zzso zzso 1 patient zzso died and 9 zzso had zzso zzso The zzso was maintained for a mean of zzso days zzso zzso Patients with zzso had a significantly higher prevalence of diabetes zzso zzso zzso P zzso obesity zzso zzso zzso P zzso peripheral vascular disease zzso zzso zzso P zzso but a lower zzso of poor zzso function zzso zzso zzso P zzso A double zzso was used more frequently in patients who had zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso 

Diabetes zzso zzso zzso of peripheral vascular disease and use of double zzso are risk factors for zzso after coronary artery zzso The efficacy of the closed method of treatment with a zzso zzso system was increased with early diagnosis and zzso
