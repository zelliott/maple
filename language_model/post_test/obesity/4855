Although obesity is an established risk factor for coronary heart disease and stroke zzso its role as a risk factor for other causes of death has not been extensively investigated, particularly in an industrial zzso 

This prospective mortality study included 20 years of follow up of middle-aged industrial workers zzso zzso zzso at Shell Oil Company's manufacturing and research zzso zzso health risk factor data as of December 31, 1983, and mortality data as of December 31, 2003, were extracted from the company's Health Surveillance zzso Relative risks zzso for selected causes of death by body mass index zzso category were calculated using the Cox zzso hazards model adjusted for age, sex, and smoking status as well as other potential risk factors, zzso cholesterol, hypertension, and zzso blood zzso 

Compared with employees with zzso between zzso and zzso zzso those with zzso of 30 zzso or greater had a statistically increased zzso zzso for age, sex, and smoking zzso for all causes zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso coronary heart diseases zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cardiovascular diseases zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and accidental deaths zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After adjusting for additional zzso coronary heart diseases and cardiovascular diseases remained statistically zzso 

zzso was associated with increased death rates for all causes, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and all zzso zzso individuals had a statistically lower cancer zzso Death rates for lung cancer and respiratory disease were lower among zzso employees but did not reach statistical zzso zzso of employee obesity can be an effective means of reducing these causes of zzso
