The effect of progressive, zzso zzso on zzso tract structure and function was examined in zzso to zzso zzso control zzso and diabetic zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were analyzed by transmission electron zzso for zzso changes associated with increased zzso zzso zzso In addition, the same zzso were analyzed for changes in activity of tissue zzso zzso an zzso that zzso zzso zzso and supports the cellular zzso and storage of free fatty zzso Between 8 and 16 weeks of age, zzso zzso deposits increased dramatically in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso as well as in the zzso zzso of diabetic mice compared to zzso By 16 weeks of age, the zzso deposits essentially occupied the entire zzso area of both the zzso and zzso cell types in zzso The zzso zzso underlying the zzso zzso was expanded in the diabetics relative to controls, and the zzso condition induced an zzso increase in zzso zzso space that was occupied by a zzso type of ground substance of unknown composition and zzso In association with these structural changes, both zzso and zzso zzso activities were greatly increased in the zzso mice compared with zzso These data suggest that the structural zzso and functional decline in zzso tract condition of the zzso zzso are related to the enhanced cellular zzso deposition observed in this zzso These changes in structural and zzso parameters are related to the zzso incompetence characteristic of this zzso zzso
