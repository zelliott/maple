zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells is zzso of zzso patient prognosis in many zzso zzso However, it is not known whether the zzso originates from zzso or zzso cells, or whether increased expression of zzso zzso proteins zzso contributes to zzso zzso In this study, zzso and expression of zzso were evaluated zzso in zzso cases of human breast cancer, and correlated with zzso factors and patient zzso Both zzso cells and zzso cells were zzso In zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso correlated with each other, and zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso high zzso rate, and short overall zzso In zzso cells, the zzso levels of all HAS zzso correlated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso high zzso rate, and short overall survival of the zzso In addition, expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso were related to zzso large tumor size, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso and zzso were independent zzso factors in the zzso zzso The data suggest that increased levels of HAS zzso contribute to the zzso of zzso in breast cancer, and that zzso is zzso in zzso cells and zzso zzso The study also indicates that HAS zzso levels are related to tumor aggressiveness and poor patient outcome representing potential targets for zzso
