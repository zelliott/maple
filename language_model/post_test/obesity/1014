The commonly used zzso equations to calculate resting energy expenditure zzso can yield inaccurate zzso 

To compare measured zzso with estimated zzso in normal and obese zzso To develop specific zzso equations for our zzso 

Eight hundred zzso women aged 18 to 74 years old with a body mass index zzso between zzso and zzso zzso and zzso men aged 18 to 71 years old with a zzso between 185 and zzso zzso were zzso zzso was measured by indirect zzso and fat free mass by zzso zzso zzso was also estimated using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Measured zzso in controls was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in women and men zzso The figures for overweight women and men were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso for obese women and men were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and for zzso obese women and men, were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso was corrected for fat free mass, no differences between controls and different degrees of zzso were zzso The difference between estimated and measured zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso in women and from zzso to 900 zzso in zzso The equations derived using data obtained in the present study, showed a better zzso zzso 

An important error was detected when zzso was predicted using zzso or Harris Benedict zzso in Chilean obese zzso Therefore these equations must be used with caution, local equations must be devised or resting energy expenditure must be measured by indirect zzso
