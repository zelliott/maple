zzso droplets zzso are zzso that coordinate zzso storage and zzso both processes being especially important in cells specialized in managing fat, the zzso zzso analyses of zzso have consistently identified the small zzso zzso as a component of the zzso zzso However, the specific contribution of zzso to zzso function remains to be zzso zzso we have analyzed zzso zzso zzso zzso and function in relation to the zzso status of zzso We show that zzso production increases during zzso differentiation of zzso zzso In addition, our data show that insulin zzso via zzso zzso zzso the recruitment of zzso to the surface of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso impaired the zzso response to insulin, thereby suggesting that this zzso promotes fat zzso in zzso On the other hand, studies of the zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed and extended previous evidence for the participation of zzso in zzso Together, our data support the view that zzso is a common zzso of zzso and zzso and suggests that the zzso zzso zzso is the link that enables zzso action on these two zzso Finally, we describe, for the first time, the presence of zzso in human zzso zzso wherein the expression of this zzso exhibits zzso and zzso differences and is correlated to zzso Taken together, these findings indicate that zzso is involved in zzso zzso as well as in zzso zzso likely zzso interaction of zzso with zzso zzso and the exchange of lipids between these zzso A role for zzso in the regulation of zzso biology under both normal and pathological conditions is zzso
