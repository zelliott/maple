To study the effect of zzso zzso acid on gene expression of fatty acid binding proteins zzso in white obesity tissue of rats with insulin resistance, and explore the mechanism of resisting diabetes by zzso 

Male zzso rats were randomly separated to control group, high-fat group and high fat + zzso group zzso zzso zzso by diet zzso Using reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso technique to measure the expression level of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso serum insulin and zzso levels of rats with insulin resistance were higher than that of rats fed with basic diet, supplement of zzso can decrease zzso serum insulin and zzso levels of rats with insulin resistance, and zzso can increase the expression of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso tissue of rat with insulin zzso 

zzso can improve insulin resistance of obese rat and increase the expression of zzso zzso acting through zzso zzso
