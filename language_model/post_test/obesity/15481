Training in zzso zzso is known to improve the accuracy of dietary zzso in adults, but there is no comparable evidence for zzso To obtain this information, we studied 110 second- and zzso American Indian schoolchildren zzso control subjects were not zzso testing the hypotheses that a zzso zzso zzso training session would reduce children's food quantity zzso error, and that the improvement would be dependent on food type, measurement type, or zzso Training was a hands-on, zzso zzso and measurement zzso zzso Mixed linear models zzso zzso zzso were used to evaluate zzso and zzso differences from zzso to zzso Test scores were calculated as percentage zzso errors by difference and absolute value zzso Mean zzso zzso error decreased significantly zzso from zzso to zzso for 7 of 12 foods zzso zzso by both calculation methods, plus 3 additional foods by the difference method and one additional food by the absolute value zzso zzso zzso zzso differences occurred for 3 foods, reflecting a greater decrease in zzso error for the trained zzso Improvement was greatest for solid foods estimated by dimensions zzso or in cups zzso for liquids estimated by volume or by label reading zzso and for one zzso food estimated in cups zzso Despite these significant improvements in zzso ability, the error for several foods zzso of the true zzso indicating that more than one training session would be necessary to further increase dietary reporting zzso
