A low resting zzso rate for a given body size and zzso a low rate of fat zzso low levels of physical activity, and low plasma zzso zzso are all risk factors for body weight zzso The aim of the present investigation was to compare resting zzso rate zzso respiratory zzso zzso levels of physical activity, and plasma zzso zzso in eight zzso adults (2 males and 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso years; body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso body fat 33 zzso zzso mean zzso zzso who lost zzso zzso zzso zzso (16 to 79 zzso and had maintained this weight loss zzso or zzso months (2 to 9 zzso to eight zzso and zzso control zzso subjects (1 male and 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso years; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso body fat 33 zzso zzso 

Following 3 days of weight maintenance diet zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured after a 10-hour fast using indirect zzso and plasma zzso zzso were measured using zzso zzso of physical activity were estimated using an zzso over a zzso period in free living zzso 

After adjustment for fat mass and zzso mass, zzso subjects had, compared with controls, similar levels of physical activity zzso zzso 205 zzso zzso zzso 204 zzso and similar zzso zzso zzso 268 zzso zzso zzso 104 zzso but higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso concentration correlated positively with percent body fat zzso zzso zzso p zzso and, after adjusting for fat mass and zzso mass, was lower in zzso than in control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso 

The low fat zzso and low plasma zzso zzso observed in zzso individuals may, in part, explain their propensity to zzso
