zzso is a major health concern worldwide which is associated with increased risk of chronic diseases such as zzso syndrome, cardiovascular disease and zzso The zzso of the molecular mechanisms involved in zzso and zzso is of essential importance as it could lead to the identification of novel zzso and therapeutic targets for the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso have been shown to play regulatory roles in several biological zzso They have become a growing research field and consist of promising pharmaceutical targets in various fields such as cancer, zzso zzso The present study investigated the possible implication of zzso in zzso tissue during the development of obesity using as a model the zzso mice fed a high-fat zzso wild type male mice were fed either a standard zzso or a high-fat diet zzso for 5 zzso Total zzso was prepared from white zzso tissue and was used for zzso profiling and zzso of the most zzso expressed zzso as identified by the zzso profiling were validated using zzso The results of the present study confirmed previous zzso The zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso after zzso feeding has also been previously zzso On the other hand, we show for the first time the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso during the development of zzso However, future studies are warranted in order to understand the exact role that zzso play in zzso and zzso
