Mean zzso binding to circulating zzso was low zzso less than zzso compared to normal zzso in nine obese patients on a zzso diet in which zzso of the calories were zzso On a zzso zzso diet, insulin binding was normal in six of seven obese zzso Plasma insulin zzso were elevated in obese patients on both zzso No correlation was found between insulin binding and plasma insulin zzso zzso intolerance and zzso were worsened by keeping the patients at rest and were improved by having the patients walk zzso zzso The change in physical activity had no effect on zzso binding to zzso We conclude that 1) insulin binding to zzso in obese patients is generally low in patients on a zzso diet, but is normal in patients on zzso zzso 2) zzso of insulin receptors does not necessarily occur in the presence of zzso and 3) a walking program results in an improvement in zzso tolerance and zzso that is not associated with a change in insulin zzso
