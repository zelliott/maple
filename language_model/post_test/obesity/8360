Type 2 diabetes is an individual health challenge requiring ongoing zzso zzso patient reporting of relevant health parameters and linked automated feedback via mobile telephone have potential to strengthen zzso and improve zzso This research involved development and evaluation of a mobile zzso remote patient reporting and automated telephone feedback system, guided by health behavior change theory, aimed at improving zzso and health status in individuals with type 2 zzso 

This research comprised a zzso controlled zzso zzso criteria were diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, elevated zzso zzso zzso levels zzso zzso or use of oral diabetes medication, and zzso years of zzso zzso subjects zzso participated in remote patient reporting of health status parameters and linked health behavior change zzso Control participants zzso received standard of care including diabetes education and zzso provider zzso Patients were followed for approximately 10 zzso 

zzso participants zzso compared with controls and controlling for zzso a significantly greater mean reduction in zzso of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and significantly greater weight reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso trends for greater intervention compared with control improvement in zzso and zzso blood pressure were zzso 

zzso information technology platforms for remote patient reporting linked with zzso health behavior change automated feedback have potential to improve patient outcomes in type 2 diabetes and merit zzso research zzso
