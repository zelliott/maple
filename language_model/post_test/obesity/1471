Both weight gain and weight loss have been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality in recent studies from the zzso This finding has led to concern and uncertainty about appropriate advice for overweight and obese zzso 

In a prospective study of cardiovascular disease, the relationship between weight change over a zzso period and subsequent risk of a heart attack during a further zzso year follow-up was examined in zzso middle-aged British zzso 

Over half of the men remained stable zzso change in zzso and served as the reference zzso zzso gained weight and zzso lost zzso The zzso men free from a history of coronary heart disease experienced zzso heart attacks, fatal and zzso during the zzso zzso Men who gained zzso zzso had the lowest rate of heart attack, although this was not significantly different from the stable zzso The men who lost weight had an increased risk of heart attack, which after adjustment (for age, recall of zzso hypertension and diabetes and other coronary risk factors zzso serum total cholesterol, blood pressure, social class, initial body mass index zzso and lung function zzso and smoking status at screening and 5 years zzso was of a similar level of risk to the stable zzso The men who zzso zzso zzso had a significantly increased risk of a heart attack after the above adjustment zzso zzso When the effect of weight change was examined according to initial zzso those men with a zzso zzso zzso who lost weight had a marginally increased relative risk of heart attack after full adjustment zzso zzso zzso while men who were overweight zzso zzso zzso or obese zzso or zzso 28 zzso showed no benefit from weight zzso A small amount of weight gain zzso in the overweight or obese men was associated with decreased risk, whereas considerable weight gain zzso zzso was associated with increased risk, both findings reaching statistical significance in the overweight men zzso zzso and P zzso zzso 

zzso weight gain zzso zzso in middle-aged men is associated with increased risk of a heart attack, but weight loss does not appear to reduce risk even in the overweight or zzso
