To determine whether early zzso of the zzso zzso axis is zzso in zzso obese zzso 

Thirty-five simple obese zzso stage zzso boys with body mass index over 25 aged 8-11 years old and 25 zzso zzso healthy zzso boys zzso were clinically examined and zzso size measured by zzso zzso zzso B, testosterone, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and bone age were zzso zzso tests were performed in the obese children and the relationships between zzso B and bone age, zzso volume, zzso zzso and zzso peak zzso zzso and testosterone were zzso 

The majority of zzso zzso and testosterone levels were zzso in both groups of zzso children and no difference was apparent between the zzso However, zzso volume zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso right zzso zzso vs zzso zzso bone age, zzso and zzso levels were significantly higher in obese zzso zzso B was zzso in all zzso zzso levels were significantly higher in obese children zzso zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso and correlated with zzso volume zzso zzso zzso zzso right: zzso zzso zzso P zzso and bone age zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso levels did not correlate with zzso zzso However, after zzso zzso a clear negative correlation between peak zzso and zzso zzso B was apparent zzso zzso zzso P zzso consistent with early zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso axis is apparent in obese zzso stage zzso boys and appears to represent an early hormonal change of zzso in these zzso
