As obesity reaches epidemic proportions, zzso fatty liver disease zzso is becoming a frequent cause of patient referral to zzso There is a close link between dysfunctional zzso tissue in zzso and common conditions such as zzso syndrome, type 2 diabetes zzso and cardiovascular zzso This review focuses on the zzso of interactions between zzso tissue and target zzso in obesity and the resulting clinical implications for the management of zzso zzso The release of fatty acids from dysfunctional and zzso zzso results in zzso caused by the zzso of zzso toxic zzso in zzso zzso zzso muscle, pancreatic beta zzso and subsequent zzso of inflammatory zzso cellular dysfunction, and zzso The cross talk between dysfunctional zzso and the liver involves multiple cell zzso including zzso and other immune cells, that in concert promote the development of zzso liver disease, a term that more accurately describes the zzso of zzso zzso At the clinical level, zzso tissue insulin resistance contributes to type 2 diabetes zzso and cardiovascular zzso zzso that rescue the liver from zzso by restoring zzso tissue insulin sensitivity zzso significant weight loss, exercise, zzso or preventing zzso of inflammatory pathways and zzso stress zzso vitamin zzso zzso hold promise in the treatment of zzso although their long-term safety and efficacy remain to be zzso Better understanding of pathways that link zzso zzso zzso zzso dysfunction, and liver zzso will result in improvements in the clinical management of these challenging zzso
