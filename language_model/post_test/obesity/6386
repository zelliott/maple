zzso acid has been reported to increase zzso disposal in diabetic zzso This study has examined the effect of zzso acid on zzso zzso by cultured zzso muscle cells and different types of skeletal muscles in normal lean zzso and severely zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was measured in zzso muscle cells using the zzso zzso analogue zzso zzso and in isolated muscles by zzso disappearance from the incubation zzso 

In zzso muscle cells, short-term zzso zzso zzso with zzso m zzso acid increased zzso zzso by zzso approximately the same extent as zzso m zzso Combination of the two agents produced a slightly greater increase zzso at 12 zzso than either zzso Red zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso zzso proportions of type 1 and 2 zzso and abdominal muscle zzso type 2 zzso from normal mice incubated with zzso m zzso acid showed increased zzso zzso to a similar extent as zzso m insulin in each of the three zzso Muscles from zzso mice, which showed little response to insulin, showed a substantial increase zzso zzso p zzso in zzso zzso when zzso m zzso acid was added in the presence of zzso The zzso acid also increased zzso zzso in red zzso zzso zzso p zzso from zzso mice without added zzso 

The results suggest that zzso acid can increase zzso zzso by a range of normal muscle types and improve the response to insulin by zzso skeletal muscles of zzso zzso
