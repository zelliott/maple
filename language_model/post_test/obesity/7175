Although stair use in zzso can provide an accessible means of zzso physical activity into work zzso there is little information available on how building design influences stair zzso 

This zzso study assessed the relationship between stair use and the design and location of zzso 

Ten three- or four-story academic buildings on two university zzso 

The buildings contained a total of 38 stairs and 12 zzso 

zzso use was measured using infrared zzso zzso environmental variables that zzso the appeal, zzso zzso zzso and safety of stairs were zzso 

zzso analysis identified eight spatial variables associated with stair zzso travel distances from stair to nearest entrance and the elevator, effective area or occupant load of each zzso accessibility of each zzso area of stair zzso (a graphic representation of the horizontal extent of a person's visual field from a specific point of reference within a building floor zzso number of turns required for travel from the stair to closest entrance, and the most integrated path zzso Three variables zzso area, area of stair zzso and number of turns for travel from the zzso explained 53 % of stair use in the 10 zzso Most variables zzso the appeal, zzso and safety of stairs were not statistically zzso 

This study suggests that the spatial qualities that zzso the convenience and zzso of stairs may have the most influence on stair use in zzso
