Extra fat mass is usually accompanied by zzso as well as clinical zzso including systemic inflammation and high blood zzso This study aimed to evaluate the associations among zzso zzso blood levels of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso profile, blood zzso insulin resistance, and blood pressure and determine the actual zzso of zzso and blood pressure in zzso zzso women in zzso 

A total of 200 women with body mass index zzso of zzso were enrolled in a zzso zzso zzso intake and zzso as well as laboratory evaluations, including zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso profile, serum insulin, and zzso were performed for all the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso correlation zzso and zzso linear zzso analysis were used to establish a model to predict zzso and zzso blood pressure zzso zzso 

Although serum zzso directly correlated with levels of zzso zzso zzso total cholesterol, zzso and waist circumference zzso its strongest association was found with percent of body fat mass zzso zzso zzso Also, zzso directly correlated with zzso zzso and zzso but it was more strongly correlated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso No association was found between blood or zzso variables and dietary zzso In different zzso models, zzso and zzso were the zzso of zzso but zzso was the significant predictor of zzso 

zzso in Iranian middle-aged women can affect both inflammatory zzso and zzso thus zzso for zzso syndrome and further zzso We identified zzso and zzso as the zzso of serum zzso levels and zzso as the predictor of zzso in our zzso
