The influence of prolonged energy restriction zzso zzso for 4 weeks) on zzso zzso action was investigated in abdominal zzso of obese zzso An attempt was made to discriminate between dietary influences per zzso and indirect influences caused by changes in the concentration or action of zzso zzso energy restriction resulted in about a zzso increase in zzso zzso rate which was associated with a corresponding increase in zzso response to zzso Both these effects could be zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso which increased zzso release of zzso from fed donors to levels normally seen during zzso suggesting that the improvement of zzso responsiveness to insulin during energy restriction was an apparent one only, due to the fact that zzso release was zzso To identify dietary influences that selectively affect insulin action the effects of insulin were compared with those of other zzso agents in the presence of zzso zzso zzso effective zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso almost completely suppressed zzso release before and during zzso The extent of zzso produced by these latter compounds was therefore related to zzso activity by the same linear relationship in all experimental zzso By contrast insulin only partially depressed zzso release and the relationships between zzso activity and response to zzso zzso of insulin were significantly different before and during zzso zzso less than or equal to zzso in the presence of zzso zzso indicating that zzso selectively influences insulin action via mechanisms that are unrelated to the effects of other zzso zzso It is concluded that the main effect of energy restriction on zzso zzso action is an apparent one which is secondary increased zzso zzso zzso dietary effects on insulin action became apparent upon removal of zzso zzso These tend to limit the zzso response to insulin and may be due to changes at the zzso level but could also reflect an intrinsic property of zzso zzso zzso
