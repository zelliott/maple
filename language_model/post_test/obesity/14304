Body mass index zzso has been shown to be highly zzso but most studies were carried out in zzso born before the onset of the zzso zzso 

We aimed to zzso genetic and environmental influences on zzso and central zzso in children growing up during a time of dramatic rises in pediatric zzso 

We carried out twin analyses of zzso and waist circumference zzso in a UK sample of zzso twin pairs aged 8-11 zzso zzso genetic zzso was used for the zzso zzso and zzso quantitative genetic zzso was used for the analysis of zzso between zzso and zzso 

zzso genetic zzso confirmed substantial zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso genetic analyses showed that, although the genetic influence on zzso was largely common to zzso zzso there was also a significant independent genetic effect zzso For both zzso and zzso there was a very modest zzso effect, and the remaining environmental zzso was zzso 

zzso influences on zzso and abdominal zzso are high in children born since the onset of the pediatric obesity zzso Most of the genetic effect on abdominal zzso is common to zzso but zzso is attributable to independent genetic zzso Environmental effects are small and are divided approximately equally between shared and zzso zzso zzso the family may be vital for obesity prevention in the earliest years, but longer-term weight control will require a combination of individual engagement and zzso efforts to modify the environment, especially for children at high genetic zzso
