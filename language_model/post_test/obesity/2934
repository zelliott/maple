Although many factors may influence the choice of the operative zzso zzso safety in terms of the degree of zzso zzso should be zzso No data currently exist to delineate in markedly obese patients the effect of the operative incision on the extent or duration of this zzso zzso consecutive patients of both zzso scheduled for zzso zzso bypass for zzso zzso zzso were zzso In 23 patients the operation was performed through a zzso incision and in 25 patients through a vertical zzso In 6 patients, zzso was also performed in addition to the zzso zzso zzso there was a significant fall in zzso both in the zzso and vertical incision groups and this continued through day zzso On day 5 statistically significant zzso was present only in the vertical incision zzso In addition, the decrease in zzso was significantly greater on days 4 and 5 in the vertical group than in the zzso zzso On days 2 and 3 again the mean decrease in zzso was greater in the vertical group but this was not statistically zzso The effect of added zzso on zzso was studied in 6 women with zzso zzso The results were compared with 6 subjects who had small zzso bypass without zzso and who were matched for zzso age weight, zzso ratio, zzso ratio, smoking zzso and percentage of predicted zzso In both groups there was a significant fall of zzso from day 1 through day 4, but there was no significant difference between the two zzso Although the numbers studied were small, these limited results would suggest that the type of zzso rather than the zzso procedure is the important factor in determining zzso zzso zzso These studies also suggest that in patients with an increased potential for zzso zzso zzso markedly zzso the zzso abdominal approach zzso always be seriously zzso
