To investigate whether levels of zzso hormone zzso within the normal range are associated with an increased risk of new vascular events and mortality in patients with clinical manifest vascular diseases and whether this relation is influenced by zzso 

Prospective cohort study in zzso patients zzso men and zzso zzso with clinical manifest vascular disease and zzso levels in the normal zzso Median follow up was zzso zzso range zzso zzso Clinical zzso of interest were: zzso zzso stroke, vascular death, and zzso zzso In patients with manifest vascular disease, the prevalence of zzso zzso was zzso while zzso had zzso zzso An increase in 1 unit of zzso was associated with a zzso higher risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the occurrence of zzso zzso adjusted for age, zzso zzso function, and zzso In patients with a body mass index zzso below the median of zzso the zzso per unit zzso for zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients with a zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue thickness below the median zzso was associated with higher zzso per unit zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to visceral zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no relation between zzso and risk of stroke, vascular death, the combined zzso or zzso zzso 

Higher zzso levels within the normal range are associated with an increased risk of zzso zzso in patients with clinical manifest vascular zzso This relation is most prominent in patients without visceral zzso
