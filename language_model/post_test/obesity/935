Certain zzso strains cause obesity in several strains of zzso The potential association between obesity and altered zzso tolerance was assessed by monitoring body weight and zzso tolerance throughout the incubation period in zzso zzso strain combinations that do and do not produce zzso Virtually all obese mice showed reduced zzso tolerance as shown by significantly higher blood zzso levels 2 h after a zzso zzso Mice injected with a zzso strain that did not cause obesity showed normal zzso The zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of obese mice clinically affected with zzso was very zzso zzso prevented both the increase in weight and zzso zzso tolerance but had no other effect on the course of the zzso Following increasing dilution of the zzso the increase in body weight and the development of zzso zzso tolerance reached an zzso that was similar to that of zzso zzso The system described provides an zzso model of obesity with altered zzso zzso
