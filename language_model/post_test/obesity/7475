To determine whether obesity and premature zzso are additive events increasing the risk of insulin resistance and zzso failure, using early insulin response zzso or the zzso index and zzso zzso as zzso 

This was a prospective zzso study conducted at a zzso care academic medical center involving 81 zzso predominantly Hispanic children zzso zzso 47 zzso classified as lean controls (4 zzso 6 zzso mean age, zzso zzso zzso years; mean body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso obese controls (20 zzso 10 zzso mean age, zzso zzso zzso years; mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lean premature zzso (3 zzso 11 zzso mean age, zzso zzso zzso years; mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and obese premature zzso (7 zzso 20 zzso mean age, zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso levels, zzso growth factor 1, zzso growth factor binding protein 1, and zzso levels were zzso An oral zzso tolerance test was zzso zzso was calculated as zzso - zzso - zzso zzso differences were assessed by zzso analysis of zzso with interactions and associations explored with zzso 

zzso was greater in the obese subjects with and without premature zzso Combined analysis of the independent variables obesity and premature zzso showed that the obese premature zzso group had the highest zzso The obese subjects with premature zzso had greater zzso zzso levels than their lean zzso The differences in zzso zzso ratio among the groups were not statistically zzso 

Using zzso and zzso as markers to assess the risk of insulin resistance and impaired insulin zzso indicates that obese children with premature zzso may be at greater risk for the development of zzso and type 2 diabetes zzso compared with their lean zzso
