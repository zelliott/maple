zzso zzso zzso represents a marker of zzso zzso This study was addressed to investigate the associations of zzso plasma levels with zzso zzso insulin resistance, and related zzso and zzso zzso 

50 zzso women, 17 with normal weight and 33 overweight and obese, aged zzso years, were zzso zzso included body mass index zzso central fat zzso zzso by waist zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure levels, zzso plasma zzso of zzso zzso lipids zzso total cholesterol and zzso insulin, and zzso factors zzso zzso zzso von zzso factor, zzso and insulin resistance zzso by the zzso model zzso zzso zzso and obese women had higher zzso plasma zzso zzso compared to zzso controls zzso zzso zzso were positively correlated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure, zzso insulin, zzso and zzso plasma levels zzso for all the zzso When a multiple zzso analysis was performed, with zzso as dependent variable and all the other parameters as independent zzso zzso did not maintain a significant relationship with any of these zzso 

zzso plasma zzso are higher in overweight and obese insulin resistant subjects, thus possibly contributing to the cardiovascular risk of these zzso However, body zzso and insulin resistance are not independent zzso of zzso plasma zzso zzso
