Alcohol intake can have zzso or zzso effects in patients with type 2 diabetes zzso The present study was designed to investigate the zzso control of male patients with diabetes zzso from the aspect of the genetic status of alcohol zzso 

One hundred zzso men with type 2 diabetes zzso were enrolled in the present zzso They were all zzso at the Diabetes Center of zzso Central zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso 2 zzso gene of each patient was determined by zzso chain zzso zzso length zzso zzso and the patients were divided into those with active or inactive zzso zzso We compared the amount of habitual alcohol intake and clinical data that included physical findings and blood chemistry of the patients in the active and inactive zzso zzso The zzso control of each patient was evaluated by the serum level of zzso 

Of the zzso patients with type 2 diabetes zzso 90 patients had the active zzso zzso and 73 patients had the inactive zzso zzso The mean zzso level of the active zzso group was nearly the same as that of the inactive zzso zzso However, the zzso level of the zzso drinkers zzso zzso in the inactive zzso group was highest and was significantly higher than the zzso level of the zzso drinkers of the active zzso zzso The zzso of the patients with diabetic complications was higher than the zzso of those without diabetic complications in both the active and inactive zzso zzso However, the zzso level of the zzso drinkers without diabetic complications in the inactive zzso group was significantly higher and the zzso of 24 zzso urinary zzso was higher than the respective level of the zzso drinkers without diabetic complications in the active zzso zzso 

zzso zzso alcohol intake worsens zzso control in diabetic patients who have the inactive zzso zzso The data on 24 zzso urinary zzso level suggested that increased zzso after zzso drinking by inactive zzso diabetic patients may increase the zzso value by the zzso condition that resulted in zzso
