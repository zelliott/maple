To determine whether zzso plasma zzso zzso levels in overweight, middle-aged black women are different from those of white women of similar zzso and age and ascertain whether there is a difference between the two groups in plasma zzso levels in response to a liquid high fat zzso 

Using a commercial zzso zzso the concentration of zzso was measured at baseline and at 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours after ingesting a fatty liquid meal zzso of the calories from zzso in 12 black and 12 white women who were matched for age and zzso 

zzso levels zzso per zzso at baseline and at every other zzso of the test meal were significantly lower in the black than in the white zzso In addition, the change in zzso concentration from baseline was lower in the black than in the white group only at 8 hours after the zzso 

The lower baseline level and the blunted zzso response of the black women to the fat load indicated that this signal for appetite suppression was reduced, which, in turn, might contribute to the enhanced obesity of the black zzso
