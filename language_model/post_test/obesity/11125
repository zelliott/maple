Studies conducted in mice have revealed positive effects of zzso acid zzso The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of zzso on fat zzso and zzso control in rats fed an zzso zzso zzso were randomly divided into two groups: control group and zzso group zzso supplemented with zzso zzso No changes were observed in zzso tissue zzso The zzso tolerance test showed that the zzso value in the zzso group had decreased significantly at the final time zzso zzso zzso as had zzso levels zzso However, zzso model assessment zzso showed that insulin resistance did not zzso No changes were observed in the liver, skeletal muscle zzso or zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso Low levels zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in both zzso and higher levels of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso in liver, zzso zzso zzso in zzso were zzso zzso supplementation induced zzso zzso due to the zzso effect on zzso In conclusion, dietary supplementation of zzso zzso did not lead to decreased fat zzso in zzso zzso liver, or skeletal muscle, or to improved zzso zzso The zzso induced in liver is a negative effect that should be considered before proposing zzso as a functional zzso
