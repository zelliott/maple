To study the association of gene zzso at cholesterol zzso transfer protein zzso locus with obesity and response to dietary intervention in zzso 

The zzso method was used to detect the zzso of zzso gene of 340 adults in zzso The levels of serum zzso profile, including zzso zzso HDL and LDL were zzso zzso was selected to dietary zzso 

zzso zzso zzso of zzso B1 zzso B1 B2 and B2 B2 were zzso zzso and zzso respectively, which were in agreement with zzso zzso There was no significant difference in the distribution of zzso between the obesity group and control zzso The result was same after several influence factors zzso zzso The levels of HDL were significantly different among zzso zzso zzso for the B2 B2 zzso had the highest HDL zzso The relationship was steady after adjusting several influence zzso zzso for the B1 B2 zzso had higher HDL level after intervention, which was significantly different to other zzso zzso After adjusting baseline HDL level and zzso zzso didn't effect the change in zzso 

zzso gene zzso influenced serum HDL zzso But this gene zzso at zzso locus wasn't zzso in adult zzso zzso HDL level influenced the change in HDL response to dietary intervention in three zzso zzso
