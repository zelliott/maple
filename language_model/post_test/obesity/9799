zzso sleep zzso zzso and zzso syndrome, both closely related to zzso often coexist in affected zzso however, body mass index is not an accurate indicator of body fat and thus is not a good predictor of zzso and other zzso The aim of this study was to investigate whether the occurrence of zzso could be associated with an altered body fat distribution and a more evident zzso zzso risk independently from obesity and zzso zzso 

zzso consecutive patients zzso men and 113 zzso were included in the study and underwent overnight zzso zzso data, blood pressure, zzso profile, zzso parameters were zzso Body composition by zzso two-dimensional zzso and carotid zzso thickness measurement were zzso 67 patients zzso had no zzso and 104 zzso had zzso The percentage of patients with zzso syndrome was significantly higher among zzso patients zzso that were older, heavier and showed a bigger and zzso heart compared to the control zzso Upper body fat deposition index , the ratio between upper body fat zzso arms and trunk fat in zzso and lower body fat zzso fat in zzso was significantly increased in the zzso patients and significantly related to zzso fat zzso In patients with zzso syndrome, zzso zzso analyses showed that upper body fat deposition index and zzso fat showed the best association with zzso 

The occurrence of zzso in obese people is more closely related to cardiac zzso and to abnormal fat distribution rather than to the absolute amount of zzso zzso In patients with zzso syndrome the severity of zzso is associated with increase in left zzso mass and carotid zzso zzso
