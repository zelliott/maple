Both elevated plasma free fatty acids zzso and accumulating zzso in zzso tissue are observed in the process of obesity and insulin zzso This contradictory phenomenon and its underlying mechanisms have not been thoroughly zzso Recent studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso factor zzso contributes to elevated plasma zzso and insulin resistance in obese mice via the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso However, we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso protein expression despite of enhancing zzso Plasma zzso and zzso were increased in associated with a progressive zzso and those outcomes were also accompanied by fat zzso and a reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso injection zzso zzso zzso protein expression and elevated plasma zzso while zzso zzso zzso significantly rescued the zzso zzso reduction and also reduced plasma zzso in obese zzso zzso reduced zzso protein expression in a zzso and zzso manner in differentiated zzso zzso Small interfering zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in a decreased zzso of zzso and regulated zzso degradation via zzso zzso degradation zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso using zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and zzso also zzso zzso switch gene 2 zzso zzso which is an zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso Overall, zzso attenuated zzso protein zzso via zzso degradation in zzso and zzso also promoted zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso may contribute to progressive obesity and insulin resistance via its dual regulation of zzso
