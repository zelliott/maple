To examine the association of zzso with functional status and zzso health among US adults and how the association differs by age and zzso 

All analyses are based on the National Health zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso representative study of the US household zzso We pooled all survey years and fitted zzso zzso for the two sexes and three age strata zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso 

Our study found that although zzso and severe obesity are consistently associated with increased disability and poorer health status, overweight and moderate obesity show associations that vary considerably by age and zzso For men, the adjusted odds ratios zzso for disability and zzso zzso health tended to be lowest among overweight zzso especially for zzso or zzso Among men with moderate zzso the risk of disability was elevated for ages zzso but lower for zzso or zzso For women, the adjusted zzso for disability and zzso zzso health tended to be lowest among zzso zzso particularly for ages zzso zzso Compared to zzso counterparts, overweight women zzso or zzso had a lower risk of disability but a somewhat elevated risk of zzso zzso zzso 

The results suggest that the association of zzso with functional status and zzso health varies significantly across ages and zzso The variations in the association of zzso with functional status and zzso health suggest that a single zzso body weight zzso may not be appropriate for all persons or all health zzso
