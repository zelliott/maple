We sought to evaluate whether zzso body mass index zzso impacts surgical zzso complication rates, and/or recurrence rates in women undergoing pelvic zzso 

All women who underwent pelvic zzso for zzso indications at our institution from 1993 through 2010 were zzso Women were zzso into 3 groups based on zzso zzso zzso surgical zzso early zzso zzso and late zzso 60 zzso zzso zzso and zzso outcomes were zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses were zzso zzso survival zzso were compared using zzso zzso 

161 patients were included zzso normal weight, 44 overweight, 58 zzso Median follow-up times were 22, 29, and 25 zzso Most patients underwent total pelvic zzso zzso zzso had a zzso zzso On zzso analysis, both overweight and obese patients had a higher risk of early superficial wound separation compared to normal weight patients - OR zzso zzso zzso and OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of surgery was significantly longer for overweight zzso OR zzso zzso zzso and obese zzso OR zzso zzso zzso patients than for normal weight patients zzso Late zzso complications for patients in the normal weight, overweight, and obese groups were zzso zzso and zzso zzso There were no differences in time to recurrence zzso or overall survival zzso between zzso 

Although operative times were longer and risk for superficial wound separation was significantly higher, pelvic zzso appears to be feasible and safe in overweight and obese women with overall complication rates and survival outcomes comparable to normal weight zzso
