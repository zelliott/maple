zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso level was measured during per zzso zzso tolerance test as well as zzso specific insulin binding percentage and capacity of zzso in zzso obesity and in obese children due to zzso and was compared with zzso zzso zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso ratios were zzso In 4 cases zzso zzso content was substantially increased as compared to the other zzso The data suggest that zzso in zzso obesity is zzso The ratio of the two peptides was normal or zzso insulin binding % of zzso corresponded to that of the control group, which explains in these cases normal or zzso zzso zzso It is thought that in obese children high zzso zzso levels with an adequate clinical picture can indicate the functional examination of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio differing from normal indirectly shows the changes of zzso zzso
