zzso zzso diabetes zzso zzso and hypertension are leading causes associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and zzso In modern times, the combined first line zzso therapy with at least two drugs with a different mechanism of action to achieve a better blood pressure control, is increasing in acceptance zzso The aim of the present study was to determine possible beneficial effects of the zzso combination zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso regarding zzso and vessels protection in an animal model of hypertension, obesity and zzso such as the obese zzso rat zzso and control lean zzso rats zzso 

zzso male zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used in this zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso with zzso group zzso zzso zzso group zzso zzso and zzso with zzso group zzso zzso During 6 months, zzso and zzso received a daily dose of 1 zzso combination of zzso zzso PER + zzso zzso zzso zzso of doses zzso by zzso and zzso and zzso received an equal volume of vehicle throughout the zzso In order to evaluate cardiac dimensions and left zzso mass zzso zzso zzso were performed, at baseline and at the end of the zzso zzso and blood samples for zzso determination were zzso After 6 months of treatment all rats were sacrificed, hearts were harvested for light zzso zzso high-resolution light zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso against transforming growth factor beta zzso and zzso type I zzso I) and type III zzso zzso and electron zzso zzso zzso 

At the end of the study zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso lower blood pressure zzso zzso 4 versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso smaller cardiac dimensions zzso zzso lower zzso g body weight zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso higher fractional zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso Moreover, zzso that received zzso showed zzso zzso zzso density zzso zzso zzso versus 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso density zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso thickness zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and lower amounts of: zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and vessel wall zzso zzso zzso I and zzso III zzso and zzso I zzso III ratio zzso compared with zzso zzso Finally, zzso with zzso showed not only zzso modification in zzso and zzso metabolism when compared with zzso zzso but also an improvement in zzso ratio zzso 

These results suggest that zzso of PER + zzso can control cardiovascular damage in zzso providing an additional help in the zzso scenario zzso
