zzso activity levels in adolescents with obesity requires the development of exercise programs that are both attractive to adolescents and easily zzso The aim of this study was to develop a modular zzso training program for adolescents with severe zzso with a focus on zzso individual targets and acquiring physical zzso We report here the effects on zzso fitness from a pilot zzso Furthermore, we examined the feasibility of the modified shuttle test zzso as an outcome zzso for zzso fitness in adolescents with severe zzso 

Fifteen adolescents from an zzso body weight management program participated in the zzso training study (age zzso zzso zzso zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso The subjects trained three days per week for 12 weeks, with each session lasting zzso zzso The modular training program consisted of zzso outdoor and swimming zzso zzso of the zzso was studied by assessing construct zzso zzso reliability and sensitivity to zzso 

Comparing zzso and end of training period showed large clinically relevant and significant improvements for all zzso zzso zzso zzso peak zzso effect size zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, a significant improvement was found for the efficiency of the cardiovascular system as assessed by the oxygen pulse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reliability and sensitivity to change of the zzso were very zzso zzso was significantly correlated with zzso peak zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso The zzso walking distance improved significantly by zzso zzso zzso The attendance rate at the exercise sessions was zzso 

This zzso varied zzso training program has clinically relevant effects on zzso performance in adolescents with severe zzso The added value of our zzso training program for body weight management programs for adolescents with severe obesity should be studied with a zzso zzso This study further demonstrated that the zzso is a reliable, sensitive and easy to administer outcome measure for zzso fitness in adolescent body weight management zzso
