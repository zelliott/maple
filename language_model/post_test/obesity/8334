Numerous obesity zzso have been identified using zzso association zzso A UK study indicated that physical activity may zzso the cumulative effect of 12 of these zzso but replication studies are zzso zzso we tested whether the zzso effect of these zzso is diminished in adults of European ancestry reporting high levels of physical zzso Twelve zzso zzso were zzso or zzso in zzso zzso A genetic risk score zzso was calculated by summing the zzso zzso of each genetic zzso Physical activity was assessed using self-administered zzso zzso interactions between the zzso and physical activity on zzso were tested in linear and zzso zzso models in each zzso with adjustment for age, zzso sex, study center (for zzso zzso and the marginal terms for physical activity and the zzso These results were combined using zzso weighted by cohort sample zzso The zzso yielded a statistically significant zzso zzso physical activity interaction effect estimate zzso zzso However, a statistically significant interaction effect was only apparent in North American zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso In secondary zzso both the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed evidence of zzso zzso physical activity zzso This zzso of zzso individuals provides further support for an interaction between physical activity and a zzso in obesity zzso although these findings hinge on the inclusion of zzso from North America, indicating that these results are either zzso or zzso
