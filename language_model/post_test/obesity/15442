Family history of hypertension and obesity are both risk factors for zzso zzso and obesity share several zzso abnormalities and are frequently zzso However, not all obese people are zzso Renal handling of sodium has been proposed as a zzso mechanism of essential hypertension and zzso This study was conducted in obese adolescents to evaluate the role of a family history of hypertension versus obesity in the zzso handling of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso were measured in 46 obese adolescent offspring of zzso parents zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso years, 22 zzso eight obese offspring of zzso parents zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso years, four zzso and in 34 lean adolescent offspring of zzso parents zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso years, 24 zzso zzso in OH was zzso zzso zzso in ON it was zzso zzso zzso and in zzso it was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in OH was zzso zzso zzso in ON it was zzso zzso zzso and in zzso it was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Plasma zzso activity zzso and zzso zzso were measured in OH and zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso and PA was zzso zzso 36 and 242 zzso 32 zzso respectively zzso zzso In zzso adolescents with a family history of hypertension, regardless of their body mass, have a diminished zzso and zzso zzso adolescents also have higher plasma levels of zzso than lean zzso In conclusion, the family history of hypertension would be related to the increased zzso zzso sodium zzso whereas obesity would be related to increased zzso sodium zzso mechanisms, such as zzso Both mechanisms could explain the higher prevalence of hypertension in obese offspring of zzso zzso
