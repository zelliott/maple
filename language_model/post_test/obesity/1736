The aim of this article is to develop a model of how culture shapes the body, based on two studies conducted in urban zzso 

Research was conducted in 1991 and 2001 in four zzso distinct zzso First, cultural domain analyses were conducted with samples of key zzso The cultural zzso investigated included lifestyle, social support, family life, national identity, and zzso Cultural consensus analysis was used to confirm shared knowledge in each domain and to derive measures of cultural zzso Cultural zzso zzso how closely an individual matches the cultural consensus model for each zzso Second, body zzso cultural zzso and related variables were assessed in community zzso Multiple zzso analysis was used to examine the association of cultural zzso and body zzso controlling for standard zzso and competing explanatory zzso 

In 1991, in a survey of 260 individuals, cultural zzso had a zzso association with the body mass index that differed for men and women, controlling for zzso and dietary zzso In 2001, in a survey of 267 individuals, cultural zzso had a linear association with abdominal circumference that differed for men and women, controlling for zzso and dietary zzso In general, as cultural zzso increases, body mass index and abdominal circumference decline, more strongly for women than zzso 

As individuals, in their own beliefs and behaviors, more closely approximate shared cultural models in socially salient zzso body composition also more closely zzso the cultural zzso of the zzso
