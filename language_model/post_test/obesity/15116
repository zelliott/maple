Increased circulating zzso has been reported in obese subjects but not in association with measures of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes zzso The main aim of this study was to determine whether zzso in plasma and urine are associated with insulin zzso 

We performed both zzso and zzso zzso weight zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso other inflammatory zzso zzso model assessment of insulin resistance zzso and parameters of zzso and zzso metabolism were evaluated in zzso subjects zzso with normal zzso and 62 with impaired zzso zzso tolerance and 51 zzso zzso zzso was also evaluated in urine samples from 71 participants zzso zzso and 21 subjects with zzso zzso sensitivity zzso zzso zzso was determined in a subset of 156 subjects, and the effects of weight loss were investigated in an independent cohort of obese subjects zzso 

zzso zzso was significantly increased in zzso zzso of zzso and positively associated with zzso obesity measures, inflammatory zzso and parameters of zzso and zzso zzso Similar findings were reported for zzso zzso in zzso In the subset of subjects, the association of zzso with zzso was independent of zzso and zzso In fact, zzso together with zzso protein contributed to zzso of zzso zzso after controlling for age and blood zzso zzso Otherwise, weight loss led to decreased circulating zzso in parallel to zzso zzso and zzso 

These findings suggest that circulating and urinary zzso of zzso are linked to chronic zzso inflammation and insulin resistance beyond zzso
