Many zzso and experimental studies have proven that some adult diseases might have their origin in fetal zzso It has been also hypothesized that zzso environment in pregnancy complicated with diabetes might influence the development of zzso type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases in the zzso 

To assess zzso zzso insulin zzso and prevalence of obesity in the offspring of mothers with zzso diabetes zzso zzso and zzso diabetes zzso zzso and to evaluate the relationship between maternal zzso control during pregnancy and zzso disturbances in zzso 

Children of mothers with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 34) were examined at zzso zzso of age and compared with the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso parameters available for zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of overweight and zzso impaired zzso zzso and insulin resistance were analyzed based on zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed with zzso zzso 

In children of zzso mothers, body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso control zzso and insulin resistance zzso zzso model assessment index - insulin resistance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso control zzso were significantly higher than in other zzso zzso and insulin resistance were also most frequent in zzso group zzso significant zzso In addition, we observed the relationship between maternal zzso zzso and mean zzso in zzso period and insulin resistance in zzso There was not such correlation for the class of maternal zzso 

Children born to mothers with zzso diabetes seem to be at risk for obesity and zzso zzso
