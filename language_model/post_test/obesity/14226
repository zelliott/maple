The zzso factor zzso 2 zzso zzso T zzso was previously associated with type 2 diabetes zzso and decreased zzso whereas zzso carrying the zzso C and zzso A zzso zzso were associated with increased zzso The functional relevance of zzso zzso and their effects on zzso and obesity remained to be further zzso In white European zzso we found that the zzso T zzso was more associated with zzso in zzso non-obese individuals zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso than in 1,110 class III obese subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso No direct effect of the zzso C zzso and zzso was found on any form of obesity in zzso normal zzso tolerant zzso individuals, zzso zzso with familial obesity and zzso individuals from the French general zzso However, in zzso subjects, the zzso C zzso was less prevalent in the zzso non-obese individuals zzso compared to zzso class III obese subjects zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso T zzso is less prone to be bound by protein factors than the C zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cell lines and that zzso expression decreases in subcutaneous zzso tissue from zzso obese zzso carriers under calorie zzso In conclusion, zzso is not a risk factor for obesity in European zzso but its effect on zzso risk is modulated by zzso Furthermore, our data suggest that the zzso T zzso may be possibly functional and associated with a nominal decrease in zzso expression in zzso tissue of individuals under calorie zzso
