The purpose of this article was to test whether physical activity, healthy eating, and emotional well-being would improve if patients received feedback about zzso that have been shown to be responsive to changes in weight and zzso 

Patients were zzso to limited feedback zzso body mass index zzso and blood pressure at 4 and 10 zzso or enhanced feedback zzso zzso blood pressure, zzso insulin resistance, and nuclear magnetic resonance zzso profiles at 2, 4, 7, and 10 zzso zzso measures mixed effects zzso zzso models were used to determine whether zzso zzso diet, and quality of life changed over zzso 

Major parameters were similar in both groups at zzso zzso measures of zzso healthy eating, quality of life, and health state improved in both patient groups, but there was no difference between patient groups at 4 or 10 zzso zzso blood pressure improved in the enhanced feedback group, and there was a difference between the enhanced and limited feedback groups at 10 months zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso 

Providing patients with enhanced feedback did not dramatically change zzso However, across groups, many patients maintained or lost weight, suggesting the need for more study of zzso zzso
