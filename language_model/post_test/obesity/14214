This study was designed to zzso whether the plasma zzso level reflects visceral or subcutaneous fat zzso and zzso zzso in obese zzso 

zzso obese Japanese children, including 37 boys and 19 girls were enrolled in the zzso The age of the subjects ranged from 5 to 15 zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso The zzso control group for measuring zzso consisted of 20 non-obese zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso and subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso areas were measured by zzso zzso The plasma zzso for zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The plasma zzso level was higher in the obese zzso zzso zzso zzso than in the control children zzso zzso zzso zzso In a zzso analysis, the zzso correlated significantly with age, zzso body weight, waist zzso zzso and SAT area, zzso zzso insulin, and the zzso model assessment for insulin resistance zzso After being adjusted for age and sex, only the zzso area retained significant partial correlation with zzso and in contrast the body weight, zzso and SAT area with zzso The plasma zzso concentration was not correlated with zzso The plasma zzso levels in the control, zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso groups zzso zzso 7) were significantly different from each zzso 

These results suggest that plasma zzso level is a specific marker for visceral fat zzso in obese zzso As a good surrogate marker, plasma zzso level can predict the zzso area in obese zzso
