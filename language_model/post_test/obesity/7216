There has been an zzso increasing interest in zzso hypertension zzso The zzso pressure zzso markedly affects the function of the respiratory zzso 

This review will focus on the available literature from the past few zzso A zzso and zzso search was performed in order to find an answer to the question zzso is the impact of increased zzso on respiratory function in the critically zzso 

In particular, increased zzso increases chest wall zzso (or decreases zzso and promotes zzso shift of the zzso with zzso reduction in lung volume and zzso zzso zzso of the lung zzso also triggers pulmonary zzso During general zzso in normal subjects, zzso does not affect the chest wall mechanics, but plays a relevant role in the zzso displacement of the abdominal content, the zzso and zzso changes in lung mechanics and zzso In obese patients, the increased zzso is the major zzso of the reduction in lung volume, zzso formation and zzso in chest wall zzso In zzso patients the measurement of zzso and chest wall mechanics is important for a better interpretation of respiratory mechanics, zzso and appropriate setting of the zzso Furthermore, increased zzso promotes lung zzso zzso induced lung injury and reduced zzso flow in normal and diseased zzso 

Increased zzso markedly affects respiratory function in such a way that it has an impact on daily clinical zzso
