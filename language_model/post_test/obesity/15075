Human aging is characterized by both physical and zzso zzso A key feature of zzso zzso is the zzso decline in skeletal muscle mass, strength, and endurance that characterize even the healthy zzso zzso in zzso particularly in visceral zzso zzso are almost universal in aging individuals and can contribute to zzso and insulin resistance by increasing levels of inflammatory zzso known collectively as zzso Aging also is associated with declines in zzso and innate zzso known as immune zzso which are risk factors for cancer and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in skeletal muscle tissue and declines in aging zzso zzso zzso zzso fat deposition and insulin resistance, is anabolic for skeletal muscle in certain situations, and is required for the development and survival of natural killer zzso zzso We review the effect that zzso and zzso have on zzso cells, with special emphasis on zzso We zzso that increased zzso and decreased zzso levels during aging constitute a common mechanism for zzso zzso and immune zzso
