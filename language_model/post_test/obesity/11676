zzso (or zzso represent the major form of stored energy in zzso zzso synthesis has been assumed to occur primarily through zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that zzso the final and only committed step in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been considered necessary for zzso tissue formation and essential for zzso Here we show that zzso zzso mice are viable and can still zzso zzso Moreover, these mice are lean and resistant to zzso zzso The obesity resistance involves increased energy expenditure and increased zzso zzso zzso also alters zzso metabolism in other zzso including the zzso zzso where zzso is defective in zzso zzso Our findings indicate that multiple mechanisms exist for zzso synthesis and suggest that the selective zzso of zzso zzso synthesis may be useful for treating zzso
