zzso syndrome is a rare genetic syndrome associated with zzso zzso severe insulin resistance zzso that is disproportionate to the degree of zzso and premature zzso The zzso zzso which is zzso in zzso syndrome, encodes a giant zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Its function is unknown, although roles in primary zzso formation and function, zzso zzso trafficking and, most recently, zzso differentiation have been zzso We now test the hypothesis that the severe zzso and zzso in zzso syndrome are accounted for by a partial zzso in zzso and/or insulin action in mature zzso leading to relative failure of zzso tissue to discharge its role in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression zzso in zzso zzso was associated with impairment of zzso zzso and at least a twofold reduction in zzso gene expression following hormonal induction of zzso This was accompanied by a commensurate zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso events in response to insulin were zzso These results suggest that partial impairment of zzso in zzso syndrome may contribute to the severity of the associated zzso zzso whereas the ability of insulin to stimulate zzso zzso into zzso is zzso zzso
