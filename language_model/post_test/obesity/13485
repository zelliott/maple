We aimed to categorize zzso zzso zzso according to technical difficulty to zzso learning purposes and zzso results, making future studies more zzso 

Fifty patients undergoing a zzso total zzso zzso were zzso zzso Four preoperatively known facts zzso body mass index zzso tumor zzso and zzso radiation zzso were compared to four operative outcomes zzso time, blood loss, a visual analogue score zzso for difficulty rewarded by the surgeon, and zzso zzso of the zzso 

zzso time for male and female patients was zzso zzso 245 zzso zzso blood loss was 300 zzso 300 zzso zzso the zzso was 8 zzso 6 zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso time was zzso zzso and zzso zzso for high, zzso and low tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso Blood loss was 105, zzso and 600 zzso zzso zzso zzso Lower tumors were rewarded a higher zzso zzso zzso zzso and were less often radically zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso time for zzso and zzso patients was 277 zzso 225 zzso zzso blood loss was 500 zzso 150 zzso zzso the zzso was 7 zzso 5 zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso time was 240 zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso Blood loss was 150 zzso for zzso zzso and 500 zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso Higher zzso were rewarded a higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had no correlation to zzso of the procedure zzso zzso zzso There was an association between technical difficulty score and operation time zzso blood loss zzso zzso zzso and zzso of surgery zzso 

zzso surgery in male, zzso and obese patients with lower tumors seemed more zzso A categorization according to technical difficulty, to preoperatively predict difficulty of the zzso was found zzso
