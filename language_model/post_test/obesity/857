We present data suggesting that zzso zzso zzso may be the zzso gene of a previously identified quantitative trait locus zzso associated with cortisol levels, fat, and muscle content in a pig zzso Because zzso in human and mouse maps in the region zzso to the pig region containing this zzso we considered zzso as an interesting zzso candidate gene because zzso plays a major role in cortisol zzso zzso we cloned pig zzso from a bacterial artificial zzso library and showed by fluorescent in zzso zzso and radiation hybrid mapping that it maps on zzso at the peak of the zzso zzso zzso we detected in a subset of the pig zzso progeny a highly significant genetic linkage between zzso plasma binding capacity values and the zzso 7 markers zzso the zzso zzso In this population, zzso capacity is correlated positively to fat and zzso to muscle zzso zzso zzso capacity was three times higher in zzso compared with Large White parental breeds and a zzso difference was found in zzso zzso expression between the two zzso Overall, the data accumulated in this study point to zzso gene as a key regulator of cortisol levels and obesity zzso
