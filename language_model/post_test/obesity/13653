zzso zzso protein zzso is zzso by liver and zzso and is implicated in systemic insulin resistance in zzso and zzso zzso normally binds to the larger zzso zzso zzso forming a protein complex that reduces zzso clearance of zzso To determine whether zzso in zzso binding contribute to elevated plasma zzso levels in zzso states, we investigated zzso interactions in zzso zzso mice and zzso obese mice zzso zzso zzso zzso of plasma showed that zzso of zzso is contained within the zzso complex in zzso and lean zzso zzso with an zzso zzso brought down zzso equal amounts of zzso and zzso indicating that zzso was not more saturated with zzso in zzso mice than in zzso However, plasma zzso levels were elevated approximately fourfold in zzso mice zzso zzso zzso injected zzso in lean mice cleared zzso whereas the zzso for disappearance was approximately twofold longer in zzso zzso zzso fractional zzso of zzso was reduced in zzso mice, consistent with increased zzso In zzso mice, plasma zzso levels and clearance of injected zzso were similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were elevated approximately twofold in zzso but not in zzso zzso Since elevated circulating zzso causes insulin resistance and zzso intolerance in mice, these findings suggest that increased zzso or zzso in zzso binding may contribute to insulin resistance by stabilizing zzso at higher zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso levels or interfering with zzso binding may enhance insulin sensitivity in obesity and type 2 zzso
