It has been noted that elevated inflammatory zzso such as tumor necrosis zzso zzso soluble zzso zzso II zzso zzso 6 zzso and zzso protein zzso are characteristically found in the serum in obese zzso In this study, we examined the correlation of these markers with zzso in zzso obese, and zzso obese individuals to explore this relationship across the broad range of zzso 

A total of 9 zzso including normal and overweight zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso and 41 obese zzso or zzso zzso adults were included in this zzso Among obese subjects, 11 subjects were grade I or II obese zzso or zzso and zzso zzso and 30 subjects were zzso obese zzso III obese, zzso or zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso insulin, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso 

zzso subjects zzso or zzso zzso had significantly higher serum levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso were positively correlated with zzso in obese zzso However, in zzso obese subjects, only the serum zzso of zzso and zzso remained correlated with zzso primarily because of this relationship in zzso 

The present results support evidence that obesity represents an inflammatory zzso In zzso zzso the correlation of only zzso and zzso with zzso particularly in zzso suggests that zzso may be zzso in an zzso manner in proportion to the expansion of fat mass particularly in the abdominal region, with a corresponding increase in zzso production of zzso
