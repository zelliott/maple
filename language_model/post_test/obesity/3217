zzso tissue produces inflammation and immunity molecules suspected to be involved in zzso zzso The pattern of expression and the nutritional regulation of these molecules in humans are poorly zzso We analyzed the gene expression profiles of subcutaneous white zzso tissue from 29 obese subjects during very low calorie diet zzso using zzso zzso and reverse zzso quantitative zzso The patterns of expression were compared with that of 17 non-obese zzso We determined whether the regulated genes were expressed in zzso or zzso fraction zzso Gene expression profiling identified 100 zzso transcripts that are regulated in obese individuals when eating a 28 day zzso but not a 2 day zzso zzso analysis showed that the pattern of gene expression in obese subjects after 28 day zzso was closer to the profile of lean subjects than to the pattern of obese subjects before zzso Weight loss improves the inflammatory profile of obese subjects through a decrease of zzso factors and an increase of zzso zzso The genes are expressed mostly in the zzso fraction of zzso zzso which is shown to contain numerous zzso The beneficial effect of weight loss on zzso complications may be associated with the modification of the inflammatory profile in zzso zzso
