Apart from zzso blood zzso zzso and insulin zzso oral zzso tolerance test zzso is also used in calculating insulin zzso During zzso insulin zzso may not reflect normal zzso insulin zzso Based on this idea, zzso and whole body insulin sensitivity rates were tested during zzso and mixed meal test zzso in obese zzso Thirty-one women with zzso zzso zzso Check Index zzso values below zzso and body mass index zzso were included into the zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso 300 zzso were applied to all zzso Data obtained from zzso and zzso were used in the assessment of insulin sensitivity with zzso of Model zzso Resistance zzso and zzso Composite Whole Body zzso zzso Index zzso zzso Mean zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso was zzso zzso zzso and from zzso was zzso zzso zzso In analysis, it was demonstrated that there was a correlation between zzso zzso and zzso zzso derived from zzso and zzso Comparing the time periods zzso it was detected that despite similar zzso in insulin levels, zzso levels were higher in zzso than zzso at 15 and 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated to be effectively used with the data of zzso as used with zzso Moreover, zzso was shown to be in parallel to zzso insulin zzso and reflect pancreatic functions better compared to zzso
