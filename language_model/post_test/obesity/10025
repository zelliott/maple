The role of expression and zzso of the zzso gene product, zzso for the regulation of plasma zzso levels has been investigated in zzso using abdominal subcutaneous zzso tissue of 20 obese, otherwise healthy, and 11 zzso zzso Body mass index zzso zzso zzso in the two groups was zzso and zzso zzso Fat cell volume was zzso zzso in the obese and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In the obese group, plasma zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to gamma zzso were increased five and two times, zzso Moreover, zzso tissue zzso rates per gram zzso weight or per fat cell number were also increased two and seven times, respectively, in the obese zzso There were strong linear correlations zzso zzso zzso between plasma zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All of these zzso zzso correlated strongly with zzso and fat cell volume zzso zzso zzso zzso About zzso of the variation in plasma zzso could be attributed to variations in zzso zzso rate, zzso or fat cell zzso We conclude that elevated circulating levels of zzso in obese women above all result from accelerated zzso rates of the zzso from zzso tissue because of increased zzso gene zzso However, zzso zzso zzso zzso and circulating zzso levels are all more closely related to the stored amount of lipids in the fat cells of zzso tissue than they are to an arbitrary division into obese versus zzso
