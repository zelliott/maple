The central zzso system is essential for the regulation of long-term energy zzso in zzso zzso experiments suggest that this system also affects zzso zzso in particular by modulating peripheral insulin sensitivity independently of its effect on zzso zzso patients with complete genetic defects in the central zzso system can provide insight into the role of this system in zzso zzso in zzso We here describe the eighth individual with complete zzso zzso zzso and the first with coincidental zzso type 1 diabetes, which provides a unique opportunity to determine the role of zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso gene in this severely obese patient with isolated zzso hormone zzso identified a zzso zzso untranslated region zzso zzso which we find to abolish normal zzso protein zzso as assessed in zzso The patient's insulin requirements were as expected for his age and zzso zzso This unique patient suggests that in humans the central zzso system does not seem to affect peripheral insulin sensitivity, independently of its effect on zzso
