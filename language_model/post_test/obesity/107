A new approach has been developed to examine insulin sensitivity and resistance in zzso in zzso In it, zzso methods are used, which permit the assessment of zzso state zzso zzso by a method that is zzso and does not use zzso zzso zzso doses of zzso infused zzso are used to drive zzso out of steady state and to stimulate the release of insulin into the portal zzso By relating the changes in the rates of zzso production, zzso and fractional disappearance to zzso zzso and insulin, it is possible to assess the body's sensitivity to zzso levels of these two zzso The utility of this approach was examined in zzso a known human model of insulin zzso The data demonstrated that zzso production in the obese subjects responded normally to zzso They also showed that insulin was much less effective in promoting zzso zzso in the obese persons than it was in the normal zzso In the obese subjects who were zzso the pancreatic zzso were shown to be normally responsive to the zzso effects of either zzso or zzso zzso they did not release sufficient insulin to overcome the insulin resistance, and these obese individuals had impaired zzso zzso Thus, it is suggested that, in the presence of insulin resistance, the responsiveness of zzso will determine whether the zzso tolerance will be zzso zzso in other conditions associated with zzso zzso the zzso basis of which is zzso
