The clinical significance of visceral fat zzso in childhood obesity has remained zzso 

In 35 subjects (18 boys and 17 zzso aged zzso years, visceral and subcutaneous fat were estimated by measuring the maximum thickness of zzso fat zzso and the minimum thickness of subcutaneous fat zzso in the upper median abdomen, respectively, by zzso The associations with zzso serum insulin levels converted to zzso zzso were studied for six zzso zzso including the obesity index, body fat percentage, zzso circumference ratio zzso zzso zzso and the ratio of zzso to zzso zzso wall fat index, zzso 

In girls, the zzso was positively correlated with the zzso obesity index, body fat percentage and zzso In contrast, the zzso was positively correlated only with the zzso and zzso in zzso There were no significant correlations between the zzso and the zzso or zzso in either zzso The zzso revealed the highest correlation with the zzso in both boys zzso zzso zzso P zzso and girls zzso zzso zzso P zzso 

These results indicate the important contribution of visceral fat zzso to the development of zzso regardless of zzso zzso it is suggested that evaluating zzso by zzso may be the most sensitive and reliable method of predicting insulin zzso zzso zzso in children, compared with other conventional zzso of zzso
