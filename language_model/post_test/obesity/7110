To investigate whether zzso distribution of fat mass zzso is associated with variations of the zzso zzso axis activity in zzso obese zzso 

zzso assessed with dual energy X-ray zzso and a comprehensive set of measures of zzso axis activity and zzso have been studied in 45 zzso obese children aged 6 to 11 years zzso and 6 to 13 years zzso 

After adjustment for whole body fat mass zzso zzso zzso correlated positively with insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso model assessment of insulin resistance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When adjusted for zzso zzso correlated positively with morning plasma cortisol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the total zzso zzso correlated zzso with the rise of zzso cortisol after a standard meal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso obviously in zzso When adjusted for zzso and zzso morning plasma cortisol correlated positively with total cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The rise of zzso cortisol after a standard meal was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and positively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with zzso model assessment of insulin resistance in boys and girls, zzso 

Association exists in zzso obese children between zzso and markers of zzso axis zzso These data suggest that zzso axis could be involved early in life in obesity associated with zzso zzso zzso
