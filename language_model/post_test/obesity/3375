A subset of zzso zzso have been identified with elevated levels of zzso and zzso zzso The insulin zzso between 0 and 15 zzso in an intravenous zzso tolerance test zzso was zzso zzso 42 zzso in zzso zzso monkeys compared to 191 zzso 16 zzso in zzso zzso controls zzso less than zzso zzso insulin increased from 37 zzso 4 in zzso to 57 zzso 7 zzso in zzso monkeys zzso zzso zzso zzso clearance also increased from zzso zzso zzso in zzso to zzso zzso zzso in zzso monkeys zzso less than zzso The acute zzso zzso 31 versus 137 zzso 19 zzso and secondary insulin responses zzso zzso 75 versus zzso zzso 32 zzso were significantly greater in the zzso monkeys than in the zzso controls, respectively zzso less than zzso The rate of zzso clearance per amount of insulin zzso was diminished about zzso in both the acute and the secondary zzso of zzso monkeys zzso less than zzso Total zzso zzso was two times greater in zzso than in zzso monkeys zzso zzso zzso The zzso monkeys averaged zzso greater weight and zzso greater body mass than the zzso monkeys zzso less than zzso although both groups were fed the same amount of diet and were well within zzso zzso These zzso zzso appear to have a functional zzso with excess insulin zzso relatively impaired clearance of zzso and possible insulin resistance, but no zzso pathological zzso Development toward overt diabetes might be exacerbated if obesity became a more dominant zzso
