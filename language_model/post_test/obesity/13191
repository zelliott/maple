zzso zzso zzso is involved in the metabolism of several zzso and plays a key role in reverse cholesterol zzso The aim of the current study was to test the statistical association between two zzso gene promoter zzso zzso and zzso and zzso profiles in a zzso zzso 

A sample population of zzso zzso individuals was zzso DNA was extracted from the blood and zzso were determined by zzso chain reaction, restriction zzso zzso and zzso gel zzso 

Analysis of the data revealed that these two zzso are in strong linkage zzso zzso zzso A significantly lower total zzso ratio was noted for carriers with the zzso and zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso and zzso zzso A significant trend of the association was also found on the high levels of zzso cholesterol zzso among carriers with the zzso and zzso zzso as opposed to that of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis has demonstrated that the effects of zzso and zzso zzso on zzso levels were not affected by subjects' sex, body mass index, plasma zzso levels and the cholesterol zzso transfer protein gene zzso zzso zzso analysis on each sex has revealed that the two studied zzso were significantly associated with zzso levels among males but not significant in zzso The same association between obese and non-obese men was not zzso The zzso of the respective zzso on zzso levels were zzso and zzso among obese men, but not significant among non-obese zzso 

Analysis of our data revealed an independent association between the zzso gene promoter zzso and zzso levels in zzso The data also suggests that the zzso and zzso zzso interact with sex and obesity on zzso zzso The findings give clues for identifying high risk population in preventive medicine and clinical zzso The subsequent impacts on treatment profiles and prognosis were derived from this zzso
