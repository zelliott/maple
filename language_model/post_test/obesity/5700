In order to demonstrate the suggested failure of the zzso system in human obesity and to evaluate the role of central zzso activity in zzso zzso and zzso stimulating hormone zzso release in this condition, 13 zzso obese and 9 healthy women of normal weight were zzso A zzso test zzso zzso zzso was performed before and after administration of zzso zzso 60 zzso zzso for 14 zzso In the controls, zzso did not modify the expected significant increase in zzso induced by zzso In obese patients, however, the zzso levels was significantly increased after zzso but the increase was less than in the zzso After zzso the zzso response to zzso was larger than in the zzso phase, with values similar to those observed in normal zzso In neither group zzso did change the zzso effect of zzso but the hormonal response in obese patients was greater than in the zzso The restoration of the responsiveness of zzso to zzso after central zzso stimulation confirms the hypothesis that a failure of the zzso system may occur in human zzso Since zzso does not interfere with the zzso pattern of zzso and zzso zzso in normal or obese subjects, the zzso system does not seem to play a major role in the control of zzso zzso
