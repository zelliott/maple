zzso with metabolically healthy or benign obesity zzso zzso or at risk obesity have been zzso however, the zzso factors for developing these zzso are poorly zzso 

Our objective was to examine zzso timing marked by zzso age in relation to zzso obese, benign obese, and healthy zzso zzso at zzso and to characterize the potential role of zzso marked by the free zzso index zzso in accounting for any associations between zzso age and obesity zzso 

The study was zzso 

Participants included a multiethnic community sample of zzso zzso women ages zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Membership in zzso obese, benign obese, and healthy zzso groups was defined by body mass index and number of zzso syndrome zzso 

With each zzso increase in zzso age, the probability of having the zzso obese compared with the healthy zzso zzso decreased by zzso This association attenuated when zzso was zzso suggesting zzso levels may account for this zzso In addition, higher zzso was independently related to having the zzso obese compared with the healthy zzso zzso as well as having the zzso compared with the benign obese zzso (all zzso 

Younger zzso age is associated with having the metabolically zzso obesity zzso compared with the healthy zzso zzso at zzso This relation may be driven by levels of zzso zzso which were especially elevated among women with the zzso obesity zzso
