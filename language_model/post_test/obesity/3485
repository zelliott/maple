In the present study, the ability of zzso to inhibit skin tumor promotion by zzso zzso was analyzed in mice maintained on either an overweight control diet or an zzso zzso zzso was included for comparison, and a combination of zzso and zzso was also zzso zzso zzso in the drinking water) and zzso zzso zzso inhibited development of both zzso and zzso cell zzso in overweight and obese mice in a zzso zzso A zzso combination of these two compounds displayed an additive zzso effect on tumor zzso zzso treatment also reduced the size of zzso Interestingly, all treatments seemed to be at least as effective for zzso tumor formation in obese mice, and both zzso and zzso were more effective at reducing tumor size in obese mice compared with overweight control zzso The effect of zzso on skin tumor development was associated with a significant reduction in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, treatment with zzso led to zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and attenuated signaling through zzso complex zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were more effective at blocking zzso zzso signaling induced by zzso consistent with the greater zzso effect on skin tumor zzso zzso the current data demonstrate that zzso given in the drinking water effectively inhibited skin tumor promotion in both overweight and obese mice and that the mechanism involves zzso of zzso zzso and attenuated signaling downstream of zzso
