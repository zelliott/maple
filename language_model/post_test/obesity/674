To investigate the additive effects of zzso protein 2 zzso gene zzso variation and zzso zzso gene zzso variation on the obesity in Chinese Han zzso 

The zzso gene zzso variation and zzso zzso gene zzso variation were examined by zzso chain zzso zzso length zzso in 119 obese subject with mean zzso zzso and in 177 control subjects with mean zzso The additive effects of the two gene zzso were zzso 

zzso The frequency of zzso zzso gene zzso variation in obese subjects was not significantly different from that in control zzso In control subjects, the zzso variation carriers had higher zzso zzso level and zzso zzso level than did zzso zzso The frequency of zzso of zzso gene zzso variation in obese subjects was higher than that in the control subjects zzso zzso In control subjects the zzso variation carriers had higher zzso zzso When there was only zzso gene or zzso zzso gene zzso the frequency of gene zzso in obese subjects was not significantly different from that in control subjects zzso But when there were simultaneously two gene zzso the frequency of gene zzso was higher in obese subjects than in control subjects zzso zzso zzso The zzso carriers with zzso zzso were the greatest relation to obese obesity zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso gene zzso zzso increases the risk of zzso Though the zzso gene zzso alone or the zzso zzso gene zzso alone is not associated with zzso the possible additive effects of the two zzso increase the occurring of zzso
