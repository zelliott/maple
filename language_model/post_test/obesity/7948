The main purpose of this study was to investigate associations of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and collagen zzso zzso gene and its regulator, the nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with body fat mass and its topographical distribution in zzso zzso 

Participants were zzso healthy women, 60 to 85 years old, who were zzso for four zzso in the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Total body fat mass and the central to peripheral fat mass ratio zzso zzso were measured using zzso zzso and zzso model assessment of insulin resistance were measured in zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso was associated with zzso zzso zzso and the zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso the G zzso being associated with low zzso and high zzso zzso Similar associations of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso characterized the zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso variation of zzso zzso was associated with total body fat mass zzso zzso zzso women with zzso being the most obese zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso in the determination of zzso zzso zzso zzso when analyzed using a zzso zzso 

zzso in the zzso gene are associated with body fat distribution, whereas the zzso zzso in zzso is associated with overall zzso apparently in interaction with an zzso promoter zzso
