We assessed the effect of zzso on human zzso zzso were isolated from 16 healthy obese and 10 lean healthy zzso zzso sensitivity was assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso participants were subdivided into 2 subgroups, insulin sensitive zzso and insulin resistant zzso zzso properties zzso to zzso 1, migration through zzso 1, surface expression of zzso oxidized zzso zzso zzso zzso were assessed zzso and zzso in zzso with zzso zzso were repeated after incubation with zzso and a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso We found a significant correlation between insulin resistance and zzso attachment to zzso and zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso properties of zzso in all groups, apart from surface expression of zzso in IS obese zzso zzso with zzso or zzso attenuated the observed zzso zzso zzso zzso dysfunction which may be zzso zzso with insulin resistance suggests that zzso might be accelerated before the onset of zzso
