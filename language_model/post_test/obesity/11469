This is the ninth update of the human obesity gene map, incorporating published results through October 2002 and continuing the previous zzso Evidence from zzso zzso obesity cases, zzso disorders exhibiting obesity as a clinical feature, quantitative trait zzso zzso from human zzso scans and various animal zzso experiments, and association and linkage studies with candidate genes and other markers is zzso For the first time, transgenic and knockout zzso models exhibiting obesity as a zzso are incorporated (N zzso zzso As of October 2002, 33 zzso syndromes relevant to human obesity have been mapped to a zzso region, and the zzso genes or strong candidates have been identified for 23 of these zzso zzso reported from animal models currently number zzso there are 68 human zzso for obesity zzso from zzso zzso Additionally, significant linkage zzso with candidate genes have been identified in targeted zzso Seven zzso regions harbor zzso zzso among two to five zzso Attempts to relate DNA sequence variation in specific genes to obesity zzso continue to grow, with 222 studies reporting positive associations with 71 candidate zzso Fifteen such candidate genes are supported by at least five positive zzso The obesity gene map shows putative zzso on all zzso except zzso More than 300 zzso zzso and zzso regions have been associated or linked with human obesity zzso The electronic version of the map with links to useful sites can be found at zzso
