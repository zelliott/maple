The sensing of circulating nutrients within the zzso zzso may be critical for energy zzso To induce a sustained impairment in zzso zzso zzso zzso viruses zzso expressing zzso A zzso zzso an zzso involved in the degradation of zzso zzso zzso were injected zzso into the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso led to decreased abundance of zzso fatty zzso A in the zzso zzso and blunted the zzso responses to increased zzso zzso The enhanced expression of zzso within this zzso region induced a rapid increase in food intake and progressive weight zzso zzso was sustained for at least 4 months and occurred despite increased plasma zzso of zzso and zzso These findings indicate that nutritional zzso of the zzso abundance of zzso A is required to restrain food intake and that a primary impairment in this central zzso zzso is sufficient to disrupt energy zzso and induce zzso
