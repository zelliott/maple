The age of zzso rebound zzso is defined as the time at which zzso starts to rise after infancy and is thought to be a marker of later zzso To determine whether this age is related to future occurrence of zzso syndrome, we investigated the relationship of the timing of zzso with zzso consequences at 12 years of zzso 

A total of zzso children zzso boys and 124 zzso born in 1995 and 1996 were enrolled in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso were conducted at the ages of 4 and 8 months and 1, zzso 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 years, based on which age of zzso was zzso Plasma lipids and blood pressure were measured at 12 years of zzso 

An earlier zzso zzso years of zzso was associated with a higher zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso representative of insulin zzso This zzso consists of elevated zzso zzso B, and zzso index and decreased zzso zzso cholesterol in boys and elevated zzso B in girls at 12 years of zzso The earlier zzso was also related to elevated blood pressure in zzso 

This zzso zzso study indicates that children who exhibit zzso at a younger age are predisposed to future development of zzso zzso zzso monitoring of zzso may be an effective method for the early identification of children at risk for zzso zzso
