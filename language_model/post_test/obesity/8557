The worldwide increase in the prevalence of childhood obesity is reaching epidemic proportions and is associated with a dramatic rise in cases of type 2 zzso The prevalence of zzso intolerance and its zzso and the relation of cardiovascular risk factors with levels of zzso and degree of obesity were studied in zzso obese children of European zzso 

A total of zzso zzso obese Italian children zzso score zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso aged zzso years, including 345 male subjects, underwent an oral zzso tolerance zzso zzso resistance and insulin zzso were estimated using the zzso model assessment for insulin resistance and the zzso index, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid were zzso The zzso zzso zzso and degree of zzso calculated as the zzso of zzso were used as dependent zzso 

The prevalence of zzso intolerance was zzso zzso resistance zzso zzso impaired insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso were significantly and independently related to zzso zzso zzso zzso The degree of obesity did not relate to insulin resistance but was independently correlated with inflammatory zzso zzso acid, and zzso zzso variables that were often abnormal in this zzso 

In these zzso obese children, both insulin resistance and impaired insulin zzso contribute to the zzso of zzso and the degree of obesity is related to cardiovascular risk factors independently of insulin zzso
