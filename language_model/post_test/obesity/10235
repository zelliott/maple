The upper normal limit zzso of serum zzso zzso normal range was recently challenged, because patients diagnosed with liver diseases may have zzso or zzso zzso levels, and because possible zzso are often ignored in determining normal zzso 

To estimate the zzso for serum zzso and to identify factors modulating zzso 

We reviewed medical records of subjects aged zzso who underwent standard panels of laboratory tests, including serum zzso over 6 months at a central zzso Three groups were zzso Group 1, comprised total study population zzso zzso Group 2 zzso zzso comprised total study population, excluding those receiving potentially zzso drugs, or diagnosed with liver disease, or had any abnormal laboratory test results other than for zzso cholesterol, zzso or zzso Group 3 zzso zzso the zzso population, from whose zzso values we established the new zzso comprised Group 2 subjects with normal zzso cholesterol, zzso and zzso zzso 

The 95th zzso zzso values, corresponding to the zzso in groups 1, 2, and 3 were zzso 40, and zzso zzso zzso zzso (16 zzso zzso of subjects whose zzso was below zzso listed by the test manufacturer zzso zzso had zzso level above our new zzso Linear and zzso analyses showed that zzso levels were significantly modified by zzso age, zzso cholesterol, zzso and zzso zzso zzso interaction was found between zzso zzso and cholesterol zzso 

In this first large-scale study of zzso population, serum zzso zzso was far lower than currently accepted zzso Age and gender may be considered when determining the zzso for zzso
