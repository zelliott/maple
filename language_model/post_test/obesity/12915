We reported previously an increase in zzso zzso zzso gene expression in the anterior zzso of human zzso hormone zzso transgenic zzso The primary goal of this study was to investigate the possible mechanisms regulating zzso expression in these zzso Compared with normal sibling controls, zzso transgenic mice had significantly greater amounts of abdominal fat, higher levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso increase in plasma zzso zzso Despite normal plasma zzso levels, zzso transgenic mice had zzso elevated levels of plasma zzso Using a zzso protection zzso we measured the zzso levels of the zzso long form zzso in the anterior zzso and zzso after 48 h of zzso In the anterior zzso food deprivation induced dramatic increases in zzso zzso levels in both normal and transgenic zzso In contrast, in the zzso zzso resulted in a significant decrease in zzso gene expression in normal mice, and no changes were detected in zzso transgenic zzso Using dual in zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso Moreover, the number of zzso zzso cells as well as the percentage of zzso cells that express zzso zzso were increased in transgenic zzso In conclusion, 1) the modest obesity in zzso transgenic mice is associated with increases in zzso synthesis and zzso as well as insulin zzso 2) zzso and/or zzso as well as zzso and insulin may zzso contribute to the changes in zzso gene expression in the anterior zzso and the zzso 3) the response of zzso gene expression in the zzso to zzso is absent in the modestly obese zzso transgenic zzso and 4) zzso are target cells for zzso and the increase in zzso gene expression in the zzso of zzso transgenic mice is due at least in part to the increase in the number of cells expressing zzso
