To measure zzso zzso zzso as well as the ability of zzso zzso to transport reducing zzso by shuttle systems in rats fed an energy dense zzso 

zzso were fed a control zzso or energy dense zzso diet for 15 zzso 

State 3 and State 4 oxygen consumption were measured in isolated zzso using zzso or zzso as zzso We also measured zzso shuttle activity and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso rats, in comparison with CD rats, showed a significantly greater energy intake without a corresponding greater body weight gain and carcass zzso zzso Compared to CD rats, zzso rats also showed a significant increase in resting zzso rate, which was abolished by zzso zzso zzso state 3 zzso using zzso or zzso as zzso as well as zzso shuttle activity significantly zzso while zzso zzso zzso significantly increased in zzso rats compared to CD zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is reduced and a greater fraction of zzso zzso can be transported to the zzso through the zzso shuttle and oxidized through the respiratory chain from complex II zzso This mechanism could lead to a decrease in zzso zzso efficiency which is in line with the increased energy expenditure occurring in rats fed an energy dense zzso
