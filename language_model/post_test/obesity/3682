To determine the influence of modifiable lifestyle factors on the risk of cardiovascular disease after zzso cell transplantation zzso 

zzso survivors of zzso 1 year treated from 1970 to 2010 zzso zzso zzso were surveyed from 2010 to 2011 on current cardiovascular health and related lifestyle factors zzso diet, recreational physical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared with those from a matched general population sample (National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Compared with zzso participants, zzso survivors zzso age, zzso years; median zzso years since zzso zzso zzso had higher rates of zzso zzso v zzso stroke zzso v zzso zzso zzso v zzso and diabetes zzso v zzso P zzso for all zzso zzso of hypertension was similar zzso v zzso and survivors were less likely to have zzso heart disease zzso v zzso P zzso Among zzso survivors, hypertension, zzso and diabetes were independent risk factors for zzso heart disease and zzso and smoking was associated with zzso heart disease and diabetes zzso ratios zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso zzso was a risk factor for zzso hypertension, zzso and diabetes zzso zzso zzso P zzso In contrast, lower zzso intake was associated with greater risk of zzso and diabetes zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso and lower physical activity level was associated with greater risk of hypertension and diabetes zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso lifestyle characteristics among zzso survivors attenuated risk of all cardiovascular conditions zzso 

Attention of clinicians to conventional cardiovascular risk factors and modifiable lifestyle characteristics offers hope of reducing serious cardiovascular morbidity after zzso
