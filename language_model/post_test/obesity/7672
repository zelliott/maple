Evidence from individual trials comparing Mediterranean to low-fat diets to modify cardiovascular risk factors remains zzso 

We systematically searched zzso zzso zzso Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from their inception until January 2011, as well as contacted experts in the field, to identify zzso controlled trials comparing Mediterranean to low-fat diets in zzso individuals, with a minimum follow-up of 6 months, reporting zzso data on cardiovascular risk zzso Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and zzso 

We identified 6 trials, including zzso individuals zzso zzso fulfilling our inclusion zzso Mean age of enrolled patients ranged from 35 to 68 years, mean body mass index from 29 to 35 zzso After 2 years of zzso individuals assigned to a Mediterranean diet had more favorable changes in weighted mean differences of body weight zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso total cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso The observed zzso across individual trials could, by and large, be eliminated by restricting analyses to trials with balanced zzso or trials with restriction of daily calorie intake in both diet zzso 

Mediterranean diets appear to be more effective than low-fat diets in inducing clinically relevant long-term changes in cardiovascular risk factors and inflammatory zzso
