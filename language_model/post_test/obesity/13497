zzso zzso 1 zzso is the zzso zzso in zzso fatty acid zzso It is imperative for the assembly of zzso zzso which transport zzso zzso from liver to zzso tissue and other zzso We aimed to determine the role of zzso zzso activity in human zzso and zzso zzso 

We studied 54 people participating in a lifestyle intervention zzso with diet modification and increased physical zzso zzso sensitivity was determined during a zzso clamp and estimated from an zzso Liver fat was zzso by zzso resonance zzso at baseline and after 9 months of zzso The pattern of fatty acids in serum zzso was determined by zzso followed by thin layer and gas zzso with the zzso zzso zzso ratio providing an index of zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso activity index correlated zzso with liver fat zzso zzso zzso and positively with insulin sensitivity, both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These correlations depended on overall zzso They were absent in zzso participants zzso liver zzso zzso insulin sensitivity zzso zzso insulin sensitivity zzso zzso but were strong in obese individuals zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, during intervention a high zzso activity index at baseline predicted a decrease in liver fat only in obese participants zzso zzso zzso 

Our data suggest that high zzso zzso activity may regulate fat zzso in the liver and possibly protects from insulin resistance in zzso
