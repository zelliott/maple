The zzso properties of cardiac muscle in zzso mouse zzso referred to as zzso zzso an animal model of human zzso diabetes zzso were investigated, and the findings compared with those obtained from a zzso control mouse zzso zzso referred to as B6 zzso The ages of the B6 mice were zzso zzso zzso weeks zzso zzso 24) and those of the zzso mice used were zzso zzso zzso weeks zzso zzso zzso The zzso mice had mild zzso zzso and zzso zzso muscles from both mice were examined by light zzso zzso zzso zzso and filament disorder in the zzso muscles were found only in the zzso zzso The resting membrane potential of the zzso muscle was less negative in the zzso mice than in the control zzso The maximum rate of rise in the zzso of the action potential was significantly decreased in the zzso mice compared with that of the control zzso These suggest a decrease in a zzso zzso current zzso in the zzso zzso The duration of the action potential zzso at all levels of zzso was significantly longer in the zzso mice than in the B6 zzso A blocker of transient outward current zzso zzso significantly prolonged the zzso of the B6 mice, but failed to prolong it in the zzso mice, suggesting that Ito in the diabetic mice is very zzso A zzso channel blocker, zzso dramatically zzso all levels of zzso in both groups, suggesting that there is no difference between B6 mice and zzso mice in zzso zzso current via zzso zzso These suggest the malfunction or zzso of zzso channels which zzso at least Ito and zzso in diabetic zzso
