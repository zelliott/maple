The inability of the zzso to meet the demand for insulin brought about by insulin resistance leads to type 2 zzso In adults, zzso replication is one of the mechanisms thought to cause the expansion of zzso zzso Efforts to treat diabetes require knowledge of the pathways that drive zzso zzso proliferation in zzso A robust zzso stimulus of zzso expansion is pregnancy and identifying the mechanisms underlying this stimulus may provide therapeutic leads for the treatment of type 2 zzso The peak in zzso proliferation during pregnancy occurs on d zzso of gestation in zzso Using advanced zzso approaches, we globally characterize the gene expression signature of pancreatic zzso on d zzso of gestation during zzso We identify a total of 1907 genes as zzso expressed in the zzso during zzso The zzso ability to compensate for relative insulin zzso during zzso stress is associated with the induction of both zzso and survival zzso A comparison of the genes induced in three different models of zzso expansion suggests that diverse mechanisms can be recruited to expand zzso zzso The identification of many novel genes involved in zzso expansion during pregnancy provides an important resource for diabetes researchers to further investigate how these factors contribute to the maintenance of not only zzso mass, but ultimately zzso zzso
