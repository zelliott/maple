The relationship between zzso body weight and zzso outcome has only recently been identified using a single, indirect measure of weight zzso ideal body weight zzso The literature is zzso regarding which index is the better indicator of body zzso The purpose of this study was to determine zzso if zzso transplant body weight, measured by body mass index zzso and zzso is associated with zzso transplant morbidity and mortality and zzso if patient zzso age, and zzso of heart disease affect this zzso 

The sample included zzso patients who received a heart transplant from January 1, zzso 31, 1995 at 38 institutions participating in the zzso zzso Research Database zzso Patients were divided into groups according to their zzso and zzso Data were described using zzso measures of central zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso analyses and log rank tests for zzso and a multivariable risk factor analysis in the hazard zzso 

For all patients zzso zzso zzso being zzso zzso of zzso before heart transplant was a risk factor for increased mortality after heart zzso The association between zzso transplant zzso and zzso transplant survival was affected by zzso age, and zzso of heart zzso In zzso a higher zzso was a significant risk factor for death early after transplant zzso zzso zzso Although not zzso there was a trend for a higher zzso being a risk factor for death in females throughout the post transplant period zzso zzso zzso No differences in cause of death were found for zzso and zzso In male and female recipients zzso years, being overweight zzso transplant was a risk factor for zzso In patients with zzso zzso heart disease, the greatest risk for infection was found in patients who zzso of zzso zzso transplant zzso and zzso were not associated with acute rejection or cardiac zzso zzso after zzso 

In conclusion, being zzso or obese preoperatively is associated with decreased survival in all patients after heart zzso Being obese preoperatively is associated with increased infection after heart transplant in males and females zzso years and in patients with zzso heart zzso Of the 2 zzso of body weight used in this study, percent ideal body weight appears to be the better predictor of future morbidity and mortality following heart zzso
