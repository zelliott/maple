We have studied zzso binding and insulin dose response relationships of zzso transport conversion of zzso to CO2 and total zzso and zzso at 37 degrees C and pH zzso in zzso from obese patients before zzso zzso zzso and after zzso for 10 days zzso zzso zzso Studies of zzso from obese before zzso showed a significant reduction of insulin binding when expressed to cell surface area and rightward shifts of the insulin dose response zzso zzso insulin zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The decreased insulin sensitivity of zzso from obese was most likely the functional consequence of the impaired insulin zzso Moreover, decreased zzso zzso transport capacities were present in rat cells from obese both in the zzso and zzso insulin zzso zzso Similarly, the percentage response above zzso level to zzso insulin stimulation of zzso zzso and zzso was impaired to these zzso The latter findings suggest post zzso defects localized both to the transport system per zzso and to zzso mechanisms involved in the metabolism of zzso zzso the post zzso pathways for the insulin induced zzso was intact in fat cells from obese zzso Studies after zzso showed an increase of zzso insulin binding accompanied by an increased sensitivity to the zzso effect of insulin with unchanged zzso zzso However, due to marked post zzso zzso the insulin zzso zzso zzso was severely zzso Thus, the zzso transport system of zzso from all zzso subjects was totally unresponsive to insulin, while some of the zzso patients had a slight response of zzso zzso and zzso in the presence of insulin in zzso effective zzso
