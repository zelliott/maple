In this prospective study 246 women with zzso diabetes were followed up to determine the characteristics of zzso control associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso meters were used for zzso blood zzso Ambulatory zzso profiles were produced to characterize zzso control levels throughout zzso With these novel approaches to the collection and representation of zzso data, the severity of zzso intolerance zzso was found to be associated with both maternal and zzso morbidity in terms of infant size and zzso section zzso By use of zzso cluster analysis to identify three groups on the basis of control levels zzso less than 87 zzso mid 87 to 105 zzso high greater than 105 zzso we were able to show a positive outcome in the low group with reduced rates of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we showed that as mean blood zzso levels and instability in zzso control increased from group to group, zzso of zzso and zzso infants zzso Whereas obesity increased the relative risk of adverse zzso outcome, type of treatment zzso versus zzso did not appear to be zzso zzso monitored toward stability within a narrow range to achieve tight zzso control, ambulatory zzso in pregnancy is associated with a decreased risk of maternal and fetal zzso
