Human obesity is a main cause of morbidity and zzso Recently, several studies have demonstrated an association between the zzso gene locus and early onset and severe zzso To date, the zzso gene has only been discovered in zzso We identified zzso zzso in the complete zzso sequences of various evolutionary diverse marine zzso algae, ranging from zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso However, zzso zzso appear to be absent from all other completely zzso zzso of plants, zzso and zzso zzso Although the biological roles of these marine zzso zzso zzso are still unknown, these genes will be useful for exploring basic protein features and could hence help unravel the function of the zzso gene in zzso and its zzso link with obesity in zzso
