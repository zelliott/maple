Increased dietary sodium intake has been associated with an increase in blood pressure as well as a decrease in zzso zzso disposal in young healthy zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether dietary sodium intake is associated with changes in oral zzso zzso insulin sensitivity, and blood pressure in older, zzso overweight zzso Eight older zzso zzso zzso years, mean zzso zzso overweight zzso zzso zzso body zzso mildly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso patients with a zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso were studied after 2 weeks on low (3 zzso and 2 weeks on high (10 zzso sodium zzso To examine zzso metabolism we performed a 2 h oral zzso tolerance test and a zzso zzso and 600 zzso zzso clamp at the end of each sodium zzso High sodium intake was associated with a significantly greater urinary sodium zzso zzso zzso 45 zzso v 112 zzso 21 zzso P zzso The increase in dietary sodium from low to high did not result in significant differences in zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso v zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso or insulin zzso zzso zzso v zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso levels or in the zzso zzso zzso zzso v zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and insulin zzso zzso zzso v zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso areas determined during the oral zzso tolerance zzso Similarly, there was no effect of dietary sodium on zzso zzso disposal at low zzso zzso zzso v zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso or high zzso zzso zzso v zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso insulin infusion zzso Our findings suggest that, in insulin resistant zzso increased dietary sodium does not affect either zzso or insulin responses during an oral zzso tolerance test or zzso disposal during a zzso zzso zzso
