zzso was originally reported as an zzso zzso hormone that provided a link between obesity and zzso zzso protein level was elevated in obese mice and decreased by zzso zzso zzso of zzso improved insulin sensitivity in zzso obese mice, while the administration of zzso zzso induced insulin zzso More recently, we have shown that zzso of the zzso gene in mice decreased zzso zzso through impairment of zzso while zzso treatment in these knockout mice increased zzso zzso zzso However, the link between zzso and zzso zzso has been questioned by studies demonstrating reduced, rather than increased, zzso zzso expression in obese and diabetic zzso To better understand the regulation of zzso we developed a sensitive and specific zzso zzso that could accurately measure serum zzso levels in several mouse zzso We show that while zzso zzso is indeed suppressed in obese mice, the circulating zzso level is significantly elevated and positively correlated with insulin, zzso and zzso Both zzso zzso expression and protein levels in zzso mice are suppressed by zzso treatment in parallel with reductions in zzso and zzso In zzso mice, serum zzso increases after nocturnal zzso zzso with rising levels of zzso zzso zzso and protein levels decline in parallel with zzso and insulin during zzso and are restored after zzso We performed clamp studies to determine whether zzso is zzso related to insulin and zzso zzso zzso expression and serum zzso increased in response to zzso and further in response to zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that the nutritional regulation of zzso and changes in zzso gene expression and circulating levels in obesity are zzso at least in part, through insulin and zzso
