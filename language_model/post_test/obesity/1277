The aim of this work was to assess the specific food type zzso zzso high fat, high zzso preference profiles of individuals with zzso syndrome zzso obese controls and normal weight zzso 

zzso tasted a food predominantly high in zzso a food predominantly high in protein and a food predominantly high in fat over repeated trials and indicated their most zzso second preferred and least preferred zzso zzso items tested on a given trial were zzso in a block zzso zzso 

These were 12 individuals with zzso syndrome, 12 matched obese controls zzso but otherwise zzso and 14 normal weight zzso 

The basic data were expressed as a proportion of each food type selected as most preferred over the total 27 zzso 

zzso subjects preferred high zzso foods over high protein foods and high protein foods over high fat zzso These subjects demonstrated a statistically reliable difference in preference for high zzso foods over high fat zzso However, normal weight and obese control subjects demonstrated no difference in food zzso The only significant zzso comparisons were between zzso subjects and obese controls, with the zzso group showing a significantly greater preference for high zzso foods than obese zzso 

The obesity of zzso was shown to have a significant and distinctly different food preference profile from normal weight and obese zzso The differences in food preference between the obese zzso and zzso subjects is in zzso with the growing recognition of functional zzso within the obese population, that may have not only differing underlying zzso but also distinct behavioral profiles of zzso
