The aim of this study was to test the hypothesized structural paths in zzso zzso theory zzso model on adolescent girls' physical activity following a 12-month physical activity and dietary intervention to prevent zzso 

We conducted a 12-month follow-up study of 235 adolescent girls zzso zzso zzso years, zzso zzso zzso from 12 secondary schools located in low-income zzso At zzso participants completed zzso scales related to physical activity zzso zzso zzso parental support, and outcome zzso At baseline and 12-month follow-up zzso participants wore zzso for 7 zzso zzso equation modeling was used to determine if Time 1 measures predicted physical activity at 12-month follow-up after adjusting for baseline zzso 

The model explained zzso and zzso of the zzso in physical activity and zzso zzso Model fit indexes indicated the data were a good fit to the zzso however, only zzso was associated with physical activity at 12 zzso There was no support for intention or outcome expectations as zzso zzso of zzso zzso was associated with outcome expectations and parental zzso however, only outcome expectations predicted zzso 

Current findings indicate a large proportion of the zzso for physical activity and intention remains unexplained and that the proposed pathways in the zzso model were not fully zzso Future model testing may need to consider zzso or integration of theoretical models, which may include ecological components if we are to advance our understanding of physical activity behavior in this zzso of the adolescent zzso
