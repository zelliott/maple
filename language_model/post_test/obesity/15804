The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of the zzso zzso zzso and to test its association to cardiovascular risk factors in type 2 diabetes zzso zzso zzso 

A total of 103 unrelated Caucasians from zzso including 71 zzso patients without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso years, with a mean body mass index zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and 32 zzso patients who suffered from coronary heart disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso years, with a mean zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso for zzso zzso using a zzso separated zzso zzso 

The prevalence of the zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher in zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso and control zzso zzso groups, since it was found in 10 zzso zzso patients, 13 zzso zzso patients and 10 zzso control zzso When the association of zzso zzso zzso and the risk of suffering from zzso were assessed within the zzso group in a zzso zzso zzso model adjusting for age and sex, zzso zzso zzso carriers had a zzso lower risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso for developing zzso compared to subjects who exhibited zzso zzso 

The prevalence of the zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher in type 2 diabetic patients who suffered from zzso compared to type 2 diabetic patients without zzso However, after a zzso zzso zzso model analysis, adjusting for age and zzso zzso zzso zzso carriers had a zzso lower risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso for developing zzso compared to subjects who exhibited zzso zzso Since these data were zzso the potential patient selection and survival bias, as well as community zzso of zzso and zzso could most likely substantially underestimate the genetic zzso
