Recently, the zzso zzso gene zzso was reported to be associated with type 1 zzso In the present report, we calculated that the reported zzso of the two zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were not in zzso equilibrium zzso We therefore investigated the association of the zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso type 1 diabetic Caucasian zzso collection zzso case and zzso control subjects tested at zzso and zzso case and zzso control subjects tested at zzso as well as a type 1 diabetic Caucasian collection comprised of families of European ancestry zzso families tested at zzso and zzso families tested at zzso No evidence for association with type 1 diabetes was found, including for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso To evaluate whether common variation elsewhere in the gene was associated with disease zzso we analyzed eight zzso tag zzso in a type 1 diabetic zzso collection zzso case and zzso control zzso No evidence for association was obtained zzso zzso zzso We conclude that common zzso variation in zzso is unlikely to contribute substantially to type 1 diabetes zzso in the populations tested and recommend routine application of tests for zzso in zzso studies for genetic zzso
