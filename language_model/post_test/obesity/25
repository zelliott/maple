The activities of zzso zzso are known to be responsive to changes in the dietary intake of carbohydrates in the adult zzso Little is known, however, regarding the activities of these zzso in obese subjects and how they are affected by differing zzso zzso To evaluate the effect of zzso intake on the activity of zzso zzso in zzso we used the genetically obese mouse zzso zzso as an experimental zzso zzso an example of zzso obesity and zzso diabetes, this animal is characteristically zzso and zzso Groups of obese mice and lean zzso were fed for 7 weeks equal amounts of either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities were measured on zzso zzso from the zzso and middle portions of the zzso zzso and lower zzso zzso were expressed as activity per tissue protein as well as total zzso zzso mice were found to have consistently greater total activity of both zzso and zzso than their lean zzso mostly as a result of increased zzso zzso Total zzso activity, however, was similar in the upper zzso in both obese and lean mice, largely related to a decreased specific activity in obese zzso All mice fed the zzso diet had significantly increased total activity of all zzso studied when compared to the zzso animals, except for the zzso activity in the lower zzso where no differences were found in either zzso zzso in activity related to high zzso intake were a result of increases in specific zzso
