A major contributor to mortality zzso with schizophrenia or zzso disorder is cardiovascular disease, an important risk factor for which is the cluster of clinical abnormalities that define the zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso zzso impaired zzso zzso 

The aim of this article was to examine the effects of switching from the antipsychotic zzso to zzso on the prevalence of the zzso syndrome in high-risk overweight or obese patients with schizophrenia or zzso zzso 

This post hoc analysis was based on data from a previous zzso zzso zzso (19 US zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso overweight or obese zzso mass index zzso zzso patients aged 18 to 65 years with schizophrenia or zzso disorder whose treatment was switched from zzso to zzso were zzso Patients who entered the phase 1 switch from zzso to zzso (6 weeks) and the phase 2 extension zzso weeks) were included in the zzso The primary end point was the difference from baseline in the prevalence of the zzso syndrome at week 20, determined using zzso of weight, zzso waist zzso and zzso and zzso blood pressure zzso 

zzso assessments for the zzso syndrome were available from 121 of 123 patients recruited for phase 1 of the study zzso men, 60 zzso mean zzso age, zzso zzso years; mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 71 patients entered phase 2 (29 men, 42 zzso mean zzso age, zzso zzso years; mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of whom 39 zzso zzso diagnosed with zzso and 32 zzso with zzso zzso The zzso syndrome was identified in 63 zzso patients at study zzso In the 71 patients with data available from baseline and week 20 zzso the last observation carried forward zzso the prevalence of the zzso syndrome was reduced from 38 zzso patients at baseline to 26 zzso at study end zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso improvements at study end were seen in mean weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso waist circumference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no significant difference in the reduction in the prevalence of the zzso syndrome between patients who did or did not receive the behavioral therapy for weight zzso 

In this post hoc analysis of switching from the antipsychotic zzso to zzso on the prevalence of the zzso syndrome in high-risk overweight or obese patients with schizophrenia or zzso disorder, the zzso syndrome was highly prevalent at zzso Switching from zzso pine to zzso was associated with a significant reduction in this zzso
