Diabetes and obesity are epidemic in the zzso Indians of the zzso United States, and the prevalence of diabetes is zzso The most likely link between obesity and diabetes is tissue insulin zzso If obesity is defined as an excess of body fat, then it can only be accurately assessed by zzso of body composition and not by approximations such as body mass index or percent of ideal zzso To compare the zzso data of individuals of varying size, an accurate measure of zzso size is zzso Total body weight is not an appropriate means of comparing individuals since obese subjects have a greater proportion of zzso mass zzso Body surface area shows a sex difference, and this may distort data if both sexes are zzso From studies of zzso rate we have determined that zzso rate is directly zzso to the zzso mass plus 18 zzso and we suggest that this weight can be zzso with zzso zzso zzso storage in skeletal muscle appears to be important in the disposal of an intravenous zzso zzso zzso with its role in zzso storage, zzso zzso zzso is activated in proportion to the ability to dispose of zzso during a zzso zzso zzso The role of zzso zzso is most notable at zzso plasma insulin zzso and since zzso zzso at these insulin zzso is highly familial independent of the degree of zzso we suggest that there may be a specific genetic zzso expressed in skeletal muscle that reduces insulin responsiveness in some zzso The lack of correlation between 24 hour respiratory zzso measured in a zzso chamber (a measure of the proportion of fat derived zzso and degree of obesity indicates that in obese zzso Indians insulin resistance is not due to an zzso of zzso metabolism by free fatty acids zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with an increase in zzso mass almost zzso for zzso with fat mass when compared to the lean zzso A role for this increase in zzso tissue in producing insulin resistance has been given insufficient attention in the zzso With an increase in zzso mass, muscle cells are zzso and zzso in muscle are more widely zzso We propose that these zzso changes in muscle zzso at least in part, the effects of obesity to produce a reduction in insulin sensitivity and the abnormal zzso of insulin action found in the zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
