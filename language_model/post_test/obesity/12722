To assess the effects of obesity on pulmonary function, 46 healthy subjects exhibiting various degrees of obesity underwent lung function zzso zzso were divided into three groups according to body mass index zzso 13 had minimal obesity zzso 25 to 29 zzso group zzso 24 had a zzso in the 30 to 40 range zzso zzso and 9 displayed to zzso obesity zzso 40, group zzso Respiratory resistance was estimated by the forced random noise zzso technique and airway resistance was determined by body zzso Lung volumes and zzso flows were also determined and significant negative correlations with zzso were zzso zzso flows diminished in proportion to lung volumes, and the ratio of forced zzso volume in 1 s to forced vital capacity was within normal zzso Although zzso flows did not suggest zzso zzso both respiratory resistance and airway resistance rose significantly with the level of obesity zzso zzso and p zzso respectively), from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, in group 1, to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, in group zzso zzso of the factors responsible for this increased resistance disclosed a significant linear correlation between airway zzso and functional residual capacity zzso zzso zzso p zzso but specific airway zzso was found to be independent of the degree of zzso The difference between respiratory resistance and airway resistance did not widen significantly according to the level of zzso suggesting that chest wall resistance was not a factor enhancing these zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that in addition to the elastic load, obese subjects have to overcome increased respiratory resistance resulting from the reduction in lung volumes related to being zzso
