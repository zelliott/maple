Recent studies have suggested that zzso a plasma protein zzso by zzso may play a role in zzso In this study, we tested the hypothesis that zzso contributes to in zzso zzso dysfunction in obese zzso A zzso comparison of plasma zzso soluble zzso zzso and soluble vascular zzso zzso zzso was carried out in 35 obese women (age zzso selected with a body mass index zzso or zzso and 25 normal weight women (age zzso zzso zzso An additional study was conducted to determine the short-term effects of weight loss induced by caloric zzso Plasma levels of zzso zzso and zzso were measured before and after weight zzso zzso women had higher levels of zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso and zzso zzso versus zzso zzso than non-obese zzso zzso and zzso zzso had a positive correlation with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso waist circumference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At multiple zzso analysis zzso predicted zzso and zzso independently of obesity measures and other zzso zzso obese patients who completed the program of weight reduction showed a significant decrease in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The magnitude of decrease of zzso and zzso was related to the magnitude of reduction in zzso zzso zzso our results show that obesity is associated with enhanced levels of zzso zzso These abnormalities are related to abdominal obesity possibly zzso by zzso levels, and are zzso with weight zzso
