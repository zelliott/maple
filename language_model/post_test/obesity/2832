zzso resistance is a characteristic feature of both obesity and zzso diabetes zzso In general, the causes of insulin resistance can be placed into three zzso zzso abnormal beta cell zzso products, zzso circulating insulin antagonists, and zzso target tissue defects in insulin zzso In obesity and in zzso diabetes zzso the cause of the insulin resistance resides at the level of the target zzso However, the specific mechanisms underlying these zzso states are zzso zzso of insulin resistance can be evaluated by constructing in zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso clamp zzso If zzso zzso are shifted to the right with no impairment in zzso insulin action, then this is termed a decrease in zzso zzso and is consistent with a pure zzso in insulin zzso If a decrease in zzso insulin action exists, then this is termed a decrease in zzso zzso and is consistent with a zzso zzso in insulin zzso In obese patients, cellular insulin receptors are decreased and the magnitude of this decrease is zzso related to the degree of zzso In those patients with only moderate zzso the insulin resistance is not zzso In these patients, the in zzso zzso curve between plasma insulin levels and zzso disposal demonstrates a rightward shift with no change in zzso insulin zzso Thus, in this situation, insulin resistance is due to decreased insulin receptors zzso In obese patients with more severe insulin resistance, decreased zzso insulin responsiveness is also seen indicating a combined zzso and zzso zzso In patients with zzso diabetes zzso the same phenomenon is zzso zzso those patients with mild insulin resistance have decreased insulin sensitivity due to decreased insulin receptors whereas those with severe insulin resistance have decreased insulin sensitivity and decreased insulin responsiveness due to a combined zzso and zzso zzso When the spectrum of patients is zzso a zzso of defects zzso In patients with mild insulin resistance, decreased insulin receptors are the only zzso in patients with severe insulin resistance, decreased numbers of insulin receptors and the zzso zzso in insulin action zzso but the zzso zzso is the zzso zzso Between these extremes the relative roles of zzso defects and zzso defects vary, but the general trend is that as insulin resistance zzso the zzso zzso becomes more zzso
