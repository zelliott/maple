The current worldwide increase of zzso defined as impaired zzso zzso or impaired zzso tolerance and type 2 diabetes zzso zzso zzso the increase of zzso However, it is unclear that which children have an increased risk and should be screened for zzso 

We studied zzso overweight children and adolescents to identify risk factors for zzso A risk score for zzso was calculated using zzso zzso This score was examined in a second, independent cohort of zzso overweight children and zzso History of zzso in parents and grandparents, degree of overweight, age, zzso stage, birth weight, hypertension, zzso zzso zzso and abdominal obesity were considered as potential risk zzso 

The frequency of zzso was zzso in sample 1 and zzso in sample zzso The strongest association was observed for history of parental diabetes with an adjusted odds ratio zzso of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso in sample 1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso in sample 2, followed by zzso stage with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in sample 1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso in sample 2, and by extreme obesity with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in sample 1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso in sample zzso 

The main risk factors for zzso were parental diabetes, zzso stage, and extreme zzso zzso for zzso seems meaningful in subjects with either a parental history of diabetes or a combination of extreme obesity and zzso stage and detected nearly zzso of the overweight children and adolescents with zzso
