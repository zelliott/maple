In recent years, there has been increasing focus on zzso function in pediatric obese zzso Our aims were to investigate whether there is an association between serum zzso hormone zzso within the normal range and body mass index zzso and to determine if zzso levels correlate with zzso risk factors in zzso 

A retrospective zzso analysis was carried out on zzso zzso zzso and zzso lean, overweight, or obese zzso zzso zzso blood pressure, zzso blood zzso zzso zzso zzso profiles, zzso free zzso zzso and free zzso zzso were assessed from medical records and compared among zzso zzso with known presence of diabetes, using medications altering blood pressure and zzso or zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso or with zzso zzso disease were zzso 

zzso zzso and elevated levels of zzso zzso were found to be more common in overweight and obese children zzso and those zzso changes were significantly correlated with the increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso within the normal range were higher in overweight and obese children zzso and zzso was positively correlated with total cholesterol, zzso and zzso blood pressure zzso 

Our findings suggest that obese children have higher serum zzso and zzso levels even within the normal range, and that an increase in zzso is associated with zzso and higher zzso blood zzso It remains to be seen whether zzso might serve as a potential marker of zzso risk factors in obese pediatric zzso
