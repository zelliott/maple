The relationship between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and skeletal muscle insulin resistance is complex and zzso We examined the effect of a short-term zzso zzso index zzso diet and zzso exercise training intervention zzso on zzso and insulin sensitivity in older, zzso zzso Participants zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso 33 zzso 1 zzso were randomly assigned to a zzso controlled feeding trial zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso 7) or high zzso zzso zzso zzso 8) zzso zzso combined with supervised exercise zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity was determined via 40 zzso zzso zzso clamp and zzso zzso and zzso content was assessed by zzso zzso with correction for fiber zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso after both interventions with no interaction effect of diet zzso zzso insulin sensitivity increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was reduced by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso of time), P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although both interventions increased zzso content, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso diet composition did not significantly effect the zzso However, the zzso group showed a robust increase in the zzso ratio compared with the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso group also demonstrated greater reductions in zzso than the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Changes in muscle lipids and insulin sensitivity were not zzso however, the change in zzso was zzso associated with the change in zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso These data suggest that increases in the zzso pool following a low zzso diet and exercise intervention may represent zzso zzso from zzso The lower systemic zzso levels that prevail while eating a low zzso diet may promote zzso of zzso stores in the zzso
