In order to examine the contribution of the skeletal muscles to insulin resistance in zzso fatty zzso or lean zzso rats were functionally zzso by an zzso zzso zzso zzso adjusted to produce plasma levels of about 500 zzso zzso were given IV zzso and during the next four hours the zzso and zzso of zzso by peripheral zzso zzso was estimated from the rate of fall in the plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso rats was similar to that in the lean, despite plasma insulin levels that were ten times zzso Furthermore, a marked reduction in zzso was revealed when plasma insulin in the zzso rats was zzso (by waiting one hour after zzso before the zzso load was zzso zzso zzso was resistant to insulin over a range of zzso plasma insulin zzso indicating a shift to the right of the zzso zzso The zzso response in the fatty rats was markedly depressed compared with that in the lean rats, and even large doses of insulin (up to 1000 zzso zzso failed to restore zzso The results suggest that the skeletal muscles isolated by zzso from zzso zzso rats are less responsive as well as sensitive to insulin than the muscles of lean rats and that the muscles contribute significantly to the insulin resistance found in intact obese zzso
