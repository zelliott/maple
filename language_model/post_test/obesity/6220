We put 12 obese subjects on a zzso diet zzso and observed how their weight loss affected their zzso zzso Seven had zzso diabetes and five did zzso They consumed 1000 zzso for at least 1 week, then zzso zzso for 4 weeks, and 1000 zzso zzso zzso improved zzso tolerance and insulin response to a zzso load in the diabetics and did not affect these parameters in the zzso It did not change insulin responsiveness to intravenous zzso in either zzso Both groups showed improved insulin resistance, as measured by an insulin suppression zzso zzso analysis showed that insulin resistance zzso well with obesity and zzso zzso Weight reduction did not change zzso insulin zzso Thus, the improvement in zzso tolerance by some of the diabetics seems to have arisen from improvements in their insulin resistance and insulin response to a zzso zzso zzso resistance improved because of weight reduction and subsequent improvements in zzso zzso
