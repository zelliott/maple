zzso breathing zzso and sleep zzso have been linked to hypertension in previous studies, but most of these studies used surrogate information to define zzso zzso zzso and were based on small clinic zzso or zzso 

To assess the association between zzso and hypertension in a large cohort of middle-aged and older zzso 

zzso analyses of participants in the Sleep Heart Health zzso a community-based zzso study conducted between November 1995 and January zzso 

A total of zzso subjects recruited from ongoing zzso studies zzso or zzso 40 years; zzso zzso 

zzso index zzso the average number of zzso plus zzso per hour of sleep, with zzso defined as a zzso of zzso and zzso defined as zzso or zzso zzso reduction in zzso or zzso excursion both of which are accompanied by zzso or zzso zzso drop in zzso zzso zzso obtained by unattended home zzso Other measures include zzso zzso percentage of sleep time below zzso oxygen zzso history of zzso and presence of hypertension, defined as resting blood pressure of at least zzso zzso zzso or use of zzso zzso 

Mean zzso and zzso blood pressure and prevalence of hypertension increased significantly with increasing zzso measures, although some of this association was explained by body mass index zzso After adjusting for demographics and zzso variables (including zzso neck zzso and zzso zzso as well as for alcohol intake and smoking, the odds ratio for hypertension, comparing the highest category of zzso zzso or zzso 30 per zzso with the lowest category zzso per hour), was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso P for trend zzso zzso The corresponding estimate comparing the highest and lowest categories of percentage of sleep time below zzso oxygen zzso zzso or zzso zzso vs zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso P for trend zzso In zzso zzso associations of hypertension with either measure of zzso were seen in both zzso older and younger ages, all ethnic groups, and among zzso and overweight zzso zzso and zzso associations were observed for the zzso index or zzso history of habitual zzso 

Our findings from the largest zzso study to date indicate that zzso is associated with systemic hypertension in middle-aged and older individuals of different sexes and ethnic zzso
