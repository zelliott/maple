To investigate whether or not reduction of zzso volume during weight loss is related to zzso and urinary zzso zzso in obese zzso 

98 obese and 31 non-obese women zzso admitted to the zzso and metabolism zzso clinic of the School of Medicine, zzso University were included in the zzso zzso volume, zzso function tests, zzso and zzso levels, and urinary zzso zzso were measured at baseline and six months after treatment for zzso 

zzso volume increased in obese women zzso zzso zzso After adjustment for body mass index, there were no significant differences in plasma zzso and serum zzso levels between obese and non-obese women zzso zzso zzso volume correlated positively with body mass index zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso levels, while there was a negative correlation between zzso volume and urinary zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and urinary zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso in obese zzso Changes in body mass index zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels zzso zzso zzso were the only factors that significantly affected the change of zzso volume during weight zzso 

zzso status may play an important role in increased zzso volume in obese zzso however, zzso status did not seem to exert a significant influence on the changes in zzso zzso On the other hand, changes in both body mass index and plasma zzso levels seemed to be important for changes in zzso zzso
