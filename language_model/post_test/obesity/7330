zzso resistance is a major factor in the zzso of type 2 diabetes and zzso the strong association between obesity and zzso Paradoxically, the zzso consequences of having zzso zzso fat zzso are remarkably similar to those of having zzso zzso fat zzso a finding that has generated considerable interest in a rare zzso In both cases, excess energy accumulates as zzso in zzso sites such as the liver zzso zzso and skeletal muscle, where it plays a central role in the zzso of insulin resistance, zzso and type 2 zzso Human zzso are zzso by a total or partial zzso of body fat, and may be inherited or acquired in zzso zzso engineered mice with zzso zzso manifest many of the features of the human disorder, including zzso fatty liver, zzso insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, providing a useful zzso model of the human zzso zzso zzso which causes similar, albeit zzso zzso problems in humans has been more difficult to mimic in the zzso This review discusses key zzso studies in mice with zzso zzso including fat transplantation and the use of zzso zzso replacement zzso These studies have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the underlying molecular zzso of zzso zzso zzso and insulin resistance, and have prompted the initiation and subsequent adoption of zzso replacement therapy in human zzso This review also considers the possible reasons for the apparent difficulties in generating mouse models of partial zzso such as zzso differences in the distribution of fat zzso and the apparent lack of sexual zzso in fat mass and distribution in mice compared with the dramatic differences present in adult zzso
