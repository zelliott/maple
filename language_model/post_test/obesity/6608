The absolute zzso risk zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso was based on three major, independent zzso risk factors: hypertension, zzso zzso zzso and severe pathological score at zzso We zzso in our prospective regional cohort of zzso the impact of body mass index zzso on the ultimate outcome in light of this zzso zzso 

We had information on 331 zzso patients zzso zzso At diagnosis, the zzso was normal zzso zzso in 195 and elevated zzso in 136 zzso with 102 overweight zzso and 34 obese zzso defining two groups, normal zzso and elevated zzso subsequently zzso 

At diagnosis, in the zzso group, hypertension and zzso zzso zzso were more frequent zzso P zzso and P zzso zzso and the mean global optical score was increased zzso zzso zzso This resulted in a worse zzso scoring distribution zzso zzso In addition, these patients with an elevated zzso were zzso years older zzso zzso including more obese women and with an zzso already lower zzso zzso zzso At last zzso in the zzso group, progression remained worse with greater prevalence of zzso zzso versus zzso P zzso and zzso events zzso versus zzso zzso survival and Cox zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso remained a powerful independent risk factor for prediction of events, but not zzso 

zzso patients with an elevated zzso at diagnosis had a significantly worse presentation and worse final zzso zzso increased hypertension frequency, zzso level and some zzso zzso all of which translate into a worse zzso for prediction of zzso or dialysis alone or zzso with no apparent direct effect of zzso per zzso
