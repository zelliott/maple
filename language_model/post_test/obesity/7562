zzso tissue is a highly dynamic zzso organ, zzso a number of zzso substances zzso regulating insulin sensitivity, energy metabolism and vascular zzso zzso zzso tissue is a key zzso that links obesity with insulin resistance, hypertension and cardiovascular zzso zzso zzso tissue is characterized by zzso zzso and zzso of inflammatory zzso and zzso leading to the zzso production of zzso zzso and zzso that induce zzso dysfunction and vascular inflammation through their zzso and zzso zzso By contrast, the zzso of zzso an zzso with insulin zzso and zzso activities, is decreased in obesity and its related zzso Emerging evidence suggests that zzso is protective against vascular dysfunction induced by obesity and diabetes, through its multiple zzso effects on zzso and zzso metabolism as well as on vascular zzso zzso improves insulin sensitivity and zzso profiles, thus reducing the classical risk factors for cardiovascular zzso Furthermore, zzso protects the zzso through its zzso actions on zzso cells, zzso zzso cells, smooth muscle cells and zzso Data from both animal and human investigations demonstrate that zzso is an important component of the zzso axis that mediates the zzso between zzso tissue and zzso This review highlights recent work on the vascular protective activities of zzso and discusses the molecular pathways underlying the vascular actions of this zzso
