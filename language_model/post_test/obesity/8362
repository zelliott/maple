To assess the estimated zzso disposal rate zzso insulin dose, and zzso profile in children with type 1 diabetes zzso zzso and overweight or obesity as compared to children with zzso and normal zzso 

A total of 115 patients zzso zzso zzso with zzso on intensive insulin therapy were zzso The following parameters were zzso weight, zzso body mass index, waist and hip zzso insulin dose, zzso zzso zzso blood pressure, and zzso zzso zzso were zzso by sex and zzso
