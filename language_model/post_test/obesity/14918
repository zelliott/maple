zzso and education are among the strongest social zzso of body mass index zzso throughout the life course, yet we know relatively little about how these social factors both independently and zzso contribute to the rate at which zzso changes from adolescence to zzso The purpose of this study is to zzso examine variation in zzso of zzso from adolescence to zzso by zzso and zzso education and zzso determine if the effects of zzso and zzso education on zzso zzso differ by zzso and zzso 

We used nationally representative data from the National zzso zzso of zzso Our sample included white zzso black zzso and Hispanic zzso zzso zzso height and weight were collected on 16 occasions from 1981 to zzso We employed zzso linear growth models to specify zzso zzso 

zzso education was zzso associated with zzso and zzso change among zzso Among men, zzso education was zzso associated with zzso these educational disparities persisted for zzso diminished for blacks, and widened for zzso zzso education was zzso associated with zzso among women, but was positively associated with the rate of zzso change among black zzso zzso education was zzso associated with zzso among white and Hispanic men, and positively associated with zzso among black zzso These educational disparities widened for White and Black men, but narrowed for Hispanic zzso 

Our results suggest that by simultaneously considering multiple sources of stratification, we can more fully understand how the unequal distribution of advantages or disadvantages across social groups affects zzso across the life zzso
