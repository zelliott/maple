zzso of a palatable diet can induce zzso leading to weight gain zzso zzso and insulin resistance in zzso zzso zzso can also induce zzso in rats but zzso have an zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate whether preventing zzso zzso zzso energy zzso in dietary obese zzso rats would enhance the zzso effects of treatment at a therapeutic zzso and, within this zzso to produce an original survey of candidate zzso targets in the clinically relevant visceral white zzso tissue zzso zzso 

zzso rats that were either freely fed or energy restricted zzso zzso to the level of zzso zzso were treated with zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso for 2 weeks, the restricted group controlling for zzso zzso and weight zzso The outcome measures were circulating zzso of various zzso markers of insulin resistance, and gene expression was measured in zzso zzso 

In both freely fed and zzso groups, compared to zzso zzso controls, zzso reduced plasma levels of insulin zzso and zzso p zzso and p zzso respectively), free fatty acids zzso zzso and zzso p zzso and p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso both p zzso reflected in improved insulin sensitivity, as measured by zzso model assessment zzso and zzso p zzso and p zzso zzso also increased the expression of the fatty acid zzso zzso fatty acid transport protein zzso zzso fatty zzso protein zzso zzso heart zzso zzso and fatty acid zzso zzso all p zzso in both zzso zzso zzso was also increased by zzso treatment, but only in combination with energy restriction zzso p zzso as was zzso II expression zzso zzso In contrast, the drug had no effect on expression of several genes associated with zzso Although zzso zzso was zzso only in the zzso group, zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was reduced in both treated groups (all p zzso zzso and zzso necrosis zzso expression was also reduced, though in the latter case, only with energy restriction zzso zzso Other zzso were unaffected by zzso zzso 

Our results clearly show that energy restriction enhances the therapeutic efficacy of zzso and suggest that this occurs, at least in part, through a zzso effect on gene expression in visceral zzso These findings improve our understanding of the underlying zzso basis for the clinical usefulness of dietary restriction as an adjunct to zzso therapy in type 2 zzso
