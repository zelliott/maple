zzso disturbances are observed in the peripheral and central nervous systems of patients with zzso diabetes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso growth factors zzso are zzso growth factors that can support nerve zzso and zzso survival in the types of zzso known to be afflicted in zzso We tested the hypotheses that zzso gene expression is reduced in neural zzso and liver of spontaneously diabetic obese zzso zzso rats and that zzso treatment can prevent zzso There was a significant early reduction in zzso zzso content as measured per zzso of wet tissue or per zzso zzso in zzso nerves, spinal zzso and brain from spontaneously diabetic obese zzso zzso zzso lean zzso adult zzso In addition, zzso zzso content was reduced in liver but not nerve or spinal zzso of zzso zzso zzso thresholds were abnormal zzso in diabetic zzso zzso zzso zzso rats, and subcutaneous infusion of zzso restored thresholds toward zzso The low dose of zzso that prevented zzso in contrast had no effect on zzso or zzso These data suggest that zzso treatment may provide rational therapy for diabetic zzso and that therapy may be effective even in patients unable to adequately control their zzso
