Recent zzso association studies have identified six novel genes for type 2 diabetes and obesity and confirmed zzso as the major type 2 diabetes gene to date in zzso However, the implications of these genes in Asians are zzso 

We studied 13 associated single zzso zzso from these genes in zzso patients with type 2 diabetes and zzso control subjects of Asian ancestry from Hong Kong and zzso 

We confirmed the associations of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with risk for type 2 diabetes, with odds ratios ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the A zzso of zzso at zzso was associated with increased zzso in the control subjects zzso zzso zzso However, we did not observe significant association of any genetic zzso with surrogate measures of insulin zzso or insulin sensitivity indexes in a subset of zzso control zzso Compared with subjects carrying zero, one, or two risk zzso each additional risk zzso was associated with zzso increased risk, and there was an up to zzso increased risk for type 2 diabetes in those carrying eight or more risk zzso Despite most of the effect sizes being similar between Asians and Europeans in the zzso the ethnic differences in risk zzso zzso in most of these genes lead to variable attributable risks in these two zzso 

Our findings support the important but differential contribution of these genetic zzso to type 2 diabetes and obesity in Asians compared with zzso
