zzso zzso rats, animal model for the zzso syndrome, develop a zzso zzso that is independent of zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether drugs used to treat cardiovascular dysfunction in zzso syndrome also protect nerve zzso 

zzso zzso rats at 20 weeks of age were treated for 12 weeks with zzso or zzso zzso rats were used as zzso zzso in zzso zzso was measured by zzso zzso blood flow zzso was measured by hydrogen clearance and nerve zzso zzso was measured following electrical stimulation of motor or sensory zzso 

zzso treatment decreased serum zzso zzso zzso activity and both drugs reduced serum cholesterol zzso In obese zzso rats at 32 weeks of age zzso levels were elevated in the zzso and zzso zzso which were reduced by treatment with either zzso zzso levels were increased in zzso zzso and reduced with zzso zzso zzso was decreased and corrected by treatment with either zzso Motor nerve zzso zzso was decreased and significantly improved with zzso zzso zzso zzso rats were zzso in response to a zzso stimulus and this was significantly improved with either zzso Treatment with either zzso or zzso significantly reversed the decrease in zzso vascular relaxation of zzso zzso in obese zzso zzso 

Even though obese zzso rats have normal zzso vascular and neural zzso develop with age and can be improved by treatment with either zzso or zzso
