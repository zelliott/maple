zzso acts as an zzso zzso zzso factor that can increase zzso zzso To zzso the therapeutic implications of zzso for zzso diabetes, we crossed transgenic skinny mice zzso zzso zzso which we have developed recently, and lethal yellow zzso mice zzso a genetic model for zzso syndrome, and examined the zzso zzso of F1 zzso At 6 weeks of age, plasma zzso zzso in zzso mice with the zzso zzso zzso were significantly higher than those in zzso zzso Although no significant differences in body weight were noted among zzso mice, zzso mice, and their zzso lean zzso zzso zzso and insulin tolerance tests revealed increased zzso tolerance and insulin sensitivity in zzso compared with zzso zzso However, at 12 weeks of age, when plasma zzso zzso in zzso mice were comparable to those in zzso mice, zzso mice developed zzso syndrome similar to that of zzso zzso Body weights of zzso zzso and zzso mice were reduced to those of zzso mice by a zzso food zzso when plasma zzso zzso remained high in zzso mice but were markedly reduced in zzso and zzso mice, zzso tolerance and insulin sensitivity in zzso mice were markedly improved as compared with zzso and zzso zzso The present study demonstrates that zzso can delay the onset of impaired zzso metabolism and accelerate the recovery from diabetes during caloric restriction in zzso mice, thereby suggesting the potential usefulness of zzso in combination with a long-term caloric restriction for the treatment of zzso zzso
