zzso is a key signal linking peripheral zzso levels to the regulation of energy zzso in the zzso The injection of zzso decreases body weight and food intake in lean zzso however, in a zzso model of high fat zzso obesity zzso the zzso zzso cannot improve zzso This ineffectiveness is known as zzso resistance, and the factors downstream of zzso signaling have received attention as viable targets in the treatment of zzso We previously reported that the zzso system is one of the targets of zzso In the present study, the effect of an zzso inverse zzso on zzso zzso release and energy intake was investigated in normal and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly increased zzso zzso release and reduced 12 zzso intake in normal mice, but had no such effects in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso (5 zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso a significant increase in zzso release in both types of zzso zzso did not reduce 12 zzso zzso however, it decreased 3 zzso intake in both types of zzso These results suggest that lack of the zzso of the zzso system partly contributes to obesity in zzso mice and direct zzso of the zzso system zzso zzso zzso
