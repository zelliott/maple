The present study was undertaken to determine whether factors that affect zzso zzso produce differences in insulin zzso in the zzso of obese versus lean zzso At zzso zzso (3 zzso the obese zzso zzso more insulin for a given zzso in zzso zzso concentration and responded to a wider range of zzso zzso zzso zzso than the lean zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the membrane potential changes induced by increments in zzso were not significantly different in the two types of zzso The zzso of lean and obese mice treated with zzso toxin showed a zzso similar response to zzso and to zzso but only the control and zzso toxin treated obese zzso responded to zzso zzso when deprived of zzso zzso responses to zzso and zzso were identified in the zzso of obese zzso These findings show that the abnormal insulin zzso response of the obese zzso is due, at least in part, to a zzso independent of zzso zzso This is best explained by an altered sensitivity of zzso events, most likely the result of differential effects of an zzso element acting on zzso and zzso zzso channels, both of which are implicated in membrane zzso
