Our understanding of the mechanisms by which zzso fatty liver disease zzso zzso from simple zzso to zzso zzso is still very zzso Despite the growing number of studies linking the disease with altered serum zzso levels, an obstacle to the development of zzso zzso zzso has been the lack of large cohort data from zzso patients matched for key zzso features such as zzso We studied zzso zzso individuals with normal liver zzso zzso or diagnosed with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso randomly divided into zzso zzso of all zzso and validation zzso of all zzso zzso zzso zzso of 540 serum zzso variables were performed using zzso liquid zzso coupled to mass zzso zzso The zzso profile was dependent on patient zzso index zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso mechanism may be quite different depending on an zzso level of zzso A zzso zzso model based on the zzso serum zzso profile was used to separate patients with and without zzso The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was zzso in the zzso and zzso in the validation zzso The zzso zzso corresponding to maximum average diagnostic accuracy zzso predicted NASH with a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso zzso zzso zzso The present data, indicating that a zzso serum zzso profile may be able to reliably distinguish NASH from zzso patients, have significant implications for the development of NASH zzso and potential novel targets for therapeutic zzso
