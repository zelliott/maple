The zzso zzso zzso in mice results in an obese zzso that is identical to that of the original zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that zzso mice fail to zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Here we report the zzso organization of the mouse obese gene and establish the molecular genetic basis of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is the result of the zzso of a zzso zzso in the first zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso and contains several zzso zzso and zzso zzso This leads to the production of zzso zzso in which the zzso first zzso is spliced to sequences in the zzso zzso As a consequence mature zzso zzso is not zzso and zzso the zzso zzso is not zzso
