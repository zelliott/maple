To investigate the effectiveness of exercise on the regulation of insulin zzso 

Eleven zzso women, with body fat mass from the normal range to moderate zzso were examined with zzso clamp at 10 zzso zzso concentration to determine zzso and zzso (after zzso zzso of zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso before and 24 zzso after a zzso zzso 

zzso but not zzso increased after zzso The degree of increase of zzso after exercise showed negative correlations with body mass index zzso zzso the waist to hip circumference ratio, zzso free testosterone and free fatty acid zzso as well as zzso blood pressure zzso zzso and a positive relationship to sex hormone binding zzso concentration and zzso before zzso 

It is concluded that only zzso contributes to the zzso of insulin sensitivity after a zzso exercise in zzso Additionally, the increase of zzso is less in abdominal zzso and zzso dependent on free fatty acid zzso zzso and zzso all putative zzso factors for insulin zzso
