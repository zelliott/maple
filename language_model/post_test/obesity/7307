Animal studies suggest that increased consumption of the zzso omega-3 zzso fatty zzso zzso acid and zzso acid, can protect against the development of obesity in animals exposed to an zzso diet and reduce body fat when already zzso There is also evidence that increased zzso of these fatty acids can reduce body fat in humans, but human studies are relatively few and have generally been conducted over short time periods with small sample sizes, making it difficult to draw definitive zzso zzso reductions in body fat may result from zzso effects, zzso zzso and changes of gene expression in skeletal muscle, heart, liver, zzso and zzso zzso that suppress fat deposition and increase fat zzso and energy zzso We conclude that increased zzso of zzso omega-3 fatty acids may improve body zzso but longer-term human studies are needed to confirm efficacy and determine whether increasing omega-3 zzso might be an effective strategy to combat zzso
