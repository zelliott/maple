zzso released from zzso zzso induce chronic zzso zzso which may enhance cancer zzso We investigated whether zzso of obesity and circulating zzso levels could predict incident cancer zzso 

This zzso community-based study included subjects from the Hong Kong zzso zzso zzso zzso Study zzso study commenced in zzso zzso with baseline assessments including zzso of zzso zzso were zzso in zzso zzso with measurement of serum levels of zzso including zzso zzso soluble tumor necrosis factor zzso 2 zzso as a surrogate marker of tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso and zzso acid binding protein zzso zzso cancer cases were identified up to 31 December zzso 

205 of zzso subjects recruited at zzso had developed incident zzso More of the subjects who developed zzso were obese zzso vs zzso or had central obesity zzso vs zzso according to Asian zzso zzso circumference zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso but not body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso was a significant independent predictor for incident zzso after adjustment for age, sex and smoking zzso 99 of zzso subjects zzso at zzso had developed zzso zzso who developed zzso had significantly higher level of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso After adjustment for conventional risk factors, only zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso predicted cancer zzso 

Our data supported the increased risk of zzso by chronic low grade inflammation related to central zzso
