We investigated whether the decreased zzso zinc zzso reported in genetically obese diabetic zzso zzso mice reflected an increased propensity to zinc zzso by determining zinc zzso in zzso from zzso zzso and control mice following ad zzso feeding of a zzso diet (2 zzso or restricted or ad zzso feeding of a zzso diet (20 zzso for 12 zzso Although zzso and zzso zinc zzso of zzso mice fed the zzso diet tended to be lower than in any other experimental group when expressed on a dry weight basis, zinc zzso in these zzso were either not different from or greater than those of their zzso controls when expressed on an ash weight basis, zzso relative to all mineral constituents of these zzso zzso and zzso copper zzso of the diabetic zzso mice were either not different from or greater than those of their controls on an ash weight zzso zzso zinc zzso of diabetic zzso mice fed zzso diets were lower than those of their controls on a dry weight basis but were not different from their controls on an ash weight zzso We found zzso lower dry zzso calcium and zzso zzso in zzso of the zzso mice fed a zzso diet than in zzso of their zzso and zzso zzso These findings suggest that the low zzso zinc concentration reported in the diabetic zzso mouse probably reflects a generalized decrease in bone mineral content rather than a specific depletion of tissue zinc zzso
