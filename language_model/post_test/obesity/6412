We hypothesized that short-term calorie restriction would blunt zzso hormone zzso zzso in obese women with zzso zzso syndrome zzso and thereby zzso the zzso zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, 15 obese patients with zzso and nine zzso and body mass zzso healthy women underwent zzso blood sampling to zzso plasma zzso zzso and insulin zzso zzso subjects were prescribed a very low caloric liquid diet zzso zzso for 7 days and were then zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso higher in zzso subjects, but plasma insulin and zzso levels were not different in the zzso zzso zzso to zzso calorie restriction enhanced zzso and zzso zzso zzso even zzso As expected, plasma zzso insulin, and zzso zzso decreased by 18, 75, and zzso zzso zzso total testosterone concentration fell by zzso whereas serum zzso zzso sex zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso remained zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence of normal zzso and hormonal adaptations to calorie restriction points to anomalous feedback control of zzso zzso release in zzso
