To study the influence of dietary intervention on plasma zzso levels in obese children and adolescents with anorexia zzso zzso Study design zzso obese children zzso and 16 zzso adolescents were studied at three different zzso clinical diagnosis and after a reduction or zzso of zzso and 50% of the initial zzso zzso zzso zzso included 21 zzso growth stage 1 and 36 zzso growth stage 5 zzso We analyzed plasma zzso levels and their correlation with plasma levels of zzso insulin, zzso growth factor I zzso zzso growth factor binding protein 1 zzso zzso growth factor binding protein 2 zzso zzso growth factor binding protein 3 zzso and integrated concentration of growth hormone zzso before and after dietary zzso 

At diagnosis, zzso levels were significantly decreased in obese children zzso of control zzso and significantly increased in adolescents with AN zzso of control zzso After dietary intervention, zzso increased in obese patients but without reaching control levels even after a 50% reduction in body mass index zzso In adolescents with zzso zzso levels zzso after a zzso increase in zzso zzso correlated zzso with the zzso and positively with zzso levels in controls but not in obese patients or in patients with AN at zzso The positive correlation between zzso and zzso was recovered after dietary zzso 

Plasma zzso levels present opposite changes in obesity and AN after dietary intervention, suggesting that zzso is a good marker of nutritional zzso
