zzso and surgery are known risk factors for zzso zzso zzso but there is limited information about the independent effects of obesity on the zzso of zzso zzso We linked questionnaire data from the Million Women Study with hospital admission and death records to examine the risk of zzso in relation to body mass index zzso both in the absence of surgery and in the first 12 weeks following an zzso 

Overall, 1 170 zzso women zzso age, zzso zzso recruited in 1996 to 2001 through the National Health Service Breast zzso zzso in England and Scotland were followed for an average of 6 years, during which time zzso were admitted to hospital or died of zzso The adjusted relative risks of zzso increased progressively with increasing zzso and women with a zzso zzso 35 zzso were zzso times as likely to develop zzso as those with a zzso zzso to zzso zzso risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and obese women were more likely than lean women to be admitted for surgery and also to develop zzso zzso During a zzso period without surgery, the zzso rates of zzso per 1000 women with a zzso zzso and zzso 25 were zzso zzso and zzso zzso the corresponding rates in the 12 weeks following day and zzso surgery were, respectively, about 4 and 40 times zzso 

zzso risk increases with increasing zzso and the associated excess risk is much greater after surgery than without zzso
