Whole brain zzso of zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso have been measured in two strains of rats with differing zzso to zzso S zzso rats are resistant to developing obesity when eating a high-fat diet, whereas zzso rats readily develop obesity when eating the same zzso We tested the hypotheses that brain zzso zzso and zzso differ between S zzso rats and zzso rats, and that these zzso are altered when eating a high-fat diet primarily in S zzso zzso zzso Blood and brain zzso zzso were higher in S zzso rats than in zzso rats zzso less than zzso but diet effects were not zzso Brain zzso zzso like zzso was higher in S zzso rats than in zzso rats zzso less than zzso and was not affected by adding fat to the zzso Brain zzso differed only slightly between strains but increased after adding fat to the diet zzso less than zzso in both strains with a greater increase occurring in S zzso zzso The brains of S zzso rats are chronically exposed to higher levels of zzso and zzso than are those of zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a potential signal in the regulation of body zzso Brain zzso increases with fat zzso especially in S zzso rats, suggesting that the ability to adjust to an energy dense diet may be through suppression of food intake by elevated brain zzso
