The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential importance of zzso stress, measured by zzso compounds, as zzso risk factor for cardiovascular zzso We planned to examine the relationship between zzso of plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso measures of obesity and various zzso risk zzso 

zzso study using a zzso from the population of a survey conducted in the summer and fall 2007 and 2008 by Canadian zzso Ship zzso in 36 Canadian Arctic Inuit zzso zzso included a subset zzso zzso of a total study population zzso zzso with a mean age zzso zzso zzso years and body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso Plasma levels of zzso and zzso was determined by gas zzso zzso chemical zzso zzso zzso zzso and their relationships to waist circumference zzso blood pressure C zzso proteins zzso blood lipids and zzso zzso were assessed by zzso zzso 

Plasma zzso correlated positively with zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso P zzso after adjustment for age, sex and body mass zzso zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso were not found elevated in smokers zzso zzso whereas zzso were decreased in smokers zzso zzso zzso zzso and sex were found to be major zzso of zzso stress in Canadian zzso 

Plasma measures of zzso and zzso increase with increased obesity and associated zzso risk factors, including zzso and blood zzso zzso measurement of zzso provides an advantageous zzso insight into zzso stress not captured by zzso zzso
