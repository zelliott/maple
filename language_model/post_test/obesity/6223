A study was made on the mechanism of increased zzso metabolism in enlarged zzso from zzso obese zzso rats showing zzso and zzso zzso metabolism was assessed by measuring CO2 production from zzso and the concentration of zzso zzso was estimated by zzso In comparing zzso from obese rats with those from lean rats, the zzso rates of zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso increased zzso per unit cellular surface area and the zzso in the plasma membrane increased zzso per zzso while that in zzso zzso was zzso of the value in lean zzso The increase of zzso zzso rates observed in zzso cells from obese rats could be partly explained by zzso of the zzso from the zzso site to the plasma zzso In the presence of insulin, as the zzso rates of zzso zzso increased in obese rats, zzso zzso zzso increased zzso in lean rats and zzso in obese zzso Thus, the rates of zzso zzso on a per unit cellular surface area as well as the zzso on a per protein basis in the plasma membrane became almost similar in cells from both groups of zzso Since protein content per cell increased with cell enlargement, increased zzso metabolism per cell which was observed in zzso from the obese rats was mainly due to an increase of zzso zzso accompanied by a similar degree of cellular protein zzso
