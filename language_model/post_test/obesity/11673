To determine whether zzso is involved in zzso zzso 

zzso serum samples were obtained from 20 women with normal zzso cycles who were either obese or zzso 12 non-obese patients with zzso zzso syndrome zzso 8 obese patients with zzso 10 patients with stress-related zzso zzso and 8 patients with weight zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso levels were strongly related to body mass index zzso in each group, but there was no difference in the mean serum zzso levels among the zzso study zzso A significant difference in the mean serum zzso levels was found between the non-obese and obese control groups zzso and between the non-obese and obese zzso groups zzso 

These findings indicate that circulating zzso levels in women with normal zzso cycles and those with zzso dysfunction are strongly related to zzso zzso does not appear to be primarily involved in regulating zzso zzso
