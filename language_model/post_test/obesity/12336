zzso small food stores yielded a zzso group of stores in terms of store type and nutritious food zzso Most stores were identified as convenience zzso or specialty stores zzso others were small grocery stores zzso and large grocery stores zzso zzso and specialty stores were smaller and carried fewer nutritious and fresh food zzso The availability of nutritious food and produce was better in stores in neighborhoods that had a higher percentage of white residents and a lower population density but did not differ significantly by neighborhood zzso 

Commercial databases alone may not adequately categorize small food stores and the availability of nutritious zzso Alternative measures are needed to more accurately inform research and policies that seek to address disparities in zzso health zzso
