We sought to investigate the impact of body mass index zzso on zzso and long-term outcomes after initial zzso with zzso zzso coronary zzso zzso or coronary artery bypass graft surgery zzso 

zzso results exist on the impact of zzso on the risk of zzso complications after zzso or zzso and no long-term mortality data exist from a large series of zzso zzso 

From the zzso series and zzso registry of the zzso zzso zzso Investigation zzso zzso patients who had zzso and zzso patients who had zzso were evaluated by taking their zzso at study zzso They were classified as zzso low zzso zzso normal (20 to zzso zzso overweight zzso to zzso zzso class I obese (30 to zzso zzso and class zzso obese zzso 35 zzso zzso complications and zzso and long-term zzso were compared between levels of zzso within each mode of initial zzso 

Among patients who had zzso each unit increase in zzso was associated with a zzso lower adjusted risk of a major zzso event zzso zzso zzso stroke, zzso among patients who had zzso no difference in the zzso outcome was observed according to zzso In contrast, zzso was not associated with five-year mortality in the zzso zzso among the zzso group, adjusted relative risks of five-year cardiac mortality according to levels of zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso 

Body mass index appears to have a differential impact on zzso and long-term outcomes after coronary zzso These results underscore the need for further research to identify factors responsible for the apparent short-term protective effect of a higher zzso in patients undergoing zzso and to study the impact of weight reduction on the long-term survival of obese patients undergoing zzso
