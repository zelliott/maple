zzso drives the global anabolic response to zzso zzso regulating both zzso and zzso zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso B is critical to zzso control of zzso zzso but its role in zzso metabolism has remained zzso Here, we show that zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso in obese, zzso states induced by either zzso zzso or high-fat diet zzso zzso mice lacking zzso zzso failed to zzso zzso in their zzso associated with and most likely due to a decrease in zzso gene expression and de zzso zzso However, zzso is also required for zzso pathways unrelated to fatty acid zzso as mice fed high-fat diet had reduced liver zzso in the absence of zzso zzso but did not exhibit changes in zzso These data demonstrate that zzso is a requisite component of the zzso regulation of zzso metabolism during insulin zzso
