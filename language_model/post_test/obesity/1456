To validate an improved formula for the calculation of total body water zzso from zzso values in obese zzso 

A sample of 37 overweight females zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso 

The reference zzso for zzso were obtained by zzso oxide zzso Body height zzso hip circumference zzso as well as body zzso at 100 zzso zzso were also zzso 

The values obtained for zzso C and zzso were introduced in the calculations and the following developed formula for total body water was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of this formula was assessed through the statistical test of zzso and Altman which we also performed for other formulas containing the weight and/or the zzso 

We found that the accuracy of the prediction of zzso by our formula, although lower than those formulas using body weight, is higher than that which takes into account only body zzso We conclude that body volume, expressed through body height and hip zzso is a good choice of zzso in zzso zzso zzso The new approach can be useful in clinical settings for repeated monitoring of obese women, during zzso zzso
