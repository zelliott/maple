zzso experience with zzso drugs has shown that psychiatric and cardiovascular diseases may be reported as adverse drug zzso For adequate risk assessment of these drugs knowledge on baseline risks of patients starting zzso drugs and insight in patterns of use is zzso The aim was to assess whether baseline characteristics of patients starting zzso drugs differ from those not being prescribed these drugs, and to study patterns of zzso drug zzso 

A zzso cohort study was conducted in the zzso database zzso The index cohort comprised all persons who started an zzso zzso The reference cohort comprised up to six randomly sampled patients from the same zzso practice with same index zzso zzso characteristics were assessed for both zzso The index cohort was followed for 1 year to study patterns of drug zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to calculate crude odds ratios and zzso confidence zzso 

The index and reference cohort comprised zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both cardiovascular and psychiatric zzso were more prevalent among starters compared to zzso zzso of the patients stopped using zzso drugs within 90 zzso Users of zzso drugs differed from patients using zzso or zzso whereas users of zzso and zzso were highly zzso 

The increased prevalence of zzso constitutes a baseline risk which may translate in higher occurrence of psychiatric and cardiovascular diseases during use of zzso drugs, independent of the zzso The limited period of use might reduce possible cardiovascular benefits of weight reduction induced by these zzso
