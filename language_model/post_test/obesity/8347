In this present study, we zzso zzso To clarify if zzso is associated with zzso inflammation independent of underlying zzso and zzso to evaluate the effect of zzso zzso concentration on zzso inflammation markers in a group of patients with elevated zzso zzso 

In a cohort of 165 patients with newly detected zzso zzso according to 75 g oral zzso tolerance test zzso subjects were classified either as newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes zzso group, zzso zzso zzso impaired zzso zzso zzso plus impaired zzso tolerance zzso zzso group, zzso zzso zzso or zzso only zzso group, zzso zzso zzso A control group zzso zzso zzso consisted of zzso and body mass index zzso healthy subjects with a normal zzso zzso zzso of zzso insulin, zzso zzso zzso zzso and high sensitive zzso protein zzso were zzso zzso index was zzso 

zzso inflammation markers were elevated in patients with diabetes and zzso compared to healthy controls and also zzso patients zzso zzso zzso p zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso for zzso and zzso diabetes zzso zzso p zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso for zzso and zzso In multiple zzso analysis, zzso zzso concentration was independently associated with circulating zzso and zzso zzso when the data was controlled for age, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso 

Our results suggest that patients with zzso independent of underlying zzso have increased zzso of zzso inflammation which is mostly driven by zzso zzso zzso
