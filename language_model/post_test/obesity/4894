Type 2 diabetes has been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular zzso disease, but this risk has not been well documented in young patients, especially of Latin American zzso Also, the potential zzso benefits of insulin therapy have not been evaluated in young patients with type 2 zzso The objectives of this study were to determine any zzso difference in the presence of zzso risk factors in young Latin Americans with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and the effect of intensive insulin therapy on these zzso risk zzso 

zzso Latin American patients with type 2 diabetes between the ages 18 and 45 years were evaluated at zzso All women were zzso and had regular zzso zzso The mean body mass index zzso zzso 30 zzso in both zzso zzso body fat, percent zzso zzso and zzso profiles were similar between zzso zzso sensitive zzso protein zzso levels were elevated and similar between genders zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules zzso zzso zzso 1, vascular zzso zzso 1, zzso and zzso zzso protein 1 were zzso whereas zzso levels were below normal in both gender zzso zzso zzso zzso was similar between genders and did not show any relationship with any of the zzso In women, there was a direct relationship between waist circumference and zzso zzso levels zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso No other significant relationships were zzso zzso Latin American patients with type 2 diabetes completed up to 104 weeks of zzso with insulin zzso In these patients, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were obtained every 12 zzso zzso sensitive zzso zzso zzso zzso and urinary zzso zzso among other tests, were obtained every 52 zzso At 52 and 104 weeks, body weight, zzso waist zzso and percent body fat increased in a parallel and significant zzso Despite a significant decrease in percent zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso and zzso profiles, highly sensitive zzso zzso zzso zzso and other nontraditional zzso risk factors did not change zzso 

In young, obese, Latino type 2 diabetic patients, improvement in zzso control with insulin zzso was not associated with a parallel improvement in markers of vascular zzso zzso Latino women with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes have zzso risks comparable to Latino diabetic men of the same zzso zzso and underlying insulin resistance may counteract the potential zzso benefits associated with insulin therapy in lean diabetic zzso Weight loss could be a potential therapeutic zzso to improve zzso risk in Latino type 2 diabetic patients, especially zzso
