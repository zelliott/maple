The obese zzso gene has been cloned recently and its protein product is called zzso zzso is an zzso zzso factor that regulates body weight zzso Several hormonal factors have been reported to regulate zzso zzso zzso To determine which factors are most important for regulation of zzso zzso zzso we examined the effects of insulin, zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on primary cultured zzso zzso zzso obtained from zzso fat were cultured using the ceiling zzso Total zzso was extracted and the expression of zzso zzso was measured by quantitative reverse zzso chain zzso After 24 h of zzso 100 zzso insulin significantly increased the expression of zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso Moreover, insulin increased zzso zzso expression in a zzso manner over a range of zzso zzso The effect of 100 zzso insulin was similar to that seen with zzso newborn calf zzso zzso zzso zzso also increased zzso zzso expression zzso The effect of zzso occurred more rapidly than zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso had no effects, whereas zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso had zzso effects zzso and zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso The combination of 250 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not have an additive effect on zzso zzso zzso Our present data suggest that, of these agents, insulin is the most important factor regulating zzso zzso zzso
