Increased zzso zzso zzso are thought to play a role in insulin resistance, but the precise nature of the zzso species that produce insulin resistance in human muscle are zzso zzso either generated via zzso of zzso or produced by de zzso zzso induce insulin resistance in cultured cells by zzso effects on insulin zzso The present study was undertaken to determine whether zzso or other zzso are increased in muscle from obese zzso subjects and to assess whether zzso plays a role in the insulin resistance of zzso in human zzso zzso zzso and obese zzso subjects zzso zzso 10 each) received zzso zzso with muscle zzso zzso and after 30, 45, or 60 zzso of insulin zzso The rate of zzso infusion required to maintain zzso zzso zzso zzso was reduced zzso as expected, in the obese subjects at each time point zzso zzso Under zzso conditions, total muscle zzso content was increased nearly twofold in the obese subjects zzso zzso 9 zzso 25 zzso 2 zzso zzso muscle, P zzso All species of zzso were increased similarly in the obese zzso in contrast, no other zzso was zzso zzso of zzso zzso by insulin in the obese subjects was significantly reduced after 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso arbitrary zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of insulin infusion zzso zzso for zzso Muscle zzso content was significantly correlated with the plasma free fatty acid concentration zzso zzso zzso P zzso We conclude that obesity is associated with increased zzso zzso zzso This twofold increase in zzso may be involved in the decrease in zzso zzso observed after insulin infusion and could theoretically play a role in the reduced ability of insulin to stimulate zzso zzso in skeletal muscle from obese zzso
