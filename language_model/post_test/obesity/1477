Recent data show that fat balance is the only component of zzso balance which is not precisely zzso The adherence to a lifestyle characterized by high fat food habits and zzso thus favor a positive fat balance which may persist for a long period of zzso The resulting body fat gain contributes to the restoration of fat and energy balance because of the enhancing effect of fat gain on fat zzso zzso predisposed to obesity seem to be particularly vulnerable to a positive zzso balance because they are characterized by a reduced fat zzso when their body weight is normal and by a reduced capacity to increase fat zzso when exposed to a high fat zzso Body fat gain, particularly in the deep abdominal area, is also associated with an increase in zzso which is known to acutely inhibit fat zzso and zzso Beyond these peripheral zzso effects, zzso with zzso can influence zzso regulation of energy balance which ultimately results in an increase in sympathetic nervous system zzso An increased sympathetic zzso exerts an enhancing effect on fat zzso and energy expenditure and a reducing effect on food zzso As discussed in this report, zzso thus appears to be an adaptation which is part of a regulatory system aimed at restoring fat and energy balance under conditions favoring body fat zzso
