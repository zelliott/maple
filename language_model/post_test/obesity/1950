zzso zzso resistance is associated with hypertension but the underlying mechanism is zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso is impaired in zzso obese zzso zzso We studied zzso artery zzso 220 zzso zzso function before the development of hypertension in zzso old obese zzso rats and zzso lean zzso zzso In vessels from lean rats, insulin at zzso of 50, 500 and zzso zzso attenuated the zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso P zzso 500 zzso 13 zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso 13 zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso from obese rats failed to show any such response to insulin (2 zzso zzso increase in zzso tension with zzso zzso not zzso both in the presence and absence of zzso (3 zzso zzso zzso from obese rats showed slight but significant impairment in the zzso response to zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso however, relaxation in response to zzso was not significantly different between the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso not zzso zzso zzso blood pressure was not significantly different in lean zzso zzso 8 zzso and obese zzso zzso 7 zzso rats at the time of study (not zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso of zzso zzso is impaired in the obese zzso rat and that this zzso precedes and therefore could contribute to the development of hypertension in this zzso zzso The zzso in insulin action could reside in the zzso generation of zzso oxide, as zzso function is also zzso
