Recent evidence suggests that obesity increases the risk of severe outcomes following respiratory zzso It is less clear whether obesity is associated with the risk of being infected with influenza or other respiratory zzso zzso we examined the association between obesity and zzso visits for acute respiratory infections zzso 

We conducted a retrospective cohort study for a period of over 13 years on zzso individuals in Ontario, Canada who responded to population health surveys and agreed to linkage with health administrative zzso zzso aged zzso years who responded to a survey within 5 years prior to the start of an influenza season were zzso zzso regression, with adjustment for relevant zzso was used to measure the association between zzso body mass index zzso and zzso visits for zzso We conducted numerous sensitivity analyses to assess the zzso of our zzso 

We observed higher rates of zzso visits for zzso during influenza season periods compared with normal weight individuals for those who were overweight zzso zzso rate ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso obese class I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and obese class II or III zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a similar magnitude were observed during zzso season zzso zzso was a greater risk factor for zzso managed in emergency departments than physician zzso 

zzso individuals are at an increased risk of zzso visits for zzso during both influenza and zzso season zzso suggesting that the effect of obesity on the risk of respiratory infections is not limited to zzso zzso designed to reduce the prevalence of obesity may have the added benefit reducing the population burden of respiratory zzso
