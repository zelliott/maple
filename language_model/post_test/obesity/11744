It has been shown recently that the variable expression of the zzso collagen zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso risk on the one hand and zzso risk on the other zzso The level of expression of the zzso zzso is genetically controlled and associated with the zzso zzso The expression level of this zzso collagen zzso may play a central role in the rapidly evolving coronary artery zzso that lead to zzso zzso and sudden cardiac zzso We studied zzso zzso of the zzso zzso for their relation as a risk factor for zzso zzso in a zzso zzso of patients with coronary artery zzso We compared zzso zzso (by sequence specific primer zzso chain zzso of the zzso that is associated with zzso zzso levels in 94 zzso survivors of sudden cardiac death with a matched group of 106 patients with coronary artery disease without sudden cardiac zzso Gene zzso in the patient groups did not differ and were similar to those in the general population represented by 217 healthy zzso There was no overrepresentation of an zzso in any zzso The inherited zzso that is associated with the levels of zzso zzso zzso is not associated with zzso zzso in coronary artery disease zzso
