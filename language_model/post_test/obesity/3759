zzso of zzso is known to disrupt the development of energy balance regulatory zzso We investigated whether administration of zzso to normally nourished rats affects energy balance in their zzso zzso (2 zzso was administered from day 14 of pregnancy and throughout zzso Male and female offspring were fed either on zzso or on high-fat diets that zzso similar levels of obesity in the sexes from 6 zzso to 15 zzso of zzso Treatment of the zzso with zzso prevented zzso increases in the rate of weight gain, zzso fat pad weight, area under the zzso zzso tolerance curve, and zzso plasma insulin concentration in female zzso In the male zzso the zzso increase in weight gain was prevented and increased fat pad weight was zzso Energy intake per rat was higher in response to the zzso diet in male offspring of zzso but not zzso zzso A similar trend was seen in zzso female zzso Energy expenditure at 3 zzso of age was higher for a given body weight in female offspring of zzso compared with zzso zzso when these animals were fed on the zzso zzso A similar trend was seen for male rats fed on the zzso zzso Thus zzso levels during pregnancy and zzso can affect the development of energy balance regulatory systems in their zzso
