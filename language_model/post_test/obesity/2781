zzso zzso individuals to zzso heart failure zzso and cardiovascular disease zzso zzso regulates energy zzso is elevated in zzso and influences zzso and vascular zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso levels are associated with greater risk of zzso zzso and mortality in elderly zzso 

We evaluated zzso elderly zzso age 79 years, zzso zzso zzso Study participants attending a routine examination at which plasma zzso was zzso 

zzso levels were higher in women and strongly correlated with zzso zzso zzso On follow-up zzso zzso zzso 129 (of zzso free of zzso participants developed zzso zzso (of zzso free of zzso experienced a first zzso event, and 391 individuals zzso In multivariable Cox zzso models adjusting for established risk factors, zzso was positively associated with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso ratio zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Additional adjustment for zzso nullified the association with zzso zzso zzso but only modestly attenuated the relation to zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso We observed a zzso zzso relation between zzso and mortality zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso with greater risk of death evident at both low and high zzso zzso 

In our zzso community-based elderly sample, higher circulating zzso levels were associated with a greater risk of zzso and zzso but zzso did not provide incremental zzso information beyond zzso Additional investigations are warranted to zzso the zzso relation of zzso to zzso
