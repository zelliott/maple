The objective of this study was to investigate zzso zzso changes that permit one to identify zzso rats at normal weight that are prone zzso zzso resistant zzso to zzso In blood collected via chronic cardiac zzso a zzso high-fat meal zzso 50% fat, 40 zzso at dark onset caused a significant increase in zzso insulin, and zzso compared with zzso zzso Similar to patterns in already obese compared with lean rats on a high-fat diet, these zzso zzso changes in zzso rats on lab zzso were almost twofold larger in zzso rats that, compared with OR rats, subsequently accumulated zzso more fat mass on a chronic high-fat zzso These exaggerated zzso changes were similarly observed in blood collected using a simpler tail vein puncture zzso In three separate experiments, the zzso rise in zzso was found to be the zzso positive correlate zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of long-term body fat zzso The lowest zzso zzso zzso highest zzso zzso scores for this zzso zzso measurement identified distinct OR and zzso subgroups, respectively, when they were similar in body weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and meal size (40 zzso zzso tests in these zzso zzso rats revealed a distinct characteristic compared with OR rats, zzso exaggerated zzso rise in expression of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Thus, with this zzso zzso zzso zzso rats can be identified while still at normal weight and then investigated for mechanisms that contribute to their excessive body fat zzso on a high-fat zzso
