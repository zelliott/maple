zzso zzso zzso act in the brain to regulate food intake and body weight and, independently of these actions, affect insulin zzso These experiments investigated the function of novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that cross the zzso barrier when administered zzso Treatment of diet induced obese zzso zzso mice with zzso zzso administered peripherally improved zzso zzso zzso zzso and fatty liver zzso zzso of function was determined using B6 zzso and zzso zzso knockout mice zzso zzso Chow fed zzso but not zzso used for these tests exhibited zzso zzso and severe zzso associated with increased expression of zzso genes involved in zzso zzso food intake associated with acute zzso treatment, and weight loss associated with 14 days of treatment with zzso required functional zzso but not zzso However, while 14 days of treatment with zzso did not affect body weight and even increased cumulative food intake in zzso a significant reduction zzso zzso in zzso insulin was still zzso Despite lowering insulin, chronic treatment with zzso did not improve zzso in zzso and did not affect zzso zzso gene zzso Together, these results demonstrate that peripherally administered zzso zzso zzso regulate body weight, liver metabolism and zzso zzso through independent zzso zzso are necessary for zzso zzso weight loss and improvements in liver zzso but are not required for improvements in zzso zzso with activity at zzso improve zzso zzso at least partially by causing weight loss, however other zzso receptors may have potential for treating aberrations in zzso zzso associated with zzso
