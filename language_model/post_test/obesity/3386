The vascular actions of insulin are complex, because it can stimulate both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We examined zzso to insulin in isolated feed arteries of the zzso zzso and zzso muscles zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso fatty zzso rats, a zzso zzso model of obesity and insulin zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was similar in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, examination of zzso effects revealed a number of novel insights into the zzso vascular effects of zzso zzso feed arteries zzso more than zzso in zzso at 100 and 1000 zzso zzso insulin zzso versus 6 and 28 versus zzso zzso P zzso for zzso zzso Likewise, in zzso rats there was significantly greater zzso in zzso than zzso at 10, 100 and 1000 zzso zzso insulin zzso versus 3, 30 versus 0 and 34 versus zzso zzso all P zzso In the presence of 3 zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso blocker, zzso zzso of the zzso was enhanced such that differences between vessels were largely abolished in both zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was significantly greater in zzso than zzso within each group, whereas sodium zzso zzso responses were greater in the zzso compared with the zzso Overall, our findings indicate that the zzso zzso zzso is more active in zzso than in zzso independent of obesity in the zzso rat zzso
