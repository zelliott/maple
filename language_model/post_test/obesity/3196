zzso zzso and overall obesity are both related to coronary heart disease mortality zzso however, the relative contribution of these 2 components of fat deposit in the zzso of sudden death is zzso 

We used the data from zzso zzso men of the Paris Prospective Study I who were free of zzso heart disease and who were 43 to 52 years of age at first clinical examination between 1967 and zzso Body mass index zzso and zzso abdominal diameter zzso were measured at baseline and used as markers of overall and abdominal zzso During a follow-up of 23 years, there were 118 sudden deaths and 192 fatal zzso zzso After adjustment for baseline level of cardiovascular risk factors, trunk subcutaneous fat, and zzso diameter, the ratio of the fifth over the first zzso of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso to zzso for sudden death and fatal zzso zzso respectively, and the risk of sudden death increased zzso with zzso zzso The corresponding ratios for zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso Compared with men with low zzso zzso zzso and normal zzso zzso zzso men with elevated zzso zzso zzso were at increased risk of sudden death but not of fatal zzso zzso whether they were of normal weight zzso adjusted relative risk zzso 0 zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso or overweight zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

In zzso French middle-aged men, larger zzso was associated with a particularly increased risk of sudden death, independent of zzso level and known cardiovascular risk zzso
