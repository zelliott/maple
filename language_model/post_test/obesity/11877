The goal in this study was to determine the relationship between body mass index and zzso and cortical bone using quantitative zzso zzso A higher body mass index zzso was positively associated with zzso and cortical bone zzso and serum zzso hormone, and zzso associated with cortical zzso bone mineral density zzso and serum zzso zzso When zzso is greater than 35 zzso zzso affects zzso and may explain the higher fracture risk in this population without low zzso 

The influence of adult obesity on the zzso and cortical bone, zzso and strength has not been fully zzso The goal in this study was to determine the relationship between body mass index and zzso and cortical bone mass and zzso over a wide range of body zzso 

We examined 211 women zzso years; zzso zzso zzso who were classified into three categories of zzso zzso including zzso zzso overweight and zzso I zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and also by zzso zzso zzso bone mineral density zzso zzso and cortical components as well as geometric characteristics at the zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso were measured by peripheral quantitative zzso zzso and serum was analyzed for zzso hormone zzso and zzso D zzso 

Higher zzso was associated with greater values of zzso bone and cortical zzso and area and zzso zzso zzso but lower cortical zzso and zzso zzso zzso When controlling for lower leg muscle area, fat area was zzso associated with cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso obese women with both higher zzso and zzso had lower cortical zzso zzso zzso While age is a predictor for most bone zzso fat mass explains more zzso for zzso and lean mass and zzso explain greater zzso in geometric and strength zzso zzso 

Severe obesity zzso increases zzso zzso and in the presence of a higher zzso is associated with a lower cortical zzso without compromising bone geometry and zzso Whether or not a lower cortical zzso in obesity influences fracture risk over time needs to be further zzso
