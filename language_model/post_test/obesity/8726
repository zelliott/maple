Several genetic analyses have suggested that zzso zzso zzso zzso causing decreased zzso activity correlate with increased zzso zzso and risk for coronary artery zzso In contrast, in some other studies zzso activity was positively correlated with plasma zzso zzso zzso cholesterol zzso 

To assess whether these different associations represent zzso differences in zzso zzso 

We correlated zzso zzso activities, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in obese zzso or zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso 26) and non-obese zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured using specific zzso zzso 

Surprisingly, zzso activity was significantly correlated with zzso area under the curve after a fat load in the zzso but not the entire zzso Moreover, in non-obese individuals, zzso activity correlated directly zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity correlated zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso cholesterol zzso These relationships were not found in the obese group, in whom zzso correlated with LDL cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We conclude that zzso zzso activity relates to different zzso in obese and non-obese zzso In zzso greater zzso activity may enhance conversion of zzso zzso cholesterol to LDL cholesterol, whereas in non-obese individuals the correlation is with HDL zzso Whether this is due to differences in the source of zzso zzso or zzso or to other associated zzso in zzso metabolism is zzso These results may explain the zzso of correlations between zzso and zzso zzso in different zzso
