To investigate the role of zzso gene zzso on the zzso and zzso changes observed in response to a zzso zzso protocol conducted with 12 pairs of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso included zzso and abdominal fat from zzso zzso Plasma zzso and insulin during zzso and in response to an oral zzso tolerance test zzso were zzso A zzso zzso test meal was zzso after which zzso zzso were performed for 240 zzso 

Respiratory zzso zzso decreased zzso more in zzso than in zzso subjects of the zzso zzso after the caloric surplus and the significance persisted when correction for multiple testing was zzso Total abdominal zzso and visceral zzso fat increased more in zzso than in zzso subjects of the zzso zzso In response to zzso zzso area under the curve during the zzso showed a slight decrease zzso in the zzso while it increased in zzso zzso zzso insulin area tended to increase less zzso in zzso than in zzso zzso After zzso zzso insulin was lower in zzso than in zzso subjects zzso In addition, zzso subjects experienced more decrease in zzso than zzso subjects zzso 

The zzso zzso was associated with the changes in zzso in response to zzso The zzso zzso was associated with zzso changes in abdominal visceral fat, zzso zzso area and zzso The results suggest that sequence variation in the zzso gene is involved in the adaptation to chronic positive energy zzso
