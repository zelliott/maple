zzso treatment with single drugs produces weight losses of about zzso of initial body zzso Few studies of combinations of drugs for treating obesity have been zzso The combination of zzso an zzso agent, and zzso a zzso agent, zzso produced weight losses of about zzso of initial body zzso zzso is no longer available because it was associated with cardiac valve zzso zzso zzso has been proposed as an alternative for zzso 

To compare the efficacy of treatment and prevalence of cardiac valve abnormalities on zzso vs zzso

The combination of zzso and zzso was not as effective as zzso but was not associated with cardiac valve zzso zzso term, larger scale studies of zzso are zzso
