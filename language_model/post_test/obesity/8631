Although obesity is especially common in African-American women, the relationship between body mass index zzso zzso and mortality primarily has been studied in zzso and almost exclusively in average weight zzso In order to examine the relationship between race and mortality in a predominately overweight population, we assessed mortality in zzso parents of obese African-American and Caucasian zzso Most parents of both races were overweight or zzso zzso of African-American mothers zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of Caucasian mothers zzso zzso zzso zzso had a zzso or zzso zzso of African-American fathers zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of Caucasian fathers zzso zzso zzso zzso had a zzso or zzso Even though African Americans had equivalent zzso or higher zzso average zzso and percentage overweight or obesity than zzso zzso mortality rates were consistently lower in African Americans than in zzso In a combined sample, income, age zzso zzso and cubic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and race were significant zzso of zzso Linear and zzso effects of zzso were significant within race and in the combined sample, after controlling for the effects of all other predictor zzso zzso the mortality differences cannot be due to differences in age, income, zzso or gender zzso In addition, there was significant zzso between races for all models zzso suggesting interactions between race and all other predictor zzso Moreover, there was a strong residual effect for race after accounting for the other zzso The highly selective and zzso nature of this sample limits our ability to make specific zzso risk zzso However, the consistent differences between comparably zzso racial groups sampled from the upper extreme of the zzso distribution provide support for a lower zzso mortality rate in African Americans relative to zzso
