zzso and premature zzso steroid zzso are associated with increases in fat mass and body zzso zzso zzso mice also show reduced locomotor zzso zzso zzso is known to play an important role both in fat metabolism and locomotor zzso zzso we hypothesized that the effects of zzso on the regulation of body weight, fat mass, and spontaneous physical activity could be zzso in part by zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, zzso mice and zzso knockout mice zzso were exposed to zzso or sham operation zzso zzso 10 per zzso The effects on body zzso markers of insulin resistance, energy zzso locomotor activity, and expression of zzso zzso and zzso factors were investigated over 26 zzso in all four groups of zzso zzso zzso mice developed zzso increased fat mass, and elevated markers of insulin resistance as zzso This was completely prevented in zzso zzso animals, even though their energy expenditure and spontaneous locomotor activity levels did not significantly differ from those of zzso zzso zzso zzso food intake in zzso zzso animals was significantly reduced and associated with significantly lower zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso Y zzso but not of zzso transcript zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso or zzso hormone zzso zzso receptors thus interact with zzso in the zzso regulation of food intake in mice, and their blockade may carry promising potential for the prevention of obesity in zzso steroid zzso
