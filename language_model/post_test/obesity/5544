Muscle zzso zzso are known to be a source of energy during zzso zzso 

The aim of this study was to assess whether an index of muscle fat content is related to zzso fat zzso rate zzso in 58 obese men zzso age zzso zzso zzso body weight zzso zzso percentage zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was defined as the highest value of fat zzso rate, measured by indirect zzso while walking on a treadmill zzso zzso at three different zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso mass zzso and fat mass zzso were measured with the underwater technique and scans were obtained by zzso zzso zzso at the mid thigh level to assess areas of zzso tissue within skeletal muscle, zzso deep zzso tissue zzso subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso skeletal muscle zzso and low zzso skeletal muscle zzso range of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used as zzso of skeletal muscle fat zzso 

zzso adjusted for age, was correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso abdominal visceral zzso tissue zzso zzso and plasma free fatty acid zzso levels zzso zzso but not with SAT zzso and zzso zzso zzso In a zzso linear multiple regression, plasma zzso age and zzso significantly predicted zzso zzso Each independent variable explained about zzso of the zzso zzso 

zzso makes a significant but weak contribution to the zzso of fat zzso during zzso exercise in obese zzso
