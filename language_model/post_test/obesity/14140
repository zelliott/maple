Colleagues and I previously performed a quantitative trait locus zzso analysis on zzso diabetes zzso zzso traits zzso and zzso zzso and body weight zzso in zzso zzso zzso for zzso traits were quite different from those for body zzso In this study, I performed a zzso analysis on zzso to characterize its zzso and zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso and severity of zzso were examined at 40 days zzso 50 days zzso and 60 days zzso after birth, and I compared the results with those for zzso traits and body zzso 

zzso zzso were identified on zzso 4 zzso and 6 zzso zzso zzso were identified on zzso 6 zzso and zzso zzso and 16 zzso zzso At the locus on zzso 4 and zzso the zzso zzso was associated with increases in zzso severity and body zzso on the contrary, the zzso zzso was associated with decreases in zzso severity and body weight at zzso With regard to the zzso plasma zzso levels at autopsy, the zzso zzso at the zzso locus was significantly associated with elevated zzso levels, and there was a trend that the zzso zzso at zzso was associated with decreased zzso zzso 

zzso is a complex trait that has a strong relationship to body weight rather than to zzso zzso A genetic relationship among zzso body weight, and zzso zzso levels was zzso zzso between zzso zzso and body weight zzso was strongly zzso
