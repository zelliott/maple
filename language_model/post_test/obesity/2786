zzso supplementation with zzso may produce calorie zzso effects on zzso and longevity zzso in zzso In this study, we sought to determine whether zzso treatment zzso other hallmark changes associated with calorie zzso namely zzso and decreased body zzso We found that during short-term treatment, zzso mice on a zzso diet experienced significant decreases in both heart rate and body temperature after only 1 day whereas those receiving zzso exhibited no such change after 1 zzso We also used zzso mice to study the effects of long-term treatment because previous studies had indicated the therapeutic value of zzso against the linked zzso of obesity and zzso After 12 zzso zzso treatment had produced no changes in either heart rate or body zzso zzso and in contrast to previous findings, we found that zzso mice had significantly reduced endurance in a treadmill zzso zzso reverse zzso chain reaction suggested that a proposed target of zzso zzso was activated in zzso zzso zzso Thus, we conclude that the zzso and zzso associated with calorie restriction occur through mechanisms unaffected by the actions of zzso and that further studies are needed to examine the differential effects of zzso in a zzso zzso
