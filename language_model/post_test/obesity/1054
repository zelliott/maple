African Americans may have a lower resting energy expenditure zzso than do zzso although the data are limited for obese children and adolescents and for zzso zzso in bone density and trunk lean body mass may account for some of these measured differences in zzso 

We assessed the zzso and body composition of obese African American and white children and zzso 

zzso zzso children and adolescents were evaluated zzso zzso zzso Body composition was assessed by zzso X-ray zzso zzso was measured by zzso zzso African American and white children were zzso The relation between zzso and the independent variables zzso sex, ethnic group, fat mass, and zzso mass or lean tissue zzso was zzso 

Of those zzso zzso were girls and zzso were African zzso Age, sex, zzso status, and body composition did not differ significantly by ethnic zzso All the independent variables were significantly associated with zzso Using lean tissue mass to account for differences in bone density did not significantly alter the zzso zzso decreased with age and was lower in the girls than in the boys and in the African Americans than in the zzso When trunk zzso mass was included in the model in place of zzso zzso mass, the ethnic difference in zzso zzso 

Adjustment for trunk lean tissue mass partially explains the lower zzso of obese African American children and zzso The lower relative zzso of older obese children suggests the importance of early intervention in the prevention of childhood zzso The lower zzso of girls and of African Americans may contribute to the difficulty in weight management in these zzso
