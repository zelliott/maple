The effects of prolonged zzso on the composition of weight loss and the rates of muscle protein synthesis and degradation were compared in obese and zzso zzso zzso zzso rats weighting 400 g could survive 60 days of zzso whereas obese rats weighing 550 g could survive 60 zzso Weight loss was similar in both zzso over the first 10 days of zzso (15 zzso but the composition of weight loss zzso zzso rats lost nearly twice as much zzso but only one-fifth as much body protein as lean zzso The zzso zzso rate zzso zzso zzso zzso was similar in both zzso This finding indicates a slower decline in zzso rate during zzso in obese rats, since maintenance requirements are greater in lean zzso In fed rats, the fractional rates of muscle protein synthesis zzso and breakdown zzso were slightly higher in obese zzso zzso reduced muscle protein synthesis in both zzso In obese rats, however, the zzso declined more slowly than in lean zzso On the other hand, zzso decreased in zzso obese rats but greatly increased in zzso lean zzso It was concluded that the better protein retention and slower decline in zzso rate in zzso obese rats were related to their different regulation of muscle protein synthesis and breakdown during zzso
