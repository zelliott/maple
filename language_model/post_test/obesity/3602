We aim to explore the relationship of neck circumference to zzso syndrome zzso and obesity in Chinese elders and to establish zzso points of the neck circumference for zzso and zzso 

zzso analysis for a population sample of zzso individuals aged over 65 years, representative of East China zzso zzso was identified according to the 2004 Chinese Diabetes Society zzso 

Neck circumference was correlated with body mass index zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso in men, and r zzso zzso p zzso zzso in zzso and waist circumference zzso zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso in men, and r zzso zzso p zzso zzso in zzso According to neck circumference zzso the prevalence of zzso and its components were increased significantly from zzso to zzso zzso for trend zzso in both zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that both waist circumference and neck circumference were independent zzso of Mets, with odds ratios zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso p zzso zzso respectively, in men and zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso p zzso zzso respectively, in zzso As for zzso the significant independent indicators in both genders were also waist circumference and neck circumference (all p zzso In the receiver operating characteristic curves, both the optimal zzso points of neck circumference for zzso and obesity were 38 zzso in men and 35 zzso in zzso 

The neck zzso as waist zzso is also a valuable tool for identifying zzso and zzso with established zzso points for the prediction of zzso and obesity in Chinese zzso
