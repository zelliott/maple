zzso 25 zzso D zzso and zzso hormone zzso levels correlate zzso The zzso level at which zzso is zzso suppressed and below which zzso begins to rise zzso zzso has been used to define optimum zzso zzso While serum zzso levels are lower in obese individuals, likely due to zzso of vitamin D in the zzso zzso it is not known if the lower zzso levels in obese children are associated with a zzso increase in the same manner as it is in normal weight zzso 

A retrospective record review of children between 2 and 18 years of age zzso zzso zzso undergoing simultaneous measurement of serum zzso and zzso levels was zzso 

The level of serum zzso below which zzso begins to rise was significantly lower zzso zzso in zzso children compared to normal weight children zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In overweight and obese children, the zzso axis is activated at much lower zzso levels than in normal weight zzso These findings are a consequence of similar zzso calcium levels in these groups despite lower serum zzso levels in obese zzso
