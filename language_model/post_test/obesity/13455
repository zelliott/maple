The zzso zzso product zzso zzso is a signaling zzso with wide-ranging biological zzso In this paper, we report that disruption of zzso a gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso causes increased zzso tissue levels and is accompanied by zzso development of obesity which precedes the onset of insulin resistance in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso animals in the zzso genetic background have normal zzso levels and remain lean, indicating a role of zzso in triggering or maintaining zzso In zzso zzso zzso mice, the expression of the zzso zzso zzso transcript is enhanced zzso with a zzso increase in the tissue level of zzso Also, zzso zzso is partially zzso and tissue zzso levels are zzso zzso of zzso could lead to zzso zzso of zzso further zzso zzso zzso zzso may be inhibited by zzso or by zzso generated by zzso which are enriched in white zzso tissue of middle-aged zzso zzso zzso mice and, upon zzso zzso produce more zzso oxygen species and zzso oxide than zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the more abundant and/or zzso activated zzso in zzso zzso mice leads to fat zzso by the well-known mechanisms of promoting fatty acid synthesis and zzso fatty acid zzso Our findings complement the recent report that obesity causes both a loss of zzso and an increase in the level of zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6, zzso The two zzso processes are likely to establish a positive feedback loop that would promote and perpetuate the obese zzso
