Previous studies of body mass index zzso and enrollment on the zzso transplant waiting list have not analyzed a national population of chronic dialysis zzso 

zzso patients in the United States Renal Data System zzso initiated on zzso zzso disease zzso therapy between 1 April 1995 and 30 June 1997 who had data sufficient to calculate zzso were analyzed in an historical cohort zzso Cox zzso analysis was used to model the association of zzso and rates of listing for zzso zzso censored for death and zzso of zzso zzso and adjusted for zzso zzso in the Medical Evidence Form zzso and in comparison with patient zzso 

In zzso analysis, only patients with zzso zzso zzso had a statistically significant lower rate of listing compared to patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso person zzso In Cox zzso analysis, patients with zzso zzso zzso had a zzso lower adjusted rate of listing and a 38% lower rate of survival, and patients with zzso had an zzso higher adjusted rate of listing and no significant difference in adjusted survival compared with patients with zzso zzso Caucasian females were disproportionately affected by high zzso 

Among zzso patients, lower zzso was independently associated with reduced adjusted rates of zzso High zzso affected rates of listing disproportionately in zzso zzso
