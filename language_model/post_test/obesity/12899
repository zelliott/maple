Although the precise mechanisms contributing to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes are unknown, it is believed that defects in downstream components of the insulin signaling zzso may be zzso In this work, we zzso that a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may be pertinent in this zzso To test this hypothesis, we examined zzso activity in two zzso mouse strains known to be susceptible zzso or resistant zzso to zzso obesity and zzso zzso of zzso in fat, liver, and muscle zzso of zzso mice revealed that zzso activity increased twofold in the zzso fat tissue and remained unchanged in muscle and liver of mice fed a high-fat diet, compared with their low-fat zzso zzso In contrast, zzso activity did not change in the zzso fat tissue of zzso mice, regardless of the type of diet they were zzso In addition, both zzso and zzso zzso activity was higher zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso tissue of zzso mice compared with that in zzso zzso Taken together, our studies suggest an zzso link between increased zzso activity and development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in fat tissue of zzso mice, and zzso zzso as a potential factor contributing to zzso of zzso mice to zzso zzso
