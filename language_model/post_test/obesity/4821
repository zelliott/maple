Recently, zzso expression in zzso tissue has been described and shown to be increased in patients with severe zzso We tried to assess the effect of obesity on zzso serum levels and treatment outcome of iron zzso anemia in zzso 

This was a case control study included 70 children with iron zzso anemia zzso (35 obese and 35 zzso and 30 healthy non-obese children with comparable age and zzso zzso zzso of iron status zzso iron, zzso zzso total iron binding capacity and zzso zzso and serum zzso levels were assessed initially and after 3 months of oral iron therapy for zzso 

Compared to the control group, serum zzso was significantly lower in non-obese children with zzso zzso and significantly higher in obese children with zzso zzso zzso zzso increased significantly in non-obese children with zzso after 3 months of iron therapy zzso zzso On the other hand, obese children showed zzso change in zzso level after iron therapy zzso zzso Although zzso showed significant positive correlations with zzso serum iron and zzso zzso in non-obese children with zzso it showed significant negative correlations with zzso serum iron and zzso zzso in obese children with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso increased zzso levels and was associated with diminished response to oral iron therapy in childhood iron zzso zzso
