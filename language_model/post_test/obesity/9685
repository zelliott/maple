The cardiovascular zzso nervous system in obese children is one of the main initiators of coronary heart disease and hypertension and may have a close relationship with insulin zzso Heart rate zzso is one zzso method to assess the cardiovascular zzso zzso In this method, low frequency parameters reflect zzso activity, high frequency parameters reflect zzso activity and the ratio of these parameters reflects zzso zzso 

In this study, a short-term analysis of heart rate zzso was conducted in 66 obese children and 40 healthy zzso 

While high frequency zzso values are lower in the obese group compared to the controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso the low zzso frequency ratio is found significantly higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso A significant difference was not detected for the low frequency values zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance was found in 33 zzso patients, zzso was found in 39 zzso and hypertension was found in 18 zzso zzso syndrome was detected in zzso patients in the obese zzso 

We found that zzso activity was decreased in the obese group and the zzso nervous system balance was impaired in favor of sympathetic activity in the short-term heart rate zzso
