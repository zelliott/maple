zzso insulin has been implicated as a zzso of blood pressure zzso level in obese zzso zzso We examined the relationships among zzso insulin, mean zzso pressure zzso body zzso and fat distribution in 204 subjects zzso for zzso zzso All met the criteria of taking no oral zzso agents, insulin or zzso zzso 95 percent were considered obese and 78 percent were zzso Mean age was 39 years zzso zzso percent ideal body weight zzso zzso percent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso insulin 44 zzso zzso zzso body mass zzso and body fat were measured by zzso zzso The correlation zzso between insulin and zzso was zzso zzso less than zzso Both insulin and zzso correlated highly with percentage zzso percentage body fat, fat mass, zzso body build and upper fat zzso Controlling for these variables simultaneously eliminated the association between insulin and zzso By contrast, the correlations between zzso and measures of body composition and fat distribution retained significance after controlling for insulin zzso These findings suggest that measures of body composition and fat distribution have a relationship with zzso that is not entirely accounted for by serum insulin level, and the relationship between serum insulin and zzso is indirect and largely accounted for by their mutual association with measures of body composition and fat zzso
