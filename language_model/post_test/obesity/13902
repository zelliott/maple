To examine whether high zzso meals with different zzso zzso rates have an effect on the short-term zzso in normal and obese preschool zzso 

In total, 48 children of both zzso 24 normal and 24 obese, according to body mass index, aged between 3 and 6 zzso were selected from children who were attending to a zzso center where they consumed three meals in the zzso 

Rapid zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rate meal were given at lunch, matching energy zzso zzso protein and fat levels, and then the preschool children's energy intake at the subsequent zzso was zzso In this last zzso the children received varied types of zzso foods in higher quantities than the normal zzso 

At lunch, a significant higher energy zzso lesser zzso was observed in both groups, zzso and obese children, when they consumed the zzso zzso In the subsequent zzso a significant effect of zzso zzso rate was demonstrated, but only in obese preschool children, being higher in the meal with rapid zzso rate zzso 

Rapid zzso zzso rate meal produced a zzso lesser zzso in zzso and obese zzso However, only in obese children a significant lesser zzso was observed after consumption of the rapid zzso zzso rate zzso indicating a decreased capacity of energy regulation in obese zzso The finding of the present work could provide dietary strategies required for decreasing prevalence in overweight and obesity in preschool zzso
