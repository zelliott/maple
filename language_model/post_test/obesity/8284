To study the variation tendency of hypertension in two rural areas in zzso and provide zzso evidence to evaluate the hypertension of rural zzso 

Using zzso random sampling method and zzso zzso monitoring, two remote natural villages, zzso and zzso at Yellow river and zzso river valley were selected as hypertension monitoring zzso From 1990 to 2012, clinical examination to the resident above 18 years old was carried out continuously for 23 years, 11 zzso cases were zzso 

zzso prevalence of tested cases increased with years, zzso monitoring site increased from zzso zzso in 1990 to zzso zzso in 2012 with an increase of zzso and zzso monitoring site increased from zzso zzso in 1995 to zzso zzso in 2011 with an increase of zzso Total prevalence of zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso Total hypertension prevalence of 18 - 35 years old group was zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso was higher than zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso Total hypertension prevalence of above 35 years old group was zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso was higher than zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso The growth rates of hypertension prevalence in 18 - 35 years old group of both areas zzso zzso zzso zzso were higher than 35 years old group zzso zzso zzso but the hypertension prevalence of above 35 years old group was higher than 18 - 35 years old zzso zzso prevalence of male was zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso was higher than zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso hypertension prevalence of female was zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was higher than zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso While the difference between male and female had no statistical significance in both zzso 

zzso of the two monitoring points was in high epidemic trend, but with different epidemic zzso From different region and environment research to discuss the cause of hypertension can provide scientific evidence for prevention and zzso
