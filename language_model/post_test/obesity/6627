We examined differentials in the prevalence of 23 zzso health, chronic condition, and behavioral indicators among zzso children of immigrant and zzso zzso 

We used the 2007 National zzso of Children's Health to estimate health differentials among 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso yielded adjusted zzso 

zzso children in each zzso group had a lower prevalence of depression and behavioral problems than native-born zzso The prevalence of zzso varied from zzso among immigrant Asian children to zzso among native-born zzso white and Hispanic zzso zzso children had a lower prevalence of zzso attention deficit zzso deficit zzso zzso zzso zzso learning zzso speech, hearing, and sleep zzso school zzso and zzso 1 chronic condition than native-born children, with health risks increasing markedly in relation to mother's duration of residence in the zzso zzso children had a substantially lower exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, with the odds of exposure being zzso lower among immigrant zzso black, Asian, and Hispanic children compared with native zzso white zzso zzso prevalence ranged from zzso for native-born Asian children to zzso for immigrant Hispanic and native-born zzso black zzso zzso children had higher physical zzso levels than native-born children; however, zzso rates declined with each successive generation of zzso zzso Hispanic children were at increased risk of obesity and sedentary zzso zzso differentials in health and behavioral indicators remained marked after zzso zzso 

zzso patterns in child health and zzso behaviors vary substantially by ethnicity, zzso status, and length of time since zzso Public health programs must target zzso children of both immigrant and zzso zzso
