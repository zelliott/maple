zzso pulmonary oxygen zzso exchange is common during general zzso but there is no clinical zzso as to methods of prevention or zzso We studied 14 patients at risk for pulmonary dysfunction because of increased age, zzso cigarette smoking, or chronic lung zzso Pulmonary zzso exchange was measured during four conditions of zzso awake spontaneous, conventional tidal volume zzso 7 zzso or high tidal volume zzso 12 zzso controlled zzso and five zzso after manual zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso was controlled at zzso and zzso was kept constant by adding dead space during zzso Eight patients were zzso with zzso and six with zzso zzso blood gases were used to calculate the zzso In seven patients zzso worsened after induction of zzso while in seven there was no change or an zzso Manual zzso significantly reduced zzso but changing tidal volume zzso had no zzso Using a zzso model to predict zzso exchange, obesity and type of surgery were significantly associated with zzso while level of VT and zzso gas zzso or zzso were not significant zzso Thus patient and surgical factors were more important zzso of pulmonary gas exchange during zzso than were tidal volume or zzso zzso Manual zzso is a simple and effective zzso to improve gas zzso
