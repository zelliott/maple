Changes in vascular and zzso structure and function have been demonstrated in obese children, but limited data are available on how these changes are zzso The aims of this study were to investigate vascular and zzso changes in obese children with zzso abnormalities and to study the interactions between vascular and zzso zzso 

A zzso prospective zzso study was zzso zzso obese and 27 zzso controls aged 14 zzso 2 years zzso zzso assessment included geometric parameters and zzso deformation zzso and strain zzso analysis by color tissue zzso and zzso zzso zzso assessment included carotid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso measures of the zzso and carotid artery, as well as zzso zzso of zzso zzso and left zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso children compared with controls had lower color tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso strain values zzso zzso zzso vs 56 zzso zzso zzso zzso lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain values zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso and lower zzso zzso zzso early zzso strain rate values zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso thickness was increased, zzso zzso was faster, and zzso zzso zzso were lower in obese zzso The ratio of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso (a marker of zzso zzso was lower in obese children than controls zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Changes in vascular parameters were correlated with changes in zzso zzso deformation zzso 

zzso children with zzso abnormalities have reduced zzso and zzso zzso deformation zzso early vessel wall changes, and increased zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction is suggested by these data and warrants further zzso
