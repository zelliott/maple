The aim of the present study is to examine the differences in fat and zzso zzso zzso during walking and running between zzso and zzso young adult zzso 

19 healthy, zzso (age zzso zzso zzso zzso years, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10) and overweight (age zzso zzso zzso zzso years, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 9) young men volunteered to participate in this zzso Body composition was assessed by zzso zzso zzso oxygen zzso and zzso fat zzso rate were determined with indirect zzso by using an incremental exercise test on a zzso zzso The zzso individual preferred transition speeds between walking and running were zzso zzso zzso was used to calculate fat and zzso zzso during the resting, walking and running zzso 

zzso fat zzso rates during the graded exercise test were not significantly different between the zzso Changes in zzso and fat zzso in the resting, walking and running tests were similar in the zzso and overweight zzso 

The study results suggest that with regard to changes in zzso and fat zzso zzso and zzso individuals have similar responses to walking and running at preferred speeds, despite significant differences in oxygen zzso during activity and body zzso
