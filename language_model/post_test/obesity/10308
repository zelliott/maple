zzso especially central zzso is a zzso trait associated with a high risk for development of diabetes and zzso zzso Combined gene expression analysis of zzso and zzso zzso from zzso and subcutaneous zzso tissue of mice revealed coordinated zzso differences in expression of multiple genes involved in embryonic development and pattern zzso These differences were intrinsic and persisted during in zzso culture and zzso Similar zzso differences in expression of zzso genes were observed in human subcutaneous versus visceral zzso zzso Furthermore, in humans, several genes exhibited changes in expression that correlated closely with body mass index and/or zzso zzso Together, these data suggest that genetically programmed zzso differences in zzso and their precursors in different regions of the body play an important role in zzso body fat distribution, and potential functional differences between internal and subcutaneous zzso zzso
