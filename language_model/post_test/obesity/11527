zzso zzso developed during zzso zzso by the effect of zzso represents an obstacle to the zzso return that may facilitate zzso zzso The aim of this study was to establish the effect of zzso in zzso zzso during zzso 

Prospective study of 31 consecutive patients who underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed zzso after zzso zzso after zzso before zzso release and at the end of zzso Changes of zzso were compared with zzso values and according to age, zzso presence of zzso veins and zzso zzso zzso lower limb zzso Duplex scanning was performed at days 1, 7 and 30 to detect deep zzso zzso zzso 

Average age was 56 years, zzso zzso zzso obese, zzso with zzso veins and the zzso time was zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso decreased progressively during surgery and was significantly reduced with zzso The maximum zzso zzso in the first second was reduced significantly at the end of zzso These reductions were more evident in older zzso 

zzso produces zzso changes on zzso zzso with a diminished zzso return in lower zzso Older patients have higher risk of zzso zzso while obesity can also increase this zzso However, no zzso was demonstrated in this zzso
