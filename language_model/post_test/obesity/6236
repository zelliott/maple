The regulation of feeding by body zzso as proposed by the zzso theory, has been well demonstrated in adult zzso However, mechanisms controlling long-term feeding in juvenile animals have not been well zzso In this study, increased zzso was induced in young rats through oral zzso zzso rats were divided into three zzso ad zzso feeding zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of ad zzso zzso Animals were zzso these levels for one zzso At the end of this period, one third of each group were killed and all remaining animals were returned to ad zzso feeding for either 4 or 29 days zzso During this recovery period, the zzso group had significantly depressed food zzso for the first 4 days in comparison to the zzso zzso zzso there were no significant differences between these two groups for the remainder of zzso zzso induced significant increases in total body fat in the zzso group zzso zzso in comparison to the zzso group zzso zzso and the zzso group zzso zzso By day five of recovery, only the zzso group exhibited a significant loss of body zzso Total carcass protein and ash were not different between groups at any zzso At day 29 of recovery, there were no treatment differences in carcass weight or fat zzso Loss of body fat from the zzso rats was associated with the decline in caloric zzso It appears that food intake is affected by relative zzso during the dynamic phase of zzso
