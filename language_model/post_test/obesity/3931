zzso is an zzso zzso into circulation in three zzso The aim of the study was to investigate changes of zzso zzso during profound weight loss and its relation to zzso and zzso zzso 

Thirteen severely obese female subjects were examined before and 1 year after surgical zzso Total zzso was determined by zzso zzso and zzso composition was detected by zzso Western zzso 

zzso decreased substantially zzso zzso which was associated with an increase of total zzso from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso molecular weight zzso zzso increased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas high zzso and low molecular weight zzso remained zzso Delta values of total zzso correlated significantly with Delta values of zzso zzso Similar correlations were found for Delta values of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Delta zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Delta fat zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

Thus, profound weight loss was associated with an increase in total zzso which was mainly and consistently caused by increases in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These changes result in a shift from low molecular weight to zzso and zzso zzso zzso which may be related to improvements in both zzso and zzso zzso
