zzso zzso 3 zzso largely expressed in skeletal muscle, is modulated by cold, zzso hormones, zzso zzso and exercise training among other factors in a zzso zzso In brown zzso zzso there is an increase in zzso levels after high-fat feeding and zzso zzso zzso zzso effects of these agents have been reported in skeletal zzso The aim of this experimental trial was to evaluate the effect of high-fat feeding and zzso agent treatment on skeletal muscle zzso expression zzso zzso rats were fed a cafeteria diet for 30 days and found to have significantly higher fat stores and body weight than control rats at the end of the experimental zzso When zzso rats were daily zzso injected with zzso for 30 zzso a decrease in total fat mass and body weight was zzso Such an effect was not observed in zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso muscle zzso zzso levels were significantly reduced in zzso rats when compared to lean zzso Likewise, zzso zzso consumption in zzso muscle was also significantly decreased zzso in zzso rats as compared to the control zzso It is suggested that the zzso of zzso gene expression together with the lower zzso consumption observed in high fat fed rats may be linked to lower fatty zzso which would promote zzso zzso
