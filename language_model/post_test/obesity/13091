zzso zzso injury has been implicated in progressive forms of zzso however, a role for zzso in type 2 diabetic zzso the major cause of zzso zzso failure, has not been zzso zzso we examined whether zzso may promote the progression of type 2 diabetic zzso in zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso injury was examined in zzso mice with varying blood sugar and zzso levels at 8 months of zzso The association of zzso injury with the zzso of kidney zzso was analyzed in normal zzso and diabetic zzso mice at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months of zzso 

In zzso mice, zzso and increased plasma zzso correlated with elevated blood zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels but not with obesity or zzso Progressive diabetic zzso in zzso mice was associated with increased kidney zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso mice correlated with zzso zzso levels, zzso elevated plasma zzso zzso and zzso damage, zzso fibrosis, and kidney expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso migration zzso factor zzso zzso factor zzso The zzso and zzso of zzso zzso also correlated with increased zzso zzso and zzso deposition, which was itself dependent on zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is associated with the progression of type 2 diabetic zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in diabetic zzso zzso is associated with prolonged zzso zzso immune complex deposition, and increased kidney zzso production, and raises the possibility of specific therapies for targeting zzso injury in diabetic zzso
