We applied a comparative functional zzso approach to evaluate whether zzso obese zzso rats serve as an effective obesity zzso 

zzso profiles of zzso fat from zzso and lean rats were generated using zzso and compared with the published array data of obese and non-obese human subcutaneous zzso 

zzso intake and fuel efficiency were significantly higher in zzso rats, which resulted in increased body weight and zzso zzso zzso cholesterol, zzso insulin, and zzso levels in zzso rats were significantly higher than those in the lean zzso zzso rats also exhibited impaired insulin zzso A direct comparison of zzso profiles from zzso and lean rats and those from obese and non-obese humans revealed that global zzso patterns in zzso rat fat resemble those of obese human zzso zzso expressed genes between obese and non-obese subjects in both human and rat studies were identified and associated with biological pathways by mapping genes to Gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes and zzso genes exhibited significant zzso in both obese humans and zzso rats when compared with non-obese zzso However, genes in fatty acid metabolism and zzso exhibited a broad zzso only in obese human zzso but not in zzso rat zzso zzso 

Our study based on zzso profiling suggested that zzso rats in general represent an appropriate obesity zzso However, the discrepancies in zzso zzso between zzso rats and obese humans, particularly in the zzso zzso may explain the limitations of using zzso zzso models in obesity research and drug zzso
