Unlike the intensive research in pursuit of understanding the molecular mechanisms of insulin signaling and resistance to its biological action associated most significantly with obesity and type 2 diabetes, the influence of the plasma membrane on insulin sensitivity has been zzso studied over the zzso because it was thought that zzso of insulin action, such as the insulin zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso more or less zzso in the lipids that form cell zzso Recent insights into membrane physiology suggest that the plasma membrane impacts the function of membrane proteins zzso insulin zzso Furthermore, membrane disturbances may be the basis of insulin zzso zzso insulin signal zzso data in terms of plasma membrane and insulin resistance are the focus of this zzso The discussion visits the cell membrane hypothesis of insulin resistance that suggests insulin action could be related to changes in cell membrane zzso
