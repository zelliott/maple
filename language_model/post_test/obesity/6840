It remains unclear whether the zzso effect of body mass index zzso on zzso levels translates to inappropriate prostate cancer zzso screening in obese zzso To address this, we conducted two zzso zzso studies within prospective zzso of men undergoing radical zzso for newly diagnosed zzso 

We identified zzso men with zzso zzso zzso and zzso men with zzso zzso zzso who underwent surgery to treat zzso at Mayo Clinic in Rochester between 2000 and zzso Cases and controls were frequency matched on age and zzso zzso In a similar manner, we identified 206 cases and 133 controls treated at Mayo Clinic in Florida between 2006 and zzso We employed zzso zzso models to evaluate the association of zzso features of aggressiveness with obesity zzso 

After adjusting for age and zzso level, we noted that obese men in the Rochester population are more likely to present with zzso grade 8-10 tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso stage disease zzso zzso zzso zzso We noted a similar association seminal zzso involvement zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the smaller Florida population supported these same associations but did not achieve conventional statistical zzso 

zzso men present with more aggressive zzso tumors compared with non-obese men of similar age and zzso screening zzso If confirmed, this would support the need to explore zzso screening in obese men to possibly account for a zzso zzso
