Data on the skeletal muscle characteristics of patients and animals with zzso diseases are zzso We investigated zzso expression levels and fiber profiles in the skeletal muscles of rats with zzso diabetes, hypertension, and/or zzso 

The zzso expression levels of zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor A zzso in the zzso muscles were compared among zzso control zzso type 2 diabetic zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The fiber profiles in the zzso muscles of these rats were also zzso 

zzso rats showed lower zzso zzso and zzso expression levels than WR zzso zzso rats showed higher zzso and zzso and lower zzso expression levels than WR zzso zzso rats showed lower zzso and higher zzso expression levels than WR zzso The muscles of zzso zzso and zzso rats had zzso type I and zzso type zzso and type zzso zzso whereas the muscle of zzso rats had only zzso type I zzso 

The skeletal muscles of rats with zzso diseases have unique zzso zzso patterns and fiber profiles depending on the type of zzso For example, the lower zzso and zzso zzso expression levels in the zzso muscles of type 2 diabetic rats are associated with the presence of only zzso type I fibers in the zzso
