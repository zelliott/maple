Development of effective treatment or, more zzso preventative measures against zzso and cardiovascular disease will require animal models that mimic the disease processes seen in humans and permit identification of the genetic and zzso zzso The zzso is normally resistant to cardiovascular disease, but a number of genetic zzso make affected strains of rats highly susceptible to zzso and zzso and zzso disease that is highly analogous to human zzso These models of obesity develop the zzso syndrome and type 2 diabetes, zzso zzso vascular and zzso dysfunction, and zzso zzso in the heart and zzso The models offer the prospect of both genetic and molecular biology studies that are linked directly to spontaneous cardiovascular disease and exploration of putative preventative or treatment approaches, including pharmaceutical zzso Use of small animal models of cardiovascular disease is dependent on appropriate experimental design and techniques that take account of the complex nature of the disease zzso zzso experimental procedures for the use of rat models, including handling and treatment of animals, choice of experimental variables and zzso zzso methods, and zzso and electron zzso techniques are covered in this zzso
