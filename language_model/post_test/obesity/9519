During a total fast in obese subjects, the daily rate of nitrogen zzso zzso only a small further decline after 2 zzso the zzso rate being about 5 g zzso At this time, ammonium and zzso each constitute about one-half of this zzso The purpose of this study was to consider two alternative zzso first, that the near plateau in nitrogen zzso represents an zzso minimum rate of net protein breakdown in order to supply essential zzso with calories in the form of zzso second, that protein breakdown could be further reduced by minimizing the requirement to provide nitrogen for ammonium zzso during the zzso of zzso Because ammonium zzso is largely controlled by zzso balance, 150 zzso of sodium zzso plus 60 zzso of zzso zzso were administered daily to decrease ammonium zzso in eight obese subjects who were totally zzso for more than 14 zzso zzso ammonium nitrogen fell with this treatment (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso g zzso zzso In addition, there was a smaller fall in the rate of zzso zzso (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso g zzso zzso together with a fall in the blood zzso zzso zzso it appears that ammonium zzso contributes to the negative nitrogen balance of a prolonged total fast, as assessed over a zzso period of zzso is responsible for about one-third of the net lean body mass zzso
