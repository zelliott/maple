zzso cerebral zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Its zzso is zzso and predicting onset can be zzso Diabetes zzso zzso is known to affect zzso properties of vessels, but it has not been definitively correlated with zzso We report that pre-existing zzso is independently and strongly correlated with zzso despite intensive zzso zzso 

This is a retrospective chart review of all patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso admitted to a single academic medical center between January 2002 and January 2008 zzso zzso zzso Patients presenting greater than 14 days after zzso as well as those not surviving the first 3 days zzso were excluded from zzso zzso patients zzso zzso zzso were assessed for study parameters including pre-existing zzso mean daily blood zzso and additional known zzso to zzso zzso analysis was performed to assess risk factors for zzso zzso The primary outcome measure was zzso defined as neurological change in conjunction with evidence of vessel zzso by either zzso or zzso zzso 

Of 113 patients included in the study, 42 zzso had zzso Patients with zzso zzso zzso of zzso had an increased risk of subsequently developing zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso blood zzso was not associated with increased risk of zzso and no difference in zzso control was noted between patients with or without zzso zzso resulted in worsened mortality and zzso zzso zzso for survivors zzso zzso 

In this group of patients with zzso diabetes zzso is identified as a risk factor for development of zzso Blood zzso management during hospitalization was similar in diabetics and zzso suggesting that the longstanding effects of zzso disease may be more relevant in the development of zzso then acute zzso control in these zzso
