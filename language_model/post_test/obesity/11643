Low plasma zzso of high density zzso zzso cholesterol and zzso zzso zzso are major risk factors for coronary heart disease zzso Low HDL levels are common in patients with zzso but they also occur in those with normal plasma zzso the latter include obese patients and cigarette smokers, though other patients with low HDL levels are neither obese nor zzso The present study was designed to define zzso causes of low zzso levels in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies were carried out in two groups of zzso patients having low HDL levels to determine input rates and residence times for zzso these patients included 11 zzso nonsmokers and 11 zzso cigarette zzso Their results were compared to those of 20 zzso zzso controls with normal HDL levels and 12 obese nonsmokers also having low zzso In all three groups zzso low zzso and low zzso levels, residence times for plasma zzso were reduced by approximately zzso compared to control subjects with normal HDL zzso In contrast, average input rates for zzso were similar among the three zzso patients and control zzso No differences in zzso zzso were observed among any of the three groups with low zzso zzso Within each of the four groups of the study, however, input rates for zzso were highly correlated with plasma zzso of zzso Thus, for individuals with normal levels of plasma zzso both residence times and input rates for zzso appeared to be important zzso of zzso zzso zzso times for zzso were reduced in almost all patients with low zzso levels, regardless of zzso factors, whereas input rates were highly variable among zzso
