zzso has risen at an epidemic rate over the past 20 years in the zzso To our knowledge, there is an absence of data evaluating the impact of obesity in the critically ill trauma zzso 

Prospective data were collected on zzso patients admitted to the zzso over a zzso zzso zzso was defined as a body mass index zzso as weight zzso zzso of 30 or zzso Outcomes analyzed included infection rate, hospital and zzso length of stay, and zzso Multiple zzso zzso was used to evaluate outcomes between obese and zzso patients for infection zzso versus zzso and mortality zzso versus not zzso Continuous outcomes such as hospital and zzso lengths of stay were evaluated using multiple linear zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso patients were zzso The majority zzso of injuries in the study cohort were zzso Although the majority of patients were men zzso women zzso versus zzso were more likely to be obese zzso zzso zzso patients had a more than twofold increase in risk of acquiring a zzso urinary zzso or respiratory infection, or being admitted to the zzso zzso zzso after statistically controlling for age and zzso zzso zzso When controlling for diabetes, zzso zzso age, zzso and zzso zzso zzso obese patients were zzso times zzso zzso zzso more likely to die in the zzso 

zzso is associated with a substantial increase in morbidity and mortality in the critically ill trauma zzso Future studies are warranted in both the prevention of infection and intensive care management of the obese trauma zzso
