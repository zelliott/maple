There is limited knowledge of zzso zzso Disease zzso among high risk zzso especially in the developing zzso We report our study of testing for zzso in zzso zzso 

In a zzso study, zzso people from primary and secondary health care areas in the city of zzso were studied from a random sample of zzso zzso with hypertension, diabetes, zzso or zzso We measured blood pressure zzso blood zzso level, zzso body mass index, and estimated zzso zzso rate zzso by zzso zzso using zzso zzso levels based on one random zzso The associations between health zzso indicators of kidney damage zzso and kidney function zzso zzso zzso were also zzso 

The prevalence of zzso in this study was zzso but only zzso were aware of their zzso zzso of patients had stage 1 zzso zzso stage 2, zzso stage 3, zzso stage 4, and zzso had stage zzso 24 hour quantitative zzso zzso zzso was found in zzso In those with the zzso conditions, the % of zzso was: zzso in patients with hypertension, zzso in those with zzso zzso in the obese and zzso in those who were zzso zzso of those with a history of diabetes had elevated serum zzso levels at screening zzso 126 zzso Only zzso of individuals with hypertension having zzso had reduced zzso to lower than zzso zzso In zzso analysis, diabetes, zzso and hypertension were the strongest zzso of zzso zzso 

It appears that one out of three people in this zzso population has zzso zzso and poorly controlled zzso risk zzso This growing problem poses clear challenges to this developing zzso zzso zzso should be addressed through the development of multidisciplinary teams and improved communication between traditional health care givers and zzso zzso Attention to zzso risk factors must become a zzso
