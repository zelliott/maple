In order to study risk factors associated with zzso in a general adult population, zzso subjects in the Tucson zzso Study of zzso Airways Disease were surveyed to determine the prevalence of zzso Major independent risk factors for zzso were male zzso age between 40 and 64 years, zzso and current cigarette zzso Furthermore, greater intensity of cigarette smoking also was associated with higher zzso prevalence zzso zzso prevalence remained elevated in subjects who recently quit smoking, but declined in zzso to the level of never smokers within four years of smoking zzso The presence of cough or zzso production was associated with an increase in zzso prevalence especially in zzso zzso prevalence was slightly increased in subjects who regularly used alcohol or medications as aids to zzso We conclude that cigarette smoking, zzso male zzso age over 40, and use of alcohol or sleep medications are important risk factors for zzso We propose that the effect of smoking may be related to the production of upper airway inflammation and zzso by cigarette smoke, and that smoking zzso may eventually reduce zzso zzso
