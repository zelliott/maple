zzso restriction zzso improves zzso insulin resistance through undefined molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been proposed to zzso insulin sensitivity through zzso of zzso zzso The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that changes in the activity of zzso zzso zzso may zzso the molecular mechanism of zzso in improving insulin zzso zzso and lean zzso rats were subjected to zzso zzso or allowed to feed ad zzso zzso for 20 zzso body weight and insulin sensitivity were monitored throughout this zzso The activity of zzso zzso zzso - including zzso zzso zzso zzso as listed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as listed in the zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso in liver tissue extracts was measured by an in zzso zzso zzso using various zzso zzso fragments as zzso while zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was determined by western zzso using zzso zzso zzso in obese rats significantly reduced body weight and increased insulin sensitivity compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso activity toward zzso zzso to zzso in human zzso and zzso zzso to zzso in human zzso was increased in obese rats compared to lean zzso and was markedly decreased following zzso zzso obesity increased and zzso decreased the activity of zzso zzso and zzso against zzso The close association between the activity of zzso zzso and zzso with insulin resistance suggests an important role for zzso and zzso in the development of insulin resistance, presumably via zzso of zzso zzso
