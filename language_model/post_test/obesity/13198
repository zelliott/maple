For obese older zzso zzso is both functionally important and a means of weight zzso The relationship between weight and zzso is not known in this zzso Also, the extent to which pain interferes with zzso is not zzso 

To examine the relationship between obesity and zzso and to determine the effect of pain and body mass index zzso on zzso in older zzso 

zzso study of 82 older zzso ages zzso zzso some with no back pain recruited from the community, others with back pain or spinal zzso recruited from a magnetic resonance imaging zzso scanner as part of a larger university study of spinal zzso 

Age, Visual zzso zzso for pain, zzso patient diagnosis (no pain, mechanical back pain, and spinal zzso walking zzso and stride length on a zzso laboratory zzso test, and zzso community zzso measured with a zzso zzso distance, and energy zzso 

zzso had a significant inverse relationship with ambulatory zzso in terms of the distance zzso steps taken, and walking zzso zzso severity and pain category also had a significant inverse relationship with these zzso A negative correlation was observed between pain and zzso although the relationship was statistically zzso 

zzso older people walked less than the zzso older zzso zzso was associated with decreased zzso zzso who intend to encourage increased zzso in older obese persons should consider possible barriers posed by musculoskeletal zzso
