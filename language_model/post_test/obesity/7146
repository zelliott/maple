To verify whether zzso responsiveness to zzso is associated with zzso syndrome risk zzso 

zzso zzso 

We studied 169 consecutive patients, mean zzso years, with overweight zzso or obesity zzso 

zzso analysis was used to generate three clusters based on zzso responsiveness to increasing doses of zzso zzso of zzso syndrome risk factors of the three clusters were compared by zzso zzso 

zzso responsiveness to zzso was absent in cluster 1, whereas cluster 3 had the greatest zzso zzso response to zzso zzso Plasma zzso levels significantly decreased from cluster 1 to cluster 3 in both zzso Patients in cluster 2 had an intermediate profile of zzso zzso zzso body mass index zzso values were more frequent in zzso whereas the prevalence of high waist zzso as well as zzso and hypertension, increased with increasing responsiveness to zzso from cluster 1 to cluster zzso zzso of zzso syndrome risk factors qualified as group specific in zzso of the cluster 1, zzso of the cluster 2 and zzso of the cluster zzso zzso zzso waist zzso plasma zzso and zzso defined distinctive patterns of zzso syndrome risk factors in the zzso 

In overweight and obese zzso zzso syndrome risk factors parallel to some extent zzso responsiveness to zzso Such a correlation involves plasma zzso levels, waist zzso plasma zzso and zzso and may contribute to the excess risk of cardiovascular events in overweight and obese zzso
