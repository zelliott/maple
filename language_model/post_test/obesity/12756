zzso insulin resistance, and obesity are common features of zzso zzso syndrome zzso This study was designed to investigate the relationship among these factors and how they might contribute to zzso dysfunction in zzso zzso zzso zzso and insulin resistance were zzso in zzso women with zzso and in three groups of zzso zzso zzso zzso women, obese zzso women, and thin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was defined as the zzso response to synthetic zzso zzso resistance was estimated by calculating the area under the curve for serum insulin levels in response to a 75 g oral zzso zzso The mean serum zzso response zzso to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was greater than that in zzso zzso women zzso zzso zzso P zzso obese zzso women zzso zzso zzso P zzso and lean zzso women zzso zzso zzso P zzso The serum zzso response was not correlated with body mass index zzso The area under the curve for serum insulin zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was greater zzso zzso than in zzso zzso women zzso zzso zzso obese zzso women zzso zzso zzso and lean zzso women zzso zzso zzso The serum insulin response was highly correlated with zzso zzso zzso in the three groups of obese women, but women with zzso became significantly more insulin resistant with increasing zzso zzso zzso There was no correlation between adrenal zzso zzso and insulin resistance in any of the zzso We conclude that adrenal zzso and insulin resistance are independent zzso of zzso in zzso zzso These conditions are present in both zzso and zzso zzso women, but are present to a greater extent in zzso zzso zzso women with zzso also differ from zzso controls by developing a greater degree of insulin resistance as body mass zzso
