zzso Acid Transport zzso 5 zzso is a zzso member of the zzso family, which has been shown to exhibit both fatty acid transport and zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso Here, we investigate its role in zzso acid metabolism and body weight zzso in zzso by using a novel zzso knockout mouse zzso 

zzso acid composition was analyzed by mass zzso Body weight, food zzso energy zzso and fat zzso were determined in animals fed either a low- or a high-fat zzso 

Although total zzso acid zzso were unchanged in zzso liver, zzso and feces of zzso knockout mice, the majority of gallbladder zzso acids was zzso and only a small percentage was zzso zzso but not secondary, zzso acids were detected among the remaining zzso forms in zzso deletion mice, suggesting a specific requirement for zzso in zzso of zzso acids during the zzso zzso Fat zzso in zzso deletion mice was largely normal, and only a small increase in zzso fat was observed on a high-fat zzso Despite normal fat zzso zzso deletion mice failed to gain weight on a high-fat diet because of both decreased food intake and increased energy zzso 

Our findings reveal an important role for zzso in zzso acid zzso in zzso and an unexpected function in body weight zzso which will require further zzso zzso deletion mice provide a new model to study the intersection of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and body weight zzso
