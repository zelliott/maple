We examined the long-term zzso effects of zzso gastrointestinal therapeutic system zzso a potent zzso zzso in impaired zzso zzso first-degree relatives of African American patients with type 2 zzso To this end, we assessed zzso zzso zzso function, insulin sensitivity zzso and zzso effectiveness zzso in patients with zzso before and at yearly intervals for 24 months of zzso or an identical zzso in a randomized, zzso zzso zzso zzso patients were zzso to receive either zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso 9; mean age, zzso zzso zzso years; mean body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or identical zzso zzso zzso zzso 9; mean age, zzso zzso zzso years; mean zzso 39 zzso zzso zzso for 24 zzso Each of the subjects underwent oral zzso tolerance test zzso and frequently sampled intravenous zzso tolerance test zzso at baseline and yearly intervals for 2 zzso zzso and zzso were determined by zzso minimal model zzso The ability of beta cell to compensate for peripheral insulin resistance was calculated as the disposition index zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso attenuated serum zzso responses to oral zzso challenge at 12 and 24 months when compared to baseline zzso zzso In contrast, serum zzso levels at zzso and during zzso tended to increase in the zzso group at 12 and 24 months when compared to zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso to zzso and serum zzso levels progressively increased in the zzso group at 12 and 24 months versus 0 zzso In contrast, serum insulin and zzso responses remained unchanged in the zzso zzso During zzso chronic zzso was associated with significant improvement in the blunted acute first insulin release in the zzso patients at 12 and 24 zzso These parameters remained blunted in the zzso zzso We found that zzso increased in the zzso group at 12 months zzso zzso and 24 zzso zzso versus zzso but deteriorated in the zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso significantly zzso zzso increased following zzso therapy at 12 and 24 months when compared to zzso In contrast, zzso did not change from baseline values in the zzso group throughout the study zzso zzso zzso partially restored the ability of beta cells to compensate for peripheral insulin resistance (as assessed by zzso zzso was well tolerated without any symptoms suggestive of either zzso or significant weight zzso In zzso long-term chronic zzso zzso administration improved zzso zzso by increasing zzso responsiveness to zzso improving zzso as well as significantly improved zzso but not zzso in zzso obese African Americans with zzso Our study demonstrated that zzso appears to prime beta cells to intravenous zzso stimulation resulting in restoration of zzso acute zzso and zzso insulin zzso in African Americans with zzso We conclude that zzso might be considered as a useful agent in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes in zzso obese African American patients with zzso
