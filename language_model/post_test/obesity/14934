The role of zzso dysfunction in the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes remains zzso In order to specifically define the relationship between insulin zzso zzso zzso insulin resistance, zzso zzso and zzso function, we analyzed zzso performance of zzso zzso muscle in four different mouse zzso In obese but zzso zzso mice as well as in obese but diabetic mice under high-fat diet, zzso performance remained unchanged even though zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, in zzso zzso knockout zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso mice, levels of zzso respiratory chain complexes and zzso function were markedly zzso In zzso but not in zzso mice, this was caused by reduced zzso of zzso genes zzso via decreased zzso zzso We conclude that zzso dysfunction is not zzso involved in the zzso of zzso insulin resistance under zzso zzso However, zzso type 2 diabetes and zzso of zzso or zzso is not associated with impaired zzso zzso In contrast, chronic zzso and zzso as seen in zzso mice as well as zzso zzso in muscle of zzso mice lead to zzso zzso We zzso that decreased zzso mass and/or performance in skeletal muscle of zzso obese or type 2 zzso obese patients observed in clinical studies must be explained by genetic zzso physical zzso or other still unknown zzso
