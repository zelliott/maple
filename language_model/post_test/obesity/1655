The zzso and interpretation of zzso fitness zzso in obesity is important for adequately assessing cardiovascular zzso underlying zzso and properly evaluating disease zzso We zzso compared peak oxygen zzso zzso zzso zzso in absolute terms, and relative terms zzso zzso using three currently suggested prediction equations zzso zzso W, and zzso 

There were 19 zzso and 66 obese zzso zzso underwent zzso weighing and incremental cycling to zzso zzso characteristics were analyzed by independent zzso test, and % predicted zzso by a zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso with repeated measures on one factor zzso 

zzso zzso was not different between zzso and obese adults zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was higher zzso zzso relative to body mass and lean body mass in the zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso vs 22 zzso 5 zzso 42 zzso 9 zzso body mass vs 37 zzso 6 zzso body zzso zzso fitness assessed as % predicted was not different in the zzso and obese zzso zzso zzso predicted vs zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso while using zzso W and G, zzso was lower zzso zzso but within normal limits in the obese zzso zzso 15 vs 87 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso predicted vs zzso zzso zzso predicted, respectively), depending somewhat on zzso 

Traditional methods of reporting zzso do not allow adequate assessment and zzso of zzso in obese zzso zzso zzso does allow a zzso evaluation of zzso in the obese, although care must be taken in selecting the most appropriate prediction zzso especially in zzso In general, otherwise healthy obese are not zzso zzso as is commonly believed, although zzso may be slightly higher in zzso subjects depending on the uniqueness of the prediction zzso
