zzso The regulation of zzso was studied in 14 zzso obese women aged zzso zzso zzso subcutaneous zzso from the abdominal region were examined before and after an 8 to zzso weight reduction zzso during which the mean body mass index zzso of the group was reduced from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso Fat cell volume was reduced from zzso zzso 39 to 655 zzso 45 zzso The sensitivity to zzso stimulation of zzso in zzso increased fivefold after weight zzso A corresponding increase in sensitivity was found with the beta zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the number of beta zzso binding sites as assessed by zzso binding with zzso zzso was not zzso No changes were observed when zzso (a beta zzso zzso zzso and zzso (an alpha zzso zzso were zzso zzso The zzso zzso rates decreased by about 50% after weight reduction and the maximum zzso activity of zzso zzso was also reduced by almost zzso zzso Plasma zzso of insulin, zzso and total testosterone decreased and sex zzso zzso increased after weight zzso zzso apparent free testosterone levels decreased by more than zzso after weight zzso zzso In conclusion, weight reduction leads to increased efficiency of zzso zzso with decreased resting zzso rate but increased sensitivity to stimulation by zzso which may be attributed to a decreased activity of zzso zzso and an increased sensitivity of beta zzso Changes in circulating levels of zzso insulin and testosterone may play a role in these modifications of zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
