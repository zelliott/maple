zzso are the only hormones with pronounced zzso action in zzso A number of in zzso and in zzso studies suggest that there is zzso resistance to catecholamines in subcutaneous zzso zzso which is the major fat depot in obese zzso This is due to multiple zzso in zzso signal zzso involving decreased expression and function of zzso increased function of zzso and decreased ability of zzso zzso zzso to stimulate hormone sensitive zzso A sedentary zzso which usually characterizes zzso may contribute to the zzso zzso However, zzso factors may also be zzso Recently, decreased expression and function of hormone sensitive zzso has been found in subcutaneous zzso of non-obese subjects with zzso for zzso In addition, zzso in the genes for zzso zzso and hormone sensitive zzso associate with zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso in visceral zzso tissue is increased in obesity due to increased function of zzso zzso zzso decreased function of zzso and increased ability of zzso zzso to stimulate zzso When the findings in different zzso regions are considered together, it appears that there is a zzso of zzso and thereby fatty acid zzso in zzso zzso the visceral fat zzso This leads to an increase in the circulating fatty acid levels in the portal zzso which connects visceral fat with the zzso As a consequence, the liver function may be altered leading to zzso zzso and zzso which usually accompany the obese zzso
