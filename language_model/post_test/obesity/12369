zzso has been established as an effective screening tool for the early detection of breast zzso zzso may lead to increased breast size and has been linked to increased rates of breast zzso As women with larger breasts may be predisposed to developing cancer, it is important that zzso is an appropriate test in these zzso This study investigated the sensitivity and specificity of zzso in women with larger breasts in a population screening zzso 

Data was obtained from zzso eligible screening episodes of women aged over zzso Of these episodes, zzso were eligible for the study, with zzso zzso zzso deemed to have large zzso Large breasts were defined as those for whom at least one large cassette was used in the zzso zzso Those women having only four standard zzso per screen were classified as having average size breasts zzso screens, zzso Cancer detection rates, zzso cancer rates zzso zzso and recall to assessment rates were compared for women examined on standard sized zzso versus large zzso Chance corrected measures of sensitivity and specificity and zzso confidence intervals zzso were calculated for women with and without large zzso 

The study found that the sensitivity and specificity of zzso was greater for larger zzso zzso The zzso of breast cancer was also found to be higher in woman with larger breasts in the combined population zzso per 100,000 zzso zzso zzso in large zzso women versus zzso zzso zzso zzso in other zzso and in each of the specific age zzso This study confirms the appropriateness of zzso screening for women with large zzso
