To evaluate the expression of zzso zzso type 1 zzso in zzso zzso tissue of patients with zzso syndrome and simple zzso compared with normal weight zzso 

We have performed a zzso study and studied zzso zzso tissue from a total of 24 subjects zzso obese subjects, ten patients with zzso syndrome due to adrenal zzso and six normal weight zzso Body mass index, blood pressure, plasma zzso plasma insulin, plasma zzso urinary free cortisol and post zzso plasma cortisol were measured with standard zzso zzso zzso and protein expression were evaluated in real-time zzso and western zzso analysis zzso 

zzso zzso was zzso higher in obese subjects compared with controls zzso No differences were found between zzso patients and zzso Western zzso analysis supported the zzso expression zzso 

Our data show the involvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso which is more evident in severely obese patients than in zzso syndrome zzso The lack of increase of zzso expression in zzso syndrome could suggest zzso of the zzso as a result of long-term zzso
