zzso diets containing a low zzso or high zzso dose of zzso protein concentrate enriched with zzso were fed to obese zzso rats for 6 zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso reduced the fatty liver and decreased the plasma levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso This was accompanied by increased activities of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso fatty acid zzso and zzso zzso in liver and increased zzso level in zzso The decreased fatty liver and the increased plasma zzso level appeared not to be caused by an increased zzso of zzso as zzso decreased the zzso zzso levels of zzso B and zzso zzso However, the gene expression of zzso zzso was markedly decreased in liver, but unchanged in zzso white zzso tissue and skeletal muscle of rats fed zzso indicating that the liver may be the key organ for the reduced clearance of zzso zzso from plasma after zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso ratios were increased in liver zzso by zzso The zzso in liver of rats fed zzso contained a low level of zzso and a high level of zzso zzso the production of zzso zzso When obese zzso rats were fed zzso zzso this also resulted in reduced fatty liver, possibly through reduced clearance of zzso by the zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso concentrate as well as zzso protein may be promising dietary supplements for treatment of zzso fatty zzso
