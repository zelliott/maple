As exhaustion and pain during walking seem to be common problems among obese women, we decided to zzso the relative oxygen cost zzso zzso in obese women during level zzso 

zzso obese female zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Walking tests at a zzso comfortable speed were performed zzso Speed was measured with a zzso oxygen consumption zzso with the zzso method and oxygen cost was zzso Heart rate was zzso perceived exertion and pain were assessed with zzso Category zzso scale, zzso zzso oxygen zzso zzso was predicted from a zzso bicycle zzso zzso 

The women walked more slowly, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and had higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso A majority experienced exertion and some experienced zzso Their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was less than for zzso zzso zzso The mean % zzso during walking was zzso which was higher than in normal subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso correlations between % zzso and zzso zzso zzso heart rate during walking zzso zzso zzso and age zzso zzso zzso respectively, were zzso 

Very low zzso in obese women, rather than severe obesity per se, seems the most important factor to cause high % zzso during zzso This might explain why many obese women perceive the exertion to be excessive and cannot follow the advice of their clinicians to exercise through long and brisk zzso
