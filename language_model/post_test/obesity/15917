We analyzed the natural killer cell zzso zzso zzso genes and zzso zzso in the development of type 2 diabetes zzso based on body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in Puerto Rican zzso zzso interactions between the zzso zzso A zzso zzso and its fraction containing two zzso receptors zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso were zzso We found a significant association between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and its interaction with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso not zzso only in non-obese zzso This association were due to the interactions between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso in zzso patients zzso zzso Analysis based on zzso demonstrated associations in both obese zzso zzso zzso zzso and non-obese individuals zzso zzso zzso zzso By contrast, the interaction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso was associated with zzso only in non-obese individuals zzso zzso zzso zzso As expected, interaction of both zzso and its zzso with zzso group's zzso were zzso We used zzso short tandem repeats zzso that distinguish major populations to determine genetic zzso and found that there was no genetic zzso in our zzso Our findings are consistent with the possibility of an zzso and/or zzso component in the zzso of zzso zzso receptors with chronic inflammation in obese and genetic interactions with zzso zzso in zzso non-obese possibly zzso zzso
