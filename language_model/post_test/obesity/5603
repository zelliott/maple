In men, a higher zzso intake was a significant independent predictor for lower levels of zzso zzso and zzso an increased saturated fat intake and a lower intake of cereal zzso predicted a higher zzso a higher zzso fat intake and a lower zzso index of the diet determined lower levels of zzso and zzso and a moderate consumption of alcohol determined an increased zzso In women, a higher zzso intake predicted a lower zzso and a thinner zzso no alcohol consumption determined a lower zzso and an increased intake of saturated fat and a lower consumption of cereal zzso were significant independent zzso for a higher zzso 

A modified fat zzso an increase of zzso and cereal zzso intake and a preferred consumption of low zzso index foods are independently related to lower measures of body weight in European persons with type 1 zzso
