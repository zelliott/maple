To investigate zzso and its zzso content in plasma and zzso for a complete picture of zzso status in obese zzso 

Comparative study of the zzso status of obese vs normal zzso 

In all, 10 healthy, overweight, fertile age women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 10 normal women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

a zzso liquid zzso zzso method for the determination of zzso and its zzso in the plasma and zzso of the zzso 

The major findings were: zzso significant decrease of plasma zzso its zzso and total zzso contents in obese vs normal zzso zzso significant decrease of zzso zzso zzso and total zzso content in obese vs normal zzso zzso significant increase in plasma zzso zzso ratio (in practice, it was zzso and corresponding decrease of the plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio in obese vs normal women, where plasma zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso contents are an index of zzso zzso 

This study advances the hypothesis that obese women maintain higher levels of zzso compared to normal weight subjects by storing greater amounts of zzso in cells through preferential zzso zzso recycling to compensate for relatively lower levels of zzso
