The medical demand for useful zzso is large and still zzso This is especially true for cancer, because for this disease adequate diagnostic markers with high specificity and sensitivity are still zzso Despite advances in imaging technologies for early detection of cancer, zzso multiplex techniques evolved in recent years will provide new opportunities for detection of low molecular weight zzso zzso zzso zzso by mass zzso zzso in zzso research were made based on separation of peptides and/or proteins by their zzso properties in combination with mass zzso zzso respectively zzso and sophisticated zzso tools for data zzso To evaluate the potential of zzso tumor marker detection by differential zzso display zzso we analyzed plasma samples from a tumor graft zzso After subcutaneous injection of zzso cells in zzso mice and their growth to a palpable zzso plasma samples were analyzed by zzso The comparison of obtained mass zzso data allows discovery of tumor specific peptides which fit well into the biological context of cancer zzso and show a strong correlation to tumor zzso The identified peptides indicate events associated with zzso and zzso of cells from an zzso origin, which are typical characteristics of human zzso We conclude that these findings are a zzso of zzso to detect zzso zzso zzso peptides in plasma of zzso zzso
