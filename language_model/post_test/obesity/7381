zzso studies showed worsening of cardiovascular risk factors with increasing severity of childhood zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of obesity dynamics on cardiovascular risk factors and on the stability of the diagnosis of zzso syndrome zzso in obese zzso 

A zzso assessment of components of the zzso using two definitions was performed in 186 obese adolescents (106 zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso were assessed at baseline and after 19 zzso 7 zzso We zzso the cohort into three categories based on the 25th and 75th zzso of body mass index zzso zzso change: category 1 reduced zzso zzso by zzso or more, category 2 had a zzso zzso change of between zzso and zzso and category 3 increased zzso zzso zzso zzso who reduced their zzso zzso significantly decreased their zzso and zzso zzso levels and zzso levels and increased their high density zzso cholesterol in comparison to subjects who increased their zzso zzso zzso zzso changes zzso correlated with changes in insulin sensitivity zzso zzso zzso p zzso Among those with no zzso at baseline zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso most of whom significantly increased their zzso zzso developed zzso Of 67 who had zzso at zzso 33 zzso most of whom decreased their zzso zzso lost the zzso 

zzso zzso tightly linked to changes in insulin sensitivity, have an impact on each individual component of the zzso and on the stability of the diagnosis of zzso in obese zzso
