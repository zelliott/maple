To evaluate shifts across zzso categories and associated changes in zzso risk factors over zzso years in an ethnically diverse middle school zzso 

As part of zzso a zzso zzso study designed to mitigate risk for type 2 diabetes, zzso children participated in health screenings at the start of sixth and end of eighth zzso zzso included zzso measures, blood pressure, and zzso insulin, and zzso Students were classified as zzso healthy weight, overweight, obese, or severely zzso Mixed models controlling for school intervention status and zzso were used to evaluate shifts in zzso category over time and the relation between these shifts and changes in risk zzso 

At zzso students averaged zzso zzso years; zzso were boys, zzso were Hispanic, and zzso were overweight or zzso Shifts in zzso category over time were zzso For example, zzso of youth who were overweight moved to the healthy weight range, but zzso in the healthy weight range became zzso zzso shifts were not associated with school intervention condition, household education, or youth zzso zzso zzso status, or changes in zzso zzso in zzso category were associated with worsening of zzso risk factors, and decreases were associated with zzso Boys who increased zzso category were more vulnerable to negative risk factor changes than zzso 

There are substantial shifts across zzso categories during middle school that are associated with clinically meaningful changes in zzso risk zzso Programs to promote decreases in zzso and prevent increases are clearly zzso
