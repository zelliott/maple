The aim of this study is to investigate the zzso of zzso zzso after oral administration and its zzso zzso When a suspension of zzso zzso was orally administered to mice and the zzso was zzso zzso zzso accumulated in the liver compared to zzso zzso at 48 h or later after zzso Then, a zzso suspension was orally administered to zzso obesity zzso mice every 4 days, and the zzso effect of zzso was zzso As a result, zzso suppressed the body weight increase of zzso mice and significantly reduced the plasma levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso regulated the expression of some genes in the liver involved in zzso synthesis and zzso The present study demonstrated that zzso accumulated in the liver after oral administration and exerted its zzso effect on zzso by regulating the expression of certain genes involved in zzso metabolism in the zzso
