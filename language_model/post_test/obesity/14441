The question has arisen whether patterns of body fat distribution can be identified by body zzso a method which is said to be more reliable and simpler than zzso thickness or like measures of subcutaneous fat zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we address the question of whether body zzso are inherently more reliable than zzso thicknesses in 77 zzso and 224 zzso replicates from the Health zzso zzso of 12 to zzso in the zzso zzso of six body zzso zzso was significantly zzso less than zzso higher than that of zzso thicknesses at five sites zzso suggesting that zzso are a more reliable zzso However, the reliability of zzso is still high, and zzso may be used in studies which focus on zzso or other groups in which the zzso of zzso as measures of body fat distribution is zzso
