The zzso response to exercise in obese zzso zzso diabetics was compared to that of obese zzso Exercise consisted of 45 zzso on a cycle zzso at zzso maximum oxygen zzso Six diabetic subjects were studied during oral zzso therapy and four on diet zzso The zzso therapy had no effect on the zzso zzso was elevated at rest in both diabetic zzso zzso zzso 24 zzso for diet alone, 226 zzso 36 zzso for zzso zzso and a similar fall (35 and 37 zzso zzso occurred with zzso In control subjects, zzso was 86 zzso 4 zzso and did not change with zzso In the diabetics at rest, zzso production was elevated zzso zzso 25 zzso whereas the zzso clearance of zzso was zzso During exercise the increase in zzso zzso was similar to that in controls, but zzso production failed to increase significantly, thus accounting for the decline in plasma zzso At rest, plasma zzso insulin zzso was elevated to zzso zzso in the controls and decreased to zzso zzso with zzso In the diabetics zzso was similarly elevated zzso zzso but failed to decrease normally with zzso zzso zzso zzso and free fatty acids increased similarly in diabetics and controls, whereas the increase in zzso during recovery was less in zzso The sustained zzso the zzso overproduction of zzso and zzso itself may all contribute to the observed differences in zzso flux during exercise in zzso zzso
