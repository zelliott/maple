Body composition was determined by dual energy X-ray zzso zzso scanning and classical reference methods zzso zzso and a combination of these in a zzso zzso in 19 overweight patients with zzso arthritis who underwent a zzso zzso zzso The aim of the study was to investigate whether zzso provides a valid estimate of body zzso The results showed that weight as determined by zzso was highly significantly correlated to weight determined by zzso Furthermore, significant correlations were found in the body components zzso mass, fat zzso determined by zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Mean values differed slightly but zzso With respect to changes in body zzso no significant correlations were found between any of the methods, except for the weight loss recorded by zzso and zzso and loss of fat mass (and fat free zzso estimated by zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso of correlations reflected the small changes in zzso mass and fat mass zzso and zzso zzso respectively), and the fact that changes were comparable to measurement errors of the various zzso We suggest that zzso scanning is a valid supplement for determination of body zzso zzso of zzso scanning requires new experimental in zzso zzso which, zzso also applies to the classical reference zzso
