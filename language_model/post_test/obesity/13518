Based on in zzso studies, it has been hypothesized that zzso vitamin D zzso zzso may promote weight gain in humans, but previous studies have demonstrated conflicting results regarding the association between serum zzso D and body mass index zzso 

To evaluate the relation between serum zzso D and zzso 

Two thousand one hundred and zzso subjects, recruited from a zzso and medical lifestyle management clinic, were included in a zzso zzso zzso zzso vitamin D zzso zzso and zzso D were zzso The cohort was divided according to zzso in five groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses were performed with multiple linear zzso zzso Age and gender were used as explanatory zzso 

With increasing zzso group, there was a significant decrease in both serum zzso D and zzso D zzso Those with zzso zzso had zzso lower serum zzso D levels and zzso lower zzso D levels than those with zzso zzso zzso 

There is an inverse association between zzso and the serum levels of zzso D and zzso zzso This makes it highly unlikely that high levels of circulating zzso D contribute to the development of zzso
