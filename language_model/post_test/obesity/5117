The zzso hypothesis was derived from experimental studies of zzso It states the number of zzso zzso zzso is fixed early in life and zzso an individual to be lean or obese depending on changes in the number of zzso However, the present methods for zzso zzso number are based on the zzso of total body fat and of zzso zzso While total body fat can be measured zzso little is known of the zzso of these zzso the measurement of zzso size is reliable if care is taken that cells are not damaged during the application of those methods in which cells are zzso Nevertheless, these methods are probably preferable to those based on the measurement of intact zzso human errors are more likely with the zzso The major problem with the measurement of zzso size is the zzso nature of the zzso examined and the fact that zzso that are devoid of fat are not included in the zzso There is disagreement as to whether the rapid increases in total body fat during infancy are due mainly to increases in zzso number or in zzso zzso Furthermore, data from animal experiments indicate that the number of zzso may not be fixed during adult zzso zzso correlations show almost 0 correlations between measures of obesity before 6 years and the same measures at 16 years, but these correlations increase rapidly after 6 zzso zzso data show no more than a slight tendency for obese infants to become obese zzso These findings do not support the zzso zzso
