zzso association with zzso insulin raises the possibility that zzso is an additional component of the zzso Syndrome, or perhaps zzso the zzso This zzso study of Western zzso examined the relationship of serum zzso with insulin sensitivity assessed by zzso Model Assessment zzso and components of the zzso zzso Two hundred and zzso subjects zzso men, 126 zzso aged zzso years, were drawn from a study conducted in zzso An oral zzso tolerance test indicated that 59 subjects had zzso zzso men had higher zzso levels than zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso but this difference was no longer significant after adjustment for zzso zzso levels in diabetic women zzso zzso zzso zzso women zzso zzso zzso were not zzso zzso was zzso positively correlated with zzso zzso insulin and mean blood pressure after adjusting for age and sex zzso zzso p zzso irrespective of zzso tolerance zzso Linear zzso models indicated that zzso was associated with insulin sensitivity independent of age, zzso zzso ratio, zzso zzso and zzso Similar models were zzso with mean blood pressure or zzso as the dependent zzso and including insulin sensitivity with the independent zzso zzso was independently associated with mean blood pressure in men, but was not independently associated with zzso Mean levels of zzso insulin, zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure varied across zzso of zzso in men after adjusting for age, zzso and insulin sensitivity, and mean levels in the top zzso tended to be higher than in the lowest zzso These results indicate an independent relationship between zzso and insulin sensitivity, but the zzso results concerning associations of zzso with components of the zzso zzso make it unlikely that zzso affects these zzso
