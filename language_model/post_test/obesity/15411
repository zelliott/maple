To examine the influence of genetic factors on plasma zzso zzso 

We measured plasma zzso levels, body mass index and body fat distribution in healthy young female zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The twin zzso was verified by determination of short tandem repeat and amplified zzso length zzso zzso The genetic analysis included analysis of zzso and maximum zzso zzso 

Plasma zzso levels were correlated significantly with body mass index zzso zzso zzso P zzso waist circumference zzso zzso zzso P zzso and hip circumference zzso zzso zzso P zzso but not with age zzso zzso zzso or the zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso The zzso estimates derived from zzso correlations were significant for body mass index zzso zzso zzso waist circumference zzso zzso zzso hip circumference zzso zzso zzso and plasma zzso levels zzso zzso zzso but not for the zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso In the maximum zzso path analysis, zzso was estimated at zzso for body mass index and at zzso for plasma zzso zzso After adjustment for body mass index, the zzso estimate for zzso levels from the zzso approach was zzso 

zzso factors are major zzso of plasma zzso levels in humans and may account for as much as half of the zzso in zzso zzso
