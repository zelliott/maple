Previous reports have shown that zzso can zzso the activity of the insulin zzso and studies in transgenic mice suggest a link between altered levels of various zzso and the development of insulin zzso Here, we show that an inhibitor of zzso synthesis can improve zzso control and increase insulin sensitivity in two different diabetic animal zzso In the zzso diabetic fatty zzso the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid salt zzso lowered zzso and zzso levels and improved zzso zzso Drug treatment also prevented the loss of pancreatic zzso function normally observed in the zzso diabetic fatty rat and preserved the ability of the animals to zzso zzso In the zzso obese zzso treatment with zzso zzso zzso levels and improved zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso state of the insulin zzso and downstream zzso showed increased insulin signaling in the muscles of the treated zzso diabetic fatty rats and zzso obese zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso synthesis can significantly improve insulin sensitivity and zzso zzso and may therefore represent a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of type 2 zzso
