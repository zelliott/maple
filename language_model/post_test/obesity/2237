Previous research showing an inverse association between age of zzso and adult diabetes relied on recalled age at zzso and did not adjust for zzso across the life zzso We investigated the relationship between age at zzso and diabetes, and whether childhood, adolescent or adult zzso zzso this zzso 

We used data from the Medical Research Council National zzso of Health and Development, a British birth cohort study of men and women born in 1946, with zzso recording of the age of zzso zzso at 2, 7, 15 and zzso years and diabetes status to 53 zzso 

A significant inverse relationship between age at zzso and diabetes zzso ratio zzso zzso per year older age at zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso was attenuated by adjustment for adult zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The effect of age at zzso on Type 2 diabetes was very similar to that for all types of zzso zzso of the association between age at zzso and diabetes was also observed with zzso at 15 years, but less so with zzso measured earlier in zzso 

Earlier age at zzso is associated with a higher risk of diabetes, and specifically Type 2 diabetes, in later life, which is most strongly attenuated by adolescent and adult zzso Early zzso may be clinically useful in identifying women who are at risk of later zzso and so of developing Type 2 zzso
