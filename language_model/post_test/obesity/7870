zzso is a cardiovascular risk factor in zzso transplantation zzso The objective of this study was to analyze the prevalence of zzso obesity and risk factors associated with its zzso 

The study included all patients with a functioning zzso transplant on December 31, 2003, who were residents of zzso aged older than 14 years and who underwent transplantation between 1990 and 2003 zzso zzso zzso 102 patients zzso were excluded due to lack of data for 1 or more study zzso Mean age was 53 zzso 14 years zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean transplant duration was zzso zzso zzso months zzso zzso The zzso test was used to compare proportions, analysis of zzso zzso to compare mean values, and zzso zzso to study risk factors for zzso zzso All data were taken from the Renal zzso of Catalonia zzso 

Among zzso patients, 38% were overweight zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso and zzso were obese zzso zzso of obesity was higher in women zzso vs zzso P zzso Age was associated with obesity in zzso patients aged zzso zzso and zzso zzso with respect to the group aged zzso years zzso zzso years zzso zzso zzso A total of zzso of patients who were normal weight before zzso zzso zzso became overweight zzso and zzso developed obesity zzso zzso Among patients who were overweight zzso zzso persisted with zzso excess weight and zzso progressed to obesity zzso zzso In the zzso study, significant risk factors for developing zzso obesity included the zzso female zzso risk zzso zzso P zzso age zzso years; zzso zzso P zzso and zzso years; zzso zzso P zzso zzso high blood pressure zzso zzso P zzso zzso duration of transplant zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and, particularly, the presence of excess weight zzso zzso P zzso and zzso obesity zzso zzso P zzso 

There is a high prevalence of zzso excess weight and zzso zzso control of cardiovascular risk in zzso transplant recipients should also include strict measures to prevent and treat zzso
