The possibility that dietary vitamin zzso zzso exposure zzso zzso zzso in an animal model and zzso the enhanced risk of zzso zzso associated with obesity was zzso At 4 weeks of age, zzso and zzso mice were each divided into four treatment groups and fed zzso control diet, or zzso diet containing either 25,000 international units of zzso per zzso of diet, zzso fat to induce obesity zzso zzso or high fat and 25,000 international units of zzso per zzso of zzso Mice were kept on these diets until they were sacrificed at week zzso Although zzso did not affect zzso cancer risk, it inhibited zzso increase in zzso zzso Specifically, high-fat diet increased focal zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso from zzso in the control zzso zzso mice to zzso in obese zzso zzso zzso decreased the zzso of zzso pathology in obese zzso mice to zzso zzso zzso zzso altered the zzso expression of zzso zzso and vitamin D zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were higher zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein levels in the zzso zzso were lower zzso zzso in the zzso of control zzso zzso than zzso mice, but the expression of these receptors was not affected by the dietary zzso zzso reversed the zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso and significantly increased zzso expression zzso zzso in the zzso of obese zzso zzso Our data confirm the known association between obesity and zzso cancer zzso zzso exposure to zzso inhibited the zzso effect of obesity on the zzso This protective effect was linked to a reduction in the expression of zzso and increase in zzso
