The relationship between zzso and prevalent hypertension was examined in adjusted marginal models among zzso zzso All continuous variables were zzso 

A significant zzso by gender interaction prompted separate analyses for zzso according to zzso Further adjustment for zzso was performed to determine its potential roles in the zzso zzso The mean age zzso of the sample was zzso zzso years, with a mean body mass index zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Women comprised zzso of the sample (N zzso zzso and Hispanic Americans comprised zzso of the sample (N zzso zzso One in five participants zzso had prevalent zzso In women, zzso was significantly associated with hypertension, independent of zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso African-American women demonstrated increased odds of prevalent hypertension compared to zzso women zzso zzso zzso P zzso Among men, zzso was not associated with hypertension independent of zzso and zzso explained a significant amount of the variation in zzso 

A significant relationship may exist between zzso and hypertension among women, but not among zzso The relationship between zzso and hypertension in women was not associated with insulin zzso
