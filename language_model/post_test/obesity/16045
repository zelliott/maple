Most patients with zzso sleep zzso have increased zzso zzso zzso in the present study as an increased lung volume dependence of zzso zzso which zzso them to upper airway zzso during zzso However, there are patients with severe zzso sleep zzso who have zzso zzso zzso The factors leading to nocturnal upper airway obstruction in such patients have not been zzso We studied 10 overweight male patients with severe zzso sleep zzso and zzso zzso zzso to determine the site of upper airway pathology in these zzso We found that all 10 patients exhibited paradoxical zzso narrowing of the zzso during quiet tidal zzso This phenomenon was not observed in a matched group of 10 zzso zzso male zzso We conclude that paradoxical zzso narrowing may be a contributing factor in the zzso of upper airway obstruction in patients with severe zzso sleep zzso who have zzso zzso zzso
