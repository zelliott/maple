The zzso syndrome zzso is a cluster of risk factors related to cardiovascular zzso zzso identified by impaired zzso zzso and/or impaired zzso zzso may predict future development of diabetes zzso However, it is not clear whether zzso and zzso represent the same or different clinical zzso This study compares zzso and zzso in terms of cardiovascular risk factors and target organ zzso 

A total of zzso overweight and obese zzso mass index, zzso 27 zzso zzso adults, mean age zzso zzso zzso years, 264 men and 260 women, were zzso All participants underwent a thorough clinical and laboratory zzso including an oral zzso tolerance test and insulin zzso zzso carotid zzso and pulse wave analysis were also performed for the detection of target organ zzso zzso III and zzso criteria were used for the diagnosis of zzso and zzso 

The prevalence of zzso and zzso was zzso and zzso zzso zzso Overall, 129 individuals zzso zzso had zzso without zzso zzso zzso and another 59 zzso zzso zzso without zzso zzso zzso Group P had decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and more thickened common carotid zzso in comparison to group M zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, group M was associated with higher zzso protein zzso Multiple zzso zzso analysis revealed that advanced age zzso zzso OR zzso 95 % zzso zzso - zzso low insulin zzso zzso zzso OR zzso 95 % zzso zzso - zzso for zzso zzso and increased insulin resistance zzso zzso zzso OR zzso 95 % zzso zzso - zzso for zzso were associated with group zzso 

Our data demonstrate that zzso and zzso have an overlapping zzso zzso appears to have a more pronounced effect on early zzso dysfunction and increased inflammatory zzso while zzso tends to be associated with early carotid structural zzso These findings may be due to a different zzso zzso of these clinical zzso in terms of insulin resistance and zzso as well as to the varying prevalence of cardiovascular risk zzso
