zzso protein synthesis was measured with zzso in zzso and recovered infants and in obese zzso Comparisons were made: 1) between results obtained with single zzso and repeated zzso oral dosage of zzso and 2) between zzso and zzso as end zzso In the infants S and R gave similar values for the synthesis zzso With both methods of zzso the values obtained with zzso as end product were about two-thirds of those with zzso It is suggested that the cause of this result is that zzso contributes zzso to the formation of urinary zzso With zzso as end product, a collection period of 12 h has been found to be zzso With zzso it is not possible to define an appropriate collection zzso The combination of single dose of zzso with urinary zzso as end product provides a simple method for measuring zzso protein synthesis under clinical and field zzso It can be repeated at short intervals and can give useful comparative information provided that conditions are carefully zzso The zzso so far is zzso zzso
