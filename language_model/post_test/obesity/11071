zzso blood pressure and zzso zzso are zzso traits interconnected to each other but their possible common genetic and environmental zzso are zzso 

We studied zzso zzso and 150 zzso twin pairs aged zzso years from Italy, Hungary and the United States, of which 45 zzso and 38 zzso pairs were zzso for body mass index zzso zzso difference zzso in zzso zzso 3 zzso Blood pressure components and zzso zzso were measured by zzso zzso 

zzso was more prevalent among obese than non-obese individuals zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso estimates were high for zzso measures zzso and zzso zzso According to zzso zzso decomposition, zzso correlations between zzso and blood pressure components zzso zzso zzso to zzso p zzso were largely explained by additive genetic factors zzso with the remaining explained by the unique zzso When controlling for genetic factors within all zzso pairs, zzso was significantly correlated with zzso zzso blood pressure zzso and zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso pressure, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso For the same measures, heavier zzso of zzso zzso pairs had significantly higher values than their zzso counterparts zzso zzso 

Blood pressure components are moderately correlated with zzso largely because of shared genetic zzso However, for the association of zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and mean zzso pressure, acquired, modifiable factors were also found to be zzso
