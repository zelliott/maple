To estimate the potential benefits of cardiovascular disease intervention programs in Spain, we have zzso cardiovascular population mortality zzso and deaths attributable to the main risk factors by using relative risks from international studies and Spanish prevalence and mortality data zzso of both zzso aged zzso As many as zzso of the cardiovascular deaths studied in men and zzso in women might be delayed every year in Spain if it were possible to eliminate the current exposure of the population to smoking, zzso zzso hypertension and zzso With the zzso of tobacco exposure zzso of coronary deaths and zzso of stroke deaths in men zzso in both cases for zzso might be zzso Similar actions on zzso hypertension and zzso might delay zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso of deaths, respectively, in males zzso generally somewhat higher in zzso These figures would be moderately lower if reductions in the prevalence of these factors are considered zzso These results may encourage the zzso of strategies against cardiovascular diseases in countries with risk factor prevalence similar to that of zzso
