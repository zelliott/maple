zzso and overweight are today zzso as subject to harmful zzso Through an analysis of discussions of obesity in major American newspapers, the medical literature, and pharmaceutical advertising in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, I document a significant shift in medical thinking about overweight and obesity based in psychiatry, and explore the relationship of that shift to changes in popular zzso of zzso after the Second World zzso I argue that the zzso postwar medical thinking about obesity was more zzso as compared with the zzso thinking of the zzso period, in that the newer biomedical theory linked zzso to the already zzso condition of addiction and zzso attribution of moral blame to the zzso I further argue that the pharmaceutical industry cannot be assigned the lead role in zzso in this period that some authors attributed to zzso These events cast doubt on the received view of zzso as subject to decreasing zzso and increasing zzso over the course of the zzso century, and call for exploration of the social factors influencing specific forms of zzso
