The use of zzso Information Systems zzso to zzso measure zzso food environment zzso exposure has become zzso This increase in usage has coincided with the development of a zzso zzso zzso with subsequent perceived difficulties for zzso zzso However, when used together in previous work, different types of food environment metric have often demonstrated some degree of zzso zzso and similarities between density and proximity zzso and within zzso different zzso of density and proximity metrics need to be better zzso 

Frequently used measures of food access were calculated for North East England, zzso Using food outlet data from local zzso zzso of food outlets per 1000 population and per zzso were calculated for small administrative zzso zzso zzso were also calculated based on zzso zzso of administrative areas zzso at zzso m street network and zzso zzso Proximity zzso network and zzso zzso from these zzso to the nearest food outlet were also zzso zzso were compared using zzso rank zzso 

zzso of zzso density and proximity were highly zzso zzso per zzso and per 1000 population were highly correlated zzso zzso and street network based measures of proximity zzso and density zzso depending on zzso zzso were also highly zzso zzso metrics based on administrative areas and zzso zzso of administrative areas were less strongly correlated zzso 

zzso and proximity metrics were largely comparable, with some zzso zzso results suggested a substantial degree of zzso across existing studies, future zzso could be ensured by moving towards a more zzso set of environmental zzso where appropriate, zzso the potential pitfalls of zzso variation between zzso The zzso role in creating their own zzso zzso should be better understood and zzso
