zzso of vascular growth is a hallmark of diabetic zzso but the progression and mechanisms are poorly zzso To determine whether obesity and early diabetes impair zzso zzso and vascular response to zzso zzso function as well as zzso responses to zzso were assessed in young zzso and zzso lean mice zzso zzso in obese zzso mice, and in mice suffering an early zzso and sustained type 2 diabetes zzso zzso zzso gradually increased from the zzso to the old zzso Early and established type II diabetes significantly reduced the level of insulin that was significantly increased in obese zzso zzso function was assessed in isolated resistance arteries while the zzso response induced by unilateral zzso zzso was zzso after 28 days, with a laser zzso zzso and zzso Aging zzso obesity zzso as well as early zzso and sustained type II diabetes zzso induced a progressive impairment of the zzso relaxation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that only early and sustained type II diabetes impaired skin blood flow zzso zzso zzso was reduced with aging and severely impaired in older zzso mice, the two strains of mice in which zzso reduced zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso dysfunction induced by obesity is insufficient to alter the zzso response to zzso Furthermore, the development of frank type II diabetes or increasing age is required to impair the vascular response to zzso zzso We conclude that additional risk factors or severe zzso dysfunction may be requisite to impede the zzso response to zzso
