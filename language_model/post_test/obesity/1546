zzso length has been considered in many zzso studies as a zzso of zzso However the association between shorter zzso with lower survival at advanced ages remains a controversial zzso This association could reflect the impact of other health conditions than a direct biological zzso 

To test whether zzso zzso length is associated with zzso survival beyond the impact of other risk factors of mortality like zzso functional, nutritional and cognitive zzso 

Prospective zzso 

A population representative sample of zzso patients zzso age 85 years; zzso zzso discharged from the acute geriatric hospital of Geneva University zzso zzso zzso since then 263 zzso had died zzso zzso 

zzso length in zzso by flow zzso 

In zzso model, zzso length at baseline and cognitive status were not significantly associated with mortality even when adjusting for age zzso and gender zzso The best zzso predictor was the geriatric index of zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by more dependence in instrumental zzso zzso and based zzso zzso activities of daily living and lower zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly associated with a zzso decrease in the risk of mortality compared to zzso between zzso When all independent variables were entered in a full multiple Cox zzso model zzso the zzso was the strongest risk predictor followed by the nutritional and functional zzso 

Neither zzso length nor the presence of zzso are zzso of survival whereas the weight of multiple zzso conditions, nutritional and functional impairment are significantly associated with zzso mortality in the oldest zzso
