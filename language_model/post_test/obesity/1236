To investigate the relationship between plasma zzso zzso and insulin zzso and 1) body fat, and 2) nutritional parameters in overweight or obese zzso zzso 

zzso study on plasma zzso and insulin zzso body fat, indirect parameters of appetite namely daily energy and zzso zzso 

143 zzso boys and 76 zzso overweight or obese children zzso I) and 48 (27 boys and 21 zzso healthy children with normal parameters of zzso development zzso zzso Age: zzso zzso 

zzso height and subcutaneous zzso zzso plasma zzso and insulin zzso diet history for energy and zzso zzso 

Group I was zzso by significantly higher average zzso of zzso and insulin in comparison to the control zzso The analysis of these zzso in the zzso in relation to the percentage of body fat indicates that zzso zzso increased more than insulin zzso with increasing zzso A significantly positive correlation between zzso and insulin levels was only noted in group zzso Also, only in this group was there a significant positive correlation between zzso levels and energy and zzso zzso In both groups the percentage of energy intake which was fat, correlated positively with zzso zzso zzso energy and fat zzso showed a significant positive correlation with insulin levels in both zzso 

zzso and insulin zzso in overweight and obese zzso children are not only higher than in non-obese children but also are positively correlated with each other and with the percentage of body zzso The relationship between plasma zzso levels and food intake shows that the zzso level may be able to be used as an indicator of appetite in overweight and obese zzso children whose food intake is not zzso
