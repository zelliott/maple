Physical zzso poses a major risk for obesity and chronic disease, and is influenced by both genetic and environmental zzso However, the genetic association between physical activity zzso level and obesity is not well zzso Our aims were to: zzso estimate the extent of additive genetic influences on physical activity while adjusting for household zzso and zzso determine whether physical activity and zzso measures share common genetic zzso 

The sample included 521 zzso % zzso adult relatives, zzso years of age, from five large families in the Southwest Ohio Family zzso 

zzso leisure and work PA were zzso zzso zzso of zzso Physical zzso Total body and trunk zzso including percentage body fat zzso were measured using zzso X-ray zzso zzso visceral and subcutaneous zzso tissue mass were measured using zzso 

zzso for zzso and PA traits, and the zzso household and environmental correlations among them, were estimated using maximum likelihood zzso components zzso zzso genetic effects zzso zzso were found for sport zzso zzso zzso and leisure PA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso household effects existed for leisure PA zzso zzso zzso Sport PA had a negative genetic correlation with central zzso zzso adjusted for height zzso zzso Sport and leisure PA had negative genetic correlations with zzso zzso zzso 

The results suggest that the association of sport and leisure PA with lower zzso is due, in part, to a common genetic inheritance of both reduced zzso and the predisposition to engage in more physical zzso
