zzso is a result of complex factors including multiple genetic zzso 

This study aims to check for the association of genetic zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes with hypertension among Saudi zzso 

This study included 116 cases with documented hypertension of at least 1 year zzso Their data were compared to that of 250 unrelated healthy zzso subjects from the same zzso For all participants, DNA was extracted and analyzed using real time zzso chain reaction technique for the identification of zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cases showed a significantly higher frequency of zzso zzso zzso T zzso carriage zzso and zzso zzso compared with controls zzso ratio zzso zzso The same was observed among zzso of hypertension associated with diabetes and obesity zzso zzso and cases with isolated hypertension zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso cases, whether being isolated or associated with obesity and/or diabetes, showed a zzso difference from controls in relation to all zzso zzso related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This study showed positive association of zzso gene zzso with hypertension among Saudi zzso
