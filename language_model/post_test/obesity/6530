During physical examination of patients with suspected zzso sleep zzso zzso a comment is frequently made that they appear to have a short and fat zzso To confirm this zzso impression by objective zzso we studied a group of 123 patients referred to us because of zzso and suspected zzso all of whom had nocturnal zzso and zzso of external and internal neck zzso The external neck circumference was measured at the level of the superior border of the zzso zzso Internal neck zzso were calculated from the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso areas obtained by the acoustic reflection zzso Internal zzso circumference was further subdivided into the zzso middle, and zzso zzso The acoustic technique also permitted us to measure the distance between the teeth and the zzso zzso which reflects the length of the upper zzso zzso multiple linear zzso analysis revealed that the zzso index zzso correlated only with the external neck zzso the body mass index, and the internal circumference of the zzso zzso these three variables accounted for zzso of the zzso in zzso We conclude that the external and internal neck zzso and the degree of obesity are important zzso of sleep zzso it is possible that obesity produces its effect via fat in the zzso We speculate that the zzso zzso size modulated by the dynamic loading of the airway due to the weight of fatty tissue of the neck may contribute to the zzso of zzso
