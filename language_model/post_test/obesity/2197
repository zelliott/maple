Combination oral zzso zzso have little effect on zzso and zzso metabolism in zzso zzso Based on lack of change in intermediate zzso as well as results of zzso studies, zzso zzso do not increase the risk of diabetes or cardiovascular zzso zzso is a risk factor for impaired zzso zzso diabetes and coronary artery disease, and most previous OC studies excluded these zzso thus, we have limited information about zzso and zzso metabolism in obese OC zzso 

This study compared changes in zzso and zzso parameters in 71 zzso and 38 obese women initiating the zzso Women were zzso to two zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso Participants underwent baseline and zzso zzso of zzso serum zzso zzso zzso and total, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and obese participants experienced similar changes in mean zzso insulin and log zzso model assessment, as well as similar changes in total cholesterol, HDL and zzso however, change in mean LDL zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was different between the obese and zzso groups, zzso Among the obese participants, change in zzso was marginally greater with the higher dose pill zzso otherwise, changes between the body mass index groups were not modified by pill zzso 

zzso had little effect on any zzso changes in zzso or zzso metabolism except for a borderline adverse interaction between obesity and OC dose with respect to zzso zzso and a positive interaction between obesity and OC use with respect to LDL zzso
