A principal task in zzso the zzso of complex traits is to identify zzso genes for disease zzso We previously developed a method to zzso zzso relationships among genes through the integration of DNA variation, gene zzso and zzso zzso Here we have validated our method through the characterization of transgenic and knockout mouse models of genes predicted to be zzso for abdominal zzso zzso of eight out of the nine zzso with zzso zzso and zzso being newly confirmed, resulted in significant changes in zzso zzso Liver expression signatures revealed zzso in common zzso pathways and networks contributing to abdominal obesity and overlapped with a zzso zzso network module that is highly associated with zzso traits in mice and zzso zzso of gene expression in the design and analysis of traditional zzso zzso studies allows zzso prediction of zzso genes and identification of pathways and networks zzso
