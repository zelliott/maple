Depression has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular zzso The inflammatory marker zzso protein zzso has also been identified as an independent predictor of zzso and long-term cardiovascular disease zzso zzso may influence the relationship between depression and cardiovascular zzso 

The objective of this study was to investigate the association between symptoms of depression and zzso zzso zzso in an obese clinical zzso We also sought to determine whether this relationship was different in men and women, given prior reports of a gender zzso 

zzso of depression and zzso were measured in 390 participants enrolled in a weight loss intervention trial that was delivered in a primary care zzso zzso of depression were evaluated with the Patient Health zzso zzso in which a score zzso 10 is consistent with major zzso 

A total of 58 zzso participants reported a zzso score zzso zzso The median zzso zzso zzso concentration was significantly higher in participants with symptoms consistent with major depression zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with those without depression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consistent with major depression were significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso in an analysis adjusted for age, zzso obesity class and other zzso variables zzso When interaction by gender was zzso this relationship remained significant in men zzso but not in women zzso 

zzso consistent with major depression were significantly associated with zzso in men only, even after adjusting for age, obesity class, zzso variables and medications known to affect zzso This finding suggests that there are zzso differences between men and women that may modify the relationship between zzso and zzso Further studies are needed to zzso the zzso basis for these zzso
