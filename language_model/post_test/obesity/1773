Higher protein intake during the first year of life is associated with increased weight gain zzso and body mass index zzso However, the relationship of protein intake and weight gain zzso with body composition is zzso 

To assess if the increases in weight gain zzso and zzso induced by protein intake early in life are related to an increase in fat or zzso zzso 

In all, 41 infants zzso at birth to a higher or lower protein content formula zzso and zzso zzso and 25 zzso infants were zzso zzso measures were assessed at zzso 6, 12 and 24 months, and zzso mass zzso and fat mass zzso were assessed by isotope dilution at 6 zzso 

Weight gain zzso zzso per zzso during the first 6 months of life was significantly higher among zzso infants zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso Weight gain zzso strongly correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso but showed no association with zzso zzso zzso showed no association with zzso Nevertheless, zzso strongly correlated with zzso at 6, 12 and 24 months zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not differ significantly between zzso and LP infants zzso vs zzso and zzso vs zzso zzso 

Our findings support the hypothesis that higher protein zzso early in life are associated with faster weight gain and in turn to higher zzso This mechanism could be a zzso factor for later obesity zzso
