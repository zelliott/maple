We evaluated the zzso oral zzso tolerance test zzso modifications in zzso insulin, and zzso plasma zzso and in zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels in two groups of obese subjects zzso obese, zzso N zzso zzso zzso obese, zzso N zzso zzso and in a group of healthy control subjects (N zzso zzso During zzso we detected a reduction in plasma zzso zzso and an increase in zzso and zzso zzso levels in the controls, whereas in both zzso and zzso obese subjects, there was a reduction in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, no statistically significant difference was detected among the groups studied as regards zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were negative in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso groups, and positive in control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, a direct correlation was found between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso in the control group, and a negative correlation was detected between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso in the zzso zzso Our results seem to indicate that the insulin resistance status, the zzso and the zzso of the zzso system in obese subjects could be involved in the zzso of the zzso zzso impairment observed in the obese zzso
