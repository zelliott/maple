Red wine is a zzso that can exert a broad spectrum of zzso actions both in humans and laboratory animal models if consumed zzso However, information about its effect on body weight is zzso We have evaluated the effect of moderate red wine consumption on body weight and energy intake in male zzso lean rats fed a zzso diet for 8 zzso For this purpose, we used three zzso groups: a high-fat diet group zzso a zzso zzso group zzso and a standard diet group zzso After 8 weeks, the zzso group had a lower body weight gain zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso and lower energy intake zzso zzso zzso zzso vs day vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and had less fat mass at zzso location respect to the whole body weight zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso than the zzso zzso However, the red wine didn't modified the fed efficiency zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso group versus zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso one zzso These findings, though zzso show that moderate red wine intake can prevent the increase of body weight by modulating energy intake in a rat zzso model of zzso
