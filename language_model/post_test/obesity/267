Human obesity is associated with increased serum zzso zzso which is probably caused by liver dysfunction related to liver zzso This study examines whether improvements of liver function after zzso surgery is associated with a decrease of serum zzso concentration caused by an increase of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso (an independent predictor of liver zzso zzso as well as several parameters related to obesity were measured in 16 obese patients zzso men and nine zzso before and 6 months after vertical banded zzso Ten (six men and four zzso lean, healthy subjects served as zzso 

zzso patients before surgery had approximately twofold higher serum zzso concentration than control zzso The serum zzso concentration decreased 6 months after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration was higher in obese patients before surgery, and decreased 6 months after zzso zzso Changes in serum zzso concentration correlated positively with changes of zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso p zzso The body weight, zzso zzso serum zzso zzso ratio, zzso insulin, and zzso zzso were higher in obese patients, and decreased 6 months after zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration was lower in obese patients before surgery than in control subjects and increased 6 months after zzso 

zzso obtained indicate that zzso zzso weight loss had beneficial effects on several laboratory parameters including serum zzso zzso zzso zzso and insulin zzso A strong positive correlation between serum zzso and serum zzso zzso suggests that deterioration of liver function in obese patients is contributing to a decrease in zzso metabolism and consequently to the increase of serum zzso zzso One can suppose that serum zzso concentration could be zzso marker of liver dysfunction associated with liver zzso in obese zzso
