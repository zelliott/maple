To investigate the effect of weight loss on zzso 4 content of insulin sensitive zzso of obese zzso 

Mice were made obese by zzso treatment with zzso zzso zzso In addition, one group of obese animals was submitted to a caloric restriction to promote zzso weight loss zzso Both groups were compared to zzso control zzso 

zzso data, zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso 4 protein was assessed by Western zzso analysis in white zzso and brown zzso zzso zzso and skeletal zzso and cardiac zzso zzso 

The zzso mice were very obese according to their zzso analysis, showing moderate zzso with severe zzso and reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The procedure for weight loss promoted a significant zzso zzso reduction of both zzso and zzso levels, and an increase in zzso zzso Compared to control animals, the zzso 4 content in obese zzso mice, was decreased by zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso in BAT and in different zzso membrane zzso of zzso On the other hand, zzso protein content was restored to normal levels in zzso zzso 

The reduced zzso 4 content of insulin sensitive zzso from zzso obese mice is recovered by a zzso loss in zzso This mechanism can be involved in the observed increase of insulin zzso
