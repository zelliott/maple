Type 2 diabetes and obesity are characterized by elevated nocturnal circulating free fatty zzso elevated zzso insulin zzso and blunted zzso insulin zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to improve zzso tolerance and insulin sensitivity in zzso but its direct effect on zzso has been zzso zzso from lean zzso and obese zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso rats were incubated for 24 h in zzso and exposed to 11 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with or without zzso zzso zzso was determined at zzso (3 zzso or zzso (15 zzso zzso zzso As expected, zzso zzso was significantly elevated in zzso from obese or zzso lean rats whereas the fold increase in zzso was zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso in zzso from obese rats and zzso lean rats without decreasing the fold increase in zzso However, it decreased zzso in zzso from lean rats without affecting zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso has direct effects on zzso to reduce insulin zzso when zzso is elevated above normal levels by diet or in zzso In contrast, it appears to decrease zzso zzso in zzso from lean animals but not in obese or zzso zzso
