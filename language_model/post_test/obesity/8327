To determine whether zzso exercise training + weight loss zzso + zzso would affect the expression of myostatin and its relationship with insulin sensitivity in a zzso clinical intervention zzso 

zzso obese sedentary zzso women and men zzso zzso 17 and 16, age: 61 zzso 1 years, body mass zzso 31 zzso 1 zzso , zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso X zzso Standard error of the mean zzso completed 6 months of 3 zzso zzso + zzso During an 80 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we measured zzso zzso zzso myostatin, zzso and zzso gene expression by real-time zzso in zzso zzso muscle at baseline and 2 zzso 

Body weight zzso and fat mass zzso decreased after zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso and zzso muscle area by zzso zzso did not change but muscle zzso increased zzso zzso zzso max increased zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso increased M by zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression decreased zzso after zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso myostatin levels were zzso associated with M before the intervention zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso infusion increased zzso and zzso expression before and after zzso + zzso (both P zzso but zzso levels did not zzso The insulin effect on myostatin expression was associated with the change in M after zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso 

Exercise and weight loss results in a zzso of myostatin zzso and an improvement in insulin sensitivity in obese older men and zzso
