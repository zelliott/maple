zzso pregnant women have higher rates of dysfunctional labor patterns, need for zzso zzso labor zzso zzso pregnancy, and zzso delivery compared to normal weight pregnant zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and protein expression are affected by obesity in zzso zzso samples were obtained at the time of zzso delivery from the upper aspect of the zzso zzso incision and processed for real-time quantitative zzso chain reaction and Western zzso There were 63 zzso samples available for zzso The median body mass index zzso at delivery was zzso zzso zzso range, zzso zzso zzso and the median zzso age at delivery was zzso weeks zzso range, zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene expression did not correlate with maternal zzso at delivery by linear regression, and the median zzso gene expression did not differ between women with a zzso zzso 30 zzso and those with a zzso zzso 40 zzso The zzso protein expression was also not affected by maternal zzso zzso zzso gene expression appears to be independent of zzso at the time of zzso zzso labor patterns and increased zzso zzso seen in obese women may not be due to differences in zzso zzso though functional studies are zzso
