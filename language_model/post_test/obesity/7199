Although weight loss interventions have been shown to reduce zzso in zzso fatty liver disease zzso the impact of dietary zzso composition is zzso We assessed the effect on serum zzso zzso zzso zzso of two zzso diets varying in amounts of zzso and fat in obese zzso individuals, a population at high risk for zzso 

Post hoc analysis of zzso zzso was performed in 52 obese subjects with normal baseline values and insulin resistance, as zzso by the zzso plasma zzso zzso test, who were zzso to zzso diets containing either zzso zzso fat or zzso zzso fat zzso zzso for 16 zzso The primary end point was change in zzso which was evaluated according to diet, weight loss, zzso and zzso insulin zzso 

Although both diets resulted in significant decreases in weight and zzso zzso insulin, and serum zzso zzso the zzso zzso diet resulted in greater decreases in zzso zzso zzso circulating insulin zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso changes correlated with improvement in insulin sensitivity zzso zzso zzso and zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso above the proposed upper limits experienced significant declines in zzso unlike those with lower zzso zzso 

In a population at high risk for zzso a zzso diet moderately lower in zzso decreased serum zzso zzso to a greater degree than a zzso diet, despite equal weight zzso This may result from a relatively greater decline in zzso insulin zzso Further research with zzso end points is needed to further explore this zzso
