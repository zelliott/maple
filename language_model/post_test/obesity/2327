To assess the mortality experience of participants in the Third Harvard Growth Study zzso who provided zzso 8 years of growth zzso 

A total of zzso participants provided an average of zzso body mass index zzso between age 6 and 18 zzso Based on these zzso the participants were classified as ever overweight or zzso zzso for height in zzso Age at peak height zzso was used to indicate timing of overweight relative to zzso Relative risks of zzso and zzso mortality according to measures of childhood growth were estimated using Cox zzso hazards survival zzso 

For women, ever being overweight in childhood increased the risks of zzso and breast cancer zzso the risk of death from zzso heart disease was increased in zzso Men with a first zzso of overweight before zzso were significantly more likely to die from zzso heart zzso women in the same category were more likely to die from all causes and from breast zzso 

We find evidence of long-term effects of having ever been overweight, with some evidence that zzso before zzso influences the pattern of zzso
