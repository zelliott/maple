The zzso zzso Products, zzso Madison, zzso zzso zzso and diary self report were compared with adjusted heart rates to evaluate 3 d of zzso activity in 35 8- to zzso obese zzso zzso heart rates were calculated by zzso zzso resting heart rates from heart rates measured in the zzso zzso and zzso data were converted to multiples of resting zzso rate zzso zzso between zzso zzso and adjusted heart rates zzso zzso zzso were significantly higher zzso zzso than correlations between adjusted heart rates and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had higher mean standard errors in zzso heart rates zzso zzso zzso zzso than did zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso were significantly greater than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso and systematically overestimated zzso zzso The zzso zzso accounted for zzso and the zzso magnitude score accounted for zzso of the zzso in zzso heart zzso The zzso zzso and zzso magnitude score accounted for zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso The vertical zzso did not account for zzso in either zzso heart rates or zzso zzso It was concluded that the zzso yielded a better estimate of activity in obese children than self zzso In addition, the zzso magnitude composite score of the zzso accounted for significantly more zzso in both zzso activity and zzso heart rates as compared with the vertical directional zzso of the zzso
