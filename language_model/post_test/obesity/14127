To better define the efficacy and safety of zzso the first selective zzso type 1 zzso zzso zzso in a large population of overweight and obese patients using pooled efficacy data from three Phase III zzso zzso in zzso and Related zzso Disorders zzso studies, selected efficacy data from the zzso study, and pooled safety data for all four zzso zzso 

The zzso studies enrolled patients who were either overweight zzso zzso with at least one zzso zzso hypertension, zzso or, for zzso type 2 zzso or zzso All patients received daily treatment with zzso (5 or 20 zzso or zzso for 1 year plus a zzso diet zzso zzso zzso and advice on increased physical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso America zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso excluded patients with type 2 zzso zzso zzso was an entry requirement for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso required the presence of type 2 diabetes zzso controlled by zzso or zzso zzso 

The pooled zzso population comprised zzso patients without diabetes zzso completed zzso and zzso patients with diabetes zzso completed zzso Most efficacy measures improved during the zzso zzso zzso period, except that HDL cholesterol decreased as expected in the early phase of a zzso zzso After 1 year of zzso treatment, changes from baseline with 20 zzso zzso in the zzso population were as zzso body weight zzso zzso waist circumference zzso zzso HDL cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso and zzso model assessment for insulin resistance zzso zzso (all P zzso zzso zzso In the diabetic population, 20 zzso zzso reduced zzso levels by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of change in HDL cholesterol, zzso zzso (in zzso and zzso (in zzso versus body weight at 1 year by zzso suggested that zzso of the effect of zzso could not be explained by the observed weight zzso At 1 year, adverse events more frequently reported with zzso were zzso zzso and psychiatric in zzso Serious adverse events were zzso and almost equivalent to zzso zzso zzso rates were similar across treatment groups, except zzso from adverse events, which occurred more frequently with 20 zzso zzso versus zzso (most commonly, depressive disorders zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mood zzso with depressive symptoms zzso zzso zzso and anxiety zzso zzso zzso A thorough review of psychiatric and neurological adverse events was zzso 

In zzso patients, 20 zzso zzso produced weight loss and significant improvements in multiple zzso risk factors such as waist zzso zzso HDL cholesterol, and zzso zzso was generally well zzso with more frequently reported adverse events being zzso zzso and psychiatric in zzso
