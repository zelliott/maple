zzso to investigate the relationship between body mass index zzso and zzso zzso transport as measured by zzso current zzso in human zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The study included zzso from zzso of normal appearance in the zzso colon and/or zzso zzso Patients were referred for routine zzso zzso for zzso abdominal zzso and had normal zzso zzso zzso were mounted in zzso zzso chambers and zzso SCC was zzso Patients were divided into two groups on the basis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significance was assessed by the zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were calculated by zzso product moment zzso 

In zzso zzso zzso SCC zzso zzso standard zzso was significantly higher in 59 zzso from 30 patients with low zzso than in 32 zzso from 23 patients with high zzso zzso zzso 29 zzso zzso zzso 27 zzso 21 zzso P zzso zzso In zzso zzso mean zzso SCC was zzso lower in 38 zzso from 15 patients with low zzso than in 46 zzso from 19 patients with high zzso (54 zzso 26 zzso zzso zzso 74 zzso 39 zzso zzso P zzso zzso The correlation zzso between zzso and SCC was zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso active zzso transport is related to zzso and this relationship may differ in different segments of the zzso zzso
