Although there are established age-related differences in sweet preferences, it remains unknown whether children differ from mothers in their preference for and perception of fat zzso We examined whether individual differences in zzso and fat preferences and perception are related to age, zzso and zzso 

Children zzso zzso zzso and their mothers zzso chose the concentration of zzso and fat most preferred in pudding and zzso most preferred in water using zzso zzso zzso procedures, and ranked pudding samples for intensity of sweetness and zzso zzso were also weighed and measured for zzso as well as zzso for a zzso gene zzso 

Children preferred higher zzso of zzso in water zzso and in pudding zzso and lower zzso of fat in pudding zzso than did zzso Children and mothers were equally able to rank the intensity of different zzso of fat zzso but not zzso in pudding zzso zzso and lean children and mothers did not differ in preferences, but obese mothers were less able to correctly rank the concentration of fat in pudding than were lean mothers zzso Mothers who smoked preferred a higher concentration of zzso than did those who never smoked zzso Individual differences in sweet preference were associated with genetic variation within the zzso gene in mothers but not children zzso 

zzso of zzso children prefer higher zzso of sugar but lower zzso of fat in zzso than do their zzso Thus, zzso foods may be better accepted by children than zzso
