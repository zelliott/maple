It was recently shown that zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso To evaluate whether zzso might impair the effects of insulin in muscle tissue we studied the interaction of insulin and zzso in a muscle cell system, zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso did not significantly affect insulin zzso zzso transport and zzso synthesis zzso to 2 fold zzso however, zzso by itself (1 zzso was able to mimic approximately zzso of the insulin effect on zzso transport and zzso zzso Both zzso transport as well as zzso synthesis were inhibited by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and the protein zzso C inhibitor zzso while no effect was observed with the zzso inhibitor zzso We determined whether the effect of zzso occurs through zzso of zzso and zzso zzso did not stimulate zzso activity in zzso zzso however, zzso zzso could be demonstrated in zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso fold of zzso In summary the data provide the first evidence for a positive zzso between the zzso chain of the insulin zzso and the zzso zzso zzso mimics in zzso zzso insulin effects on zzso transport and zzso synthesis most likely through zzso of zzso This effect of zzso occurs independently of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
