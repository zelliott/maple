zzso and related zzso zzso including inflammation and zzso zzso in the liver, play a role in liver zzso zzso zzso such as decreased serum zzso levels, are also involved in zzso liver zzso In the present study, we examined the effects of zzso - a drug used for the treatment of zzso - on the development of zzso zzso liver zzso zzso in zzso zzso obese zzso 

Male zzso mice were administered tap water containing 40 zzso DEN for 2 weeks and were subsequently fed a diet containing 1 zzso or 10 zzso zzso for 14 zzso 

At zzso feeding with 10 zzso zzso significantly inhibited the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso of cellular zzso as compared to that in the zzso group by inducing zzso but zzso cell zzso zzso improved liver zzso and activated the zzso protein in the zzso It also decreased free fatty acid and zzso levels, while increasing zzso levels in the zzso The serum levels of tumor necrosis factor zzso and the expression of zzso and zzso zzso in the liver were decreased by zzso treatment, suggesting zzso of the chronic inflammation induced by excess fat zzso 

zzso is effective in zzso the early phase of zzso liver zzso and, therefore, may be useful in the zzso of liver cancer in obese zzso
