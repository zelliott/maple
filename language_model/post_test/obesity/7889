The prevalence of hypertension is two times higher in diabetics than in zzso In type 1 diabetes zzso zzso the zzso of hypertension is similar to the zzso of zzso In obese patients with type 2 zzso zzso there can be associated complications of zzso zzso and hypertension, which can lead to coronary artery disease and zzso These associated complications are the result of a genetic zzso that produces insulin zzso zzso Increased zzso zzso with increased levels of blood pressure zzso and increased LDL cholesterol, and this is why zzso is associated with an increase in cardiovascular deaths in zzso even in the absence of zzso zzso 

The aim of this study was to research the influence of a patient's age, diabetes zzso and obesity on the frequency of hypertension and its association with zzso in zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso patients with zzso (79 zzso 89 zzso were zzso The main outcome measures were: 24-hour urinary zzso zzso rate by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hypertension zzso zzso or zzso 140 zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso or zzso 90 zzso zzso and body mass index zzso 

zzso was detected in zzso of patients with zzso and zzso of patients with zzso zzso of zzso patients and zzso of zzso patients were zzso Patients were divided into four groups, according to the presence of hypertension and zzso Group zzso with hypertension and MA, Group zzso with hypertension but without MA, Group zzso without hypertension and MA, Group zzso without hypertension but with zzso zzso of zzso patients were without hypertension and zzso while the most frequent zzso patients were those with hypertension zzso with and zzso without zzso A significant correlation between zzso and zzso zzso in both types of zzso zzso zzso for zzso and p zzso for zzso was zzso zzso zzso patients were obese and there was a significant correlation between a patient's zzso zzso and his or her age zzso zzso 

These results suggest that hypertension can be prevented in patients with zzso with weight zzso There was a significant association between hypertension and zzso especially in zzso zzso Tight control of blood pressure is essential for the reduction of zzso as well as further zzso and zzso diabetic zzso
