We compared health behaviors and health outcomes among zzso zzso and zzso pregnant Black women and examined whether zzso and zzso characteristics explained differences among these population zzso 

We analyzed data from a prospective cohort study conducted in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with a series of zzso zzso zzso models predicting zzso alcohol, and marijuana use and measures of physical and mental zzso 

zzso Black women were significantly less likely to engage in substance use and had better zzso physical and mental health than did native-born Black zzso These findings were largely unchanged by adjustment for zzso and zzso zzso The foreign-born advantage varied by place of zzso it was somewhat stronger for zzso women than for zzso zzso
