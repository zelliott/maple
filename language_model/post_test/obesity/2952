zzso analysis with a zzso zzso of 340 subjects representative of people likely to be examined in a center specialized in diabetes detection was performed by multiple zzso analysis, which provides zzso of discrimination for different sets of blood zzso zzso zzso The relative sensitivity and the relative specificity of six different diagnostic zzso zzso and zzso zzso WHO, British zzso Association, zzso and European Study Group of Diabetes zzso were zzso giving a quantitative determination for the degree of zzso in the definition of zzso only 48 per cent of the subjects are classified in the same way by any of the diagnostic zzso The zzso of sampling and the index or zzso of zzso which are the most efficient in screening diabetes were estimated from homogeneous groups of subjects universally recognized as zzso zzso or as diabetic zzso according to the different diagnostic zzso Better discriminating power zzso between zzso and zzso compared with the maximum zzso as measured by zzso of zzso from the seven zzso values of the zzso is given by the two-hour zzso per zzso than by the one-hour zzso per zzso zzso value when a single value is zzso the zzso zzso value is the best set of two times zzso per zzso The different zzso now in use for the zzso of the zzso have been found less effective than the weighted sum of zzso zzso zzso The difficulty in obtaining highly specific diagnostic tests is discussed in relation to the consequences on a partly automated screening in large zzso
