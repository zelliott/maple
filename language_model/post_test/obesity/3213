Traditional risk factors predict the 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease zzso zzso risk factors like physical zzso obesity zzso zzso and family history of premature zzso are independently associated with zzso High burden of coronary artery zzso zzso on electron beam zzso zzso is a zzso risk zzso 

To determine the association between zzso and traditional risk assessment and whether the presence of added underlying risk factors is associated with advanced zzso in low- and zzso zzso 

After excluding patients with zzso we studied zzso zzso individuals referred for zzso for cardiac risk zzso Traditional zzso zzso risk score was estimated according to zzso criteria, and individuals were divided into 3 groups: low-risk zzso zzso zzso risk over the next 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso and high-risk zzso % zzso Advanced zzso was defined as a calcium zzso or zzso zzso based on sex and zzso 

The prevalence of advanced zzso was zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in high-risk individuals zzso zzso zzso risk factors were zzso associated with advanced zzso in low- and zzso individuals zzso zzso A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that addition of underlying risk factors to traditional risk assessment increased the area under the curve significantly from zzso to zzso zzso zzso 

A substantial proportion of low- and zzso individuals have advanced zzso Adding family history, zzso and physical zzso to traditional risk assessment improves prediction of advanced zzso which may lead these individuals to be treated more aggressively at an earlier zzso
