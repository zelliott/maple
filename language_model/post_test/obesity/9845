In the present study, the nutritional quality of four grains including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso barley zzso and white rice zzso were evaluated in terms of plasma zzso zzso gut transit time, and thickness of the zzso wall in zzso The rats were then raised for 4 weeks on the high-fat diet based on the American Institute of zzso zzso zzso diets containing 1 % cholesterol and 20 % dietary zzso Forty male rats were divided into 4 groups and raised for 4 weeks with a diet containing one of the following zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso The level of zzso zzso substances zzso in liver was shown to be higher in rats by the order of those fed zzso zzso zzso and zzso This indicates that other grains decreased zzso stress in zzso more than zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels in the zzso zzso and zzso groups were significantly higher than those in the WR group zzso zzso Plasma zzso profiles differed significantly according to grain zzso and decreased zzso wall thickness was consistent with the finding of decreased plasma zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso in rats fed zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso capacities of grains are quite high, especially those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that the whole grains had a zzso zzso This effect was related to several mechanisms that corresponded to lowering plasma zzso decreasing zzso and increasing zzso zzso
