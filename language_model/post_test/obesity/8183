zzso resistance has been recognized as a major factor in the development of zzso fatty liver disease zzso The association between insulin resistance and zzso as a risk factor independent of obesity has been less well zzso This study aims to determine presence of insulin resistance and components of zzso syndrome in non-obese patients with zzso 

150 patients zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso 115 zzso male, 35 zzso zzso diagnosed with zzso participated in the zzso We measured body mass index zzso waist circumference zzso waist hip ratio zzso zzso zzso profile, zzso zzso zzso insulin, and liver zzso zzso resistance was calculated using the zzso model of assessment zzso zzso zzso resistance was arbitrarily considered altered when it zzso 

120 zzso of the 150 patients were zzso zzso according to the Asia Pacific zzso 40 zzso had zzso zzso zzso zzso had insulin resistance with mean zzso resistance zzso of zzso Thirty zzso were zzso of these, 7 had central obesity zzso 90 zzso for zzso 80 zzso for zzso zzso zzso patients were lean zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in men and zzso zzso in zzso zzso of these 23 zzso had insulin resistance with mean zzso of zzso Only 4 zzso did not have any component of zzso zzso 

zzso resistance often associated with zzso syndrome is common and plays a key role amongst lean Indian patients with zzso fatty liver zzso
