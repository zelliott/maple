zzso load applied to the airways may induce zzso fatigue, and zzso has been shown to zzso to the development of zzso zzso muscle fatigue may occur in patients with zzso sleep zzso syndrome zzso as these patients zzso develop both zzso loading and zzso The results of previous studies on this topic are inconclusive, probably because of the zzso approaches zzso 

Six obese patients with zzso underwent a zzso zzso The zzso pressure time index zzso was evaluated as an indicator of zzso contraction, and the mean frequency of the zzso zzso power spectrum zzso and the maximum relaxation rate of zzso pressure zzso as zzso of a fatiguing zzso A total of 119 randomly selected zzso (each including zzso zzso zzso were zzso throughout the night in zzso sleep to assess possible muscle fatigue due to the high pressure generation in each zzso A zzso zzso analysis was performed on the first three zzso zzso on all the zzso efforts, and on the first three zzso breaths following the zzso zzso zzso fatigue development due to the cumulative effect of zzso over the night was also zzso 

A progressive increase of zzso and zzso was found during the zzso phase in all the subjects in the zzso zzso The overnight analysis did not show a reduction in either zzso zzso or zzso secondary to zzso upper airway obstruction during the zzso 

No evidence of zzso fatigue or impaired zzso contraction was found either within each zzso or throughout the whole night, despite the generation of high zzso values during the zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso fatigue does not occur in zzso during zzso zzso
