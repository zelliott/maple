zzso zzso zzso are the products of the zzso degradation of zzso zzso produced by the liver and zzso Recent studies have demonstrated that zzso are correlated with cardiovascular zzso We assessed the relationship between obesity and zzso and evaluated the factors related to zzso in children and zzso 

We measured zzso waist zzso blood pressure, body fat mass, total abdominal fat, visceral and subcutaneous fat areas, zzso zzso insulin, total cholesterol, zzso LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and zzso cholesterol in 135 children and adolescents zzso boys and 68 zzso Plasma zzso zzso were isolated using an zzso gel containing specific zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based on the zzso zzso the subjects were divided into two groups: normal zzso zzso and overweight zzso or zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cholesterol was significantly correlated with age, sex, zzso waist zzso zzso and zzso blood pressures, visceral and subcutaneous fat areas, zzso fat area ratio, total cholesterol, zzso HDL cholesterol, zzso and zzso model assessment of insulin resistance zzso According to the zzso zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso were independently correlated with zzso zzso After excluding zzso profiles as an independent zzso the zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso were independently associated with zzso zzso
