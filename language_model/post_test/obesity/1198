To assess the level of serum zzso zzso in zzso and obese zzso subjects with zzso body zzso 

zzso zzso levels were measured in 30 long-standing zzso patients zzso of diabetes zzso zzso 3 years, mean zzso zzso with 15 of the patients being obese of zzso distribution zzso 30 zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, there were 15 zzso obese zzso subjects and 10 healthy subjects serving as the control zzso 

All groups of patients in this study zzso obese, and obese zzso showed significantly higher levels of zzso than the healthy control zzso zzso zzso were significantly higher in zzso patients with zzso type of obesity than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso greater levels of zzso were found in zzso subjects with diabetes when compared with obese subjects without diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso Furthermore, zzso serum zzso were not dependent on the degree of zzso control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso uncontrolled zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but were much greater in subjects with diabetes complicated by vascular disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso uncomplicated zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso No correlation was found between zzso and other zzso parameters in this zzso 

zzso levels are significantly elevated in both zzso and zzso zzso patients regardless of the degree of zzso zzso zzso is an independent risk factor showing greater zzso in those subjects complicated with diabetic vascular zzso
