zzso related to energy balance and obesity are exceptionally complex, with varying contributions of genetic zzso and interacting environmental zzso The use of mouse models has been a powerful driving force in understanding the genetic architecture of zzso traits such as zzso However, the use of mouse models for analysis of complex traits is at an important zzso zzso association studies in humans are now leading to direct identification of obesity zzso In this review, we focus on three areas representing the current and future roles of mouse models regarding zzso of complex zzso First, we zzso increasingly powerful ways to harness the strength of mouse models for discovery of genes affecting zzso zzso Second, we examine the status of using a systems biology approach to dissect the genetic architecture of zzso And third, we explore the effects of recent findings indicating increasing levels of complexity in the nature of variation zzso and the zzso of, complex traits such as zzso
