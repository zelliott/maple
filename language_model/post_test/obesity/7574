This review focuses on the novel zzso and zzso mechanisms underlying the zzso of zzso with particular attention to the role of zzso and the contributions of other joint zzso to cellular events that lead to the onset and progression of the disease and irreversible cartilage zzso 

Studies during the past 2 years have uncovered novel pathways that, when zzso cause the normally zzso zzso zzso to become activated and undergo a zzso shift, leading to the disruption of zzso and ultimately to the zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso Studies in animal models and retrieved human zzso indicate that zzso factors may be produced by the zzso themselves or by the zzso and other surrounding zzso even in the absence of overt zzso and that multiple pathways zzso on the zzso of zzso and zzso especially zzso zzso attention has been paid to the contribution of zzso in zzso joint injury, such as zzso tears, and the protective role of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso responses through zzso such as zzso domain zzso and zzso New findings about zzso signals, including the zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and their zzso by inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for advanced zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso are zzso 

Further work on zzso and pathways that are common across different models and occur in human zzso and that impact the zzso disease process at different stages of initiation and progression will inform us about new directions for targeted zzso
