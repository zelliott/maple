We tested a hypothesis that interactions between zzso zzso the major zzso zzso zzso and its zzso alpha 4 beta 1 zzso is important in the development of zzso injury of zzso liver zzso We examined the effect of connecting zzso zzso zzso blockade of zzso 4 beta 1 interaction in a well-established zzso rat liver model of ex zzso cold zzso followed by zzso In this model, zzso peptides were administered through the portal vein of zzso zzso rat zzso before and after cold zzso zzso zzso zzso recipients of fatty liver transplants received an additional zzso course of zzso peptides after zzso zzso zzso therapy significantly inhibited the recruitment of T zzso zzso zzso and zzso the expression of zzso tumor necrosis zzso and zzso Moreover, it resulted in selective zzso of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso formation, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso therapy improved zzso preservation of zzso liver zzso and extended their zzso survival in lean recipients from zzso in zzso to zzso in zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso blockade of zzso 4 beta 1 interaction protects against severe zzso injury experienced otherwise by zzso zzso These novel findings document the potential of targeting zzso 4 beta 1 in zzso interaction to increase the transplant donor pool through zzso of marginal zzso zzso
