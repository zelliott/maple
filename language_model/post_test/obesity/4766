zzso studies indicate that diabetes is a zzso at risk for particulate matter zzso cardiovascular disease zzso Recent animal studies suggested PM might impair zzso zzso which may lead to zzso However, the mechanism remains zzso 

To investigate further the PM effect on insulin resistance zzso in obese and healthy zzso 

Male zzso rats were fed with either a high fat diet zzso or normal zzso diet zzso for 6 zzso Both groups were then further assigned to receive zzso zzso or normal saline zzso zzso 6 per zzso by zzso zzso zzso once per week for 3 zzso zzso zzso and insulin were measured and zzso model zzso resistance zzso was used to assess zzso zzso tests and lipids profile were examined at zzso The markers of zzso and zzso an indicator of zzso oxide zzso production, zzso protein zzso and white blood counts zzso in peripheral blood were also zzso 

Body weight, insulin and zzso of zzso rats were significantly increased compared with a zzso after 6 zzso In zzso rats, zzso increased zzso after first IT and further increased zzso at the end of zzso However, this increase was not observed in zzso rats and after zzso zzso Increased zzso was also noted after chronic zzso exposure in both zzso and zzso zzso 

Exposure to zzso enhanced zzso in zzso rats but not in zzso zzso zzso subjects with zzso may be a susceptible population to particulate air zzso
