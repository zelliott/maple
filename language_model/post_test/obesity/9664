The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of zzso zzso based on spectral zzso zzso zzso zzso extraction with additional noise reduction using zzso reconstruction in simulated optimal and obese patient zzso 

Two zzso zzso zzso were containing 10 zzso with zzso zzso representing zzso enhancement ranging from water zzso to zzso zzso units and, in addition, 40 zzso simulating enhancement seen in zzso zzso inlet zzso and urinary zzso collecting systems of up to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acquisition was performed using a zzso scanner at 140 zzso zzso and 80 zzso zzso zzso soft tissue kernels and corresponding zzso reconstructed kernels generated zzso series used for zzso zzso variations between known and zzso determined zzso concentration were calculated for each concentration zzso paired zzso tests evaluated variations between zzso and zzso reconstructed data sets for small and obese zzso zzso plots with zzso analyses assessed concentration differences observed in zzso and zzso reconstructed zzso 

For zzso data, mean concentration variations of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were detected in small and large zzso respectively, compared with significantly less variation observed in zzso reconstructed data with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso systematically overestimated zzso in lower concentration ranges and underestimated zzso in higher concentration zzso zzso analyses showed cubic distribution of concentration differences for zzso (R zzso zzso and linear distribution for zzso reconstructed data (R zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso is able to accurately zzso zzso in zzso simulating optimal and large zzso zzso reconstruction improves the accuracy of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso determined zzso zzso could potentially be corrected with weighting zzso
