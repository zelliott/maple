zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is increased in zzso tissue in obesity and type 2 diabetes zzso and strong zzso suggests that it is implicated in the zzso of insulin zzso and action in the zzso zzso To determine the role of zzso in zzso insulin resistance in zzso we zzso zzso (also known as zzso in obese zzso mice zzso 

Mice of zzso zzso were obtained by crossing zzso mice with zzso zzso zzso tolerance and insulin sensitivity were studied in zzso zzso zzso insulin sensitivity, insulin zzso liver zzso and zzso tissue inflammation were zzso 

While zzso and zzso mice exhibited comparable body weight and zzso zzso mice did not develop zzso and their zzso tolerance was zzso zzso clamp studies demonstrated an increase in zzso insulin sensitivity in the zzso mice associated with an increase in both zzso zzso disposal in skeletal muscles and zzso tissue insulin zzso This occurred in parallel with improved insulin zzso in both zzso The zzso mice were also partially protected against zzso zzso with a strong reduction in zzso zzso zzso These zzso improvements were associated with reduced expression of zzso zzso inflammatory zzso and T zzso markers in the zzso zzso 

Our results demonstrate that the targeting of zzso could partially protect obese mice against insulin resistance and liver zzso by decreasing zzso tissue inflammation and by increasing muscle zzso zzso Our results indicate that deregulation of the zzso zzso could be an important component in zzso zzso zzso
