zzso were found to inhibit zzso gene expression and zzso both in zzso and in animal zzso We evaluated first the acute effect of zzso zzso on zzso in normal subjects and zzso plasma zzso levels in a series of patients with zzso syndrome compared with zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was administered zzso to five healthy volunteers, with blood samples taken at zzso 0, 30, 60, 120 and 180 zzso zzso patients with zzso syndrome were divided in two groups: one with 11 obese and the other with 10 non-obese zzso zzso Each group was compared with controls that were matched for sex, age, body mass index, waist zzso zzso insulin, zzso levels and blood zzso 

In normal subjects, zzso produced a decrease in zzso at 30 and 60 zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso was lower in non-obese zzso patients than in non-obese controls zzso In contrast, there was no difference in zzso levels in obese zzso patients and in obese zzso zzso was zzso correlated zzso with zzso model assessment index in both obese and non-obese zzso zzso in non-obese zzso patients only, zzso was zzso correlated with urinary cortisol zzso 

zzso inhibit zzso in man, as shown by both zzso administration to healthy subjects and zzso cortisol zzso Similar levels of zzso in obese zzso patients and their obese controls indicate that obesity per zzso may act as a zzso factor in masking the relationship between zzso and zzso
