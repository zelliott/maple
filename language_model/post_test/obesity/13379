zzso plasma zzso acid and insulin zzso were determined in subjects with zzso obesity and in zzso controls before and after a zzso period of physical zzso After the training period the plasma zzso of insulin and zzso decreased and the concentration of zzso increased in the obese zzso No changes were noticed in the zzso The obese subjects had elevated plasma levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso before as well as after physical zzso The zzso of these zzso acids were correlated to the plasma insulin level and to lean body mass before but only to lean body mass after physical zzso It is suggested that the lean body mass, zzso is higher in zzso zzso contributes to the elevated zzso of zzso zzso and it is unlikely that the insulin decreases in the obese subjects after physical training is zzso through an effect of zzso acids on insulin zzso
