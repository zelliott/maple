The international zzso zzso Task zzso zzso body mass index zzso zzso are widely used to assess the prevalence of child overweight, obesity and zzso Based on data from six countries fitted by the zzso method, they link zzso values at 18 years zzso 17, zzso 25 and 30 zzso zzso to child zzso which are averaged across the zzso Unlike other zzso references, zzso the World Health Organization zzso standard, these zzso cannot be expressed as zzso zzso zzso 

To address this, we averaged the previously unpublished zzso M and S zzso for the six countries, and used them to derive new zzso defined in terms of the zzso at 18 years corresponding to each zzso zzso These new zzso were compared with the zzso and with the WHO standard and reference, by measuring their prevalence rates based on US and Chinese zzso 

The new zzso were virtually identical to the zzso giving prevalence rates differing by zzso on zzso The discrepancies were smaller for overweight and obesity than for zzso The international and WHO zzso were systematically different zzso age zzso 

Defining the international zzso in terms of the underlying zzso zzso has several zzso New zzso are easy to derive zzso zzso 35 for zzso zzso and they can be expressed as zzso zzso zzso boys obesity zzso zzso zzso allowing them to be compared with other zzso zzso For WHO, median zzso is relatively low in early life and high at older ages, probably due to its method of zzso
