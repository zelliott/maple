The expression of zzso zzso zzso and that of the zzso growth zzso zzso zzso are positively correlated in breast cancer zzso Their function is strongly linked in enhancing zzso activity in normal and zzso human zzso zzso cells in zzso This review examines the likely role of such a mechanism in the increased breast cancer risk reported in zzso women with abdominal zzso zzso breast zzso show an increased proportion of zzso cells with high zzso activity, and recent studies suggest that genetic zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso alpha gene may increase the zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso obesity in women is associated with higher zzso both of free zzso and free zzso zzso of their respective receptors may induce synergistic stimulation of zzso zzso However, there is clinical evidence that progression in zzso breast zzso may be delayed or zzso zzso occurs spontaneously in a proportion of duct zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso as women approach the menopause, and zzso therapy has been shown to reduce recurrence and progression of zzso zzso 

zzso trials in breast cancer prevention would greatly benefit from surrogate response markers which could predict long-term zzso Changes in zzso and zzso expression apart from those in zzso zzso criteria, might predict the likelihood of zzso zzso in cancer prevention zzso Future studies could involve examination of serial core zzso from normal breast tissue during trials of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of changes in these markers with changes in circulating zzso and zzso zzso may help to clarify the roles of the zzso
