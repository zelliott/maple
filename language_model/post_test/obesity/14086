We have shown that individually, dietary fiber and protein increase zzso of the zzso and zzso hormone, zzso zzso zzso 

Our objective was to combine, in one diet, high levels of fiber and protein to maximize zzso zzso improve zzso zzso and reduce weight zzso 

zzso zzso and obese zzso male James C Russell zzso zzso rats lacking a functional zzso zzso were fed one of four experimental diets zzso high protein zzso high fiber zzso zzso fiber zzso or combination zzso for 3 zzso An oral zzso tolerance test zzso was performed to evaluate plasma zzso insulin and zzso Plasma lipids and zzso zzso zzso expression were zzso 

Energy intake was lower with the zzso diet in lean and obese zzso Weight gain did not differ between zzso Higher zzso zzso zzso in lean rats fed a CB diet was associated with higher zzso zzso during zzso The zzso diet significantly reduced plasma zzso area under the curve zzso during zzso in obese rats, which reflected both an increased zzso zzso and higher zzso zzso zzso containing zzso resulted in the lowest plasma zzso and total cholesterol zzso 

Overall, combining zzso with zzso in the diet increased zzso zzso in response to oral zzso but did not improve zzso tolerance or zzso profiles more than the zzso diet alone zzso We also suggest that zzso and zzso response to zzso differ among rat models and future research work should examine their role in improving zzso tolerance in zzso zzso genetic obesity with overt zzso
