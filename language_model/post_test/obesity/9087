The study involved 258 children zzso males and zzso zzso with an average age of zzso zzso Weight and height were obtained for each child and zzso was calculated according to the formula weight zzso zzso The prevalence of overweight and obese subjects was then determined using the growth zzso of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention zzso the growth zzso of the International zzso Task Force zzso and the zzso published in 2003 by zzso et zzso 

All three methods gave similar, but not zzso estimates of the prevalence of overweight in both boys and zzso However, when determining the prevalence of zzso the use of the zzso zzso led to a significantly higher prevalence of obesity in both males and females when compared to the growth charts of the zzso and zzso et zzso 

The use of the zzso growth zzso leads to an increase in the prevalence of obesity when evaluating children under 5 years of zzso The lower zzso values inherent in the zzso charts, in contrast to the ones proposed by the zzso allow for earlier identification of a larger number of subjects with weight problems and therefore provide the potential for earlier zzso
