zzso is hypothesized to involve zzso zzso and the condition has been related to increased zzso to zzso The present study analyzed the association between zzso and zzso assessed as clinical attachment loss zzso and bleeding on probing zzso in a zzso zzso 

Participants included zzso women and zzso men aged 20 to 95 years zzso rate zzso who underwent an oral examination, including zzso recording of clinical zzso and zzso zzso and obesity were assessed by body mass index zzso using the World Health Organization zzso zzso was related to clinical zzso zzso as zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso by multivariable zzso zzso in the total population and in subjects zzso by gender and smoking zzso 

zzso participants had a lower odds ratio zzso for clinical zzso compared to participants with normal weight zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso The same tendency was observed in subjects zzso by smoking zzso zzso zzso had a lower OR for clinical zzso compared to zzso participants with normal weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso participants had a higher OR for zzso compared to subjects with normal weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso In addition, overweight zzso had a higher OR for zzso compared to normal weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

zzso may be zzso associated with clinical zzso but positively related to zzso
