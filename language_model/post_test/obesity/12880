We have previously observed that obese viable yellow zzso mice exhibit increased zzso zzso zzso and fatty acid zzso zzso gene zzso further, zzso zzso protein increases in cultured zzso and these effects are inhibited by zzso channel zzso zzso we determined the effect of zzso channel blockade zzso for 4 zzso on zzso and obesity in transgenic mice expressing the zzso gene in a ubiquitous zzso The transgenic mice initially were significantly heavier zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and exhibited a zzso degrees C lower initial core temperature zzso an approximately twofold increase in fat pad weights zzso a zzso increase in zzso zzso activity zzso and a twofold increase in plasma insulin level zzso compared to control zzso zzso treatment resulted in an zzso decrease in fat pad weights zzso and a zzso decrease in zzso zzso activity zzso zzso circulating insulin levels and insulin sensitivity zzso and zzso elevated core temperature in the transgenic mice, but was without effect in the control zzso These data suggest that zzso regulates zzso fat storage, and possibly zzso at least zzso via a zzso zzso and that zzso channel blockade may partially zzso zzso zzso
