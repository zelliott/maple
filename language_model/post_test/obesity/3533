We examined the association of zzso body mass index zzso and zzso weight gain zzso with risk of death during infancy using the Institute of Medicine's zzso zzso Weight zzso zzso 

We obtained maternal and infant data for zzso from zzso women with a zzso zzso live birth in the 41 states that participated in phase 5 of the zzso zzso Assessment Monitoring zzso We fit zzso zzso models to estimate the association between zzso zzso zzso and risk of death during zzso controlling for zzso 

Only zzso of women gained the zzso amount of weight during zzso zzso born to zzso zzso and overweight women with inadequate zzso had odds of mortality during infancy that were zzso zzso and zzso times higher, respectively, than those of infants born to women with adequate zzso zzso born to obese women with excessive weight gain had a zzso decreased likelihood of zzso 

A significant association exists between inadequate zzso and infant death that zzso with increasing zzso zzso weight gain beyond the recommended amount appears to be protective against infant zzso
