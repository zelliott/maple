zzso tissue distribution was examined in normal and zzso obese zzso rats following constant infusion to zzso zzso distribution was linear among all zzso and uniform throughout body water zzso The apparent distribution zzso zzso zzso serum zzso ranged from zzso to zzso for all lean zzso but averaged zzso in zzso zzso rats had a consistently higher zzso in several zzso including muscle, heart, and liver caused by reduced (from 42 to 33 per zzso serum protein zzso Muscle slice zzso of zzso from buffer was similar in normal and obese animals, confirming serum binding as the factor altering zzso The conceptual and applied bases of calculating and measuring zzso volume of distribution zzso by various methods were zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso by obesity can be accounted for by zzso in serum binding and expanded lean and fat tissue masses, rather than changes in tissue zzso
