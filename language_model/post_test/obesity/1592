The influence of minimally invasive options has led to the application of new evolving techniques in zzso surgery to eliminate visible neck zzso Here, we describe one author's experience with zzso robotic zzso and examine the effect of experience on determining the learning curve and improvements over time in operative zzso 

With zzso approval, a prospective analysis of our surgical experience was zzso All patients underwent robotic zzso zzso by a single surgeon between September 2009 and June zzso Principal outcomes measures included length of hospital stay, zzso of zzso and effect of obesity on zzso 

One hundred consecutive operations were performed on 91 zzso zzso zzso 22 total or zzso zzso and 9 completion zzso procedures were zzso Of patients who underwent zzso zzso were discharged within 4 hours; the remaining patients were discharged within 23 zzso Mean operative time for zzso was zzso zzso zzso minutes, and for total or zzso zzso mean operative time was zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean robot zzso time was zzso zzso zzso minutes for all zzso zzso contributed to prolonged total operative zzso Improvement in the length of time to perform components of the procedure was noted after 45 zzso Two cases required conversion to a cervical zzso There were no instances of permanent vocal zzso zzso on zzso zzso 

Here we report the largest experience of robotic zzso zzso surgery in the United zzso This novel technique provides excellent zzso results and can be performed as an zzso procedure in selected group of zzso It is feasible and safe, however, has a lengthy learning zzso
