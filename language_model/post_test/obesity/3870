The retrospective cohort studies of David zzso and colleagues during the late 1980s established the principle that the zzso of certain adult diseases such as stroke, type 2 diabetes and zzso may be linked to in zzso zzso Later termed the zzso Origins of Health and Disease zzso hypothesis, there have been several more recent attempts to explain this zzso Although a general conceptual framework has been established to explain how mechanisms may have evolved to facilitate rapid adaptations to changing ecological conditions, it doesn't identify the actual mechanisms responsible for such zzso zzso zzso modifications to DNA and related proteins occur from the earliest stages of zzso zzso These determine zzso patterns of gene expression and so represent the most plausible mechanisms by which environmental factors can influence development during the life zzso In providing a contemporary overview of zzso modifications during early zzso development, this review highlights both the complexity and our current lack of understanding of how zzso zzso may contribute to in zzso zzso It concludes by providing some thoughts to future research zzso where the emphasis should be on zzso our understanding of zzso and devising more thoughtful experimental approaches that focus on specific environmental factors in appropriate animal and cellular zzso
