zzso fatty liver disease zzso is associated with impaired zzso and zzso zzso However, the metabolism of cholesterol in zzso remains zzso We investigated how fatty liver influences cholesterol metabolism in 242 zzso zzso 

Liver fat content was measured with zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso metabolism was zzso with serum zzso zzso surrogate markers of cholesterol synthesis and zzso The analyses were performed with zzso zzso 

A total of 114 subjects had zzso and 128 subjects had normal liver fat zzso zzso zzso reflecting cholesterol synthesis zzso zzso and zzso were higher, and those reflecting cholesterol zzso zzso and plant zzso were lower in subjects with zzso than in controls, independent of body mass zzso Liver fat content was positively associated with markers of cholesterol synthesis zzso zzso from zzso to zzso p zzso for all) and zzso associated with markers of cholesterol zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso p zzso for zzso In the entire study group, synthesis and zzso markers were zzso indicating that the zzso of cholesterol metabolism was zzso LDL cholesterol was similar in the two zzso 

We demonstrated that although LDL cholesterol zzso are zzso cholesterol metabolism in zzso is characterized by increased synthesis and diminished zzso of zzso These changes are associated with liver fat content independent of body zzso
