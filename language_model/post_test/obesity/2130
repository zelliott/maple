The discoveries of the zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso and the zzso hormone zzso have translated into zzso therapies for zzso Both classes of molecules also exhibit zzso effects and have been investigated for their zzso zzso In the present review, we explore the mechanisms underlying the zzso and pharmacological actions of zzso and zzso zzso Despite their similarities zzso both molecular classes slow gastric zzso decrease zzso and inhibit food zzso there are important distinctions between the central and/or peripheral pathways that mediate their effects on zzso and energy zzso We suggest that understanding the similarities and differences between these molecules holds important implications for the development of novel, zzso therapies, which are increasingly the norm for zzso zzso Finally, the future of zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso
