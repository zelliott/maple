A twofold or greater risk of neural tube zzso zzso pregnancy has been associated with zzso zzso where obesity was defined as body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso have been more elevated for zzso zzso than for zzso 

We investigated whether finer zzso zzso of zzso zzso in combination with other factors, were associated with a zzso zzso zzso Data were derived from a zzso study of fetuses and infants with zzso among zzso California zzso Interviews were conducted with mothers of 277 zzso zzso cases and 517 zzso zzso 

Women with a zzso zzso zzso compared with those zzso zzso revealed an odds ratio zzso of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) for zzso zzso in their infants and zzso zzso risks were observed for each zzso zzso zzso and risks varied by zzso open zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso closed zzso zzso zzso isolated, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso high, zzso zzso low, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were higher among female zzso and foreign-born zzso and for some zzso the risks were quite large, zzso OR zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso among female zzso whose mothers zzso zzso compared with males whose mothers were zzso zzso zzso zzso vitamin use was not observed to influence risk as greatly across zzso 

The observed zzso zzso of zzso obesity and zzso zzso risks suggests that there are likely to be several zzso mechanisms underlying the zzso
