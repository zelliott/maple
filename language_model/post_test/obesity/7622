We hypothesized that zzso adaptations related to pregnancy and zzso might be associated with differences in blood pressure levels during pregnancy between younger and older zzso This might partly explain the increased risk of zzso zzso disorders with advanced maternal zzso We examined the associations of maternal age with zzso and zzso blood pressure in each zzso of pregnancy and the risks of zzso zzso zzso 

The study was conducted among zzso women participating in a zzso prospective cohort study from early pregnancy zzso Age was assessed at zzso Blood pressure was measured in each zzso Information about zzso zzso disorders was available from medical zzso 

In second and third zzso older maternal age was associated with lower zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso per additional 10 maternal years, zzso Older maternal age was associated with higher third zzso zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso per additional 10 maternal zzso zzso age was associated with zzso hypertension among overweight and obese zzso 

Older maternal age is associated with lower second and third zzso zzso blood pressure, but higher third zzso zzso blood zzso These blood pressure differences seem to be small and within the zzso zzso zzso age is not consistently associated with the risks of zzso zzso zzso zzso body mass index might influence the association between maternal age and the risk of zzso zzso
