We wanted to explore if zzso zzso interacts with fat zzso or zzso physical activity, on fat mass, lean mass and zzso 

Among zzso individuals zzso zzso in the zzso zzso diet and cancer cohort that were zzso for zzso in zzso and had information on dietary intake (from a modified diet history zzso and no history of diabetes, cancer or cardiovascular disease, zzso deaths (including zzso cancer and zzso cardiovascular zzso occurred during zzso years of zzso zzso physical activity was determined from a list of 17 different physical activities in a zzso Body composition was measured using zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso associated strongly with both fat mass and lean mass zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso but we found only significant interactions with fat zzso or physical activity, on fat mass zzso and zzso No significant interaction between zzso zzso and fat intake zzso or zzso physical activity zzso on total mortality were zzso However, we observed a significant interaction between zzso physical activity and zzso zzso on cardiovascular mortality zzso The highest vs lowest zzso of physical activity was associated with zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso reduced cardiovascular mortality among zzso zzso and zzso reduced cardiovascular mortality among zzso carriers zzso 

Our results indicate that zzso zzso associates with both fat mass and lean mass, but the level of fat intake and physical activity only modify the association with fat zzso In addition, zzso zzso may modify the association between physical activity and cardiovascular zzso
