To examine associations among eating frequency, energy intake and body weight at zzso as well as associations among change in eating frequency and change in energy intake and weight during a zzso successful weight loss intervention in overweight and obese zzso zzso 

zzso Swedish women with zzso body mass index of zzso zzso completed a zzso diet record at 10-14 weeks zzso zzso and 12 weeks later zzso which were used to calculate energy intake and eating frequency, that is, the mean number of intake occasions per zzso 

The women had a mean eating frequency of zzso zzso zzso intake occasions at zzso A positive association was found between eating frequency and energy intake at baseline zzso 307 zzso 46 zzso zzso whereas no significant association between eating frequency and weight was observed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso During the intervention period, reduced eating frequency was positively associated with energy intake reduction zzso 169 zzso 69 zzso zzso whereas no significant association was found with weight loss zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Women receiving dietary intervention reduced their eating frequency more during the intervention period than did women not receiving dietary intervention zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A positive association was found between eating frequency and energy intake at baseline and between reduced eating frequency and reduced energy intake during a zzso weight loss intervention in overweight and obese zzso zzso zzso studies on eating frequency are warranted to zzso its effect on energy intake and weight among zzso zzso
