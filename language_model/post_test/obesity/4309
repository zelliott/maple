zzso association studies have shown that variation in the zzso gene zzso to obesity and related traits that are common features of zzso zzso syndrome zzso The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of zzso variation on zzso insulin sensitivity, and zzso and hormonal profiles in zzso 

We examined 136 zzso women zzso body mass index zzso zzso mean age: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clamp and oral zzso tolerance tests and sex hormone assessments were zzso The study group was zzso for the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso vs zzso zzso body weight zzso vs zzso zzso fat mass zzso zzso vs zzso zzso and waist circumference zzso vs zzso zzso were higher in carriers of at least one copy of the A zzso zzso in these parameters were more significant when comparing AA and zzso zzso Women with the AA zzso also had decreased insulin sensitivity zzso and zzso hormone zzso In zzso zzso the association of the zzso gene zzso with insulin sensitivity was no longer significant when zzso was included in the zzso 

Variation in the zzso gene zzso weight, zzso and other measures of obesity and insulin sensitivity in zzso The examined zzso gene zzso appears to have a greater impact on obesity and related traits in zzso than in other zzso The effect on insulin sensitivity appears to be secondary to its influence on obesity and body zzso
