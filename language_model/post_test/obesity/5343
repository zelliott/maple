To evaluate whether subjects with zzso zzso zzso zzso differed in their circulating zzso levels compared with those in subjects without HS and, if so, to examine to what extent such differences are zzso by the adverse pattern of the zzso syndrome zzso typically observed in these zzso 

In a zzso study, we zzso 68 healthy, mildly obese individuals with a negative or negligible daily alcohol zzso 

HS (by zzso zzso tolerance status (by oral zzso zzso insulin resistance zzso zzso model assessment zzso and plasma zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso with zzso HS zzso zzso zzso had markedly lower plasma zzso zzso than those without HS zzso zzso 25) zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso P zzso In addition, the former had significantly higher values for body mass index zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso resistance score, plasma insulin (at zzso and after zzso zzso plasma zzso and liver zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and tended to have lower high density zzso zzso cholesterol zzso The significant differences in plasma zzso levels that were observed between the groups were little affected by adjustment for potential zzso zzso such as age, sex, zzso zzso lipids and zzso resistance zzso Similarly, in zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly predicted the presence of HS zzso zzso and the increased levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso independently of potential zzso 

These results show that decreased plasma zzso zzso are closely correlated with zzso HS in healthy obese zzso
