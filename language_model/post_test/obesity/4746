The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that a lower birth weight, as an indicator of adverse zzso environment, is associated with higher serum zzso levels in European zzso We also examined the possible sexual zzso in this zzso 

zzso serum zzso was measured in 757 European born at term adolescents zzso zzso aged zzso zzso zzso zzso We measured weight and zzso and body mass index was zzso Birth weight, duration of pregnancy, and duration of breast-feeding were obtained from parental zzso zzso of pregnancy and zzso zzso status, center, body mass index, and physical activity were entered as zzso in the zzso 

There was a significant interaction effect between sex and birth weight on serum zzso levels zzso zzso zzso We observed that body weight at birth was zzso and significantly associated with serum zzso levels only in female adolescents zzso zzso zzso adjusted P zzso zzso The association persisted after further controlling for physical activity zzso zzso zzso adjusted P zzso zzso 

These findings provide further evidence for a zzso programming effect of birth weight on serum zzso zzso Our results also contribute to explain the zzso health effects associated with lower birth weight, such as long-term increased risk of developing obesity and type 2 zzso
