An impaired transfer of insulin from the circulation to the zzso fluid has been suggested to contribute to insulin zzso 

The objective of the study was to address whether the delivery of insulin from the circulation to zzso tissue and skeletal muscle is impaired in obese women with zzso zzso compared with lean healthy zzso 

Seven obese zzso women with zzso zzso and nine lean healthy women were zzso The zzso insulin concentration in zzso tissue and muscle tissue was measured by the zzso technique during an oral zzso tolerance test (75 zzso In zzso zzso insulin levels were zzso We used zzso clearance and zzso to monitor blood zzso zzso needle zzso were taken to obtain fat cell zzso 

After oral zzso zzso mean zzso insulin levels were higher in obese women than in the lean zzso However, zzso insulin levels in zzso zzso tissue and zzso muscle were similar in both zzso zzso the proportion of circulating insulin being transported across the vascular zzso to the zzso fluid in zzso tissue and in muscle tissue was significantly lower in the obese compared with the lean zzso 

zzso subjects with zzso zzso need higher circulating insulin levels than lean controls to attain similar zzso insulin levels in zzso tissue and skeletal muscle, indicating an impaired transfer of insulin across the zzso
