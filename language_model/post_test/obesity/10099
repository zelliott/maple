The effects of exercise training on cell surface zzso in skeletal muscle of the obese zzso zzso rat were investigated using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the absence of insulin, zzso transport activity was no different in either zzso zzso or zzso zzso muscles of trained and sedentary obese zzso Likewise, zzso zzso zzso was not altered in these muscles with zzso In contrast, the trained group exhibited significantly greater zzso (2 zzso zzso transport activity in zzso muscles than the sedentary group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso for trained and zzso respectively), which was paralleled by a significant enhancement of zzso cell surface zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for trained and zzso zzso Exercise training, however, did not alter zzso zzso transport activity or cell surface zzso in zzso zzso Finally, exercise training did not alter the ability of muscle contraction to elevate zzso transport activity or cell surface zzso in either zzso or zzso muscles of the obese zzso These results indicate that training improves zzso zzso transport in muscle of the obese zzso rat by increasing zzso content and by altering the normal zzso distribution of these zzso such that they are now capable of zzso to the cell surface in response to the insulin zzso
