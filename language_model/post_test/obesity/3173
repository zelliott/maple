The New Zealand obese zzso mouse strain shares with the related New Zealand black zzso strain a number of zzso zzso Among these is a high proportion of zzso B zzso a subset associated with zzso zzso zzso 50% of zzso males develop a chronic zzso type 2 diabetes syndrome associated with 2 unusual features: the presence of B zzso zzso infiltrates and the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso To establish the potential zzso contributions of B zzso and zzso in this model, a disrupted zzso heavy chain gene zzso zzso on the zzso background was zzso 4 generations into the zzso background and was then zzso to produce mice that initially zzso for zzso versus the zzso zzso zzso and thus permitted comparison of syndrome zzso A new flow zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso expressing mouse insulin zzso showed zzso and zzso zzso zzso in serum from zzso intact zzso but not in zzso male zzso However, the absence of B zzso and zzso distinguishing zzso from zzso males failed to significantly affect zzso zzso The zzso males gained weight less rapidly than zzso zzso probably accounting for a zzso but not zzso of zzso Thus, zzso and the zzso component of the zzso in chronic diabetics were not essential either to development of insulin resistance or to eventual pancreatic beta cell failure and zzso A new zzso designated zzso was generated by zzso zzso zzso zzso Currently at the zzso generation, zzso mice exhibit the same zzso obesity as zzso zzso but develop type 2 diabetes at a higher frequency zzso zzso Also, unlike zzso mice that are difficult to zzso the zzso strain breeds well and thus offers clear advantages to zzso zzso
