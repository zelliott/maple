To investigate the concentration levels of zzso zzso and zzso Y zzso in the blood of obese children, and to zzso the relationship between these zzso 

zzso methods were used to measure the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the blood of 98 obese children zzso male zzso zzso zzso zzso female zzso zzso zzso zzso and in 104 normal children zzso male zzso zzso zzso zzso female zzso zzso zzso zzso as the control zzso 

The zzso zzso in obese children zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso female zzso zzso zzso zzso were higher than those in the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso female zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso The zzso of plasma zzso in zzso children zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso female zzso zzso zzso zzso were lower than those in the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso female zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso correlations between zzso and zzso were noted in the obesity group zzso zzso zzso and the control group zzso zzso zzso P zzso while the slopes in the two groups were different zzso group zzso obese group zzso A positive correlation between zzso and zzso was noted zzso zzso zzso P zzso The fluctuation range of zzso in obese children was markedly narrowed when compared with that in the control zzso 

The concentration level of peripheral zzso and zzso in the obese and non-obese children change zzso The obesity in children zzso with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso as well as with their zzso
