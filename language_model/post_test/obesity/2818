Young female obese zzso and lean mice were fed a single diet containing 10 or zzso zzso or were allowed to zzso from two diets containing 10 and 50, 20 and 60, or 30 and zzso zzso for 3 zzso zzso and lean mice offered a choice of two diets varying in zzso zzso and zzso respectively, of energy from zzso Although both obese and lean mice consumed more protein when allowed to zzso each group maintained the same energy intake as observed when a single diet was zzso Because obese mice consumed more energy than lean mice, their self-selected intake of protein was zzso greater than observed in lean zzso The increased protein intake in self-selected obese mice was associated with a decreased zzso neutral zzso acid ratio in their zzso Average nitrogen retention was only slightly less in obese mice than in lean mice, but the sites of nitrogen deposition differed zzso zzso mice retained only zzso of their nitrogen in the carcass zzso muscle and zzso while lean mice retained zzso of their nitrogen in the zzso In zzso young obese mice allowed to zzso from two diets varying in protein and zzso consumed more protein and more energy, but deposited less nitrogen in their zzso than lean zzso zzso in young obese mice is not directly linked to an increased demand for dietary zzso
