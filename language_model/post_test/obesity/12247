zzso evidence has demonstrated that long-term zzso inflammation is a risk factor for obesity and type 2 diabetes zzso zzso Our previous study reveals a significant association between promoter zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which suggests possible roles of zzso in zzso In this study, we focused on examining the putative regulation of zzso and zzso metabolism by zzso 

zzso mice were zzso injected with either zzso containing full-length zzso zzso gene zzso or zzso zzso for mimicking the status of transient and long-term zzso zzso respectively, and the effects of the zzso zzso to zzso metabolism and insulin sensitivity were subsequently zzso 

Our results reveal that zzso improves insulin sensitivity and zzso tolerance through zzso zzso zzso while attenuating zzso zzso zzso is also involved in zzso metabolism by zzso zzso zzso in fat zzso which lead to decreased weight gain and fat zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso regulates zzso and zzso metabolism by promoting insulin sensitivity, zzso tolerance and zzso zzso zzso This study zzso the novel roles of zzso in metabolism and provides new insights in the interaction between zzso responses, insulin sensitivity and zzso
