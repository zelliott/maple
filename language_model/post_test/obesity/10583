We investigated whether high-fat diet zzso obesity was associated with changed function of components of the zzso zzso zzso sensory and zzso the mechanisms involved and the possible effects of zzso on these zzso 

Male zzso rats were divided into three zzso zzso rats fed a standard diet zzso zzso zzso rats fed a zzso zzso zzso for 7 zzso and zzso rats fed a zzso and treated with zzso (15 zzso zzso ) for 7 zzso zzso of isolated zzso arteries were exposed to electric field stimulation zzso with or without zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and NO release, and zzso expression were also zzso 

zzso induced a greater zzso contraction in obese than in control zzso In zzso rats, zzso reduced zzso zzso by zzso but zzso release was greater and zzso release zzso zzso and zzso increased zzso to zzso in segments from control rats, but not in those from zzso zzso NO release and zzso expression were lower in zzso segments from zzso rats than in control zzso All these changes in zzso rats were reversed by treatment with zzso 

zzso control of zzso zzso tone was altered in zzso zzso zzso zzso and diminished zzso components both contributed to increased zzso responses to zzso All these changes were reversed by zzso indicating novel mechanisms of statins in neural regulation of vascular zzso
