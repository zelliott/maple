The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso on obesity risk and plasma zzso insulin, and zzso levels in a sample of the zzso zzso 

Three hundred and zzso obese patients and 317 controls participated in this zzso The zzso zzso was determined by zzso chain zzso zzso length zzso zzso zzso 

In the entire study sample, no significant differences in zzso zzso were observed between obese patients and zzso However, zzso analysis by gender revealed a quantitative increase in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in obese women (but not zzso compared to zzso When a dominant model of inheritance was zzso the zzso zzso were more prevalent in these obese female patients than in controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that in women only, obesity risk was significantly higher for zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and for carriers of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso for the normal zzso The association between the zzso zzso zzso and obesity remained statistically significant even after adjustment for zzso No relationship was found between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and insulin zzso Additionally, this zzso gene zzso had no effect on plasma zzso zzso 

There is evidence in this study that the zzso zzso zzso is associated with obesity in zzso zzso
