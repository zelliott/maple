zzso zzso drugs are among the most commonly used prescription and over-the-counter medications, but they often produce significant gastrointestinal zzso and zzso particularly in elderly patients and patients with certain zzso Novel zzso drugs are seldom tested in animal models that mimic the high risk human users, leading to an underestimate of the true toxicity of the zzso In the present study we examined the effects of two novel zzso and two commonly used zzso in models in which zzso zzso was expected to be zzso zzso zzso zzso (a hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso (a zzso zzso and zzso zzso were evaluated in healthy, zzso obese, and zzso rats and in rats of advanced age (19 zzso and rats zzso zzso aspirin and/or zzso In all models except hypertension, greater gastric and/or zzso damage was observed when zzso was administered in these models than in healthy zzso zzso damage was significantly increased when zzso with zzso aspirin and/or zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso zzso when tested at doses that were as effective as zzso and zzso in reducing inflammation and zzso zzso activity, did not produce significant gastric or zzso damage in any of the zzso These results demonstrate that animal models of human zzso display the same increased zzso to zzso gastrointestinal damage as observed in zzso Moreover, two novel zzso that release zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso do not induce significant gastrointestinal damage in these models of impaired zzso zzso
