There have been inconsistent results published about the relationship between excess body weight, expressed as increased body mass index zzso and risk of zzso zzso zzso We conducted a zzso to explore this zzso We focused on whether the relationship varied based on the sex of the study subjects, study design, features of the zzso or potential zzso including alcohol use, zzso zzso drug use, smoking, and zzso 

We identified studies by performing a literature search of zzso zzso and zzso Web of Science through July 31, 2011, and by searching the reference lists of pertinent zzso We analyzed 36 independent studies, which included zzso incident cases of zzso zzso relative risks with their zzso confidence intervals zzso were calculated with a zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed using zzso Q statistic and zzso zzso 

Overall, a zzso increase in zzso zzso as zzso increased the risk for zzso zzso relative risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso although there was a high level of zzso among studies zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that the increased risk of zzso in obese individuals was independent of race, geographic location, study design, sex, zzso zzso and zzso The association between increased zzso and risk for zzso was stronger for colon than zzso zzso 

Based on a zzso increased zzso increases the risk for colon but not zzso zzso Unlike zzso cancer, there is no sex difference in the relationship between increased zzso and risk of zzso
