zzso disease zzso is the leading cause of death among women of all races and zzso The risk of developing the disease is greater in zzso zzso 

The purpose of this study was to use cluster analysis to examine diet patterns and to examine the association between diet patterns and the presence of major cardiovascular disease risk zzso 

Data from the zzso National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

Women aged 50 years and older were included zzso 

The following major zzso risk factors were zzso being overweight or obese zzso mass zzso having elevated zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso and having low levels of zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patterns were derived by cluster analysis using data from a 24-hour dietary zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso were calculated using zzso zzso to determine the probability of having a risk factor according to diet pattern while accounting for zzso physical activity, age, and zzso 

zzso analysis generated six zzso diet patterns zzso zzso and Yellow zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Frozen zzso zzso and zzso Meat zzso and Soft zzso and zzso The majority of the women were grouped in the zzso diet zzso zzso associated with adequate levels of zzso zzso cholesterol included being zzso African American zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso alcohol consumption zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and being assigned to the zzso diet pattern zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso or Meat dishes diet pattern zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso The zzso pattern was also associated with having normal zzso blood pressure levels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso grouped in the zzso zzso and Milk diet pattern were more likely to have an adequate body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso 

zzso associations between dietary patterns and major zzso risk factors were zzso Food and nutrition professionals can use this information to assess zzso food choices observed in the dietary patterns to guide nutrition recommendations and help reduce the zzso of zzso risk zzso Future research should aim to evaluate dietary intake via complementary methods zzso dietary patterns and zzso assessment) to better understand zzso zzso
