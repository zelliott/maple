zzso is associated with an impairment of the zzso zzso zzso by all stimuli known to date, but the basic mechanism of this zzso is zzso To determine whether obesity is associated with a chronic state of zzso zzso zzso several tests with zzso stimuli with or without zzso were undertaken in both obese subjects and matched zzso zzso reduces zzso release from the zzso by increasing central zzso zzso The administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso to obese subjects did not modify zzso zzso values zzso zzso zzso zzso at 90 zzso while in control subjects the zzso zzso peak was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso notably increased zzso zzso zzso in both the obese zzso zzso zzso zzso and control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Since zzso acts by releasing zzso zzso similar studies were undertaken employing zzso which presumably enhances zzso release by reducing zzso zzso zzso administration in obese subjects induced an increase in zzso levels of 5 zzso zzso zzso which was significantly smaller than that in the matched control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso increased the zzso action toward a zzso peak of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the obese and zzso zzso zzso zzso in control zzso As a third zzso stimulus of zzso zzso trials of zzso zzso were carried zzso zzso induced an increase in zzso levels in obese subjects of zzso zzso zzso zzso which was higher than that produced by any other zzso but lower than that in control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast with the previous two zzso zzso zzso with zzso did not modify the zzso zzso release in either obese or normal zzso Our results lend support to the view that zzso acts through zzso hormone release and zzso by reducing zzso discharge from the zzso In addition, they seem to indicate that zzso acts by a combination of both mechanisms, mainly through a reduction in zzso zzso These findings support the idea that obesity is associated with a state of chronic zzso zzso as the basis for the zzso in zzso zzso
