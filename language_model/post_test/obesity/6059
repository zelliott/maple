zzso is a novel zzso previously associated with zzso syndrome zzso in a small sample of subjects from zzso 

The aim of the study was to determine whether plasma zzso levels were associated with zzso syndrome zzso in a larger sample from a second, unrelated human zzso 

Plasma samples were obtained from the San Antonio Family Heart Study zzso a large zzso genetic zzso study including zzso Mexican-American zzso zzso were randomly sampled without regard to zzso or disease zzso This sample is zzso for a variety of zzso related to the zzso zzso 

Plasma zzso levels were measured by sandwich zzso Linear zzso and correlation analyses were used to determine associations between plasma zzso levels and zzso syndrome zzso 

zzso zzso levels were significantly higher in zzso subjects with body mass index zzso greater than 30 zzso compared with those with a zzso below 25 zzso zzso zzso Plasma zzso levels were significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso serum insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso zzso independent of age and sex in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso levels were associated with zzso syndrome zzso in a second, unrelated human zzso This zzso result using a large human sample suggests that zzso may be involved in the development of the zzso zzso
