zzso therapy using insulin zzso zzso has demonstrated zzso effects compared with other insulin zzso zzso underlying these effects, however, remain largely zzso Here we zzso that the zzso zzso selective preference allows zzso to exert enhanced action on zzso zzso expression and the production of zzso zzso zzso an zzso hormone possessing both zzso and weight loss zzso To test this hypothesis, we used obese type 2 diabetic zzso mice and conducted a zzso intervention with daily injection of a therapeutic dose of zzso or human insulin zzso in these zzso The body weight of the mice after zzso daily injection of zzso (5 zzso was decreased significantly compared with those injected with the same dose of zzso or zzso The zzso effect of zzso was associated with significantly elevated circulating levels of total zzso and reduced food zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso induced rapid zzso of protein zzso B zzso in the gut L cells of normal zzso Western zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso in a more rapid and enhanced fashion in the mouse zzso zzso compared with those by zzso In zzso investigation in primary fetal rat zzso cell zzso cultures showed that zzso increased zzso zzso expression as determined by Northern zzso and real-time zzso zzso with these in zzso zzso zzso significantly increased zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was also shown to induce rapid zzso of zzso in the zzso gut cell line zzso Furthermore, zzso increased zzso zzso its nuclear zzso and enhanced zzso response zzso protein zzso zzso in a zzso zzso and/or zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso benefit of zzso in mice is related to its zzso zzso preference that leads to profound stimulation of zzso expression and enhanced zzso zzso in zzso L cells, potentially involving the zzso of zzso signaling zzso
