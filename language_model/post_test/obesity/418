To calculate zzso zzso from workplace obesity interventions, employers require information about costs saved by the zzso This article presents a simulation model used to calculate zzso for workplace obesity zzso 

We estimated annual savings in medical expenditures and absenteeism costs by amount of average weight loss for a nationally representative zzso We also present several examples that use the model to evaluate the zzso for published workplace obesity zzso 

Across all overweight and obese employees, zzso weight loss would result in a reduction in total annual costs zzso plus zzso of $90 per zzso 

The results suggest that low-cost policy or environmental change interventions in zzso may be more likely to be cost saving than high cost, individually targeted behavioral change interventions unless they result in substantial weight zzso
