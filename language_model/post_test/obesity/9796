To investigate whether the specific strains of zzso zzso zzso the zzso syndrome in zzso zzso 

8 zzso zzso mice were subdivided into four groups who received either zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or no bacterial supplement in the drinking water for 12 zzso The mice were fed a high-fat Western diet with zzso cholesterol and body weights were monitored zzso At the end of the study, oral zzso and insulin tolerance tests were zzso In addition, zzso and liver weights were recorded along with analyses of zzso expression of zzso zzso protein 4 zzso the zzso marker zzso zzso by the gene zzso and liver zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed in the zzso root region of the zzso 

Mice receiving zzso zzso zzso gained significantly less body weight than the control mice, whereas the zzso mice gained significantly zzso zzso and liver weights were also reduced in the zzso zzso zzso insulin levels were lower in the zzso group, but no significant effects were observed in the zzso or insulin tolerance zzso zzso genes in the liver were not altered by any of the bacterial treatments, however, increased expression of zzso was found in the zzso group, indicating increased zzso zzso the liver zzso towards having lower fat zzso There were no effects on inflammatory zzso blood cholesterol or zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso partly prevented zzso zzso possibly via a previously unknown mechanism of inducing liver expression of zzso
