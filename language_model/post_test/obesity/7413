zzso status influences hormone zzso from specialized zzso cells within the gut zzso These hormones regulate food intake by zzso information to central zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were believed to be the main source of gut peptides regulating food zzso However, recent evidence highlights a specific zzso cell within the zzso zzso of the stomach as an important player in appetite zzso zzso zzso is the only known zzso hormone peripherally produced in gastric zzso cells and centrally acting to stimulate food zzso Recent advances led to the assumption that zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso is also involved in regulating food zzso This, and the novel observation that zzso which zzso food zzso is expressed in zzso cells of the stomach, supports an important role for gastric zzso cells in regulating food zzso Another zzso zzso was initially described as a zzso gene product zzso food zzso but subsequent studies produced controversial data and its action as an zzso factor is zzso zzso synergistic interactions between zzso and zzso peptides seem to orchestrate food intake and body weight regulation, which may have implications for understanding mechanisms leading to the treatment of zzso
