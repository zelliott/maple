zzso prostate specific zzso is widely used to predict zzso pathological features and zzso zzso after radical zzso Recent reports that zzso may be responsible for lower prostate specific zzso in obese men led to concerns that prostate specific zzso may be less effective for zzso in men with increased body mass zzso We determined whether the clinical usefulness of prostate specific zzso is zzso impacted by obesity by examining its operating characteristics and zzso accuracy as a function of body mass zzso 

We performed a zzso retrospective analysis of the records of zzso men who underwent radical zzso from 1988 to 2007 from Veterans Affairs hospitals of the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital zzso the Duke zzso Center and Johns Hopkins zzso zzso curve analysis, the zzso index and the test for interaction were used to compare the ability of prostate specific zzso to predict zzso tumor characteristics and zzso recurrence across body mass index zzso 

There were no significant differences in the area under zzso zzso across increasing body mass index categories for prostate specific zzso to predict pathological zzso sum (7 or greater, 7 zzso + zzso or greater, or 8 or zzso positive surgical margins, zzso extension or seminal zzso invasion in all 3 zzso There was no significant difference in prostate specific zzso accuracy to predict zzso failure across increasing body mass index zzso 

In 3 zzso of men treated with radical zzso the ability of zzso prostate specific zzso to predict adverse pathological features and zzso zzso recurrence is not significantly affected by zzso However, adjusting for obesity related zzso may still be required to properly interpret prostate specific zzso results in men with increased body mass zzso
