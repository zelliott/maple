Although high body mass index zzso is a risk factor for hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, limited data exist on the association of overweight and obesity with early stages of kidney zzso 

zzso data for zzso participants of the nationally representative Third National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso with an estimated zzso zzso zzso or zzso 60 zzso zzso without zzso or zzso were analyzed to determine the association between zzso and elevated serum zzso zzso zzso weight, overweight, class I zzso and class II to III obesity were defined as a zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso serum zzso C was defined zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso for participants zzso years of age without diabetes, hypertension, zzso or zzso or stage 3-5 chronic kidney zzso 

The zzso prevalence of elevated serum zzso C was zzso zzso zzso and zzso among adults of normal weight, overweight, class I zzso and class II to III zzso respectively zzso trend zzso After zzso adjustment for zzso behaviors, zzso blood pressure, and serum zzso and compared with participants of normal weight, the odds ratio zzso confidence zzso of elevated serum zzso C was zzso zzso for overweight, zzso zzso for class I zzso and zzso zzso for class II to III zzso 

A graded association exists between higher zzso and elevated serum zzso zzso Further research is warranted to assess whether reducing zzso favorably affects elevated serum zzso C and the development of chronic kidney zzso
