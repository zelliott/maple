Feeding patterns were examined in obese zzso and lean zzso adult zzso rats over the zzso cycle during 14 zzso zzso rats eat more than lean rats especially during the dark zzso Light and dark feeding expressed as percentage of 24 zzso intake showed no significant differences between the lean and obese zzso The higher food intake in obese rats is mainly caused by larger meals since obese rats ate fewer meals than lean zzso Only for the obese group differences were observed between mean meal size in light and dark zzso There is some indication that the zzso controlled zzso distribution of meals is different in obese rats compared to lean rats since obese rats eat fewer but larger meals during the first half of the dark zzso During this phase meal size increases gradually in the obese rats, suggesting that the zzso influence on feeding motivation is zzso
