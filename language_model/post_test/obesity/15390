We determined the zzso of plasma zzso levels in 20 healthy subjects (10 men, 10 zzso 10 lean, 10 zzso at stable body zzso Blood samples were zzso after an overnight fast, between zzso and zzso on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 19, and zzso Body weights were recorded on the same zzso Plasma zzso was measured using a specific zzso The mean zzso zzso baseline body weights zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The body mass zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean daily zzso plasma zzso level was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso levels zzso were zzso zzso zzso in lean men, zzso zzso zzso in obese men, zzso zzso zzso in lean women, and zzso zzso zzso in obese zzso zzso zzso levels on days 2 to 26 were highly correlated with the baseline levels on day 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso Body weights remained within zzso of zzso whereas zzso zzso levels zzso between zzso and zzso of baseline values, throughout the 26 days of zzso We conclude that zzso plasma zzso levels are zzso with a maximum day-to-day variation of approximately zzso in healthy, zzso lean and obese persons who maintain a stable body zzso
