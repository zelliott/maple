To develop a standard weight zzso that can be used for zzso of patient size for obese zzso 

Data were available from zzso zzso zzso from zzso patients zzso data zzso and zzso from general medical patients zzso data zzso The patients had a wide range of age zzso zzso weight zzso zzso and body mass index zzso zzso zzso in both data zzso From the zzso patients in the zzso data set, an equation for male and female patients was developed to predict their normal weight as the sum of the lean body mass and normal fat body zzso The equations were evaluated by predicting the weight of patients in the general medical data set who had a normal zzso zzso zzso In addition, the clinical utility of the predicted normal weight zzso zzso was assessed by zzso comparing body surface area and zzso zzso calculations based on actual weight of obese patients versus zzso and zzso comparing the zzso performance of zzso clearance using the zzso and Gault equation when using actual weight of obese patients versus zzso to predict zzso zzso 

The zzso equations developed from the zzso data set predicted accurately the actual weight of normal weighted zzso zzso zzso general medical patients zzso zzso zzso men, zzso zzso zzso zzso Using actual weight when computing body surface area and when zzso zzso for obese patients results in significant zzso of patient size, especially for female patients and those with zzso zzso The use of zzso in the zzso and Gault equation provided better predictions of zzso clearance than when using actual zzso 

A standard weight zzso has been developed that can be used in dosing zzso for patients who are obese zzso zzso
