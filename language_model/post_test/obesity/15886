The zzso effect of a high-fat zzso diet is zzso by stimulation of energy expenditure and zzso zzso in response to a zzso The aim of this study was to reveal whether muscle zzso zzso could be zzso by a zzso diet, especially in zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed on male mice born and maintained at 30 degrees zzso zzso mice were randomly weaned onto a low-fat zzso or zzso diet for 2 zzso In the zzso zzso mice, cold exposure (4 degrees zzso resulted in hypothermia, whereas the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice were cold zzso Cold sensitivity of the zzso zzso mice was associated with a relatively low whole body energy expenditure under resting conditions, which was zzso by the zzso zzso In both zzso the zzso diet induced zzso zzso zzso with a stronger induction in zzso zzso Only in zzso zzso 1) the zzso diet zzso zzso of whole body zzso zzso by zzso and 2) at 30 degrees C, oxygen consumption, total content, and zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso muscle was increased by the zzso diet in parallel with significantly increased zzso Gene expression data in zzso muscle of the zzso zzso mice indicated a shift from zzso to fatty acid zzso Our results suggest a role for muscle zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso mice and indicate that a zzso diet could induce zzso in zzso muscle, possibly via the zzso zzso
