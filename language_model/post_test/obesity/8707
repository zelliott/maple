Whereas zzso zzso zzso is strongly associated with the insulin resistant zzso syndrome, it is uncertain whether this is accounted for principally by visceral zzso zzso Several recent studies find as strong or stronger association between subcutaneous abdominal zzso zzso and insulin zzso To zzso the issue of zzso zzso tissue zzso we performed zzso abdominal zzso zzso and we undertook the novel approach of zzso SAT into the plane superficial to the zzso within subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso zzso and that below this zzso zzso zzso as well as measurement of zzso Among 47 lean and obese zzso men and women, zzso zzso zzso measured by zzso zzso was strongly correlated with both zzso and deep SAT zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso both P zzso but not with superficial SAT zzso zzso zzso not zzso Also, zzso and deep SAT followed a highly zzso pattern of associations with zzso and insulin area under the curve zzso oral zzso tolerance zzso mean zzso blood pressure, zzso zzso zzso cholesterol, and zzso zzso SAT had markedly weaker association with all these parameters and instead followed the pattern observed for thigh subcutaneous zzso We conclude that there are two functionally distinct compartments of zzso tissue within abdominal subcutaneous fat and that the deep SAT has a strong relation to insulin zzso
