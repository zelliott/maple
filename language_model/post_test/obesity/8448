The effect of meal frequency on the zzso effect of food zzso was studied in six obese boys and five obese girls zzso mean zzso SE, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso resting energy expenditure zzso were monitored continuously by indirect zzso The children consumed one large liquid meal zzso or three consecutive small meals zzso at zzso h intervals on subsequent zzso The first mode of zzso intake was determined zzso The energy content of the zzso and one zzso was tailored to provide zzso and zzso of the 24 h zzso zzso zzso The zzso changes in zzso were monitored for 6 zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso before the zzso and zzso zzso zzso respiratory quotient, plasma zzso and insulin zzso increased sooner, steeper and higher with the zzso than with the zzso The magnitude of the zzso was greater zzso zzso after the zzso zzso zzso zzso than after the zzso zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that the frequency of food consumption influences the immediate zzso response as well as the changes in respiratory quotient, zzso and zzso However, the complex effect of different meal zzso on the overall energy balance of obese patients cannot be answered on the basis of the present zzso
