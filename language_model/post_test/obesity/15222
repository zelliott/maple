The possible interaction of serum zzso D zzso and obesity in regard to type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance has not been well zzso To explore the effect modification of obesity on the association between zzso and insulin zzso 2 diabetes, data were examined from a nationally representative zzso 

The zzso sample for the type 2 diabetes analysis zzso zzso zzso was limited to participants from the National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso zzso zzso over 20 years of zzso zzso years of age assigned to the morning session and free of diabetes were limited to the insulin resistance analysis zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction was assessed through a zzso interaction term in a multiple zzso zzso zzso The presence of additive interaction between insufficient zzso and obesity zzso by zzso or waist zzso was evaluated by calculation of the relative excess risk due to interaction zzso and attributable proportion due to interaction zzso 

There was no zzso interaction of insufficient zzso and obesity on type 2 diabetes or insulin zzso Furthermore, none of the zzso or zzso values were statistically significant in the diabetes zzso However, there was strong additive interaction between abdominal obesity and insufficient zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in regard to insulin zzso In addition, zzso of the increased odds of insulin resistance can be explained by interaction between insufficient zzso and high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Within a zzso nationally representative sample, abdominal obesity and insufficient zzso interact to zzso influence the risk of insulin zzso
