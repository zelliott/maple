zzso zzso zzso zzso stress has been demonstrated to zzso the induction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso inflammatory responses, and generation of peripheral insulin zzso On the other hand, exercise has been used as a crucial tool in obese and diabetic patients, and may reduce inflammatory zzso zzso However, the ability of exercise training to reverse zzso zzso stress in zzso and zzso tissue in obesity has not been investigated in the zzso Here, we demonstrate that exercise training ameliorates zzso stress and insulin resistance in zzso zzso zzso were fed with standard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or high-fat diet zzso zzso zzso for 2 zzso After that rats were submitted to swimming training (1 h per day, 5 days for week with zzso overload of the body weight for 8 zzso zzso from zzso fat and liver were obtained and western zzso analysis was zzso Our results showed that swimming protocol reduces zzso molecules zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso In addition, exercise leads to reduction in zzso stress, by reducing zzso and zzso zzso in these zzso In zzso an increase in insulin zzso signaling was observed, as confirmed by increases in zzso zzso and zzso zzso following exercise training in zzso zzso Thus, results suggest that exercise can reduce zzso stress, improving insulin resistance in zzso and zzso zzso
