The zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the control of energy zzso To explore the pharmacological utility of zzso zzso for the treatment of zzso we evaluated the efficacy of zzso zzso and determined the relationship between efficacy and brain zzso occupancy in zzso zzso was shown to be a highly potent zzso inverse zzso that inhibited the binding and functional activity of various zzso with a binding zzso of zzso zzso for the human zzso in zzso zzso zzso inhibited food intake and weight gain, with an acute minimum effective dose of 1 zzso in zzso obese zzso zzso zzso zzso effect was demonstrated for zzso by its lack of efficacy in zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso rats with zzso zzso led to significant weight loss with a minimum effective dose of zzso zzso zzso or a plasma zzso of 87 zzso Weight loss was accompanied by the loss of fat zzso zzso occupancy zzso of brain zzso by zzso was sufficient to reduce body zzso The magnitude of weight loss was correlated with brain zzso zzso The partial zzso occupancy requirement for efficacy was also consistent with the reduced food intake of the zzso mice carrying one disrupted zzso of zzso gene compared with the zzso zzso These studies demonstrated that zzso is a highly potent and selective zzso inverse zzso and that it is orally active in zzso models of zzso
