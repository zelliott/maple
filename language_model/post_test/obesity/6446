There is accumulating evidence for a role of tumor necrosis zzso zzso in insulin resistance induced by zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the zzso zzso zzso was associated with responses to oral zzso and fat tolerance tests in a zzso study comparing male offspring with a paternal history of premature zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso controls zzso recruited from 14 European university zzso zzso zzso did not significantly differ between cases and zzso Among cases, those carrying the A zzso exhibited a higher area under the curve for insulin zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso a higher zzso between baseline concentration and peak of insulin zzso vs zzso zzso zzso and a greater decrease between peak and insulin at 120 zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso than those with the zzso zzso No such effect was observed in control zzso No association was observed with response to a fat tolerance test either in cases or in zzso The present results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso might interact with other zzso factors to coronary heart disease to zzso to insulin resistance, and that the ability of zzso to induce insulin resistance may extend beyond zzso
