zzso is a major health problem due, in part, to physical zzso The amount of activity needed to prevent weight gain is zzso 

To determine the effects of different amounts and zzso of exercise zzso 

zzso controlled trial zzso zzso zzso 

zzso overweight men and women zzso zzso zzso with mild to moderate zzso were recruited from Durham, NC, and surrounding zzso 

zzso exercise program with 3 groups: zzso high zzso intensity zzso equivalent to approximately 20 miles zzso zzso of zzso per week at zzso peak oxygen zzso zzso low zzso intensity zzso to approximately 12 miles zzso zzso of zzso per week at zzso and zzso low zzso intensity zzso to approximately 12 miles zzso zzso of walking per week at zzso zzso were counseled not to change their diet and were encouraged to maintain body zzso 

Body weight, body composition (via zzso and waist zzso 

Of zzso subjects screened, 182 met criteria and were zzso and 120 completed the zzso There was a significant zzso zzso relationship between amount of exercise and amount of weight loss and fat mass zzso The zzso group lost significantly more body mass (in mean zzso zzso and fat mass (in mean zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso than the zzso group zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively), the zzso group zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively), and the controls zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso groups had significantly greater improvements than controls but were not different from each zzso Compared with controls, all exercise groups significantly decreased zzso minimal zzso and hip circumference zzso There were no significant changes in dietary intake for any zzso 

In zzso overweight subjects, the controls gained weight, both zzso exercise groups lost weight and fat, and the zzso group lost more of each in a zzso zzso These findings strongly suggest that, absent changes in diet, a higher amount of activity is necessary for weight maintenance and that the positive caloric imbalance observed in the overweight controls is small and can be reversed by a modest amount of zzso Most individuals can accomplish this by walking 30 minutes every zzso
