The aim of this study was to determine an optimal waist circumference zzso zzso value for defining the zzso syndrome zzso in zzso Latin American zzso 

A total of zzso zzso women zzso zzso zzso with zzso good health, attending routine consultation at 12 zzso centers in major Latin American cities were included in this zzso zzso zzso guidelines of the US National zzso Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III were used to assess zzso risk zzso zzso operator characteristic curve analysis was used to obtain an optimal zzso zzso value best predicting at least two other zzso zzso zzso zzso values were calculated by plotting the zzso rate zzso against the zzso rate (1 - zzso In addition, total zzso distance to receiver operator characteristic curve, and the zzso Index were zzso 

Of the participants, zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified as having two or more zzso zzso risk components zzso a positive zzso zzso These women were older, had more years since menopause zzso used hormone therapy less zzso and had higher body mass zzso than women with fewer zzso risk zzso The optimal zzso zzso value best predicting at least two other zzso components was determined to be 88 zzso equal to that defined by the Adult Treatment Panel zzso 

A zzso zzso value of 88 zzso is optimal for defining zzso in this zzso Latin American zzso
