zzso zzso production by the liver contributes significantly to diabetic zzso The zzso system zzso plays a key role in regulating zzso zzso production and therefore its zzso is a potential therapeutic target for the correction of zzso It has previously been shown that zzso steroids, such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibit the zzso system in zzso principally through zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso We report here that in the zzso zzso mouse model, orally administered zzso zzso reduces the zzso elevated zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso protein levels that are characteristic in the zzso zzso and that this reduction is associated with zzso of blood zzso zzso Other zzso and zzso steroids also reduced, to a lesser extent, zzso zzso activity - with the exception of zzso zzso which had no apparent effect on this system in zzso zzso zzso zzso is therefore an effective zzso agent in zzso mice, and the zzso system can be successfully targeted for the therapeutic management of zzso in this animal model of zzso diabetes zzso
