zzso is associated with an increased zzso of many zzso including zzso although it is unknown whether leukemia zzso is increased directly by obesity or rather by associated zzso lifestyle, health, or socioeconomic zzso We developed animal models of obesity and leukemia to test whether obesity could directly accelerate acute zzso leukemia zzso using zzso transgenic and zzso mice weaned onto a high-fat zzso Mice were observed until development of progressive zzso Although obese and control zzso mice had similar median survival, older obese mice had accelerated ALL zzso zzso a zzso effect of obesity on zzso zzso zzso mice developed ALL significantly earlier than zzso The effect of obesity was not explained by zzso count, zzso weight, or ALL zzso However, obese zzso mice had higher zzso insulin, and zzso levels than controls, and these zzso hormones all have potential roles in leukemia zzso In conclusion, obesity directly zzso presentation of zzso likely by increasing the risk of an early event in zzso This is the first study to show that obesity can directly accelerate the progression of zzso Thus, the observed associations between obesity and leukemia zzso are likely to be directly related to biological effects of zzso
