zzso zzso of Ras 1 and 2 zzso and zzso function as molecular scaffolds to zzso regulate the zzso zzso zzso and affect multiple cell zzso Here we show that zzso interacts with and zzso the activity of zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso and fatty acid zzso in mouse embryonic zzso and zzso in a zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso processes affecting fatty acid zzso and zzso to cause zzso Despite their increased zzso zzso mice are zzso and zzso but zzso less energy than zzso zzso In addition, zzso clamp studies reveal that zzso mice are profoundly insulin zzso The expression of genes zzso zzso zzso is also zzso in the zzso tissue of zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso mice are highly efficient in zzso energy, revealing a novel role for zzso in zzso regulation of energy zzso
