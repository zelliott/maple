To investigate the difference in the prevalence of obesity and the associations between the risk of obesity and socioeconomic factors with regard to working adults in China and zzso 

The 2000 China Health and Nutrition zzso and the 2001 National Health zzso zzso in Taiwan, which contains information from zzso working adults in China zzso men and zzso zzso and Taiwan zzso men and zzso zzso 

zzso were converted to zzso comparable forms, and the estimated prevalence of obesity across socioeconomic groups was compared between China and zzso zzso models were used to examine the associations between socioeconomic factors and the probability of being zzso 

In China, the prevalence of obesity was higher in the higher income, more educated, and more sedentary occupation groups, while it was higher in the lower income and less educated groups in zzso Also, our results indicate that occupational types rather than income and education levels are more significantly associated with the probability of being obese in China, whereas income and education levels rather than occupational types are more significantly associated with the probability of being obese in zzso These findings may indicate that, when an economy becomes more developed, the association between obesity risk and income and education levels becomes more significant and negative especially among women, while the association between obesity risk and occupational types decreases especially among zzso
