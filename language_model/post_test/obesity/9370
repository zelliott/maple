zzso and zzso zzso gene is a gene located in zzso region zzso zzso zzso in zzso are associated with the obesity zzso in European and Hispanic zzso However, this association still remains controversial in Asian zzso We aimed to test the association of zzso genetic zzso with obesity and zzso zzso traits among children living in Beijing, zzso 

We zzso zzso zzso zzso in 670 children zzso girls and 338 zzso aged 8-11 years living in Beijing, and analyzed its association with obesity and zzso zzso zzso zzso and obesity were defined by zzso and zzso zzso reference for Chinese zzso zzso zzso traits included zzso plasma zzso zzso profiles, zzso zzso zzso and blood zzso 

The frequency of zzso A zzso was zzso which was zzso for the zzso and zzso for the zzso of the A zzso The obesity prevalence among the carriers of zzso zzso was significantly higher than that among those with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared to the carrier of zzso zzso the likelihood of obesity was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the carrier of zzso zzso after adjustment of sex, age and zzso zzso The zzso zzso of children with zzso zzso were significantly higher than that of their counterparts with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The concentration of zzso was zzso zzso among zzso carrier and zzso zzso among zzso carrier zzso zzso the zzso of zzso were zzso zzso among carriers of zzso and zzso zzso among subjects with zzso zzso zzso The level of zzso marginally increased in the zzso zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The evidence of association was reduced after adjustment for zzso zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso There was weak evidence of association between zzso and other zzso zzso traits including total cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and insulin resistance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso variation in the zzso gene associates with obesity in Chinese zzso
