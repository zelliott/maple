Body mass index zzso is widely used to assess risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 zzso Cut points for the zzso of obesity zzso zzso have been developed and validated among people of European zzso It is unknown whether these cut points are appropriate for zzso zzso We assessed the zzso risk associated with zzso among South zzso Chinese, zzso and zzso 

We randomly sampled zzso subjects from 4 ethnic groups zzso South zzso 281 Chinese, zzso zzso and 301 zzso from 4 regions in zzso Principal components factor analysis was used to derive underlying zzso or zzso factors associated with 14 clinical and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cut points were derived for 3 zzso zzso Three primary zzso factors emerged that accounted for zzso of the variation in markers of zzso zzso zzso zzso and blood zzso For a given zzso elevated levels of zzso and zzso factors were more likely to be present in South zzso Chinese, and zzso compared with Europeans, and elevated levels of the blood zzso factor were more likely to be present among Chinese compared with zzso The cut point to define zzso as defined by distribution of zzso and zzso factors, is lower by approximately 6 zzso among zzso groups compared with zzso 

zzso may be warranted for zzso cut points to define obesity among South zzso Chinese, and zzso Using these revised cut points would greatly increase the estimated burden of zzso zzso disorders among zzso zzso
