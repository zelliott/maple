Recently, the concept has emerged that persistent zzso zzso of zzso pathways in vascular zzso promotes the progression of zzso and increases the cardiovascular zzso zzso and related zzso diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and zzso are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of zzso A major manifestation of zzso zzso diseases in the early phase is systemic zzso zzso suggesting that identification of molecular mechanisms underlying zzso inflammation could provide clues for development of effective preventive and therapeutic approaches to cardiovascular zzso In this review, we focus on the roles of zzso in zzso and discuss the possibility that zzso could function as a molecular target for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular zzso
