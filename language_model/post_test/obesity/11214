This study investigates the effects of a restricted diet zzso on body composition and musculoskeletal health along with zzso and molecular mechanism in established mature obese zzso Twenty female rats were fed with a high-fat diet zzso ad zzso for 4 months and then assigned to either zzso or zzso group for another 4 zzso Another 10 rats were on a low-fat diet for 8 zzso zzso measures included body zzso bone mineral density, zzso and zzso serum zzso zzso zzso growth factor I, and liver zzso zzso zzso and protein expression and zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that mature obese rats on a zzso energy restriction diet for 4 months would improve body composition but degrade zzso and mechanical properties of long bones, and such changes in musculoskeletal integrity are related to the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso Relative to zzso zzso benefited body composition zzso body weight and zzso mass and increased zzso zzso decreased zzso growth factor I and zzso elevated zzso zzso zzso activity and protein expression and tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and suppressed bone formation and increased bone zzso resulting in decreased zzso and cortical bone volume, bone mineral density, and bone zzso Relative to low-fat diet, zzso had a similar effect on body composition and serum markers but increased bone turnover rate and decreased bone mineral density and zzso Our data suggest that long-term zzso has a negative impact on bone zzso in obese female rats, probably through modification of zzso and zzso of zzso
