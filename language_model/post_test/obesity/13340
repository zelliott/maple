A method is presented for the determination of serum zzso groups changes in conditions of zzso fatty tolerance test as well as for time defining in reaching the initial levels of serum zzso A zzso of the quantitative zzso zzso is applied, combined with zzso and zzso for zzso groups determination in the serum of 40 patients, subdivided into four groups: with chronic zzso heart disease, with zzso hypertension, with obesity and a control zzso zzso analysis was carried out by the 5th, 20th and 40th minute after the beginning of the zzso After loading with zzso it was established to develop quantitative changes not only in zzso but in the rest of the zzso groups as zzso At the same time, the time for reaching the initial values of zzso calculated by zzso shows significant differences between the control group and those with zzso heart disease and zzso zzso The investigation method adopted guarantees more thorough information about zzso changes after zzso infection, than the method with the determination of plasma zzso in corresponding time zzso The criterion zzso for reaching the initial zzso characterized more fully the dynamic changes in zzso and could be used in the detection of zzso anomalies in zzso zzso
