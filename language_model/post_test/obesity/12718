Total blood and plasma free zzso acids and plasma zzso levels were studied in fed and 24 h zzso zzso zzso In fed animals there were no differences between obese and lean rats in the overall essential and non essential blood free zzso zzso However, zzso reduced blood zzso acid levels in the obese animals compared to the lean group, mainly due to changes in the plasma zzso The reduction of available zzso acids from plasma in the obese rats during zzso affected most of the zzso zzso including the zzso chain zzso zzso which showed higher levels in the fed situation than in lean zzso Of particular interest is the opposite response to zzso in lean and obese zzso rats concerning the plasma ratio of zzso zzso to the large neutral zzso acids zzso which could be implicated in the zzso of food intake and energy expenditure characteristic of zzso
