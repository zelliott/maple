To assess the association between zzso surgery and zzso outcomes among obese and non-obese women in the state of zzso 

We conducted a zzso retrospective cohort analysis using vital records and hospital discharge data in Florida during zzso Women were zzso based on prior zzso surgery and zzso obesity zzso zzso complications zzso zzso zzso zzso diabetes, chronic hypertension, zzso disorders, zzso section, prolonged hospital zzso and fetal zzso zzso zzso birth, small for zzso age zzso were the outcomes of zzso zzso odds ratios zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso were zzso 

Mothers with a prior history of zzso surgery, regardless of obesity status, were more likely to have zzso chronic hypertension, zzso disorders, and zzso zzso zzso based on prior history of zzso surgery and obesity status showed that non-obese mothers with prior zzso surgery were more likely to have zzso chronic hypertension, zzso disorders, and zzso zzso whereas obese mothers without prior zzso surgery were at greater risk of having zzso diabetes, chronic hypertension, zzso infants zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and prolonged hospital stay as compared to non-obese mother without prior zzso zzso 

Although prior zzso surgery is associated with multiple negative maternal and fetal zzso it is protective against infant zzso in obese zzso Our findings support the need for zzso services tailored for former zzso surgery patients to improve maternal and zzso health zzso
