It has been suggested that obese individuals have a blunted growth hormone zzso response to spontaneous and zzso zzso zzso The present study was designed to examine the effects of a zzso whole body acute resistance exercise zzso protocol on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso in sedentary lean and obese zzso Nine obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso old, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso body mass, zzso zzso zzso body zzso and nine lean zzso zzso zzso zzso old, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso body mass, zzso zzso zzso body zzso men completed an acute zzso protocol (6 exercises, 3 sets of 10 repetitions at zzso of 10 repetitions maximum with zzso and zzso rest zzso and blood samples were collected before, at the zzso and immediately after exercise and during recovery zzso zzso and zzso In contrast to prior studies, which examined acute responses to cardiovascular exercise zzso groups did not differ in zzso response to the exercise zzso However, zzso zzso overall were significantly lower in the obese than the lean participants zzso zzso Additionally, obese individuals had significantly higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggest that obese and lean sedentary men performing a zzso whole body acute zzso protocol demonstrate similar increases in zzso zzso zzso and elevated zzso zzso are indicative of altered zzso activity associated with zzso Prior research findings of blunted zzso response may be attributable to zzso protocols not zzso on relative intensity or zzso These results underscore the complexity of zzso biology and its related mechanisms and may have implications for exercise prescription in the treatment of zzso
