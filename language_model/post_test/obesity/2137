Higher waist circumference and lower hip circumference are both associated with increased cardiovascular disease zzso risk, despite being directly zzso The real effects of visceral obesity may therefore be underestimated when hip circumference is not fully taken into zzso We hypothesized that adding waist and hip circumference to traditional risk factors would significantly improve zzso risk zzso 

In a zzso survey among South Asian and African zzso zzso zzso deaths occurred during 15 years of zzso In a model that included variables used in previous zzso risk calculations (a zzso zzso the association between waist circumference and mortality was examined before and after adjustment for hip zzso The percentage with an increase in estimated 10-year cumulative mortality zzso and a decrease zzso after waist and hip circumference were added to the model was zzso 

zzso circumference was strongly related to mortality only after adjustment for hip circumference and vice zzso Adding waist and hip circumference to a zzso model increased estimated 10-year cumulative zzso mortality zzso for zzso of those who died and zzso of those zzso zzso mortality decreased zzso for zzso of those who died and zzso of those zzso 

The effect of central obesity on mortality risk is seriously underestimated without adjustment for hip zzso Adding waist and hip circumference to a zzso model for zzso mortality substantially increased zzso zzso Both may be important inclusions in zzso risk prediction zzso
