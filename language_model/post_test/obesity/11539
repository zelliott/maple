The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of modifications of extent zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and surgical technique of zzso (including zzso zzso preservation of the zzso zzso and preservation of the zzso zzso on zzso groin zzso and survival in patients with zzso zzso 

A retrospective review of zzso patients with primary zzso cell cancer of the zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and followup data were collected from patient zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso produced about half fewer zzso than did other surgical zzso On the other hand, number of zzso zzso removed did not differ notably between zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that obesity was associated with increased risk of zzso Age greater than 70, zzso and extent of zzso increased wound breakdown zzso zzso associated with leg zzso zzso for more than 6 months were: extent of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of groin zzso With a mean followup time of 38 months, neither groin recurrence rate nor zzso survival markedly differed according to technique of zzso 

zzso of zzso with preservation of zzso zzso and zzso vein are associated with a decreased risk of zzso morbidity without jeopardizing zzso
