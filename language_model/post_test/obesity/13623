Compared with zzso obese African-American adolescents have a higher risk for type 2 zzso zzso inflammation and reduced zzso zzso 1 zzso concentration are linked to the zzso of the zzso We determined the relationship between insulin resistance, zzso activity, and zzso inflammation with zzso zzso and whether racial disparities in zzso response were present in 49 obese adolescents zzso zzso 3 years; zzso African zzso zzso zzso 

zzso underwent physical examination and an oral zzso tolerance zzso We measured levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso area under the curve zzso zzso index zzso and composite insulin sensitivity index zzso were zzso zzso were zzso by race and as inflammation positive zzso if zzso or zzso were zzso 

No racial differences were seen in mean or relative zzso Thirty-five percent of subjects had altered zzso or zzso zzso levels zzso American zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso American zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso and insulin, zzso and zzso values were zzso African Americans had lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and higher zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared with zzso 

African Americans exhibited lower zzso zzso and increased inflammatory zzso Both mechanisms may act zzso to enhance the predisposition of obese African Americans to type 2 zzso Our findings might be relevant to effective deployment of emerging zzso treatments across zzso
