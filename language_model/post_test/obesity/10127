zzso plays important roles in host immune zzso and recent studies suggest that zzso tissue is an important site of production for some complement zzso zzso has been associated with low complement levels, but studied populations have usually had zzso opportunistic infections or other conditions which might affect complement zzso To determine the impact of body weight and changes in body weight on serum complement, we investigated levels of complement proteins in otherwise healthy patients with a wide range of body zzso including patients with anorexia zzso before and after treatment, obese dieters before and after weight loss, and normal weight zzso We found that complement proteins of the alternative zzso zzso B, and zzso alternative zzso zzso activity zzso and the zzso H and I were low in starving zzso and zzso with weight zzso zzso levels were comparable in zzso at low weight and after weight gain, indicating that low serum complement levels were attributable to zzso and not complement cascade zzso with zzso Further, levels of zzso B, zzso H and I, but not D, were higher than controls in obese patients and decreased toward normal after weight zzso Overall, percentage of ideal body weight, changes in body weight, and serum zzso were each highly correlated with serum levels of complement zzso We conclude that levels of alternative zzso complement components are determined in part by factors that influence body weight and by weight changes, possibly due to changes in production in zzso tissue or at other zzso
