During seated forward reaching tasks in obese individuals, excessive abdominal tissue can come into contact with the anterior zzso This soft tissue zzso acts as a mechanical zzso altering functional zzso at the hip, and causing difficulty in certain daily activities such as zzso down, or picking up objects from the zzso The purpose of the study was to investigate the contact forces and associated moments exerted by the abdomen on the thigh during seated zzso tasks in adult obese zzso Ten healthy subjects (age zzso zzso zzso with elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso participated in the zzso zzso pressures between the abdomen and thigh were measured using a zzso zzso zzso sensor during zzso zzso zzso and force plate data were obtained using an infrared motion capture zzso The mean zzso contact force was zzso zzso zzso of body weight, ranging from zzso N to 200 zzso Net zzso moment at the hip decreased by mean zzso zzso zzso after accounting for the moment generated by zzso tissue zzso In obese individuals, zzso contact decreases the net moment at the hip joint during seated zzso zzso This phenomenon should be taken into consideration for accurate zzso modeling in these zzso
