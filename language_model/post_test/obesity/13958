Very zzso diets are widely used for weight loss yet few controlled studies have determined how these diets impact cardiovascular risk factors compared to more traditional low-fat weight loss zzso The primary purpose of this study was to compare a very zzso and a low-fat diet on zzso blood zzso LDL zzso zzso zzso and insulin resistance in overweight and obese zzso 

Thirteen zzso moderately overweight zzso zzso women were prescribed two zzso zzso zzso diets for 4 week zzso a very zzso zzso zzso and a low-fat zzso zzso zzso The diets were consumed in a balanced and zzso zzso Two zzso blood draws were performed on separate days and an oral fat tolerance test was performed at zzso after the very zzso diet, and after the low-fat zzso 

Compared to corresponding values after the very zzso diet, zzso total cholesterol, zzso and zzso were significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso lower, whereas zzso zzso insulin, and insulin resistance zzso using the zzso model assessment) were significantly higher after the low-fat zzso Both diets significantly decreased zzso zzso and resulted in similar zzso changes in the total zzso ratio, zzso zzso oxidized LDL, and LDL zzso zzso 

Compared to a low-fat weight loss diet, a short-term very zzso diet did not lower zzso but did prevent the decline in zzso and resulted in improved insulin sensitivity in overweight and obese, but otherwise healthy zzso Small decreases in body mass improved zzso zzso and therefore cardiovascular risk, independent of diet zzso
