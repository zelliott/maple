Adult overweight rats previously subjected to early zzso zzso in small litters are zzso zzso and differ in emotional zzso from rats of control zzso We proved the hypothesis that zzso of the zzso regulatory system of body weight zzso react to peptides of the zzso factor zzso family in these overweight zzso Single unit activity was recorded in brain zzso In controls, zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso predominantly activated zzso of the zzso part of zzso zzso nucleus zzso but in overweight rats, zzso induced a significant zzso Increased zzso firing to zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso part of zzso zzso nucleus zzso in controls similarly changed to more zzso in overweight zzso zzso of zzso activity in zzso and zzso can contribute to reduce zzso signals and to decrease energy expenditure in zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso of controls were significantly inhibited by zzso whereas zzso of overweight rats could also be zzso The difference in the expression of these response types was zzso zzso of zzso zzso known to produce zzso Y can increase food zzso The results are discussed in terms of a zzso action of zzso changing synaptic wiring and the expression of zzso and zzso zzso The altered responses of zzso zzso in adult zzso rats may reflect a general mechanism of zzso plasticity acquired during the zzso critical differentiation period, thus leading to permanently altered function of the regulatory system of body zzso
