In many studies, obesity has been associated with morbidity or zzso but only a few have studied the relation between obesity and sick zzso Our aim is to zzso the independent effects of both zzso and body fat distribution in relation to the zzso zzso of sick leave in a large cohort of male and female workers covering a variety of zzso taking into account a wide range of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The baseline survey of the zzso study was conducted in 25 companies across Belgium between 1994 and zzso A cohort of 20 463 workers (15 zzso males and zzso zzso aged zzso y was followed for absenteeism during 1 zzso The 75th zzso of the distribution of the total annual sickness days was used as a zzso to zzso the workers with a high zzso zzso rate of sick zzso The relation between sick leave and both obesity and body fat distribution assessed by the body mass index zzso and the waist zzso respectively, was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Using a backward procedure based on the likelihood ratio, we found central abdominal zzso to be an independent predictor of sick leave in both genders zzso zzso zzso and long zzso but not zzso In men, the odds ratios was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in women it ranged from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Two baseline zzso respiratory problems and perceived health, are zzso or zzso 

In this study, body fat distribution was associated with a high annual zzso zzso and long spells of sickness zzso If this link is zzso employers may benefit from programs aiming at the prevention and treatment of central zzso
