A recent study reported that the zzso associated zzso of zzso zzso increased plasma high sensitivity zzso protein zzso levels independent of zzso We aimed to investigate if this gene zzso had zzso effects on plasma zzso and 10 additional circulating zzso zzso throughout a broad range of body mass index zzso among Danish zzso 

In a population of zzso young men, examined for military service between 1943 and 1977, two groups were zzso 1) a random zzso sample and 2) all obese men zzso zzso all of whom were above the zzso zzso of this zzso At an average age of 49 years zzso 39 through 65 zzso zzso men, zzso 231 of the obese, were zzso including zzso and measurement of the zzso circulating inflammatory markers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Men with known disease were excluded from the zzso All the inflammatory markers were zzso to approximate a normal zzso zzso relationships were studied using linear zzso analyses with the inflammatory markers as the response zzso zzso positive associations between zzso zzso and a broad range of zzso were observed, but the associations did not significantly differ across zzso zzso zzso There were no significant associations between the other inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

No zzso effects of the zzso zzso zzso on a series of inflammatory markers were observed in this cohort of healthy middle-aged men representing a broad range of zzso
