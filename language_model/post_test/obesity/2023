It is known that spontaneous and zzso zzso zzso is reduced in zzso On the other hand, it has been recently reported that, in obese subjects, plasma zzso levels did not change during a zzso zzso To further study the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso influences in zzso we studied the effect of zzso zzso or zzso on the zzso response to zzso or zzso in 32 obese patients and 30 zzso zzso zzso levels were lower in obese than in normal subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso while zzso growth zzso levels were similar in both groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In obese as well as in control subjects zzso abolished the zzso response to either zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 255 zzso P zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso blunted the zzso response to either zzso or zzso in control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso respectively), but failed to modify it in obese patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso deeply blunted the zzso zzso release in obese patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso as well as in controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso In conclusion, our results show that, in zzso the zzso zzso release is zzso to the zzso effect of zzso but not of zzso in spite of their likely common mechanism of action, zzso increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is able to abolish zzso zzso both in normal and obese zzso These data suggest the existence of a peculiar zzso of zzso to trigger zzso release in zzso
