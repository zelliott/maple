The discovery of zzso zzso shed new light on mechanisms regulating body fat mass zzso In this zzso interactions between zzso and zzso at zzso level may be of great zzso zzso that influence plasma zzso levels have not been fully recognized and available data on zzso levels are often zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate absolute and zzso plasma zzso levels and their zzso variation, as well as to assess the relationship between zzso levels, body fat distribution, and hormones influencing body fat in subjects with various levels of zzso cortisol and different nutritional zzso Group I was composed of 14 women aged zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso due to zzso and zzso zzso syndrome zzso 17 women with visceral obesity zzso and normal or disturbed zzso zzso zzso impaired zzso tolerance zzso and diabetes zzso zzso aged 24 do 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso were included in group zzso Group III consisted of 14 women with zzso disease zzso aged 18 do 63 zzso zzso zzso zzso The control group IV zzso included 17 healthy women with normal zzso zzso zzso body zzso and body fat distribution zzso zzso were assessed in all zzso zzso plasma levels of zzso zzso zzso cortisol zzso zzso growth zzso zzso were measured with zzso test zzso Plasma zzso zzso levels, serum levels of insulin zzso and growth hormone zzso were measured with zzso test zzso Blood zzso zzso concentration was determined with an zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were expressed as zzso and zzso zzso zzso insulin resistance index zzso was also zzso Higher zzso and zzso values were found in the zzso group as compared with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso distribution did not differ in zzso and zzso groups whereas zzso subjects exhibited a higher zzso of fat in the trunk when compared to zzso zzso Absolute zzso levels were correlated with trunk zzso in zzso patients whereas in zzso and zzso groups these levels were correlated only with limb zzso Absolute zzso levels in zzso and zzso groups were comparable, whereas zzso and zzso zzso were higher in the zzso group zzso 1) reflecting zzso of zzso levels zzso 1, zzso zzso zzso levels were comparable in groups with normal zzso zzso in zzso and zzso groups, whereas in the zzso group both absolute and zzso zzso levels were lower than in zzso No correlation was found between plasma levels of F and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso This correlation was negative in zzso zzso 3) and positive in zzso groups zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso groups demonstrated a negative correlation between plasma zzso and zzso zzso zzso patients showed positive, zzso correlations between zzso levels, zzso and G values, and a positive, zzso correlation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso patients exhibited a zzso positive correlation between zzso and zzso zzso In these and in zzso patients, a positive, zzso correlation between zzso and zzso levels was zzso Moreover, a negative, zzso correlation between zzso and zzso levels was found in zzso zzso In this group, zzso levels were positively correlated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso A negative correlation between zzso levels, zzso and zzso zzso was zzso in the zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso groups, but not in the zzso group, a midnight increase in zzso levels was zzso In conclusion, zzso of zzso levels in relation to body fat in zzso syndrome is independent of the source of zzso Apparently, it results from insulin resistance and zzso and contributes to zzso zzso zzso In zzso disease, zzso of zzso may reflect an adaptation mechanism to cortisol zzso and result from low insulin and extremely high zzso zzso In women with normal cortisol levels, zzso of nutritional zzso zzso levels reflect body fat zzso In obese subjects, zzso levels may be influenced by cortisol levels, high levels of insulin, IGF-1, and zzso as well as low levels of growth zzso zzso function of zzso axis zzso zzso does not directly influence zzso variation in plasma zzso zzso In zzso syndrome, visceral fat may be a zzso source of zzso whereas in women with normal or low cortisol levels peripherally accumulated fat may determine zzso zzso
