The aim of this data analysis was to ascertain the type and prevalence rate as well as age and sex distribution of cardiovascular risk factors in type 1 diabetic patients up to 26 years of zzso 

zzso risk factors such as zzso hypertension, zzso poor zzso control, and smoking were analyzed in zzso patients who were divided into three groups zzso zzso and zzso using specifically designed diabetes software for prospective disease zzso 

More than half of the patients per zzso had at least one cardiovascular risk zzso Two risk factors were age zzso found in zzso and three or four risk factors in zzso zzso values of zzso total cholesterol, and zzso were found most zzso zzso smoking, and HDL cholesterol were observed more frequently in zzso and elevated zzso total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol more often in zzso Although zzso of the patients had zzso merely zzso of them received medical treatment, and of the zzso of the patients with hypertension, only zzso of them were given zzso zzso 

With increasing age, a greater number of patients with cardiovascular risk factors were zzso zzso sex differences were seen in the majority of risk zzso Despite the high prevalence of risk factors, only a small minority of patients received zzso or zzso zzso Early zzso zzso and treatment of additional risk factors seem to be necessary, particularly in light of the high zzso of future cardiovascular zzso
