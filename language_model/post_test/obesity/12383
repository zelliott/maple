zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso the synthesis of zzso fatty acids zzso from saturated zzso Mice with zzso or zzso deletion of zzso are resistant to zzso Here, we show that mice lacking zzso in zzso and/or liver are not protected from either zzso zzso zzso or zzso obesity zzso despite a robust reduction in zzso zzso products in both subcutaneous and zzso white zzso zzso zzso zzso deletion had no effect on zzso or insulin tolerance or on zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, lack of zzso from liver lowered the zzso levels of zzso tissue and vice versa, as reflected by the changes in zzso zzso zzso deletion of zzso from liver and zzso resulted in a synergistic lowering of tissue zzso levels, especially in the zzso model in which zzso tolerance was also zzso Lastly, we found that liver and plasma zzso show nearly identical zzso differences in zzso zzso indicating that zzso composition of plasma zzso is zzso for zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso The current study suggests that zzso deletion from zzso and/or liver is insufficient to elicit protection from zzso but it supports the existence of extensive zzso zzso between liver and zzso zzso
