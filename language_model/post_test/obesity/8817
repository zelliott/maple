To examine overweight trends over a 22-year period among zzso children from primarily middle-income families enrolled in a health maintenance zzso 

From zzso care visits to a Massachusetts health maintenance organization, we randomly selected one visit per child per calendar year, yielding a study sample of zzso children seen at zzso visits from 1980 through zzso Using zzso zzso zzso models accounting for repeated observations of individual children across years, we estimated trends in prevalence of overweight zzso or zzso 95th zzso and zzso zzso to 95th zzso 

Over the 22-year study period, the observed prevalence of overweight increased from zzso to zzso and zzso increased from zzso to zzso These increases were evident among all groups of children including infants zzso months of zzso Overall, the adjusted odds ratios were zzso per decade zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso for overweight and zzso per decade zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso for zzso 

Rates of overweight are increasing in very young children, even zzso from primarily middle-class zzso
