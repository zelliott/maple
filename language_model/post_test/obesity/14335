To predict insulin resistance in children based on zzso and zzso indicators by analyzing the sensitivity and specificity of different zzso zzso 

A zzso study was carried out of 109 children aged 7 to 11 years, 55 of whom were obese, 23 overweight and 31 zzso classified by body mass index zzso for zzso zzso were taken to determine zzso waist and hips zzso waist zzso circumference ratio, zzso index and body fat percentage zzso zzso X-ray zzso zzso blood samples were taken to measure zzso zzso and zzso zzso resistance was evaluated by the zzso zzso method, taking the 90th zzso as the zzso zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso were analyzed to a zzso confidence zzso in order to identify zzso of zzso zzso and sensitivity and specificity were then zzso 

After analysis of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso zzso indicators that demonstrated the power to predict insulin resistance were, in the following order: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso body fat percentage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso waist zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso index zzso zzso zzso zzso for the whole zzso and were: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso body fat percentage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso waist circumference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the obese zzso 

zzso and zzso indicators appear to offer good zzso power for insulin resistance in children between 7 and 11 years old, employing the zzso points with the best balance between sensitivity and specificity of the zzso zzso
