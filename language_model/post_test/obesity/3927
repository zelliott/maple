The aims of this study were to investigate the therapeutic potential of zzso electrical stimulation zzso for zzso zzso were performed to investigate the effects of zzso on food zzso gastric tone, gastric accommodation, and its possible zzso 

Ten normal dogs and six dogs with zzso zzso were used in this zzso Each dog was equipped with a gastric zzso for the measurement of gastric tone and accommodation by zzso and one pair of zzso zzso zzso for zzso The experiment on food intake was composed of both control session without zzso and zzso session after a zzso zzso The experiment on gastric tone and accommodation was performed in the zzso and fed states and composed of three zzso control, zzso and zzso with zzso 

zzso significantly reduced food intake in the normal dogs zzso zzso zzso grams, p zzso The food intake was zzso correlated with the zzso gastric volume during zzso zzso significantly decreased zzso gastric tone in the normal dogs reflected as a decrease in gastric volume zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso which was abolished by zzso and zzso 

zzso reduces food intake and zzso gastric tone in the zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on gastric tone is zzso by both zzso and zzso zzso
