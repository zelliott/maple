Previous results have shown that mice lacking in the group zzso zzso zzso zzso are resistant to obesity and diabetes induced by feeding a zzso zzso zzso This study examined the potential of using the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso as therapy to suppress zzso obesity and zzso 

Male zzso mice were fed the zzso diet with or without zzso zzso zzso Body weight gain, zzso plasma zzso levels, zzso tolerance and zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso mice fed the zzso diet without zzso inhibitor showed 31 and zzso body weight gain after 4 and 10 weeks zzso These animals also showed elevated plasma zzso levels and were zzso zzso In contrast, zzso mice fed the zzso diet with 90 zzso of zzso zzso gained only zzso body weight after 10 zzso These animals were also zzso and displayed normal zzso excursion rates in zzso tolerance zzso zzso zzso suppression of zzso body weight gain and zzso intolerance was correlated with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These results show that oral supplementation of a zzso diet with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso effectively suppresses zzso obesity and diabetes in zzso This suggests that zzso zzso may be a potentially effective oral therapeutic option for treatment of obesity and zzso
