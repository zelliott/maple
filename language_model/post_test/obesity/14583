Analysis of biological zzso using zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso can allow new insights to be gained into disease zzso with advances in zzso techniques enabling the detection of thousands of zzso In this work zzso has been used to investigate the zzso processes involved in type II diabetes in the zzso obese zzso Plasma was analyzed from three different zzso the zzso zzso obese, zzso lean and the zzso obese zzso Using zzso zzso 10,000 zzso were detected due to the narrow peak zzso and excellent peak shapes achieved with this zzso zzso in the zzso performance was demonstrated by the use of quality control zzso The positive and negative zzso total zzso zzso obtained from the three strains were readily distinguishable using zzso statistical zzso The greatest difference was observed between the zzso lean and zzso zzso rats compared to the zzso zzso obese zzso Positive zzso zzso 220 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 405 zzso zzso were elevated in the plasma derived from zzso lean rats whilst zzso zzso 385 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were at a lower concentration compared to the plasma from the zzso zzso obese zzso zzso zzso elevated in the zzso lean rats included zzso 212 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 295 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 512 zzso zzso with zzso zzso 538 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso being raised in the samples derived from zzso zzso obese zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to zzso to zzso providing further support for an involvement of zzso metabolism in zzso
