In subjects with zzso syndrome zzso zzso dysfunction is a very consistent zzso zzso leading to zzso dysfunction and zzso involve the altered control of zzso inflammation by innate immune defenses that possibly include zzso zzso zzso We investigated the associations of zzso with traits of zzso and early zzso in obese subjects before and after marked weight zzso 

In a prospective zzso study, zzso zzso of 96 severely obese subjects with and without zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso without zzso zzso zzso were examined in association with markers of insulin resistance, zzso zzso and zzso zzso before and after marked weight loss zzso weight loss zzso zzso after 3 months of participation in a standardized weight reduction zzso in addition to the study of 25 seemingly healthy lean subjects zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso did not differ between healthy lean and severely obese subjects independently of the presence of zzso zzso In severely obese subjects there was no significant difference concerning the cardiovascular risk profile, zzso inflammatory and zzso zzso and markers of zzso dysfunction and zzso between subjects with functional zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sufficient zzso zzso zzso zzso weight loss did not influence zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest that plasma levels of zzso did not differ between healthy lean and severely obese zzso zzso did not affect cardiovascular risk factors, or markers of zzso dysfunction and early zzso in severely obese patients before and after marked weight zzso
