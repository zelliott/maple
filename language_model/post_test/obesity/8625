zzso is a zzso disease combining the effects of genetic predisposition with very powerful environmental risk zzso Recent genetic studies have demonstrated that there is a zzso between different forms of human zzso zzso zzso zzso In certain cases, mainly cases of very severe obesity with childhood zzso a single gene would play a zzso role allowing environmental factors to have major zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene and its zzso zzso or more zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso are evidence of the existence of an obesity zzso zzso of this gene would be sufficient to produce early onset anomalous eating zzso COMMON zzso The more common forms of obesity are however zzso The strong environmental pressure exceeds the capacity for zzso adaptation of genetically predisposed zzso leading to an energy imbalance favoring fat zzso zzso zzso Certain candidate zzso such as decoupling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or regulator regions of the zzso zzso play a minor role in the constitution or zzso of zzso Recently, zzso zzso explorations in obese families have localized major obesity genes on zzso 2, 5, 10, 11, and zzso Identification of these genes with zzso cloning and functional zzso techniques will be helpful in better understanding the molecular zzso of obesity and better defining targets for new zzso
