zzso patients have increased zzso zzso zzso This zzso however, might not be zzso present in all forms of hypertension, as suggested by experimental studies showing that zzso activity is enhanced predominantly in zzso high-volume models and in zzso zzso Because hypertension in obesity is commonly associated with both expanded plasma volume and insulin resistance, this study sought to determine whether increased body mass index zzso in zzso patients relates to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso blood flow zzso responses zzso to zzso infusion of an ETA zzso blocker zzso were analyzed in zzso patients and zzso control subjects according to zzso The zzso response to zzso was significantly higher in zzso patients than in control subjects zzso During zzso a significant increase in zzso from baseline was observed in obese zzso or zzso zzso zzso and overweight zzso 27 to zzso zzso zzso but not in lean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, no significant change in zzso was observed during zzso either in obese zzso overweight zzso or lean zzso zzso zzso Moreover, a significant correlation between zzso and the zzso response to ETA blockade was observed in zzso subjects zzso zzso but not in control subjects zzso zzso In human hypertension, increased zzso is associated with enhanced zzso zzso activity, suggesting that this zzso may play a role in the zzso of zzso hypertension and that targeting the zzso system may be useful in the treatment of these zzso
