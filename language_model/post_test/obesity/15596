zzso with impaired zzso tolerance zzso have a high risk of developing zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether diet and exercise interventions in those with zzso may delay the development of zzso zzso reduce the zzso of zzso and thereby reduce the overall zzso of diabetic zzso such as zzso zzso and retinal disease, and the excess mortality attributable to these zzso 

In 1986, zzso men and women from 33 health care clinics in the city of Da zzso China, were screened for zzso and zzso Of these individuals, 577 were classified zzso World Health Organization zzso as having zzso zzso were zzso by clinic into a clinical trial, either to a control group or to one of three active treatment groups: diet only, exercise only, or diet plus zzso zzso evaluation examinations were conducted at zzso intervals over a zzso period to identify subjects who developed zzso Cox's zzso hazard analysis was used to determine if the zzso of zzso varied by treatment zzso 

The cumulative zzso of diabetes at 6 years was zzso zzso zzso zzso in the control group compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso in the diet group, zzso zzso zzso zzso in the exercise group, and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso When analyzed by clinic, each of the active intervention groups differed significantly from the control clinics zzso zzso The relative decrease in rate of development of diabetes in the active treatment groups was similar when subjects were zzso as lean or overweight zzso zzso or zzso 25 zzso In a zzso hazards analysis adjusted for differences in baseline zzso and zzso zzso the diet, exercise, and zzso interventions were associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso reductions in risk of developing diabetes, zzso 

Diet and/or exercise interventions led to a significant decrease in the zzso of diabetes over a zzso period among those with zzso
