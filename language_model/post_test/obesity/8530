We evaluated the potential application of zzso to monitor zzso in abdominal fat thickness in obese women before and after zzso 

This study included 40 obese women zzso age, zzso zzso zzso years; mean body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso who underwent a zzso low-calorie zzso zzso weight, waist circumference zzso and hip circumference zzso were zzso zzso and zzso ratio zzso were zzso zzso subcutaneous zzso and zzso zzso zzso fat were measured at their maximum zzso and minimum zzso thickness sites using a zzso zzso zzso zzso visceral zzso fat was measured using a zzso zzso zzso zzso were taken before and after caloric zzso 

The mean weight was reduced from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and V zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso fat thicknesses were positively correlated with change in zzso the change in zzso fat thickness showed the best and most significant correlation zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and HC zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso changes were also positively correlated with weight change, but the zzso change zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso 

All the abdominal fat zzso particularly the zzso P fat, will decrease in response to loss of body fat by zzso zzso seems to be useful in monitoring small variations in the thicknesses of abdominal S and zzso P and V zzso
