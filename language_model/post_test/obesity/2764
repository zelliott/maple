We investigated if new vessel formation in fat involves the contribution of local zzso zzso cells zzso zzso or bone zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and if zzso treatment by blockade of vascular zzso growth factor zzso receptors can prevent zzso obesity zzso 

We performed zzso bone zzso transplantation into zzso mice using transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso or selectively in zzso cells (under zzso promoter zzso as zzso The presence of donor zzso in recipient mice was investigated in fat tissue vessels after zzso using in zzso and ex zzso zzso zzso We investigated the roles of zzso receptors 1 and 2 zzso by inducing zzso in mice and treating them with blocking zzso zzso We found only marginal (less than zzso incorporation of zzso in fat vessels during zzso When zzso was inhibited by blocking zzso in mice with zzso treated mice had significantly lower body weights than control zzso In contrast, blocking zzso had no zzso effect on the weight gain during zzso 

zzso of new vessels in fat zzso during zzso is largely due to zzso rather than de zzso zzso zzso treatment by blockade of zzso but not zzso may limit zzso tissue zzso
