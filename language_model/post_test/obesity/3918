The clinical identification of zzso syndrome is based on measures of abdominal zzso zzso zzso elevated blood pressure, and zzso zzso However, the impact of zzso associated with obesity on penile zzso is not well zzso 

In this retrospective study, we sought to evaluate the effect of obesity on serum total testosterone zzso level and penile duplex parameters in men with zzso dysfunction zzso

zzso associations among zzso and serum testosterone, blood pressure, and zzso profile, as well as penile duplex zzso We compared all clinical, laboratory, and penile duplex parameters between lean men zzso zzso and overweight and obese men zzso zzso 

The zzso age ranged between 20 and 56 zzso A significant negative correlation between zzso and zzso was detected zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso was identified in zzso zzso of men with zzso The zzso of zzso varied from as low as zzso zzso in lean men to as high as zzso zzso to zzso zzso in zzso and severe zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso men with zzso 25, compared with zzso zzso in lean men zzso zzso zzso In order to study the effect of obesity on zzso function, cases with other risk factors were zzso Of 67 men suffering from zzso with no other risk zzso apart from zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso men with zzso 25, compared with zzso zzso in lean men zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is associated with lower zzso and disturbances of penile zzso It is an independent clinical factor for zzso zzso
