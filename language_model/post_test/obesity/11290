zzso stimulating protein zzso is an zzso derived from the immune complement system that is involved in energy zzso and zzso zzso acts on and zzso positively with zzso fat clearance in healthy zzso However, in zzso zzso levels are elevated and correlate zzso with fat zzso indicative of a potential resistance to zzso Using a mouse model, we hypothesized that, over time, zzso obesity zzso would result in development of zzso zzso as compared to zzso animals as zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso mice failed to accelerate fat clearance to the same extent as in zzso zzso zzso mice exhibited higher zzso levels of plasma zzso and, after zzso of diet, showed lower zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso tissue compared to zzso zzso Additionally, ex zzso zzso stimulation failed to induce normal zzso zzso in zzso tissue from zzso mice VS zzso zzso These results demonstrate for the first time a state of zzso zzso zzso Changes in the zzso zzso dynamics in obesity could alter the development of obesity and zzso such as zzso and type 2 zzso
