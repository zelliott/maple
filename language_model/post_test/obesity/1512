The genetic zzso affecting the commonly used zzso have been zzso investigated using linkage approaches in multiple zzso This study aims at performing the first zzso linkage scan on zzso in the Chinese population in mainland China with hypothesis that zzso in genetic linkage could exist in different ethnic zzso zzso was measured from 126 zzso twins in zzso zzso who were zzso using high-resolution zzso zzso Human zzso zzso containing about 1 million zzso zzso zzso zzso linkage analysis was performed with zzso software package for linkage analysis using zzso components approach for quantitative trait zzso zzso We identified a strong linkage peak at the end of zzso 7 zzso at zzso with a zzso score of zzso which zzso with that reported by a large zzso study in western zzso Multiple zzso showing suggestive linkage were found on zzso 1 zzso score zzso at zzso zzso 8 zzso at zzso and zzso 14 zzso at zzso The strong linkage identified in the Chinese subjects that is consistent with that found in populations of European origin could suggest the existence of zzso preserved genetic mechanisms for zzso whereas the multiple suggestive zzso could represent genetic effect from zzso interaction as a result of zzso environmental zzso
