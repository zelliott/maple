zzso and asthma are characterized by the presence of zzso zzso and zzso are circulating hormones produced by zzso tissue that regulate several zzso and inflammatory zzso We aimed to determine whether obesity influences zzso inflammation as well as the contribution of zzso zzso zzso to a possible linkage between zzso and zzso zzso 

One hundred patients with asthma and 60 healthy controls were zzso zzso who had a zzso illness that could interfere with the proposed tests were zzso All subjects were divided into three groups zzso range, zzso zzso according to the criteria of the current WHO international zzso for body mass index zzso zzso associations between variables expressing airway zzso zzso zzso systemic inflammation and zzso as assessed by zzso were zzso zzso and zzso were also measured and were associated with asthma airway and systemic inflammatory variables to zzso possible zzso 

zzso patients had significant higher values of zzso zzso in urine compared with zzso and normal range zzso In a linear zzso model, the only significant associations were those between zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Using the same model, log zzso and log zzso presented positive and negative associations, respectively with zzso zzso in zzso No other significant associations were observed in both patients and healthy zzso 

In a selected cohort of zzso patients, obesity is significantly associated with increased urinary zzso zzso zzso of zzso balance may be related to the presence of zzso inflammation in obese zzso zzso
