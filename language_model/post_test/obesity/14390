We studied the zzso pump in red cells from an obese human subject zzso in which the number of zzso was zzso times higher than zzso Through zzso of the kinetic properties of several modes of operation of the zzso pump we determined that the pumps in zzso cells are zzso zzso In the presence of adequate zzso zzso the maximum rates of zzso pumping and zzso production saturated at 60 and 12 zzso cell per zzso zzso Under zzso conditions pump and zzso zzso zzso were similar in zzso and normal zzso Since internal zzso was lower in zzso than in normal cells zzso approximately 2 and 8 zzso cell, respectively), we conclude that the reduction in cell zzso allows the zzso pump in zzso cells to operate at lower fraction of maximum capacity and to compensate for the increased number of zzso
