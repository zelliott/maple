In patients with the zzso syndrome zzso the zzso effect of insulin on zzso zzso responsiveness to different stimuli is zzso Whether the zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in this zzso is zzso We tested the hypotheses that, in zzso patients, ROCK zzso with zzso restores zzso zzso zzso and that zzso stress plays a role in this zzso zzso and zzso zzso blood flow responses to zzso zzso and sodium zzso zzso respectively, were assessed in zzso patients zzso zzso 8) and healthy controls zzso zzso 5) before and after the addition of zzso zzso zzso to an zzso infusion of insulin zzso zzso In zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso was also infused without zzso The possible involvement of zzso stress in the effect of zzso during zzso was investigated in zzso patients zzso zzso 5) by zzso vitamin C zzso zzso In zzso patients, compared with zzso zzso enhanced zzso and zzso zzso responses during insulin infusion zzso zzso and P zzso zzso respectively), but not in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso By contrast, zzso did not affect zzso to zzso and zzso during zzso in controls zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso In zzso patients, zzso added to insulin and vitamin C did not further enhance zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso In the zzso circulation of patients with the zzso ROCK zzso by zzso improves zzso and zzso zzso responsiveness during zzso increased zzso stress seems to be involved in the zzso of this zzso
