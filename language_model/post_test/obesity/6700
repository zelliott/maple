We investigated risk factors for fracture among young adults, particularly body mass index zzso and physical activity, which although associated with fracture in older populations have rarely been investigated in younger zzso 

In 2009, 4 years after initial zzso 58 204 zzso aged 19 to 49 years were asked to self-report fractures incident in the preceding 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to calculate odds ratios zzso and zzso zzso for associations of fracture zzso with baseline zzso and physical zzso 

Very obese women had a zzso increase in fracture risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared with women with a normal zzso zzso risk increased by zzso with every zzso increase in zzso The effects were strongest for fractures of the lower zzso zzso purposeful physical activity was also associated with increased fracture risk among women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 15 zzso vs zzso Neither zzso nor physical activity was associated with fracture among men, although fracture risk decreased by zzso with every additional 2 hours of average sitting time per day zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The increase in obesity prevalence will likely increase fracture burden among young women but not young zzso While active lifestyles have health benefits, our results highlight the importance of promoting injury prevention practices in conjunction with physical activity recommendations, particularly among zzso
