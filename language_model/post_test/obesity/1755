zzso is a key risk factor for the development of insulin resistance, Type 2 diabetes and associated diseases; thus, it has become a major public health zzso In this context, a detailed understanding of brain networks regulating food zzso including hormonal zzso is zzso At present, little is known about potential zzso of cerebral networks regulating zzso zzso We used zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the functional connectivity integrity of resting state networks zzso related to food intake in lean and obese subjects using independent component zzso Our results showed altered functional connectivity strength in obese compared to lean subjects in the default mode network zzso and zzso lobe zzso In the zzso obese subjects showed in the zzso zzso increased and in the right anterior zzso decreased functional connectivity zzso Furthermore, in the zzso lobe network, obese subjects showed decreased functional connectivity strength in the left insular zzso The functional connectivity magnitude significantly correlated with body mass index zzso Two further zzso including brain regions associated with food and reward processing, did not show zzso but insulin associated functional connectivity zzso Here, the left zzso zzso and right zzso functional connectivity strength was positively correlated with zzso insulin levels and zzso correlated with insulin sensitivity zzso Taken together, these results complement and expand previous functional zzso findings by demonstrating that obesity and insulin levels influence brain function during rest in networks supporting reward and food zzso
