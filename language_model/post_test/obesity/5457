zzso calcium zzso is increased in obese humans, and zzso zzso activity is increased in zzso zzso obese zzso The aims of this study were to test the hypotheses that zzso activity is zzso correlated with zzso and that zzso activity is positively correlated with zzso and zzso activity in obese zzso 

Thirty healthy adult women, with zzso of 20 to 40, donated a single sample of whole blood and were interviewed as to medical history and family history of zzso zzso zzso were isolated and zzso for zzso and zzso Weight and height were zzso zzso analysis was used to determine relationship between zzso and zzso zzso Family history of obesity served as a zzso 

zzso was zzso correlated with increasing zzso zzso zzso - zzso p zzso zzso The relationship between zzso and zzso remained valid after controlling for family history of obesity zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso There was a positive correlation between zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and this relationship remained valid after controlling for zzso and family history of obesity zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso activity decreases as zzso zzso zzso zzso activity may contribute to increased zzso zzso previously reported in obese zzso Further studies are needed to determine whether a drop in zzso activity can serve as a marker for the development of zzso
