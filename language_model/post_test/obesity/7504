zzso zzso or zzso small zzso of plasma zzso have emerged as important elements for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the major zzso of the zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso function of zzso zzso 2 zzso using zzso zzso mice, and we found that zzso zzso prevents high fat zzso obesity and insulin zzso Interestingly, in the liver of zzso zzso mice, large and mature zzso droplets were scarcely zzso Treatment with zzso for zzso also decreased the large zzso droplets in zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso of zzso decreased the zzso of zzso in liver of zzso zzso mice, strongly suggesting that zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso exists in zzso zzso and partially associates with the fatty acid zzso zzso and with zzso 1, a scaffolding protein of zzso Because zzso and zzso 1 exist in zzso zzso and are zzso involved in zzso zzso formation, zzso is implicated in the zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso resulting in the regulation of zzso and zzso Here, we established new cell lines, in which we can completely distinguish zzso activity from zzso activity, and we demonstrated that zzso could convert zzso produced in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane into zzso Our findings demonstrate the novel and dynamic regulation of zzso zzso via zzso changes in lipids on the plasma membrane by zzso which is responsible for obesity and type 2 zzso
