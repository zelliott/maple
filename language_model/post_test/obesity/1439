zzso is a disorder of energy balance, indicating a chronic zzso between energy intake and zzso Recently, the mouse zzso zzso and subsequently its human and rat zzso have been zzso The zzso gene product, zzso is expressed exclusively in zzso zzso and appears to be a zzso factor regulating zzso zzso and energy zzso Because the level of zzso gene expression might indicate the size of the zzso zzso we suggest that it is regulated by factors modulating zzso tissue zzso Here we show that zzso gene exhibits zzso variation, increasing during the night, after rats start zzso This variation was linked to changes in food zzso as zzso prevented the zzso variation and decreased zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso rats restored zzso zzso within 4 hours to levels of fed zzso A single insulin injection in zzso animals increased zzso zzso to levels of fed zzso zzso to control zzso and insulin independently in animals, and studies in primary zzso showed that insulin regulates zzso gene expression directly in rats, regardless of its zzso zzso Whereas the zzso gene product, zzso has been shown to reduce food intake and increase energy zzso our data demonstrate that zzso gene expression is increased after food zzso in rats, perhaps through a direct action of insulin on the zzso
