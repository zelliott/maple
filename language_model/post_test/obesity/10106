A number of studies demonstrate that highly zzso older athletes are zzso than their sedentary counterparts, and have zzso profiles similar to that of young zzso It is not clear whether the high zzso zzso capacity zzso or lean body zzso is the major zzso of the favorable zzso zzso profiles present in older zzso The objective of this study was to determine whether body composition or zzso was the major zzso of zzso zzso profiles among 61 master (age 63 zzso 6 years, mean zzso zzso athletes zzso 40 zzso 39 zzso lean zzso body fat zzso and 51 obese zzso body zzso zzso sedentary zzso Plasma high density zzso cholesterol zzso zzso were zzso higher in that athletes than in the lean sedentary men, and zzso higher than in the obese sedentary zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso lower in the master athletes than in the lean sedentary men, and 51% lower than in the obese sedentary zzso Plasma low density zzso cholesterol zzso levels were zzso lower in the athletes than in the other groups of sedentary zzso In zzso multiple zzso analysis the percent body fat was the major independent predictor of zzso and zzso levels accounting for zzso and zzso of the variation in these levels, zzso The zzso accounted for an additional zzso of the zzso in zzso levels and zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso These zzso results suggest that the favorable zzso profile of master athletes is largely due to their lean body zzso with a small independent contribution from their higher levels of cardiovascular zzso Thus, regular vigorous zzso exercise and maintenance of low body fat may prevent the commonly observed zzso deterioration in zzso zzso
