zzso 1 zzso zzso are associated with obesity in mice and zzso zzso of mouse zzso causes zzso obesity with increased linear growth and enhanced sensitivity to a high-fat diet, a zzso similar to that of zzso yellow and zzso 4 zzso knockout zzso To investigate the effects of increased zzso zzso we generated transgenic mice that zzso human zzso and examined their zzso Compared with zzso mice, zzso transgenic mice had no obvious zzso on a low-fat zzso diet but were resistant to zzso obesity on a high-fat diet due to reduced food intake with no change in energy zzso The zzso zzso also completely rescued the zzso and partially rescued the obesity of zzso yellow mice, in which zzso signaling is zzso Our results indicate that the zzso 4 zzso signals through zzso or its zzso targets in controlling food intake but not energy zzso
