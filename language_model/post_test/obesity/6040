There are only few basic papers treating of the imaging features and zzso variations of the normal greater zzso zzso The goal of our study was to exploit the new major capabilities of zzso zzso terms of spatial resolution and crucial improvements in the quality of zzso and zzso zzso zzso extensively review the in zzso zzso landmarks and variations of the normal GO a large cohort of zzso 

The abdominal zzso zzso of a series of 111 patients zzso females and 60 zzso were scrupulously zzso zzso to individually characterize the zzso and zzso features of the GO through zzso zzso various methods of measure and selective volume rendering zzso 

The GO was clearly identified, localized and characterized in all zzso The good zzso of the GO vessels, which predominantly have a vertical course, was the key of this zzso Several individual and sex related zzso variations were zzso In females the left zzso was found being statistically significantly longer than the right zzso zzso zzso but also longer than the male left zzso zzso zzso On the contrary, no statistically significant variation was found between the length of the left and right zzso in males and between the length of the right zzso in males and zzso The average length of the entire GO also appeared sex-related being very statistically significantly longer in females than in males zzso zzso zzso In males the mean thickness of the GO zzso was zzso the increasing of the zzso thickness of the subcutaneous fat zzso In females it remained rather independent from the increasing of the zzso and, as a consequence, in obese and very obese females the increasing volume of the abdomen is caused zzso by the increasing amount of zzso In most males and females the zzso followed the increasing of the amount of zzso zzso Finally the projection of a less or more important portion of the GO into the zzso zzso space was an almost exclusive male feature found in zzso of males versus only zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is able to perfectly delineate the anatomy and landmarks of the normal zzso Our study reveals several sex related anatomical zzso zzso of these zzso variations may be helpful for a better understanding and diagnosis of various zzso processes involving the GO including zzso inflammatory and zzso diseases but also for surgical therapy planning including zzso zzso
