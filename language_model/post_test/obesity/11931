A relative excess of fat in the upper body region has been proven to be associated with increased coronary artery disease zzso zzso zzso X-ray zzso zzso is probably the most accurate and precise method available to study fat regional distribution and to directly measure total body fat and lean soft tissue zzso However, while several studies have investigated the abilities of obesity zzso measures in predicting zzso only few studies have evaluated zzso as zzso zzso particularly, a comparison between a model including information coming from zzso zzso and a model in which fat is precisely measured by zzso is still zzso In order to verify if zzso severity, as measured by zzso score, is better predicted when a zzso model includes zzso zzso rather than zzso measures, we compared performance obtained by two zzso Networks zzso including standard zzso measures and zzso zzso 

Data come from 58 consecutive patients, zzso of them having suspected and zzso known zzso Two zzso were zzso input variables include zzso information, zzso data and obesity zzso In the first model zzso obesity was measured by body mass index and zzso ratio, while in the second one zzso it is zzso by zzso zzso 

Network zzso and results coming from sensitivity analysis show that in both models zzso and zzso of inflammation act as zzso zzso while obesity zzso of the chosen zzso appears to be a zzso zzso acting by the zzso of other zzso Both models show high zzso abilities, the mean percentage zzso errors being, respectively, zzso and zzso 

In our study, the zzso zzso ability is slightly superior when obesity is measured using zzso data instead of zzso zzso The reason probably relies on the fact that in the zzso the obesity role in predicting zzso is zzso by the action of other factors that appear to be more directly influencing the zzso Thus, the necessity to dispose of a perfect measure becomes less compulsory and the huge effort to precisely estimate body composition with complex methods as zzso could be avoided when using expert system such as zzso as zzso zzso
