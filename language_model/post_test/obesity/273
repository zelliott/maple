The association between obesity and blood pressure is well documented and a series of obesity zzso are used as risk factors or indicators of blood pressure and/or the presence of zzso 

The aim of the present study was to explore and determine which obesity index is the best indicator of blood pressure and the presence of hypertension among five frequently used simple zzso zzso 

zzso zzso 29 zzso were selected by cluster sampling from zzso Chinese general zzso zzso zzso waist circumference zzso hip circumference and blood pressure were measured for each zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso ratio zzso and zzso index zzso were zzso zzso zzso multiple zzso regression, zzso linear zzso and zzso characteristic zzso curve analyses were zzso 

A total of 13 zzso men and 15 521 women were zzso All five obesity zzso were positively correlated with blood pressures and zzso After adjusting for age, zzso in men and zzso in women had the greatest association with the presence of hypertension, irrespective of the statistical method zzso zzso had the strongest correlation with continuous blood pressures in both zzso 

The present results indicate that hypertension is associated with different obesity zzso in men and in zzso The best indicator for hypertension is zzso in men while it is zzso in zzso
