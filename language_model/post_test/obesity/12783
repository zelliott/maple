With obesity being recognized as an important cardiovascular risk factor, it is important to determine the optimal zzso diet for decreasing that zzso The goal of this study was to compare the effects of two zzso diets of similar caloric value, but differing in zzso content zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso were followed for 12 zzso 

The patients were assigned to one of two groups that received either a low zzso zzso zzso zzso 31) or a high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso diet zzso zzso 1200 zzso 

After 12 zzso the mean weight loss was similar and did not differ significantly between the two groups: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, loss of zzso tissue was similar, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite a high protein intake zzso zzso body zzso there was loss of lean body zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso ratio diminished significantly zzso zzso and zzso in both zzso The zzso blood zzso (even though normal, along with cholesterol and zzso zzso were significantly decreased after weight zzso The zzso blood insulin which was mildly elevated before weight loss decreased more markedly with the zzso zzso diet compared to the zzso zzso diet zzso zzso The zzso ratio improved significantly zzso zzso after weight loss with both diets zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Neither diet offered a significant advantage when comparing weight loss or other, zzso parameters over a 12 w zzso However, considering the greater improvement of zzso blood insulin, the zzso ratio and blood zzso the low zzso diet zzso could be more zzso in the zzso The improvement of zzso blood insulin could be explained by the differences in zzso fat composition in the low zzso zzso
