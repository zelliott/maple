The aims of the present study were to examine zzso expression in serum and gastrointestinal tract zzso zzso and to measure tissue zzso levels and zzso zzso in some serum zzso variables in rats with zzso obesity zzso The study included 12 male rats, 60 days zzso The rats were randomly allocated to two groups zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group were fed a zzso diet to induce zzso while those in the control group were fed on standard rat zzso After a 12 week diet program including an adaptation period all rats were zzso zzso were individually zzso zzso expression was examined by zzso , and tissue and serum zzso levels were measured by zzso zzso zzso variables were measured using an zzso When the baseline and week 12 body mass index and zzso zzso expression were compared between zzso and control rats, zzso had increased and zzso expression decreased due to zzso The zzso results were consistent with these zzso zzso zzso LDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol levels were elevated and HDL cholesterol significantly decreased in the zzso zzso A comparison of zzso zzso between the control and obese groups demonstrated that zzso was decreased in all zzso of the zzso This decrease was brought about a decline in the circulating zzso zzso This suggests that rather than being associated with a change in a single zzso obesity is a pathological condition in which zzso expression is changed in all zzso
