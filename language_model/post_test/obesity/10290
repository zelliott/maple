To evaluate the relation between body zzso zzso and body mass index zzso and to evaluate the zzso of the zzso standards for obesity established by the zzso in older black and white zzso zzso 

zzso weight, zzso and zzso assessed by zzso were determined for 296 healthy, independently living women ranging in age from 50 to 80 years zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso guidelines, zzso were classified as obese zzso or zzso 30 zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, using the zzso criterion of 38% advocated by zzso to define zzso zzso of our sample was obese zzso zzso A moderately high zzso relation existed between zzso and zzso (R zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso zzso zzso Race added zzso to the prediction of zzso zzso such that for the same zzso black women will have zzso lower body zzso than white zzso Based on a zzso or zzso 38 as the criterion for zzso receiver operating characteristic zzso analysis, performed separately by race, indicated that the currently accepted zzso zzso for obesity produced low sensitivity zzso and zzso for black and white women, zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso for black women zzso or zzso zzso zzso for white women to define obesity zzso zzso zzso 

We conclude that current zzso categories may not be appropriate for identifying obesity among zzso zzso Furthermore, the relation between zzso and zzso is different in black compared to white women but remains constant from the sixth through the eighth decade of zzso
