zzso is a protein abundantly zzso by the zzso tissue zzso Plasma zzso levels are decreased in obese, zzso and type 2 diabetic zzso Various zzso complexes, zzso zzso zzso and zzso weight zzso zzso zzso and zzso are present in zzso Here, we investigated the effect of weight reducing diet on the distribution of zzso zzso in plasma and on their zzso in AT zzso from obese zzso 

A total of 20 obese subjects (age zzso years, body mass index zzso zzso underwent eight weeks of very low-calorie diet zzso A needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal AT and blood samples were taken before and after dietary zzso AT zzso were incubated in culture medium for 4 zzso zzso zzso and western zzso analyses were used to identify zzso complexes in culture media and in zzso 

The distribution of zzso zzso in plasma was different from that zzso in human AT zzso Before zzso the relative amount of zzso zzso was zzso of total zzso in culture media and zzso in zzso Despite the zzso weight loss and improvement of insulin sensitivity, zzso neither induced change in total zzso level nor in the ratio of zzso to total zzso in plasma and in culture media of AT zzso 

The profile of zzso zzso zzso zzso by AT zzso into culture media differs from the plasma zzso A dietary intervention leading to weight loss and improvement of insulin sensitivity was not associated with modifications of AT zzso of total or zzso zzso
