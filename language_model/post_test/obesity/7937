To investigate whether excessive weight gain during pregnancy alters a woman's risk of developing zzso breast zzso 

We conducted a zzso zzso study within a cohort composed of zzso Finnish women zzso age, 40; zzso zzso who responded to a questionnaire requesting information on breast cancer diagnosis and on adult and pregnancy weight gain as part of a study of a zzso zzso zzso One hundred zzso of these women reported having been diagnosed with breast cancer, and 98 were eligible for zzso Four matched controls were selected for each case zzso zzso zzso Mean age at the time the women were diagnosed with breast cancer was zzso years zzso zzso and at the time they returned the zzso zzso years zzso zzso 

We found no evidence that pregnancy weight gain, zzso or adjusted for zzso body weight or other zzso zzso status, age at zzso and first pregnancy, and family history of breast zzso had an effect on breast cancer zzso However, pregnancy weight gain was linked to an inverse association between change in body mass index zzso during adult life and zzso breast zzso Women who gained an excessive amount of weight during pregnancy zzso 16 zzso were at a significantly reduced risk of developing zzso breast cancer zzso zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso if their zzso zzso 7 zzso after age zzso zzso increase was not associated with breast cancer risk in women whose pregnancy weight gain remained within the recommended range zzso zzso 

Since our previous findings show that women who gain an excessive amount of weight during pregnancy are at an increased breast cancer risk after menopause, regardless of adult zzso an excessive pregnancy weight gain may provide a short-term protective but cause a long-term breast zzso zzso It remains to be determined why zzso and pregnancy weight gain differently affect zzso and zzso breast cancer zzso
