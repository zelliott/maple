The zzso origins of adult health and zzso hypothesis stated that environmental factors, particularly maternal zzso act in early life to zzso the risks for adverse health zzso such as cardiovascular disease, obesity and the zzso syndrome in adult zzso Early zzso zzso including zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an early fitness advantage such as zzso survival, while incurring delayed health zzso We review the evidence that such tradeoffs are anticipated from conception and that the zzso nutritional environment can zzso the zzso trajectory of the stress axis and the systems that maintain and regulate zzso blood zzso There is also evidence that restriction of zzso growth and function, results in an increased dependence of the maintenance of zzso blood pressure on the sequential recruitment of the sympathetic nervous system and zzso zzso While the zzso origins of adult zzso hypothesis has zzso on the impact of maternal zzso an increase in maternal nutritional intake and in maternal body mass intake has become more prevalent in developed zzso Exposure to zzso in zzso life results in a series of central and peripheral neuroendocrine responses that in turn zzso development of the fat cell and of the central appetite regulatory zzso While the zzso responses to zzso zzso result in the zzso trade off between zzso survival and poor health outcomes that emerge after zzso zzso exposure to early zzso results in poor health outcomes that emerge in childhood and zzso Thus, the effects of early zzso can directly impact on zzso fitness and on the health of the next zzso In this context, the zzso responses to relative zzso in early life may directly contribute to an zzso cycle of zzso
