Although obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, it is not clear whether obesity increases the risk of zzso morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass zzso zzso zzso evidence suggests that both obesity and zzso zzso are associated with increased systemic zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso surgical patients with zzso obesity and zzso zzso might thus be at greater risk for systemic zzso and zzso states, which in turn might increase the risk of adverse zzso zzso We investigated the influence of obesity on adverse zzso outcomes after coronary artery bypass zzso surgery in patients with and without zzso zzso 

A retrospective cohort study was performed of patients zzso zzso zzso undergoing primary coronary artery bypass zzso surgery with zzso bypass between January 1995 and June zzso Patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and patients with zzso normal zzso function zzso zzso zzso were further classified as obese zzso mass zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso mass index, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed, controlling for demographic factors, medications, and zzso risk factors to determine whether obesity is independently associated with an increased risk of adverse zzso outcomes after coronary artery bypass zzso surgery in patients with or without zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso had higher rates of zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso and low cardiac output syndrome zzso vs zzso and increased hospital stay zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso (all zzso P zzso zzso analysis revealed that obese patients with zzso zzso zzso were independently associated with an increased risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso and low cardiac output syndrome zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso and increased hospital stay zzso zzso In contrast, obese patients with normal zzso zzso function were independently associated only with an increased risk of zzso zzso wound infection zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso and leg wound infection zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso 

zzso is an independent risk factor for increased cardiovascular morbidity and prolonged hospital stay in patients with zzso zzso zzso undergoing primary coronary artery bypass zzso zzso
