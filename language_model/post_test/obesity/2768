zzso of zzso was zzso zzso odds ratios zzso showed that only a FH of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly associated with prevalent zzso zzso analysis showed no effect modification for obesity and zzso We did not find any association for a FH of zzso 

These findings suggest that a first degree FH of zzso predicts prevalent cases of zzso in a zzso zzso Evidence of an association may help to identify individuals who should be targeted for screening and early prevention of type 2 diabetes and zzso
