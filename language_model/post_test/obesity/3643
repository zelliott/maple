zzso dysfunction plays a role in the development of muscle insulin resistance zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in skeletal muscle that can, in turn, interfere with insulin zzso The purpose of this study was to assess zzso function zzso and zzso in obese adolescent girls with and without zzso to determine zzso zzso Girls with zzso have impaired zzso and zzso impaired zzso in girls with zzso is related to higher zzso 

We examined 22 obese girls aged 13-21 years old for zzso zzso as a zzso model assessment of insulin resistance zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso respectively, were used to determine zzso and zzso of the zzso muscle along with magnetic resonance imaging zzso measures of zzso zzso and total zzso tissue zzso SAT, and zzso in girls with zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso lipids and zzso ratio zzso were also zzso 

Girls with zzso zzso did not differ from the zzso group zzso for age, bone age, weight, zzso SAT, zzso or zzso However, the zzso group had higher zzso zzso the zzso group had a lower log rate of zzso zzso zzso recovery zzso and a higher log zzso recovery constant zzso indicative of impaired zzso 

zzso girls with increased zzso have impaired zzso zzso This association is not zzso by zzso in zzso or zzso zzso Further studies are necessary to determine whether there is a zzso relation between impaired zzso function and zzso in obesity and zzso of such a zzso
