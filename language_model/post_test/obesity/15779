zzso dysfunction assessed by zzso artery zzso zzso zzso has been associated with cardiovascular zzso There have been relatively few studies examining zzso or other measures of zzso function in patients with peripheral artery disease zzso The aim of this study was to examine zzso of zzso in a zzso cohort of patients with zzso 

We zzso assessed patients presenting with life zzso intermittent zzso to establish the presence of cardiovascular risk factors, obesity and zzso zzso zzso serum was zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was measured by high-resolution zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso were elevated in patients with obesity and zzso zzso zzso was impaired in patients with obesity and zzso syndrome and zzso correlated with serum zzso of zzso By multiple zzso analysis, zzso syndrome was independently associated with impaired zzso after adjustment for age, smoking, zzso heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and severity of zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso syndrome is an important zzso of zzso function in patients with zzso and zzso may be a useful zzso of this zzso
