This review will examine the recent scientific literature on the mechanisms that are thought to link obesity to zzso cancer zzso zzso 

zzso has emerged as a leading environmental risk factor for the development of zzso However, the mechanisms underlying this relationship have not yet been fully zzso Recent literature has focused on inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso zzso inflammation is largely orchestrated by increases in zzso tissue zzso leading to the zzso of inflammatory zzso including tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all of which are linked to zzso zzso is decreased with obesity and has been reported to be zzso associated with zzso whereas zzso which is increased, is positively associated with the zzso zzso has been shown to influence zzso although its role remains zzso some studies have implicated zzso as being zzso whereas others have suggested it to be a risk zzso We highlight the most important recent advances that have been made on the aforementioned mechanisms that are thought to link obesity to zzso 

A better understanding of the mechanisms linking obesity to zzso risk is necessary for the design of effective treatment approaches in future clinical zzso
