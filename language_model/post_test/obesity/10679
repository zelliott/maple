The prevalence of diabetes is increasing zzso It has been long known that increased rates of inflammatory diseases, such as obesity zzso hypertension zzso and cardiovascular diseases zzso are highly associated with type 2 diabetes zzso zzso and/or zzso can develop zzso due to zzso behavioral or zzso variables but both lead to zzso stress zzso The underlying mechanisms by which zzso complications arise and manifest together remain poorly zzso zzso interactions regulate nearly every living zzso zzso of zzso zzso data has enabled unprecedented views of gene and protein zzso zzso and interactions in cellular zzso 

The present work, applied a systems biology approach to develop gene interaction network models, comprised of high zzso zzso and zzso data for zzso The genes zzso regulated through zzso were zzso and their zzso were studied to get a more complete understanding of the overall gene network zzso and their role in disease zzso 

By analyzing the genes related to zzso zzso and zzso a highly regulated zzso integrated network model has been developed that provides useful functional linkages among groups of genes and thus addressing how different inflammatory diseases are connected and zzso at genetic zzso Based on the investigations around the zzso that provided more meaningful insights about the zzso within zzso networks in terms of disease zzso association with zzso stress and zzso a hypothetical zzso disease mechanism model been zzso The results from this study revealed that the zzso stress zzso regulation cascade is the common zzso link among the zzso of zzso zzso and other inflammatory diseases such as zzso 

The findings provide a novel comprehensive approach for understanding the zzso of various zzso chronic inflammatory diseases by combining the power of zzso analysis with gene regulatory network zzso
