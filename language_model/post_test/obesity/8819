zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso released from zzso zzso during the zzso zzso Previous studies have suggested that zzso may play an zzso role in zzso thus, the zzso zzso may represent a target for zzso zzso The present studies were conducted to zzso mechanisms by which zzso might promote obesity by examining the effect of zzso on both zzso release zzso of zzso and free fatty acid zzso release zzso of both zzso and zzso as well as the ability of a zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso these zzso 

zzso rat zzso were zzso on a column with 10 zzso zzso alone or in combination with 10 zzso insulin, 1 zzso zzso or 1 zzso zzso zzso were collected every minute and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso significantly increased zzso zzso zzso zzso release by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso release by zzso and attenuated the zzso response to zzso by zzso These properties were similar to those of insulin in zzso suggesting that zzso possesses zzso zzso effects on zzso Finally, zzso reversed the effects of zzso on both zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

These studies provide further evidence for an important zzso role for zzso in zzso zzso and possibly in the zzso of zzso They also suggest that the zzso zzso may represent an excellent target for the prevention and treatment of obesity and zzso type 2 zzso
