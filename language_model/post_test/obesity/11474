To determine optimum zzso zzso for predicting the likelihood ratios of type 2 diabetes zzso zzso and hypertension zzso in zzso 

Data from a randomly selected, nationally representative health survey zzso with zzso men zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso women zzso zzso zzso were assessed for values of body mass index zzso and waist circumference zzso for predicting zzso or zzso by receiver operating characteristic curve zzso zzso ratios for zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso or zzso for zzso screening were zzso zzso included regional zzso 

zzso ratios of zzso and zzso increased from zzso values of 22 to 24 zzso in both sexes and with zzso values of 75 to 80 zzso in men and 70 to 80 zzso in zzso The best zzso zzso for predicting zzso were zzso to zzso zzso in men and zzso to zzso zzso in women, with similar values for zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso for men and women, zzso zzso zzso for zzso were 93 to 98 zzso in men and 94 to 99 zzso in women, and zzso for zzso were 92 to 96 zzso and 93 to 96 zzso for men and women, zzso The zzso zzso had higher sensitivity and specificity than those of zzso 

The risk for zzso and zzso starts at lower levels of zzso and zzso than those suggested by zzso zzso is a better zzso than zzso measures for use in public zzso
