Growth hormone is an important regulator of zzso growth and zzso We have investigated the zzso consequences of altered growth hormone zzso in zzso mice that have zzso at position zzso and 391 of the zzso domain of the growth hormone zzso and thus exhibit either low zzso zzso zzso or no growth zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso result in altered liver zzso obesity and insulin zzso 

The analysis of zzso changes was performed using zzso analysis of liver tissue and zzso zzso of urine and liver zzso Data were analyzed using zzso statistics and Gene zzso zzso The zzso profiles characteristic for each of the two zzso groups and zzso mice were identified with zzso zzso We found decreased urinary levels of zzso zzso and zzso and increased levels of zzso zzso and zzso when compared to zzso zzso These results indicate significant changes in zzso and zzso zzso and were coupled with increased fat deposition, leading to zzso The zzso analysis identified changes in expression of zzso zzso zzso with zzso in zzso concentration both in urine and zzso zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso was seen in young mice, but the pattern of zzso shifted to that of the 391 zzso as the zzso mice became obese after six months zzso 

The zzso observations were consistent with the parallel analysis of gene expression and zzso mapping using zzso data, identifying zzso and gene transcripts involved in zzso zzso especially for zzso zzso and zzso zzso The systems biology approach applied in this study provides a coherent picture of zzso changes resulting from impaired zzso zzso by the growth hormone zzso and supports a potentially important role for zzso in enhancing zzso
