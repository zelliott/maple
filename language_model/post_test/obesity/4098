zzso and its related disorders are growing epidemic across the zzso Research on links between the bipolar spectrum and obesity has proliferated in the last few zzso As some forms of abnormal temperament are considered as zzso of the soft bipolar spectrum, we aimed to evaluate abnormal zzso in zzso obese zzso 

Using a short version of the zzso zzso of Memphis, zzso Paris and San Diego, we investigated abnormal zzso zzso zzso irritable or anxious temperament in zzso patients with zzso obesity compared to a control group of 90 patients admitted prior to organ zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso were applied to assess current mood zzso 

The obese group showed statistically significantly more psychiatric zzso compared to the control zzso zzso zzso were significantly more often observed in patients with zzso obesity rather than in zzso zzso irritable and anxious zzso showed specificity to zzso zzso patients had significantly higher scores on the zzso while no difference for zzso scores was found among the whole zzso All zzso were positively correlated with zzso and zzso in the obese zzso 

The control group was not matched for demographic zzso 

Our results need replication but indicate an affective overlap in the form of abnormal temperament and depressive symptoms in obese patients, whereas mood swings should be evaluated and early mood stabilization considered for patients with significant weight gain to prevent obesity or to reduce already existing zzso Studies of mood zzso and prospective observations would shed further insight on this complex interface of a major clinical and public health zzso
