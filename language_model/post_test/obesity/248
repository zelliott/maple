zzso zzso tissue is markedly infiltrated by zzso suggesting that they may participate in the inflammatory pathways that are activated in obese zzso zzso Evidence has suggested that saturated fatty acids released via zzso zzso serve as a naturally occurring zzso that stimulates zzso zzso zzso zzso thereby inducing the inflammatory responses in zzso in obese zzso zzso Through a combination of zzso zzso analyses of saturated fatty zzso zzso in zzso and obese zzso tissue in zzso here we identified zzso zzso factor zzso a member of the zzso response zzso protein family of basic zzso zzso zzso factors, as a target gene of saturated fatty zzso signaling in zzso in obese zzso zzso zzso zzso when induced by saturated fatty zzso can zzso repress tumor necrosis zzso production in zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso is recruited to the region containing the zzso zzso site of the zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso Furthermore, transgenic zzso of zzso specifically in zzso results in the marked zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso tissue from genetically obese zzso mice fed high-fat zzso This study provides evidence that zzso which is induced in obese zzso zzso acts as a zzso zzso of saturated fatty zzso zzso thereby revealing the negative feedback mechanism that zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data also suggest that zzso of zzso in zzso offers a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent or treat zzso zzso tissue zzso
