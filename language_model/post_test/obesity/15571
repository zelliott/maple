To study the effect of body mass index on the healing of zzso zzso wounds closed with a continuous zzso 

Prospective clinical zzso 

County hospital, zzso 

zzso patients who underwent zzso zzso between September 1991 and June zzso 

Body mass index was recorded and overweight was defined as an index above zzso 

zzso wound infection, and zzso of zzso zzso at 12 zzso 

zzso patients were zzso with a higher zzso zzso length ratio than others zzso zzso zzso infection developed zzso in 97 of zzso patients zzso and overweight, youth, wound contamination, and zzso were independent risk zzso However, overweight was not associated with a higher rate of infection if the zzso zzso length ratio was zzso zzso zzso developed in 118 of zzso patients zzso and overweight, old age, wound infection, and zzso zzso length ratio less than 4 were independent risk zzso However, overweight was not associated with a higher zzso rate if the zzso zzso length ratio was zzso 

zzso is a risk factor for wound infection and zzso zzso after zzso abdominal surgery but these effects may be eliminated if patients are zzso with a zzso length to wound length ratio of zzso
