While it is well accepted that the disposal of an oral zzso load zzso occurs primarily in skeletal muscle, the mechanisms by which this occurs are not completely zzso zzso zzso zzso in skeletal muscle follows the zzso principal, such that zzso equals the products of the zzso zzso difference zzso across and the blood flow zzso into zzso It is widely believed that in the zzso period both insulin and zzso increase zzso by increasing the zzso however, a role for increments in zzso in the disposal and tolerance of an zzso has not been zzso To investigate this issue, whole body zzso zzso zzso leg zzso zzso balance zzso leg zzso and cardiac index zzso were measured after an overnight fast and over 180 zzso after an zzso (1 zzso in 8 lean zzso and 8 obese zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso age, 36 zzso 2 zzso 37 zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 60 zzso 1 zzso 99 zzso 5 zzso zzso less than zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were higher in the zzso than in the zzso subjects between 100 and 160 zzso indicating reduced zzso zzso zzso and zzso serum insulin levels were zzso to zzso higher in zzso zzso zzso at all times, indicating insulin zzso Peak zzso zzso incremental whole body zzso above baseline was zzso lower in zzso zzso zzso zzso less than zzso Peak zzso zzso was not different between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Peak leg zzso increased zzso over baseline in zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso while zzso subjects displayed no change in leg zzso from zzso zzso peak leg zzso was zzso lower in zzso zzso zzso zzso less than zzso zzso increased zzso from baseline at 60 zzso in zzso zzso less than zzso but was unchanged in zzso In zzso after an zzso 1) zzso zzso increases in both zzso and zzso subjects, but skeletal muscle zzso and zzso increase in zzso only; 2) since peak zzso zzso values were similar in zzso and zzso differences in peak leg zzso and (by zzso whole body zzso are largely due to reduced zzso to zzso zzso and 3) zzso play an important role in the zzso disposal of an zzso and therefore, zzso defects can potentially contribute to reduced zzso tolerance and insulin zzso
