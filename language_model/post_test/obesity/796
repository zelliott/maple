zzso in early life is related to adult body mass index, and early environmental influences have been proposed to have lifelong consequences for zzso However, body mass index also reflects zzso mass, and few studies have examined the relation between size in early life and direct measures of body composition in older zzso 

We investigated the associations of birth weight and weight at 1 y of age with body composition in older zzso 

We carried out a retrospective cohort study in zzso United zzso Men who were born between 1931 and 1939 and for whom there were records of birth weight and weight at 1 y of age zzso zzso zzso participated in the zzso The main outcome measures were adult body mass index, zzso mass, and fat zzso 

Birth weight was significantly and consistently positively associated with adult body mass index and zzso mass but not with measures of adult fat zzso In contrast, weight at 1 y of age was associated with adult body mass index, zzso mass, and fat zzso 

The consistently reported positive relation between birth weight and adult body mass index may reflect prenatal and maternal influences on zzso mass rather than on fat mass in older zzso The zzso environment may be more influential than prenatal factors in the development of obesity in later zzso
