Many limitations exist with completing zzso fitness testing in obese zzso The aim of this study was to determine if the new Healthy Active Living and zzso Research Group's zzso zzso zzso fitness testing protocol for obese children and youth provides a comparable estimate of peak oxygen zzso to that measured using validated zzso and zzso zzso protocols in the obese pediatric zzso A group of obese children zzso zzso zzso all zzso body mass index zzso aged zzso zzso completed 3 exercise testing zzso Testing was completed as part of an ongoing cohort study and 2 zzso zzso fitness tests were completed, in zzso order, during a second zzso zzso correlations were found between observed peak oxygen zzso zzso and predicted peak oxygen zzso for both the zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso A similar correlation was found, after accounting for body mass, between measured and predicted zzso peak oxygen zzso zzso values zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso predicted peak oxygen zzso values showed a significant correlation when plotted against the measured values zzso zzso zzso A zzso analysis found agreement between the zzso and zzso zzso protocols zzso bias zzso zzso zzso The significant relationships found between estimates of peak oxygen zzso from the zzso zzso protocol and measures of peak oxygen zzso during zzso zzso testing support the use of the zzso zzso protocol as a valid measure to estimate zzso zzso fitness within the obese pediatric zzso Given the proof of principle goal of this study, future research in the obese, pediatric population is encouraged to confirm the zzso of the zzso
