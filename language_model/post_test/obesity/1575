zzso resistance and obesity are components of the zzso syndrome that includes development of cardiovascular disease and diabetes with advancing zzso The thrifty zzso hypothesis suggests that offspring of poorly nourished mothers are predisposed to the various components of the zzso syndrome due to adaptations made during fetal zzso We assessed the effects of maternal zzso restriction in early gestation on feeding behavior, insulin and zzso zzso body zzso and liver function in aged female offspring of zzso fed either a zzso zzso 50% National Research Council zzso zzso or control zzso zzso zzso diet from 28 to 78 days of zzso after which both groups were fed at zzso of zzso from day 79 to zzso and through zzso Female zzso born to zzso and C zzso were reared as a single group from zzso and thereafter, they were fed zzso zzso recommendations until assigned to this study at 6 zzso of zzso These female offspring were evaluated by a frequently sampled intravenous zzso tolerance test, followed by zzso X-ray zzso for body composition analysis prior to and after ad zzso feeding of a highly palatable zzso diet for 11 zzso with automated monitoring of feed intake zzso zzso Aged female offspring born to zzso zzso demonstrated greater and more rapid feed zzso greater body weight gain, and efficiency of gain, lower insulin sensitivity, higher insulin zzso and greater zzso zzso and zzso content than offspring from C zzso These data confirm an increased zzso zzso of offspring born to zzso mothers, which continues into advanced age, possibly zzso these offspring to zzso zzso
