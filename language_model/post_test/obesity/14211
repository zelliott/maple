This study addressed the hypothesis that variation in genes associated with zzso function zzso zzso zzso zzso function zzso and regulation of zzso levels zzso may be zzso of zzso categories zzso and overweight + zzso in young adulthood and of changes in zzso as adolescents transition into young zzso zzso with gender and zzso were also zzso 

Participants were a zzso of individuals from the National zzso Study of Adolescent Health zzso zzso a nationally representative sample of adolescents followed from 1995 to zzso The sample analyzed included a subset of zzso unrelated individuals with zzso zzso Multiple zzso zzso were conducted to evaluate the associations between zzso and obesity zzso zzso or overweight + obese combined zzso or zzso 25) with normal weight zzso zzso zzso as a zzso Linear zzso models were used to examine change in zzso from adolescence to young zzso 

zzso associations were found between zzso zzso and categories of zzso and between zzso promoter variable number tandem repeat zzso among men and categories of zzso zzso analyses revealed that the association between these two genes and excess zzso was significant for men overall and for white and Hispanic men zzso Linear zzso models indicated a significant effect of zzso zzso on change in zzso from adolescence to young zzso 

Our findings lend further support to the involvement of genes implicated in zzso and zzso regulation on energy zzso
