To determine whether waist circumference zzso is a better predictor of insulin resistance zzso than body mass index zzso in zzso adolescents aged zzso zzso 

Using data from the National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso zzso we evaluated an ethnically diverse sample of zzso adolescents with regard to zzso zzso and zzso zzso and insulin zzso Children were classified as having zzso if they had a zzso model assessment of insulin resistance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of greater than zzso created receiver operating characteristic zzso predicting zzso across various thresholds of zzso and zzso and area under the curve was zzso 

The prevalence rate of zzso in the study population was zzso zzso of test performance zzso and zzso for predicting zzso were similar for abnormal zzso and zzso zzso that is, thresholds of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and thresholds of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were quite zzso There were no significant differences in area under the curve for zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso either for the overall population or for specific racial zzso 

zzso does not seem to provide a distinct advantage over zzso for identifying adolescents with zzso
