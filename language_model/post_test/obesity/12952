zzso E zzso zzso is one of the genetic zzso of serum cholesterol zzso The zzso zzso zzso has been associated with advanced coronary heart disease zzso diagnosed by zzso but the role of the zzso zzso in zzso has not been confirmed at zzso level, nor is any zzso effect of the zzso zzso on the development of zzso zzso 

The right and left anterior descending coronary arteries zzso and zzso and the zzso from 700 male autopsy cases zzso zzso Death zzso in zzso and zzso zzso age 53 years, range 33 to 70 zzso were stained for fat, and all areas covered with fatty streaks, zzso zzso and complicated zzso were zzso In the RCA and zzso the zzso zzso was significantly associated with the area of total zzso zzso in men zzso years old but not with that in older men zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso zzso Men zzso years old with the zzso zzso showed zzso larger total zzso zzso area in the RCA zzso and zzso larger area in the zzso zzso than did men with the zzso The zzso zzso was also associated with zzso zzso in the abdominal zzso and zzso zzso zzso but this effect, unlike that of the coronary zzso was not zzso 

In men, the zzso zzso zzso is a significant genetic risk factor for coronary zzso in early middle zzso This suggests that at older age, other known risk factors of zzso play a more important role in the zzso process than zzso zzso
