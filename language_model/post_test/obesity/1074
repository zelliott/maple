The purpose of this investigation was to compare the benefits of a meal tolerance test zzso against those of an oral zzso tolerance test zzso in one of the most commonly used models of insulin resistance, the zzso fatty zzso zzso of these two oral challenges will facilitate determination of the most effective means of inducing both zzso and insulin responses in this particular model and allow for possible therapeutic benefits to be examined more zzso zzso zzso fatty rats zzso zzso 7 or 8) were used to perform either an zzso or a zzso following an overnight zzso The zzso contained a final amount of zzso zzso of zzso zzso body weight zzso The zzso zzso available liquid zzso in addition to having fat and zzso included a final amount of available zzso and volume to match the zzso A zzso group served as zzso A greater zzso excursion was observed following the zzso compared to the zzso The zzso change in zzso from baseline was 140 zzso 10 zzso (a zzso zzso for the zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso (a zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso The zzso induced a greater change from baseline in insulin response compared to the zzso zzso zzso zzso v zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso v zzso zzso P zzso The saline challenge induced only minimal zzso and insulin responses in comparison to the other zzso These results suggest that, in a model of insulin resistance, the zzso is a more potent insulin zzso than zzso zzso A mixed zzso such as a zzso provides a complete zzso challenge zzso fat, and zzso that will induce both zzso and insulin responses, enabling a better capacity to detect differences in one of the most often used models of insulin resistance, the zzso fatty zzso
