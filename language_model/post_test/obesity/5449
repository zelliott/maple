We investigated the effects of a diet containing zzso rich in zzso such as zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso a zzso regimen, on zzso zzso in diabetic pregnant rats and their obese zzso 

zzso zzso in pregnant rats was induced by zzso injection of zzso on Day 5 of zzso zzso zzso was zzso by using zzso whereas zzso free calcium zzso zzso were measured by using zzso in diabetic pregnant rats and their obese zzso 

zzso zzso proliferation was decreased in both pregnant diabetic rats and their obese zzso as compared with control zzso Feeding the zzso diet restored zzso proliferation in both groups of zzso We also employed zzso which at 50 zzso opens calcium channels, and zzso zzso which recruits zzso from zzso zzso zzso We observed that zzso increases in zzso in zzso of diabetic mothers and obese offspring were greater than in those of control zzso Furthermore, feeding zzso diet diminished significantly the zzso rise in zzso in diabetic and obese zzso zzso increases in zzso in zzso of diabetic pregnant rats and their obese offspring were greater than in those of control zzso The feeding of the experimental diet significantly curtailed the zzso increases in zzso in both diabetic and obese zzso 

Together, these observations provide evidence that zzso zzso and zzso calcium signaling are altered during zzso diabetes and zzso zzso dietary fish zzso particularly zzso acid and zzso acid, may restore these zzso zzso
