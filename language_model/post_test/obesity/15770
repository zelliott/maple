zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that appears to mimic the action of insulin, inducing zzso transport into zzso zzso We examined zzso expression in a cohort of pregnant women to determine if pregnancy influenced zzso gene zzso circulating levels of zzso or local zzso of zzso in either zzso fat or zzso zzso of female zzso fat, blood and zzso were collected over a zzso period and frozen at zzso degrees C until they were employed in a series of various zzso zzso were collected during delivery in pregnant women, at zzso in lean women and at zzso surgery in obese and obese diabetic zzso zzso expression and zzso were measured in four zzso of zzso lean controls, pregnant women at term, obese zzso and obese diabetic women zzso zzso expression was seven times higher in zzso fat of pregnant women than in lean zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso gene transcript was translated to zzso An zzso confirmed that zzso protein was much higher in pregnant women than in obese zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso in lean women as compared to zzso in pregnant women zzso thus the increased zzso zzso levels in zzso fat were not reflected in increased serum zzso We measured zzso zzso content of human zzso and found that zzso expresses substantial amounts of zzso zzso a zzso gene that is highly expressed in most human cells had a threshold value zzso of zzso versus a zzso of zzso for zzso Again, zzso confirmed that zzso zzso zzso was translated into zzso zzso zzso zzso transport was measured in partially differentiated zzso zzso At a concentration of zzso zzso and insulin produced nearly identical increases in zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest there is a selective increase in zzso gene expression in pregnant women at zzso Since zzso also zzso and zzso induced zzso transport in a cell culture model, any hypothetical role for zzso in pregnancy should include the possibility that it may function in regulation of zzso zzso metabolism or zzso
