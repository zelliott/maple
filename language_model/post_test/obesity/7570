Previous studies suggest that obesity may be a risk factor for complications from pandemic influenza zzso zzso We aimed to examine the association between obesity and respiratory zzso during seasonal influenza zzso and to determine the extent of this association among individuals without established risk factors for serious complications due to influenza zzso 

We conducted a cohort study over 12 influenza seasons zzso through zzso of zzso respondents to population health surveys in Ontario, zzso We included individuals aged zzso years who had responded to a survey within 5 years prior to the start of an influenza zzso We used zzso zzso to examine the association between zzso body mass index zzso and hospitalization for selected respiratory diseases zzso and zzso acute respiratory diseases, and chronic lung zzso both in the entire cohort and zzso by chronic condition zzso 

zzso class I zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and obese class II or III zzso zzso individuals zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were more likely than normal weight individuals to have a respiratory hospitalization during influenza zzso Among obese class II or III individuals, the association was present both for those without previously identified risk factors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and for those with 1 risk factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso obese individuals with and without chronic conditions are at increased risk for respiratory zzso during influenza zzso They should be considered a priority group for preventive influenza measures, such as vaccination and treatment with zzso zzso
