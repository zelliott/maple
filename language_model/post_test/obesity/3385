zzso is increasingly prevalent in bipolar disorder zzso but data about the impact of elevated body mass index zzso on brain zzso integrity in BD are zzso Based on extant literature largely from structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies, we zzso that increased zzso is associated with decreased fractional zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso brain regions early in the course of zzso 

A total of 26 zzso adults (12 normal weight and 14 zzso with zzso zzso mania zzso and 28 controls (13 normal weight and 15 zzso matched for age, zzso and years of education underwent structural zzso and diffusion zzso imaging zzso 

There are significant effects of diagnosis by zzso interactions observed especially in the right zzso lobe zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso lobe zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Specifically, decreased zzso is found in the right zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso within zzso patients compared with zzso patients with zzso Compared with zzso controls, decreased zzso is observed in right zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso regions in zzso patients with zzso 

Our findings suggest that increased zzso affects zzso brain zzso integrity in zzso This highlights the need to further zzso the relationship between obesity and other neural zzso (including zzso zzso in BD which may clarify brain circuits zzso the association between obesity and clinical outcomes in zzso
