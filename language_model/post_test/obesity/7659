zzso is the first step in ingesting food, but the effects of zzso on energy intake and gut hormones in both obese and lean subjects have not been extensively zzso 

The current study aimed to compare the differences in chewing activities between obese and lean subjects and to examine the effects of chewing on energy intake and gut hormone zzso in both obese and lean zzso 

Sixteen lean and 14 obese young men participated in the current zzso In study 1, we investigated whether the chewing factors of obese subjects were different from those of lean zzso In study 2, we explored the effects of chewing on energy zzso A test meal consisting of zzso zzso zzso of energy as zzso zzso of energy as fat, and zzso of energy as zzso was then consumed on 2 different sessions (15 chews and 40 chews per bite of 10 g of zzso by each subject to assess the effects of chewing on plasma gut hormone zzso 

Compared with lean participants, obese participants had a higher zzso rate and a lower number of chews per 1 g of zzso However, obese participants had a bite size similar to that of lean zzso Regardless of status, the subjects zzso zzso less after 40 chews than after 15 zzso Compared with 15 zzso 40 chews resulted in lower energy intake and zzso zzso concentration and higher zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso in both lean and obese zzso 

zzso aimed at improving chewing activity could become a useful tool for combating zzso This trial was registered at zzso as zzso
