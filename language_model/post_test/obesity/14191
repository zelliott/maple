During the last several years the role of zzso tissue in contributing to zzso cardiovascular and zzso risk has gained much zzso 

To examine the expression of zzso protein in zzso and subcutaneous zzso tissue in correlation with plasma zzso and other clinical parameters in obesity zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso and subcutaneous fat were collected during surgery in 32 obesity zzso The expression of zzso protein in zzso and subcutaneous fat was zzso by using Western zzso method, and correlations with plasma zzso zzso model assessment insulin resistance zzso and zzso were zzso 

zzso protein expression was higher in zzso than in subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso zzso positive linear correlations were found between zzso protein in zzso zzso tissue and plasma zzso in obesity zzso zzso protein in zzso fat was positively associated with zzso zzso and zzso with zzso 

zzso expression in zzso zzso tissue could play a key role in contributing to cardiovascular risk in central obesity zzso
