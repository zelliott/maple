To determine whether zzso alters zzso zzso zzso zzso the increase in plasma zzso after intravenous zzso II zzso 10, and 20 zzso for 15 minutes each) was measured before and after zzso zzso in seven chronically zzso zzso In a random sequence on 4 successive days, dogs received either 0, 2, 4, or 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso at all insulin doses, resulted in a significantly greater zzso less than zzso change in the zzso zzso increments of plasma zzso than was observed when zzso II was administered zzso However, there was no zzso of zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso The effect of weight gain on the zzso II response was also evaluated in five zzso After weight gain, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the same magnitude that was observed before weight zzso zzso mechanisms zzso insulin could increase zzso zzso zzso production include: increased zzso zzso reduced plasma free fatty zzso and a direct action of insulin to induce increased adrenal zzso In addition to altering the zzso zzso zzso curve, zzso also increased the zzso action of zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso response, progressive zzso resulted in a progressive increase in the zzso response to zzso zzso The increased zzso response is probably due to an increased zzso of the sympathetic nervous system by zzso
