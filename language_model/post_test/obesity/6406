The purpose of this study was to zzso the effects of exercise treatment programs on changes in body mass, zzso mass, and body fat in obese children and zzso 

By using the zzso approach, studies that met the following criteria were included in our zzso 1) at least six subjects per zzso 2) subject groups consisting of children in the zzso to zzso age zzso 3) zzso and zzso values for either body mass, percent body fat, or zzso mass zzso 4) used exercise as a mode of treatment zzso walking, zzso cycle zzso zzso resistance exercise, and zzso 6) training zzso 3 zzso 7) full-length publications (not conference zzso 8) apparently zzso children zzso free from zzso diseases and zzso and 9) published studies in English language journals zzso 

A total of 120 investigations were located that addressed the issue of exercise as a method of treatment in pediatric zzso Of those, 30 met our criteria for zzso Across all designs and categories, zzso modeling yielded significant decreases in the following dependent zzso 1) percent body fat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 2) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 3) body mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 4) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and 5) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso differences were found as a function of the type intervention groups zzso vs exercise + behavioral zzso P zzso body composition assessment methods zzso vs zzso zzso zzso and total body zzso P zzso exercise intensity zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso duration zzso 30 zzso zzso 30 zzso P zzso and mode zzso vs zzso + resistance zzso P zzso zzso linear zzso suggested that initial body fat levels (or body zzso type of treatment intervention, exercise intensity, and exercise mode accounted for most of the zzso associated with changes in body composition after zzso 

Exercise is zzso for reducing selected body composition variables in children and zzso The most favorable zzso in body composition occurred with 1) zzso zzso zzso 2) zzso exercise combined with zzso resistance zzso and 3) exercise programs combined with a zzso zzso
