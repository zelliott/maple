zzso zzso zzso zzso are required for the zzso of the insulin zzso zzso and its initial cellular zzso and it has recently been reported that zzso may play a role in the zzso of insulin resistance in obesity and type 2 diabetes zzso zzso We therefore determined the amount and activity of zzso in abdominal zzso tissue obtained from lean zzso subjects zzso control zzso obese zzso subjects zzso control zzso and subjects with both type 2 zzso zzso and obesity zzso diabetic zzso zzso protein levels were zzso higher in OC than in zzso zzso zzso 195 U vs 500 zzso 146 U zzso zzso zzso P zzso while zzso exhibited a zzso increase zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso activity was zzso by measuring the zzso activity toward a zzso zzso synthetic zzso In contrast to the increased zzso protein levels, zzso activity per unit of zzso protein was markedly reduced, by zzso and zzso in OC and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was comparable in all three zzso Similar results were obtained when zzso activity was measured against intact human zzso A significant correlation was found between body mass index zzso and zzso level zzso zzso zzso P zzso whereas zzso and zzso activity per unit of zzso showed a strong inverse correlation zzso zzso zzso P zzso These data suggest that the insulin resistance of obesity and zzso is characterized by the increased expression of a zzso impaired zzso in zzso tissue and that impaired zzso activity may be zzso for insulin resistance in these zzso
