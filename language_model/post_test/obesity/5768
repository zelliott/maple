The purpose of our research was to compare the body mass index zzso and selected zzso parameters in zzso and zzso zzso 

The study group consisted of 64 zzso boys and 45 zzso the control group consisted of 68 zzso boys and 48 zzso zzso All the children were zzso years zzso We measured zzso parameters by a standardized method and the percentage of fat using the simple zzso zzso zzso Additionally, we calculated the percentage of body composition zzso and the components of zzso zzso zzso significance was estimated at the level of zzso by zzso zzso 

The zzso boys were significantly shorter than the zzso zzso however, we did not find any significant differences in weight and/or zzso in boys nor zzso The zzso boys had significantly higher fat mass % than the zzso ones zzso Moreover, they had significantly lower muscle mass % zzso as well as the bone mass % zzso The zzso girls had higher fat mass % than the zzso ones zzso and lower muscle mass % zzso The simple zzso zzso method also showed higher fat % in the zzso boys zzso but not in the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso the higher zzso was the only significant difference in zzso boys zzso and near significant in zzso girls zzso 

zzso of the zzso alone is not sufficient in zzso children because of their high percentage of zzso That is why additionally testing fat % is zzso
