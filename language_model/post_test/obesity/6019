The majority of infants in the United States are in zzso child care, yet little is known about the effect of child care on development of zzso 

To examine the relationship between child care attendance from birth to 6 months and zzso at 1 and 3 years of zzso 

We studied zzso children from a prospective cohort of pregnant women and their zzso The main exposure was time in child care from birth to 6 months of age, overall and by type of zzso zzso child care center; zzso someone else's zzso and zzso child's own home by zzso The main outcomes were zzso zzso zzso score at 1 year and zzso zzso score at 3 years of zzso 

A total of zzso zzso infants attended child care; zzso were cared for in a center, zzso in someone else's home, and zzso in their own home by a zzso After adjustment for zzso overall time in child care was associated with an increased zzso zzso score at 1 year and zzso zzso score at 3 years of age but not zzso zzso Center and own home care were not associated with the zzso but care in someone else's home was associated with an increase in both the zzso and zzso zzso 

Child care in the first 6 months of life, especially in someone else's home, was associated with an increased zzso zzso score at 1 year and zzso zzso score at 3 years of zzso
