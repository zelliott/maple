zzso obesity is associated with zzso of the zzso zzso axis to zzso zzso and to zzso zzso are involved in the regulation of the zzso zzso particularly during stress, via zzso zzso 

In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso with an zzso zzso zzso (2 zzso over 10 minutes) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso per 90 minutes zzso on the zzso zzso measured by zzso and cortisol response to combined zzso zzso 100 zzso plus zzso zzso zzso administration, and on zzso zzso and zzso zzso blood levels, in a group of obese women with abdominal zzso or peripheral zzso body fat distribution and in zzso zzso 

During the control zzso + zzso test the zzso but not the cortisol response was higher zzso zzso in obese zzso women than in controls, with minor and transient variations of zzso zzso Neither the control test nor zzso or zzso influenced zzso or post zzso + zzso A zzso zzso zzso similarly and significantly decreased zzso levels in all women and, compared to the control test, marginally influenced the zzso response to zzso + zzso zzso during zzso infusion zzso levels steadily and similarly increased to values more or less double baseline values in all zzso Compared to the control test, however, the zzso response to the zzso + zzso test performed during zzso infusion significantly decreased in the control subjects whereas a tendency to a further increase occurred in the obese groups and, specifically, in the zzso group significantly zzso zzso more than in the zzso zzso 

This study shows that zzso regulation of the zzso axis is different in obese and zzso women, particularly in stressed zzso We suggest that the abnormal zzso response to zzso + zzso challenge with increased zzso tone may represent a specific zzso aspect of the abnormal response to stress or to other specific zzso factors in obese women, particularly those with abdominal body fat zzso
