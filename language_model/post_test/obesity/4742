In a zzso adolescent girl, we investigated zzso changes before and at two time points after zzso therapy (3 d and 6 zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging was performed during visual stimulation with food zzso and low zzso and nonfood zzso 

zzso show acute and long-term effects in the amygdala, the zzso cortex, and the zzso zzso zzso area for the comparison of food and nonfood zzso For the comparison of high and low caloric pictures, pure acute effects in the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso could be observed as well as acute and long-term effects in the zzso
