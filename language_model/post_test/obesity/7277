The prevalence of zzso was higher with the zzso than the zzso cut points; absolute differences in the Chinese, Indonesian and Vietnamese were 6, 10 and zzso zzso and 10, 13 and zzso zzso zzso The prevalence of overweight was more consistent zzso differences were zzso except for the zzso Chinese and Indonesian children (from 2 to zzso zzso of zzso (from zzso to zzso varied by age, sex and zzso The consistency was gradually improving from the Vietnamese to Indonesians and to Chinese boys and girls, from girls to boys, from the younger to older boys and from the older to younger zzso
