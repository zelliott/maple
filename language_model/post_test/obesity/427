zzso is an zzso involved in body weight and food intake regulation whose promoter region presents zzso islands that could be subject to dynamic zzso This zzso process could be affected by environmental zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factors, and could influence zzso zzso gene zzso The aim of this article was to study whether a zzso diet may affect zzso gene promoter zzso in zzso A group of zzso male zzso rats were assigned into two dietary groups, one fed on a control diet for 11 weeks and the other on a high-fat cafeteria zzso zzso fed a zzso diet become overweight and zzso as compared to the zzso DNA isolated from zzso zzso was treated with zzso and a zzso portion of zzso promoter (from zzso to zzso zzso including 13 zzso sites was amplified by zzso and zzso The studied promoter portion was slightly more zzso in the zzso animals, which was statistically significant zzso zzso for one of the zzso sites zzso at the position zzso In obese rats, such zzso was associated to lower circulating zzso levels, suggesting that this position could be important in the regulation of zzso gene zzso probably by being a target sequence of different zzso zzso Our findings zzso for the first time, that zzso zzso pattern can be influenced by zzso zzso and suggest that zzso mechanisms could be involved in obesity by regulating the expression of important zzso zzso
