In animal studies, increased amounts of zzso associated with skeletal muscle zzso correlate with reduced skeletal muscle and whole body insulin zzso The aim of this study was to test this relationship in zzso zzso were 38 zzso male zzso Indians zzso age 28 zzso 1 zzso zzso sensitivity at zzso zzso and zzso zzso insulin levels was assessed by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined by indirect zzso before and during insulin zzso zzso was determined in zzso zzso muscles obtained by zzso zzso Percentage of body fat zzso 29 zzso zzso range zzso was measured by underwater zzso In simple zzso negative relationships were found between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso range zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso disposal zzso zzso zzso and zzso at zzso and zzso insulin levels, respectively, both P zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso zzso was not related to any measure of zzso In multiple zzso measures of insulin resistance zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly related to zzso independent of all measures of obesity zzso of body fat, zzso zzso zzso In turn, all measures of obesity were related to the insulin resistance measures independent of zzso The obesity measures and zzso accounted for similar proportions of the zzso in insulin resistance in these zzso The results suggest that in this human population, as in animal models, skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity is strongly influenced by local supplies of zzso as well as by remote zzso and circulating zzso The zzso underlying the relationship between zzso and insulin action on skeletal muscle zzso synthesis may be central to an understanding of insulin zzso
