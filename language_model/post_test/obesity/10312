zzso zzso zzso zzso is valuable in diagnosing heart failure zzso but its utility in obese patients is zzso Studies have suggested a zzso of zzso or zzso 100 zzso for the diagnosis of zzso however, there is an inverse relation between zzso levels and body mass zzso We evaluated differential zzso for zzso in diagnosing acute zzso across body mass index levels to determine whether alternative zzso can improve zzso 

The zzso Not zzso zzso Study was a zzso prospective study of zzso patients who presented to the Emergency Department with acute zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured on zzso Height and weight data were available for zzso zzso The clinical diagnosis of zzso was adjudicated by 2 independent zzso who were blinded to zzso zzso 

Heart failure was the final diagnosis in zzso Mean zzso levels zzso in lean, zzso and zzso obese patients were zzso zzso and 247 for patients with acute zzso and 52, 35, and 25 in those without zzso respectively zzso zzso for all comparisons except 35 vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to maintain zzso sensitivity for a zzso diagnosis were 170 zzso for lean subjects, 110 zzso for zzso subjects, and 54 zzso in zzso obese zzso 

Body mass index influences the selection of zzso for zzso in diagnosing acute zzso A lower zzso zzso or zzso 54 zzso should be used in severely obese patients to preserve zzso A higher zzso in lean patients zzso or zzso 170 zzso could be used to increase zzso
