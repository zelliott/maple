This zzso trial occurred at four North American clinics in the Prevention Through zzso zzso Management, and Education zzso zzso received zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso during a zzso zzso treatment period and no treatment during a zzso follow-up zzso zzso measures included the zzso rate and zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

During the treatment year, zzso of zzso patients and zzso of zzso patients experienced a conversion to zzso a nearly significant zzso The hazard of conversion among zzso patients was about zzso times that among zzso patients, which also approached zzso In the follow-up year, the conversion rate did not differ significantly between zzso During treatment, the mean score for zzso positive symptoms improved more in the zzso group than in the zzso group, and the zzso zzso zzso mean score showed significantly greater improvement between weeks 8 and 28 with zzso The zzso patients gained significantly more weight zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso 

A significant treatment difference in the zzso rate was not zzso However, these results may be influenced by low zzso The nearly significant differences suggest that zzso might reduce the conversion rate and delay onset of zzso zzso was zzso for positive zzso symptoms but induced weight zzso Further treatment research in this phase of illness is zzso
