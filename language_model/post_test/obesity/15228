zzso growth factors related to basic zzso growth factor are major zzso of the cellular zzso composition of zzso zzso By providing and maintaining varying zzso of zzso in different fat zzso these factors contribute to the varying sizes and functions of different regions, including the zzso in appreciable zzso Thus, differing levels and activities of the zzso growth factors contribute to variations in zzso within the same individual and between individuals, in lean and obese zzso In contrast to regional differences in zzso which are accounted by factors resident in zzso zzso we believe that obesity results from a generalized energy zzso According to our concept, there are genetic variations in zzso activity and thus differing quantities of energy are zzso for zzso zzso In a zzso relationship, the higher the zzso activity, the lesser the energy available for chemical energy storage, mainly in the form of zzso in zzso At the extreme of zzso zzso a zzso in a gene related to a zzso protein would lead to appreciable zzso of zzso activity, with consequently the greatest quantity of energy remaining available for eventual zzso zzso Moreover, the new concept, for which we have have increasing experimental evidence, zzso a zzso zzso pathway, which would zzso the activity of the zzso
