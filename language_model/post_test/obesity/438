zzso is an independent predictor of increased morbidity and mortality in critically injured trauma zzso We hypothesized that obese patients in need of damage control zzso zzso will encounter an increase zzso of zzso complications with a zzso increase mortality when compared with a cohort of zzso zzso 

All adult trauma patients who underwent zzso during a zzso period at a Level I zzso Center were zzso zzso Patients were zzso into zzso zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso 29 zzso obese zzso zzso zzso and severely obese zzso or zzso 40 zzso zzso zzso measures included the occurrence of zzso infectious zzso failure of primary abdominal wall zzso closure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute zzso zzso multiple system organ failure, days of zzso support, hospital length of stay, and zzso 

During a zzso period, zzso adult trauma patients were admitted to our Level I zzso Center of which zzso zzso underwent emergent zzso Of these, 104 zzso were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso 51 zzso obese, zzso zzso 38 zzso and severely obese, zzso zzso 15 zzso In a zzso adjusted model, multiple system organ failure was zzso times more likely in severely obese zzso zzso zzso and zzso times more likely in the obese patients zzso zzso zzso when compared with patients with normal zzso after zzso zzso zzso In the severely obese patients undergoing zzso significantly elevated prevalence ratios zzso for development of zzso infectious zzso acute zzso zzso and failure of primary abdominal wall zzso closure were zzso zzso and zzso zzso Days of zzso support, length of stay, and mortality rates were significantly higher in severely obese patients (24 days, 27 days, and zzso compared with obese zzso days, 14 days, and zzso and zzso zzso days, 14 days, and zzso zzso 

Severe obesity was significantly associated with adverse outcomes and increased resource zzso in trauma patients treated with zzso zzso to improve outcomes in this vulnerable patient population must be directed at multiple levels of health zzso
