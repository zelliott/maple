The relationship of the extent and composition of coronary zzso and the degree of cardiac zzso to zzso indicators of abdominal zzso and the amount of zzso fat was investigated in a group of 32 forensic autopsy cases that consisted of sudden deaths from violent causes of previously healthy men under 40 years of zzso Body height and weight, waist and hip zzso and the thickness of the zzso and abdominal subcutaneous fat were zzso the body mass index zzso and zzso ratio zzso were zzso and zzso zzso and zzso fat deposits and the heart were zzso The degree of coronary narrowing was determined zzso and the extent of coronary zzso was measured by zzso The thickness of the zzso and zzso was measured by computerized image zzso zzso zzso foam cells and smooth muscle cells were detected by zzso zzso positive correlations were found between zzso and the overall degree of coronary narrowing and the zzso thicknesses of the left anterior descending artery and right coronary artery when adjusted for zzso zzso thickness was also related to zzso of zzso Heart weight zzso to height showed a significant positive correlation with zzso waist zzso zzso and the size of zzso fat deposits, of which zzso was the best predictor of mild cardiac zzso The results indicate that the severity of clinically silent zzso in the zzso regions of the coronary arteries is associated with zzso in young male individuals who also have mild zzso zzso associated with abdominal zzso and an zzso of zzso zzso These associations between fat distribution and early cardiovascular changes point to a powerful need for preventive action with respect to weight gain in young men to alleviate progression of the zzso
