zzso is related to an increase in the rates of cardiovascular zzso 

To establish the impact of obesity on vascular function zzso function and zzso zzso in children and adolescents and its relationship to cardiovascular risk zzso 

In obese zzso children and zzso zzso function and zzso zzso were evaluated by a pulse zzso method zzso zzso and index of digital volume zzso zzso Data were compared with the non-obese zzso group zzso mass zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso body fat percentage, zzso zzso zzso profile, zzso zzso and zzso parameters were determined in both zzso 

Body mass index, weight, waist zzso body fat, zzso and zzso were significantly higher in the zzso zzso The zzso group showed impaired zzso function zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 20; p zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso function was only zzso correlated with waist circumference and zzso in the zzso group, whereas a positive correlation was found between zzso and zzso 

This study shows that impaired vascular function is already present in zzso children and zzso The fact that obesity is associated with some markers of cardiovascular risk suggests the importance of early lifestyle interventions in this population to prevent cardiovascular zzso
