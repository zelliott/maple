Both chronic airway obstruction and obesity are increasing in prevalence but the effect of their combination on pulmonary function parameters across the range of airway obstruction is zzso 

We studied the impact of increasing zzso on zzso lung volumes and airway function in a cohort of zzso subjects from a large pulmonary function laboratory database who were 40 to 80 years of age and met GOLD zzso Initiative for zzso zzso Lung zzso zzso criteria for COPD zzso zzso zzso We also evaluated the influence of severity of airway obstruction (by GOLD zzso on these zzso 

With increasing zzso in the group as a whole, functional residual capacity, residual volume, zzso reserve volume, and specific airway resistance zzso decreased zzso (all P zzso total lung capacity (TLC) decreased zzso zzso zzso and zzso capacity zzso and zzso increased zzso zzso zzso However, vital capacity was not influenced zzso The effects of increasing zzso on zzso and zzso were greatest in GOLD stage zzso zzso zzso whereas increasing zzso had greater effects on zzso in GOLD stage I zzso zzso 

With increasing zzso subjects with airway obstruction had consistent reductions in lung zzso with significant improvements in zzso and the zzso zzso this effect was greatest in patients with the most severe airway zzso These results have important implications for the clinical assessment of patients with combined obesity and airway zzso
