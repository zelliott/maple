zzso zzso zzso zzso in the obese, often with severe clinical manifestations, is increasingly encountered in clinical zzso The association has drawn special interest as the zzso may be different from that seen in the zzso The disease poses special management problems in the obese as traditional conservative measures are seldom zzso zzso zzso zzso has been effective in zzso management but zzso in the obese raises concerns regarding zzso zzso morbidity and zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso in 101 limbs of 87 patients are zzso Clinical features, zzso test results, and outcome after zzso are reported with comparison to select relevant features in the non-obese limbs zzso zzso zzso that were zzso over the same 11 year zzso 

zzso clinical manifestations zzso were twice as common in the obese subset compared with the non-obese zzso vs zzso respectively, P zzso zzso the zzso increasing with zzso zzso and exercise zzso vein pressures were similar to the zzso zzso zzso of primary or zzso origin similar to those seen in non-obese limbs were detected by zzso ultrasound examination in zzso of zzso zzso by increased zzso pressure associated with obesity was likely the mechanism of obstruction in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be safe with no mortality zzso zzso low morbidity zzso zzso zzso in zzso high zzso zzso cumulative at five zzso and satisfactory clinical zzso zzso percent and zzso of limbs showed cumulative improvement in pain and swelling respectively at 5 1/2 years after zzso with zzso and zzso limbs achieving complete relief of these respective zzso Thirty of 45 limbs zzso zzso were free of zzso at four zzso 

The mechanism of zzso obstruction in the obese is substantially similar to those in the zzso zzso or zzso zzso as seen in non-obese zzso cases are present in zzso of cases per zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso pressure may be a factor in zzso zzso zzso zzso is a satisfactory clinical option in the obese with severe zzso manifestations requiring speedy zzso
