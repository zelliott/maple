zzso evidence supports a correlation between obesity and breast cancer in zzso zzso protein zzso plays an important role in energy zzso and zzso the actions of zzso zzso element binding zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso In zzso women, the zzso zzso element binding zzso regulation of zzso is a zzso of breast tumor formation through local production of zzso The present work aimed to examine the effect of zzso on zzso expression and identify additional mechanisms by which zzso zzso causes increased zzso expression in human breast zzso zzso zzso Treatment of human zzso zzso cells with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to mimic zzso zzso resulted in nuclear zzso of zzso zzso promoter II zzso activity zzso showed that zzso in addition to zzso treatment significantly increased zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso was examined by zzso zzso and zzso treatment was associated with increased binding to zzso Treatment of human zzso zzso cells with zzso significantly zzso zzso expression associated with nuclear zzso of zzso and increased binding of zzso to zzso zzso treatment significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso consistent with the decreased nuclear zzso of zzso and the decreased binding of zzso to zzso The expression and activity of the zzso protein zzso zzso was examined and found to be significantly decreased following either zzso or zzso zzso In contrast, zzso significantly increased zzso expression and zzso In conclusion, the regulation of zzso by zzso in response to the altered hormonal milieu associated with menopause and zzso provides a critical link between obesity and breast zzso
