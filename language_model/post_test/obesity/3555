Studies have demonstrated that early weaning can promote zzso syndrome during adulthood and that obesity increases zzso zzso Thus, we aimed to evaluate zzso status in a pharmacological early weaning zzso model programmed for zzso syndrome at zzso 

zzso zzso were randomly assigned into 2 groups: the early weaning group zzso which was treated zzso with zzso (1 zzso to inhibit zzso zzso for the last 3 days of zzso and the control group zzso which received the zzso zzso for the same time zzso The offspring were killed at 90 zzso and 180 zzso days after zzso 

Early weaning induced greater visceral zzso and zzso At zzso the zzso offspring showed zzso intolerance with zzso and increased plasma and liver zzso zzso and liver zzso zzso activities, which reduced the liver zzso but not the increased plasma zzso zzso However, the zzso offspring showed insulin resistance at zzso and increased plasma zzso zzso liver zzso zzso and zzso zzso These changes reduced the plasma and liver zzso levels, which aided in zzso architecture zzso Additionally, we observed that zzso 1 was zzso in the zzso group at zzso but the increased expression was not maintained through zzso which suggests zzso zzso conditions in the older zzso 

Despite the observed obesity and zzso zzso dysfunction, our data suggest that the early weaning programming induced by zzso can improve the zzso zzso status and may prevent liver damage during zzso
