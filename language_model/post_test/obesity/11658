In this study, plasma zzso of zzso molecular markers were investigated in 118 elderly persons with normal zzso function zzso 65 to 97 zzso who could manage their activities of daily living zzso by themselves, to find a strategy for conservation or zzso of zzso and quality of life zzso In all subjects, the frequency by which zzso markers exceeded their upper limit of normal range was zzso for zzso zzso complex zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso for soluble zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso inhibitor complex zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso or zzso 20 zzso The mean plasma levels of these markers were slightly higher than the upper limit of their normal zzso These markers were also investigated in samples of patients with and without cardiovascular risk factors and with and without cardiovascular diseases zzso heart disease and/or cerebral zzso Furthermore, the results were analyzed in relationships between cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factor or zzso The findings suggest that aging exerts a stronger influence on plasma levels of these zzso molecular markers than the presence of cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular zzso From the viewpoint for conservation or zzso of zzso and zzso in elderly zzso also other factor, such as drug zzso lifestyle, aging, and so on, must be considered to clarify the relationship between the plasma levels of the zzso molecular markers and cardiovascular risk factors or cardiovascular zzso
