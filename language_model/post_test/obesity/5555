To examine whether children and adolescents of zzso zzso are becoming centrally obese to a greater extent than would be predicted by their relative body zzso 

Two zzso surveys conducted in 1980 and zzso 

The samples selected for the 1980 and 1995 surveys comprised zzso and zzso male children, and zzso and zzso female children, respectively, with ages ranging from zzso to zzso zzso 

We measured four zzso thicknesses zzso zzso zzso zzso and calculated some zzso of fat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso and zzso zzso % showed a significant trend to a central pattern of fat distribution from 1980 to 1995, at the ages of zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso zzso % showed a significant trend to a central pattern of fat distribution from 1980 to 1995, at the ages of zzso and zzso zzso Similar results were obtained when we adjusted for zzso zzso 

We have observed a trend to a central pattern of zzso tissue distribution, especially in males and at the youngest ages studied zzso y in zzso and zzso y in zzso These observations were independent of trends in zzso
