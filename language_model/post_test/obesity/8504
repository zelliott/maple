Several methods of varying complexity are available for the measurement of in zzso insulin zzso in zzso No study has previously compared these in the same subjects to establish which is the most appropriate for routine zzso We have, therefore, compared four methods for measuring insulin zzso in zzso zzso clamp zzso zzso model zzso shortened intravenous zzso tolerance test zzso and continuous infusion of zzso with model assessment zzso zzso subjects with varying degrees of insulin sensitivity were zzso Seven normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso five obese zzso 38 zzso 5 zzso and five zzso subjects zzso 27 zzso 3 zzso were investigated, in a zzso fashion, on separate zzso First zzso and second phase zzso rate zzso zzso incremental insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso delta I) and steady state insulin levels from the last 30 minutes zzso from the zzso zzso 3 minute insulin concentration and incremental area under insulin zzso curve zzso zzso zzso and zzso function zzso from zzso were used as indicators of insulin zzso Each index of insulin zzso could detect an overall difference between the zzso zzso zzso in zzso and obese was similar but significantly increased compared to zzso In zzso zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso delta I zzso zzso zzso p zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso In obese zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso delta I zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso In addition zzso delta I also correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso In zzso zzso delta I correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso When all subjects from the three groups were combined, significant positive correlations were obtained between each index of insulin zzso In conclusion we have demonstrated that: zzso zzso zzso zzso model and zzso clamp can provide similar overall results for, in zzso zzso function in zzso zzso zzso positive correlations were obtained between each index of insulin zzso when all subjects were zzso zzso Using the above zzso insulin zzso in normal and obese appears similar but significantly increased compared to zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
