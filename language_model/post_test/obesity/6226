zzso zzso zzso 8) and zzso zzso zzso 6) adult zzso monkeys zzso zzso were assessed in terms of body size and distribution of body fat, zzso zzso and serum zzso insulin, and zzso zzso The weights of the obese monkeys were more than 2 zzso above the mean for their sex, while the zzso monkeys averaged less than zzso zzso from the zzso zzso males and females had excess body fat located predominantly in the abdominal zzso abdominal circumference was highly correlated with total body fat, as estimated by the isotope dilution method zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso zzso monkeys of both sexes had zzso zzso greater insulin response to zzso zzso administration, and marginally impaired zzso zzso zzso males had delayed zzso insulin response to zzso zzso zzso serum zzso also were elevated in the obese monkeys zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso zzso males had lower serum zzso levels than zzso males zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso zzso females had approximately zzso higher serum zzso zzso levels than the other zzso We conclude that obese male and female zzso monkeys have patterns of fat distribution and zzso abnormalities similar to those of humans with upper body zzso The contribution of differences in zzso metabolism to the development of obesity and its complications in zzso monkeys remain to be zzso
