The family of basic zzso zzso genes comprises zzso factors involved in many aspects of growth and zzso We have previously described two zzso zzso factors, zzso and zzso zzso named zzso and zzso The zzso and predicted protein sequences of zzso and zzso are zzso within their zzso domain where there are only three conservative zzso acid zzso During zzso zzso zzso and zzso share an overlapping but distinct pattern of expression in the developing nervous zzso To improve our understanding of the role of these genes during zzso we have generated mice containing targeted deletions of both genes and here describe our results for zzso Loss of zzso results in a disruption of the zzso axis in zzso Male zzso mice are zzso zzso and zzso with zzso in circulating zzso a zzso in zzso and a loss of zzso male sexual zzso Female zzso mice reared alone are zzso but when reared in the presence of zzso their zzso and zzso develop normally and they are zzso Both male and female zzso exhibit progressive zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso and lateral zzso zzso zzso and in the anterior lobe of the adult zzso Our results support a role for zzso in the onset of zzso and the regulation of body weight zzso
