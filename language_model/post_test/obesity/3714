The zzso hormone zzso 1 zzso is a G zzso zzso that regulates energy balance and body composition in animal zzso zzso effects of zzso zzso on energy zzso in humans may partly be attributable to environmental zzso 

We examined the effect of 4 single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso gene on body composition as well as zzso lifestyle factors zzso and physical zzso We also examined the effect of zzso interactions on body zzso 

A total of zzso participants zzso men and zzso zzso from the zzso Complex Diseases in the zzso zzso Environment and zzso zzso study were zzso by using zzso chemistry validated zzso Diet and physical activity were estimated by using validated frequency zzso and body composition was assessed by using zzso X-ray zzso 

Three zzso zzso zzso and zzso were associated with differences in zzso zzso (all P zzso There was an interaction between zzso and zzso intake on total mass and waist circumference (both P zzso zzso There was also an interaction between zzso and body mass index categories zzso weight, overweight, and zzso on energy zzso zzso zzso zzso A similar interaction was shown with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also observed between each of these zzso zzso zzso and zzso and physical activity score on zzso zzso (all P zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso in the zzso gene are associated with differences in body composition and interact with zzso and zzso lifestyle zzso
