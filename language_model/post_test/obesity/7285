zzso zzso is a predominantly zzso zzso protein with zzso activity that is regulated by zzso and zzso Recent zzso association studies identified zzso to be associated with zzso fat content and liver function, thus pointing to a possible involvement in the zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to examine the association between two common zzso in the zzso gene and parameters of zzso metabolism in zzso participants from eight independent zzso study populations including six zzso studies zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Rotterdam zzso zzso zzso the zzso Study as a healthy working population zzso zzso zzso and the Utah zzso zzso Study including a group of 1037 severely obese individuals zzso zzso 46 zzso and zzso controls from the same geographical region of zzso We observed a strong additive association of a common zzso zzso within zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso each copy of the minor zzso decreased levels of total cholesterol on average by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cholesterol levels by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and LDL cholesterol levels by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These associations remained significant after correction for multiple zzso We did not observe clear evidence for associations with HDL cholesterol or zzso zzso In conclusion, our study suggests that zzso is involved in the metabolism of zzso zzso
