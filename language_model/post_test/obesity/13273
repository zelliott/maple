zzso diabetes is a zzso disorder affecting zzso of women and is a predictor of zzso Type 2 diabetes zzso and cardiovascular zzso zzso resistance, a characteristic of zzso diabetes and zzso is correlated with the fatty acids profile of the red cell and skeletal muscle zzso We investigated the plasma and red cell fatty acid status of zzso zzso The effect of obesity on membrane fatty acids was also zzso 

zzso blood obtained at diagnosis was zzso for the fatty acids in plasma zzso zzso and red cell zzso and zzso zzso 

There were reductions in zzso acid zzso zzso vs zzso diabetes zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso vs zzso diabetes zzso zzso in the red cell zzso zzso in zzso zzso A similar pattern was found in the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso and zzso acids depletion in the red cell zzso zzso was much greater in zzso zzso diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with lean zzso diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Apparently normal plasma zzso zzso fatty acids profile in the zzso diabetic women suggested that membrane zzso zzso is associated specifically with zzso in the zzso The fact that the zzso zzso is more pronounced in the outer leaflet of the membrane where most of zzso binding and zzso activities take place might provide an explanation for the increased insulin resistance in zzso diabetes and zzso
