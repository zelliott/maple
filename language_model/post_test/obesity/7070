To determine which clinical measure of childhood obesity should be monitored to best reflect change in zzso in a weight management zzso and estimate the degree of change needed to be relatively certain of fat zzso 

92 obese children with a mean zzso age of zzso zzso years and a mean body mass index standard zzso score zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso attending a zzso clinic on a regular, 3 monthly zzso 

zzso of weight and height measured up to zzso years apart used to derive zzso as zzso and adjusted for age and gender to give weight and zzso zzso zzso zzso using British 1990 Growth zzso zzso zzso zzso estimated by zzso measured by a zzso zzso body composition zzso 

Changes in zzso scores, compared to zzso weight and weight zzso most accurately reflected loss of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso equate to expected mean falls in total body fat percentage of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Approximate zzso prediction intervals indicated that a fall in zzso zzso of at least zzso over zzso months (or zzso over zzso zzso is consistent with actual fat zzso 

Change in zzso score best reflects percentage fat loss compared to zzso weight and weight zzso The wide variation in likely percentage fat loss for a given zzso zzso reduction means a loss of zzso is required to be relatively certain of zzso percentage fat zzso
