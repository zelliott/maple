To assess the effect of various interventions for weight loss on measures of asthma control and weight loss amongst overweight or obese patients with chronic zzso 

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group's Specialized Register of Trials zzso zzso from systematic searches of zzso databases, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials zzso (The Cochrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of respiratory journals and meeting zzso We also searched ongoing trials web sites and dissertation databases up to March zzso We contacted experts in the field and searched reference lists for additional zzso 

We included zzso controlled trials zzso of weight loss interventions for overweight or obese participants with asthma compared to either no intervention for weight loss or an alternative weight loss zzso 

Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data using a data extraction zzso We did not undertake any zzso as there were no suitable data to zzso 

We included four completed studies conducted amongst adults zzso zzso zzso Two were published as zzso and two as full zzso zzso included supervised physical activity, low calorie diet and zzso drugs zzso or in zzso and were compared to usual care zzso zzso low calorie diet (one zzso while one study had three intervention arms (physical activity versus low calorie diet versus a combination of the zzso Two studies were conducted in high-income countries, while two were conducted in zzso middle-income zzso studies had an unclear risk of selection and a high risk of detection zzso One of the studies found a statistically significant reduction in symptoms scores in treatment compared to control groups: the difference between groups in total zzso George's Respiratory zzso zzso score was zzso units zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso One study showed reduction in doses of rescue medication in treatment compared with control groups in the short zzso Weight loss was associated with some improvement in forced zzso volume in 1 second zzso and forced vital capacity zzso in one study, which was statistically zzso but clinically zzso there was no improvement in peak zzso flow rate zzso No data were reported on health care zzso and adverse zzso One study reported statistically significant weight loss in the treatment group compared to controls with no intervention, which was still significant at one year zzso 

zzso for practice This review found one zzso trial that showed that weight loss may be beneficial for improving asthma control in overweight and obese patients, in conjunction with weight loss in intervention groups in the short zzso zzso the zzso system to the results of this review however, shows that the quality of evidence is low, because although all four studies are zzso there were serious zzso limitations in the studies zzso risk of selection bias and high risk of detection zzso and zzso zzso sample zzso There is inadequate evidence to comment on the effect of weight loss interventions on quality of life and health care zzso In addition, there was inadequate reporting of data on adverse effects to permit proper balancing of harms and benefits of the zzso On account of this low quality of evidence, the benefit of weight loss as an intervention for asthma control remains uncertain, and as such, clinicians should be prepared to help patients to make a decision that is consistent with their own zzso for research The finding that most of the included studies were of low zzso quality highlights the need for further well designed zzso with emphasis on adequate methods of allocation sequence generation as well as allocation zzso and longer follow-up zzso These studies need to report more fully on relevant outcomes (both statistically significant and zzso such zzso asthma zzso use of rescue medication, change in lung function parameters zzso zzso zzso hospital zzso quality of life, and adverse zzso There is also a need for longer intervention as well as follow-up zzso to evaluate the effect of sustained measures to achieve weight loss, and to determine if these effects are still significantly present after a considerable period of zzso is also a need for these well designed studies in children and zzso as well as in low-income countries such as Africa, where the zzso low energy zzso as well as structured physical zzso interventions zzso in these included studies, may not be feasible or zzso
