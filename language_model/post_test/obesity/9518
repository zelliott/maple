zzso binding and action on zzso incorporation into zzso were studied in freshly isolated zzso from control, obese, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding was reduced in the obese animals from zzso zzso zzso in the controls of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The change in binding was due to a decrease in zzso number with no change in zzso zzso the obese animal for 48 h restored the zzso zzso binding and the zzso number to control zzso zzso zzso of insulin caused an zzso stimulation of net zzso incorporation into zzso above the zzso level of zzso zzso zzso zzso incorporated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso In obese zzso than 500 zzso animals the maximum insulin response measured by percent increase above zzso zzso was reduced, and the zzso zzso zzso was zzso When the obese animals were zzso the zzso and maximum insulin responses were further depressed, but the zzso was restored to control zzso In conclusion, zzso from obese animals show both a zzso and zzso zzso zzso the animals restores the zzso status to normal, but the zzso zzso zzso zzso
