This study aimed to document for the first time in a general population of French children the prevalence and levels of cardiovascular risk factors and to assess separately in boys and girls whether these risk factors were associated with fat mass distribution independently of subcutaneous overall zzso A zzso analysis of baseline data from zzso children zzso boys and 217 zzso aged 8 to 17 years included in a 1999 zzso zzso study (the zzso zzso zzso zzso II zzso was zzso zzso was defined according to the International zzso Task Force references and the 90th zzso of the French body mass index zzso The thresholds of parameters defining cardiovascular and zzso risks were the 95th zzso of the Task Force Report on High Blood zzso in Children and zzso for blood pressure and those of the American Academy of zzso for zzso zzso and biological parameters were described by sex and according to overweight zzso zzso correlations between cardiovascular risk factors and zzso measures of zzso zzso mass index, sum of 4 zzso zzso waist zzso zzso zzso were zzso Then, these correlations were additionally adjusted for the sum of 4 zzso zzso High plasma zzso high insulin zzso and low plasma zzso zzso cholesterol zzso concentration were associated with all measures of zzso zzso or zzso zzso P zzso When obese children were zzso overweight children already had high zzso and low zzso levels, respectively, 2 and 20 times more frequently than zzso children zzso Among overweight children, zzso had at least 2 risk factors among high blood pressure, high plasma zzso or zzso and low zzso concentration vs zzso among zzso children zzso zzso zzso After adjusting for the sum of zzso an independent association between the risk factors and waist circumference was found in zzso In conclusion, zzso modest excess weight is associated with increased levels of cardiovascular risk zzso zzso In girls, abdominal fat distribution is associated with cardiovascular risk factors, independently of overall zzso zzso International definition of abdominal obesity in children is required to zzso studies and to progress in the evaluation of childhood obesity and its zzso
