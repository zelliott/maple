Although mast cell functions have classically been related to allergic responses, recent studies indicate that these cells contribute to other common diseases such as multiple zzso zzso arthritis, zzso zzso aneurysm and zzso This study presents evidence that mast cells also contribute to zzso obesity and zzso For example, white zzso tissue zzso from obese humans and mice contain more mast cells than zzso from their lean zzso Furthermore, in the context of mice on a Western diet, genetically induced zzso of mast cells, or their pharmacological stabilization, reduces body weight gain and levels of inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso in serum and zzso in concert with improved zzso zzso and energy zzso zzso studies reveal that mast cells contribute to zzso and muscle zzso and associated cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso transfer experiments of zzso mast cells show that these cells, by producing zzso zzso and zzso zzso contribute to mouse zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso thereby promoting zzso obesity and zzso zzso Our results showing reduced obesity and diabetes in mice treated with clinically available mast zzso agents suggest the potential of developing new therapies for these common human zzso zzso
