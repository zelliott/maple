This study addressed the long-term effect of various zzso particularly zzso zzso on zzso function on participants with or without type 2 zzso 

In the zzso zzso zzso zzso Controlled Trial zzso zzso participants zzso 51 years; zzso zzso zzso 31 zzso mean estimated zzso zzso rate zzso zzso zzso zzso mean urine zzso ratio, zzso with serum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso were zzso to zzso Mediterranean, or zzso zzso The zzso compliance was zzso and the proportion of protein intake significantly increased to zzso of energy only in the zzso diet zzso zzso zzso low-fat and zzso We examined changes in urinary zzso and zzso estimated by zzso of Diet in Renal Disease and zzso zzso Disease zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso within zzso improvements in zzso were achieved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mediterranean zzso zzso and low-fat diets zzso zzso with similar magnitude zzso zzso across diet zzso The increased zzso was at least as prominent in participants with zzso or without zzso type 2 diabetes or those with lower baseline zzso function of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso 60 zzso zzso zzso In a multivariable model adjusted for age, sex, diet group, type 2 diabetes, use of zzso zzso zzso weight loss, and change in protein intake zzso and zzso zzso only a decrease in zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso P zzso were independently associated with increased zzso The urine zzso ratio improved similarly across the zzso particularly among participants with baseline zzso zzso with a mean change of zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso diet is as safe as Mediterranean or low-fat diets in zzso zzso function among moderately obese participants with or without type 2 diabetes, with baseline serum zzso zzso zzso Potential improvement is likely to be zzso by weight zzso improvements in insulin sensitivity and blood zzso
