Academic zzso zzso 

A total of zzso women were classified into three groups: zzso healthy control women zzso zzso zzso zzso women who were positive for zzso risk zzso and zzso women with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso 

zzso levels, zzso ratio, body mass index, and clinical and/or zzso presentations of zzso 

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, used to predict zzso for the zzso ratio, showed similar diagnostic performance to total T and average zzso zzso The zzso ratio exhibits greater observed accuracy than total T and average zzso volume for evaluation of women with zzso or zzso An zzso ratio zzso presented the best combination of sensitivity and zzso Body mass index was positively correlated with total T in zzso and zzso zzso however, body mass index was zzso correlated with zzso in zzso but showed no correlation in zzso zzso 

The zzso ratio is a valuable diagnostic tool in evaluating women with zzso and zzso or zzso and an zzso ratio zzso may be used as a decision zzso The link between body mass index and zzso may provide clues for further understanding the pathological milieu of zzso
