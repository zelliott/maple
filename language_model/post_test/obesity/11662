To investigate whether zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene are associated with obesity in Japanese zzso 

zzso study of participants from a rural town located within 50 zzso northeast of Tokyo based on school medical zzso 

zzso Japanese schoolchildren zzso boys and 262 zzso who were zzso y old with a mean age of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

DNA was extracted from whole blood and zzso by zzso zzso weight and blood pressure were measured in school medical zzso Total cholesterol, zzso and zzso zzso were measured by an zzso zzso index, body mass index zzso and zzso concentration were calculated by the respective zzso 

In zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the number of obese subjects with zzso or zzso zzso was significantly higher than that of the non-obese subjects zzso zzso The obesity index of subjects with the zzso or zzso zzso was significantly higher than that of those with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, after adjustments for age and zzso zzso of subjects with the zzso or zzso zzso was significantly higher than that of those with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, no significant differences were observed in the clinical characteristics among the zzso groups of the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso gene appears to be a genetic risk factor for obesity in Japanese children, but zzso zzso of the zzso gene does not appear to be associated with zzso
