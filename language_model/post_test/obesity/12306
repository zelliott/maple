Previous reports have described favorable changes in the relationship between zzso blood pressure and age in recent birth zzso The obesity epidemic might threaten that zzso 

To update analyses of differences between birth zzso in the relationship between zzso blood pressure and age and to determine whether increases in obesity have had adverse zzso 

We examined the zzso blood pressure zzso across birth zzso born between 1890 and 1990 in zzso participants, aged zzso years, in the National Health (and zzso zzso zzso between 1960 and zzso We zzso that zzso 10th, 25th, zzso zzso and 90th zzso of zzso blood pressure had decreased in more recent versus earlier zzso and that this pattern had slowed or reversed recently due, at least in part, to zzso 

After adjusting for zzso race, age and zzso the 10th, 25th, zzso zzso and 90th zzso of zzso blood pressure were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso lower for each decade more recently born (all P zzso zzso terms for birth cohort were positive and significant zzso zzso across all zzso consistent with a decelerating cohort zzso zzso of this zzso was observed for body mass index ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso at all zzso 

More recent zzso born in the United States between 1890 and 1990 have had smaller increases in zzso blood pressure with zzso At any age, their zzso blood pressure zzso are shifted lower relative to earlier zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the median zzso blood pressure per decade translates into zzso zzso over zzso decades, a shift that would contribute zzso to lower rates of cardiovascular zzso These favorable changes are zzso perhaps zzso at least in part, to the obesity zzso
