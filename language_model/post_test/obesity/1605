zzso and an organic extract of zzso zzso were tested in zzso and in zzso for their zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso cells were cultured under zzso and zzso conditions zzso An in zzso animal model confirmed the biological activities of zzso and the organic extract observed in the studies in zzso 

The zzso index of zzso cells cultured under zzso conditions was significantly increased in cells exposed to the organic extract and zzso relative to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene expressions were significantly increased by the organic extract and zzso Similarly, the extract and zzso resulted in an increase in respiratory rate and zzso membrane potential under zzso zzso zzso increased insulin zzso zzso while it zzso total cholesterol, zzso zzso index, zzso and zzso levels in an obese rat zzso 

The results provide evidence that zzso a constituent of zzso zzso zzso diabetic zzso
