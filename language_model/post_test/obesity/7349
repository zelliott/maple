zzso resistance is an underlying mechanism of zzso zzso We attempted to determine the association between physical activity and insulin resistance in Iranian zzso 

The data of the third national Surveillance of zzso zzso of zzso Diseases zzso in Iran were zzso We ran the Global Physical zzso zzso zzso over a nationally representative sample of zzso zzso Total physical activity zzso was calculated using zzso zzso zzso for intensity of physical zzso zzso resistance was measured by the zzso model assessment of insulin resistance zzso 

When physical activity was classified into high, moderate, and low categories, zzso values significantly increased from the high category to the moderate and low categories zzso After adjustment for age, area of residence, smoking, and body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso in males and zzso zzso in zzso duration of zzso activity zzso zzso in males and zzso zzso in zzso duration of zzso activity zzso zzso in males and zzso zzso in zzso and the time spent on sedentary behaviors zzso zzso in males and zzso zzso in zzso were significantly correlated to zzso The prevalence of physical zzso increased zzso with increasing zzso zzso 

Our findings indicate a significant relationship between physical zzso and insulin zzso For communities in a transition phase of lifestyle, encouraging physical activity may help prevent insulin resistance and its adverse zzso
