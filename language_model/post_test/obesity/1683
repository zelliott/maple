zzso and contact zzso were used to study the influence of body mass index zzso on the lowering of skin temperature caused by zzso zzso 

The study was performed using the zzso Camera zzso Type 470 and zzso The zzso of the chosen regions of interests were performed before and immediately after zzso zzso in a research room outside a zzso chamber where the temperature was zzso As an additional measurement technique during zzso zzso contact zzso was performed using zzso zzso stacked to the skin zzso 

The results obtained showed differences in the decrease of skin temperature of predetermined body zzso The largest temperature decrease was observed on the lower zzso Some differences in the zzso response of similar body parts influenced by the extremely low temperature, with regard to the zzso of volunteers, were zzso This was also found in the results of contact zzso zzso The statistical analysis confirmed the results of zzso and zzso zzso 

The magnitude of skin temperature decrease due to the extremely low temperature used in zzso zzso may be connected to a patient's zzso
