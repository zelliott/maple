We have previously shown that sex and obesity independently affect zzso very low density zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the effect of zzso on zzso zzso in lean and obese men and women zzso zzso 6 in each zzso zzso zzso were measured during zzso zzso conditions and during zzso infusion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by using zzso zzso injection in conjunction with zzso modeling zzso zzso zzso zzso in plasma was greater in obese than in lean men zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso but was not different in lean and obese women zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso infusion decreased the zzso zzso rate by approximately 50% in lean and obese men and in lean women (to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso all P zzso but had no effect on the zzso zzso rate in obese women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that both sex and zzso affect the regulation of zzso zzso zzso and insulin decrease zzso production in both lean men and lean zzso obesity is associated with resistance to the zzso and zzso suppression of zzso zzso in women, but not in zzso
