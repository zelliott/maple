zzso zzso zzso is selectively expressed in skeletal muscle of zzso and humans, and in brown zzso tissue zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso induced a decrease in zzso membrane potential suggesting that zzso behaves as an zzso of zzso zzso zzso food restriction and zzso affect zzso zzso expression differently in zzso compared to zzso The effects induced by zzso and zzso in zzso and by zzso in muscle, might be explained by changes in zzso free fatty acids zzso A single bout of exercise or endurance training, respectively, increases or decreases muscle zzso zzso The effects of zzso zzso and zzso on BAT and muscle zzso zzso expression are also zzso zzso to explain the effects of these zzso are zzso
