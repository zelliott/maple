Plasma zzso of zinc and copper were measured in 15 obese patients before zzso bypass surgery, in 27 patients after zzso bypass surgery, and in 52 lean control zzso zzso the obese patients had zinc zzso that were significantly lower than in the lean control subjects zzso zzso 3 versus 89 zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso and copper levels that were significantly higher zzso zzso 10 versus 119 zzso 3 zzso After zzso zzso plasma zinc and copper zzso were significantly lower zzso 62 zzso 2 zzso copper, 90 zzso 5 zzso P less than zzso than in zzso zzso One patient developed zzso associated with a plasma copper concentration of 36 zzso zzso count and plasma copper level rose with oral copper zzso replacement zzso zzso bypass surgery may produce clinically significant decreases in plasma zzso of zinc and zzso zzso observation and replacement therapy are indicated in all patients who develop zzso after zzso bypass zzso
