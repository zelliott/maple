zzso plasma concentration of zzso remnants may be zzso related to zzso in zzso We examined the effect of zzso on zzso remnant metabolism in 25 obese men with zzso A zzso emulsion labeled with zzso zzso was injected zzso into zzso the fractional zzso rate zzso of the zzso emulsion was determined by measurement of zzso in the breath and analyzed using zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso significantly decreased the plasma zzso of total cholesterol, zzso LDL cholesterol, zzso B zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso both decreased significantly by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso emulsion increased significantly from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The decrease in zzso was associated with the decrease in plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Furthermore, the change in zzso of zzso zzso was zzso associated with the change in zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso suggesting removal of LDL and zzso remnants by similar zzso zzso zzso We conclude that in obese subjects, zzso of cholesterol synthesis with zzso decreases the plasma zzso of both zzso and zzso remnants and that this may be partially due to an enhancement in zzso clearance of these zzso
