To develop a probability chart of adult overweight based on childhood body mass index zzso values and to evaluate the zzso change during the zzso rebound period during childhood, in different zzso with the use of risk function zzso 

A zzso growth study of zzso zzso healthy Swedish children followed from birth to 18 years of zzso Weight and height values of our subjects were zzso 

A probability chart for reaching a zzso 23 zzso at 18 years of age was constructed for boys and zzso For example, a zzso of 18 zzso at 4 years of age is associated with zzso probability of attaining a zzso 23 zzso at 18 years of age in zzso a zzso of 16 zzso at 4 years of age leads to zzso probability of having a zzso 23 zzso at 18 years of age in zzso Children with an obvious zzso rebound before 8 years of age have a high risk of being overweight at 18 years of zzso There is a clear trend of zzso increase from the 1970s to the 1990s in zzso children from a parallel zzso and Hispanic children are at the highest risk of adult zzso 

The probability chart for adult overweight developed here provides a functional method of defining childhood obesity that is based on the risk of long-term ill health rather than on a certain statistical zzso zzso It will help zzso or zzso workers identify those children who are at a high risk of becoming overweight in adulthood, which will allow clinical intervention at younger zzso
