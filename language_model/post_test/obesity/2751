The formation of an end zzso in obese patients can be technically demanding and often requires the creation of a particularly large zzso in the abdominal zzso This is because of the thickness of the subcutaneous fat and zzso fat, and increased resistance or friction while negotiating the zzso and zzso through the abdominal zzso 

The use of an Alexis zzso zzso to zzso retract the abdominal wall zzso and, thus decrease resistance or friction during zzso formation, is described (see Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1 and 2, which demonstrates the technique, zzso and zzso 

This technique has been used in eight obese patients who have undergone end zzso zzso In each patient, the efficacy of the wound protector was immediately obvious, resulting in a smaller than usual zzso in the abdominal wall and less trauma to the zzso 

The use of a wound protector has decreased the size of the abdominal wall zzso necessary for zzso creation in obese patients and hopefully will decrease the risk and rate of zzso zzso zzso
