zzso fatty liver disease zzso has been described in adult zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, chronic liver disease can be associated with significant changes in levels of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, the effect of liver zzso on the zzso production has not been investigated zzso 

To explore whether zzso zzso and/or levels of zzso zzso ALS and zzso could be altered in obese patients in relation to the presence of liver zzso 

A total of 115 obese patients zzso 30) were enrolled in the protocol (65 patients with liver zzso and 50 zzso and zzso zzso In all patients, the following parameters were zzso serum levels of zzso insulin, the zzso index, zzso zzso zzso ALS and zzso after zzso and zzso stimulation zzso 

As expected, patients with zzso had blood zzso insulin, zzso significantly higher than controls, indicating a more severe zzso state in zzso Furthermore, patients with zzso had higher levels of zzso and zzso and lower zzso peak and zzso levels as compared to zzso No difference was found in ALS levels between the zzso In a zzso analysis, zzso was positively associated with zzso zzso while IGF-1 was zzso associated with zzso zzso 

This study demonstrates that in patients with zzso the zzso levels are increased, and that the zzso axis is significantly altered probably leading to reduced zzso zzso at tissue zzso
