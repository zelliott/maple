Little is known about the influence of different training types on relative fat zzso with zzso The purpose of this study was to analyze the changes induced by zzso training zzso resistance zzso or a combination of both zzso on total fat mass zzso and regional fat mass zzso Further, the relative contribution of different regions, upper limbs zzso lower limbs zzso and trunk zzso were zzso 

zzso overweight and zzso women were zzso in either zzso zzso or zzso All training groups exercised for the same duration zzso zzso 3 times per week for 5 zzso Body composition was estimated using dual energy X-ray zzso 

zzso decreased significantly in all groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso groups zzso P zzso The relative contribution of zzso into each segment changed zzso zzso represented zzso zzso zzso of zzso at baseline and reduced to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Training type did not influence changes of zzso and zzso Fat zzso came predominantly from zzso in all training zzso These findings suggest that overweight and obese women can reduce zzso and zzso independently of training zzso
