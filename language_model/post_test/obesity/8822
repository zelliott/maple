Clinical aspects of diabetes and obesity are somewhat different, even at similar levels of insulin zzso The purpose of this study was to determine differences in body fat distribution and serum zzso zzso in diabetic and zzso obese zzso We were also interested in identifying the characteristics of insulin resistance in these two groups, particularly from the standpoint of zzso 

zzso zzso of 112 type 2 diabetic obese participants and 124 zzso obese participants were zzso zzso zzso tissue areas and zzso skeletal muscle areas were measured by zzso zzso A zzso model assessment of the insulin resistance score was calculated to assess insulin zzso The relationships among serum zzso body fat distribution, and clinical characteristics were also zzso 

Both abdominal subcutaneous and visceral fat areas were higher in the zzso obese group, whereas zzso zzso muscle area was higher in the diabetic obese zzso The zzso model assessment of the insulin resistance score was similar between groups, whereas serum zzso was lower in the diabetic obese zzso zzso visceral fat zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso was a more important predictor of zzso concentration than zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso in cases of zzso zzso whereas zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso was a better predictor of zzso level than abdominal visceral fat zzso zzso - zzso p zzso zzso in diabetic obese zzso 

zzso factors involved in zzso including different serum zzso levels and body fat zzso are believed to be responsible for differences in clinical zzso even at similar levels of insulin resistance in both zzso
