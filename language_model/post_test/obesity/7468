The significant deterioration of insulin sensitivity and zzso tolerance during pregnancy can have serious health implications for both the pregnant woman and her zzso Although it is well established that regular exercise benefits insulin sensitivity in the zzso population, the effect on zzso tolerance in obese pregnant women is not zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a supervised zzso zzso exercise zzso beginning at week 18 of zzso on zzso tolerance and zzso fitness in previously sedentary obese zzso 

Twelve sedentary obese women were zzso into an exercise zzso zzso or control zzso zzso group at 18 weeks of zzso Those zzso to zzso engaged in 10 weeks of supervised home-based exercise (three sessions a week of stationary zzso while those in the zzso group maintained their usual daily zzso Their zzso and insulin responses to an oral zzso tolerance test zzso as well as their zzso zzso were assessed both zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso tolerance in the zzso but not zzso group was indicated by a tendency zzso towards higher blood zzso levels at zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, at zzso of the zzso zzso blood zzso tended to remain elevated from baseline in the zzso zzso There was also a trend towards increased fitness in the zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso 

Regular zzso exercise begun during pregnancy may have zzso effects on zzso tolerance and fitness in obese women, and warrants further investigation in a larger sample zzso
