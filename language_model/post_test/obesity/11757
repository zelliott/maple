zzso and zzso are two classes of drugs currently used in the treatment of zzso and insulin resistance zzso zzso Whereas zzso are insulin zzso acting via zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso exert their zzso activity via zzso To determine whether zzso zzso also improve insulin sensitivity, we measured the capacity of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and the new compound zzso in two zzso models of high fat zzso zzso zzso or genetic zzso zzso zzso zzso At doses yielding serum zzso shown to activate selectively zzso these compounds markedly lowered zzso and, when present, zzso in both animal zzso This effect relied on the improvement of insulin action on zzso zzso as indicated by a lower insulin peak in response to zzso zzso in zzso zzso obese zzso zzso In addition, zzso treatment prevented high fat zzso increase of body weight and zzso tissue mass without influencing caloric zzso The specificity for zzso zzso in zzso was demonstrated by marked zzso in the expression of zzso target zzso whereas zzso target gene zzso levels did not change in treated zzso These results indicate that compounds with a selective zzso zzso profile reduce insulin resistance without having adverse effects on body weight and zzso tissue mass in animal models of zzso
