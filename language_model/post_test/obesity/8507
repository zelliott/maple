It has been proposed that zzso may not constitute a cardiovascular risk in women, and that the zzso risk profile is less apparent in women than in zzso In two different studies, we have assessed the zzso between classical coronary risk factors in women with zzso essential hypertension and looked for possible zzso zzso zzso women zzso 156 zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in study I turned out to be overweight and had nearly three times higher zzso serum insulin levels than the zzso control subjects zzso 118 zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso women with a body mass index zzso above 25 zzso had significant higher insulin levels than zzso women with a zzso less than 25 zzso and when adjusting for zzso the zzso difference in insulin levels was zzso In zzso women, the serum insulin level correlated positively to the zzso and zzso In study II, insulin was positively associated with the zzso blood pressure in zzso women zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso 29), and a negative correlation appeared between the zzso ratio and the zzso as well as zzso blood zzso No difference was observed in zzso and insulin between zzso and zzso women zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso women, zzso zzso inhibitor zzso levels were higher and the zzso zzso zzso time prolonged compared to zzso zzso zzso was positively correlated to insulin and zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso cholesterol in zzso zzso Strong associations between potential cardiovascular risk factors seem to be present even in zzso women with mild hypertension, with insulin being correlated to hypertension, zzso zzso activity, zzso and HDL zzso
