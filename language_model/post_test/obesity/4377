We previously reported that zzso develops in obese, zzso diabetic zzso mice fed a high-fat zzso diet for 12 zzso We now report earlier onset of zzso in relation to zzso zzso and clarify the roles of dietary fat and bodily zzso zzso on zzso severity, liver injury and inflammatory recruitment in this novel zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice were fed a zzso diet or zzso and zzso characteristics and liver zzso were studied at 2, 6, 12 and 24 zzso 

After 12 weeks zzso zzso mice were obese and diabetic with approximately zzso reduction in serum zzso zzso developed at this time, corresponding to a plateau in zzso expansion and increased zzso zzso Liver zzso showed mild inflammation and zzso zzso as well as zzso By 24 weeks, zzso zzso mice developed severe zzso (marked zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas dietary and genetic controls showed only simple zzso While zzso was associated with zzso zzso indicated by increased fatty acid zzso activity, zzso was associated with significantly higher levels of zzso indicating active fatty acid zzso possibly under the influence of zzso zzso zzso 

In mice genetically predisposed to obesity and diabetes, zzso feeding leads to restriction of zzso tissue for accommodation of excess energy, causing zzso zzso into liver, and transformation of simple zzso to zzso zzso The way in which zzso feeding zzso zzso stores, decreases serum zzso and causes zzso inflammation in zzso may provide clues to zzso of NASH in zzso zzso
