We have investigated the possible involvement of zzso zzso in the maintenance of hypertension in aged lean and obese zzso rats using the type II zzso zzso zzso At 8 zzso of age, the start of the study, obese zzso had been zzso for at least 2 zzso zzso blood zzso 153 zzso 4 zzso 136 zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and were zzso zzso zzso 98 zzso 193 zzso 61 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 83 zzso 260 zzso 97 zzso zzso zzso compared to their lean zzso There were no differences in plasma zzso activity between lean and obese animals and plasma zzso activity was unaffected by any zzso zzso treatment of obese rats with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 9 zzso resulted in a gradual reduction in zzso to lean levels by day zzso zzso treatment did not affect plasma insulin or zzso levels but resulted in a significant reduction in plasma zzso zzso zzso was without significant effect on zzso blood pressure in lean zzso zzso treatment of lean rats with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 9 zzso resulted in a rise in zzso blood pressure to levels similar to obese zzso after 9 zzso Plasma insulin levels were unchanged but zzso zzso was significantly zzso Plasma zzso levels were increased from zzso zzso 3 to 802 zzso 68 zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that raised zzso and zzso may be factors contributing to hypertension in zzso
