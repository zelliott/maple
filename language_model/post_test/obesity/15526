zzso and zzso of zzso binding sites were investigated in rat zzso using zzso as a zzso zzso specific binding was found in high amounts in rat zzso zzso This binding was specific, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso was slowly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso From zzso experiments, a single class of zzso binding sites for zzso was identified with an apparent zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso of 45 zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso binding was inhibited in a zzso manner by cold zzso and was highly selective since not zzso by a number of other hormones or zzso zzso experiments performed on adult rat kidney sections showed the intense presence of zzso receptors only in specific areas of the zzso inner zzso and also consistent labeling associated with vascular structures in the zzso zzso The study of the zzso zzso expression of zzso receptors in the kidney showed very low expression during the early zzso period zzso zzso Full expression of zzso sites was achieved at about 30 days and remained stable throughout adulthood zzso days and zzso Moreover, in zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a significant and rapid zzso effect in normally hydrated conscious zzso Thus, these data constitute the first characterization and mapping of zzso specific binding sites in the rat kidney and raise the possibility of a zzso control by zzso
