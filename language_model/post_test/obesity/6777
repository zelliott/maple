To address molecular mechanisms underlying obesity development, we examined patterns of critical zzso hormones, zzso and zzso zzso over zzso 

Plasma zzso and zzso were measured in 80 Mexican-American children at birth and again at 2, 5, and 9 years from the ongoing prospective cohort followed by the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of zzso zzso We used a mixture modeling approach to identify patterns in zzso zzso from birth to 9 zzso 

zzso was positively related to child body size within all ages, however zzso had inverse and weaker associations with zzso at 2, 5, and 9 zzso zzso between zzso levels over the zzso 2-5, and zzso periods increased for both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our mixture modeling approach identified three trajectory clusters for both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso 2A zzso and 3A zzso While zzso groups were most separated over the zzso period, zzso zzso displayed greatest zzso from birth to 2 zzso Children in the zzso zzso group had highest zzso and waist circumference at 9 zzso Further, children with greater birth weight had increased odds of belonging to this high risk group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to stable group zzso Children whose mothers consumed more zzso beverages during pregnancy were at risk of being in the zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to stable group zzso 

Our results highlight zzso differences in zzso and zzso over the childhood zzso zzso closely reflects child body size however factors affecting zzso and long-term consequences of its changes over infancy need to be further zzso
