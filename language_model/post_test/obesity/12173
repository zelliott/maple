To zzso factors of importance for insulin zzso fat cells from humans and rats were incubated under various experimental conditions for different periods of zzso Human zzso incubated for 24 hours in the absence of insulin showed no significant difference in insulin binding compared with cells from freshly excised zzso After 48 hours, however, an increased rate of binding zzso zzso P less than zzso was zzso The addition of insulin (2000 zzso to the culture medium resulted in a decrease in insulin binding zzso zzso P less than zzso compared with cells maintained in the absence of zzso There was no apparent difference in zzso zzso indicating that the altered binding was due to a change in zzso zzso In the absence of insulin, zzso the zzso concentration of the medium from zzso zzso to zzso zzso did not significantly influence insulin zzso zzso zzso showed similar but more rapid zzso Thus, incubation for 24 hours without insulin caused an increase in insulin binding zzso zzso P less than zzso This zzso was seen even in a high zzso concentration zzso zzso but was completely prevented by the presence of insulin in the zzso Furthermore, when rat zzso were incubated with insulin in the presence of a high zzso concentration zzso zzso there was a significant further decrease in insulin binding compared with that of parallel zzso performed in zzso zzso zzso Thus, even in the absence of zzso zzso zzso regulation of the number of binding sites is shown for both human and rat zzso tissue in zzso Although this zzso could be directly due to zzso interaction at the membrane level, the finding of rat zzso that the ambient zzso concentration can zzso this effect suggests the importance of zzso zzso
