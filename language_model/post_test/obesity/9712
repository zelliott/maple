A zzso zzso and a body surface area zzso equations were applied for plasma volume zzso zzso respectively, to confirm and zzso the zzso effect in zzso zzso zzso screening among obese zzso The agreement between the equations was additionally zzso 

A total of zzso men were zzso collected, with ages 40 to 65 years, zzso 0 to 4 zzso and no prostate zzso zzso mass was calculated as zzso concentration multiplied by zzso zzso linear zzso models, theoretical models, and the zzso method were zzso 

zzso concentration significantly decreased with increasing body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso however, zzso mass estimated by zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso equations remained zzso A screening zzso of zzso zzso in zzso men was found to be corresponding to zzso and zzso zzso in obese men zzso by zzso on the basis of zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, the mean zzso confidence zzso difference of zzso between the two equations was zzso zzso to zzso zzso 

The inverse relationship between zzso concentration and zzso might be explained by a zzso effect among obese zzso There is significant variation in zzso calculated by the two zzso 

A value between zzso and zzso zzso might be recommended for zzso screening in middle-aged obese Asian zzso
