Lung cancer is the second most common zzso and the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United zzso In cancer, weight loss and obesity are associated with reduced zzso However, the effect of obesity or weight loss at presentation on lung cancer survival has not been well zzso 

Using an extensive cancer zzso we identified zzso patients diagnosed with lung cancer during the period of zzso of which zzso patients presented with obesity and/or weight zzso We examined the relationship between survival and weight loss or obesity at diagnosis using zzso and zzso zzso 

Median survival time zzso for all lung cancer patients was zzso zzso Patients presenting with weight loss zzso had shorter zzso versus those who did not zzso versus zzso zzso P zzso and patients with weight loss had significantly shortened zzso for all stages and zzso zzso In contrast, obese patients at presentation zzso had longer zzso relative to non-obese patients zzso versus zzso zzso P zzso which was significant across all stages and zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the absence of weight loss was an independent, positive predictor of improved survival zzso zzso zzso P zzso while the absence of obesity was an independent predictor of worsened survival in lung cancer zzso zzso zzso P zzso 

Our results demonstrate an inverse relationship between survival and weight loss at presentation and a potentially protective effect of obesity in lung cancer survival, which could be due to greater zzso reserves, thereby zzso life by slowing the progress of cancer zzso
