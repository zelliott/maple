zzso of zzso growth hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared in groups of genetically obese zzso and lean zzso zzso male zzso rats at four different ages, 3, 5, 9, and 11 weeks, in order to determine the earliest age at which a difference between the two groups could be zzso No difference was seen in three-week-old zzso Five weeks of age was the earliest time at which the level of zzso zzso was significantly decreased in the obese zzso this decrease was present at all subsequent zzso Mean serum growth hormone levels were lower in obese animals at all ages, but the differences were not statistically significant because of the large individual variation associated with the zzso nature of zzso zzso The earliest occurrence of differences in zzso zzso level is later than some of the obesity associated abnormalities present in zzso zzso The earliest time of the zzso zzso differences can be associated with the time when decreased protein deposition is initially seen in the obese zzso Because of this association, decreased zzso zzso may enhance the development of zzso
