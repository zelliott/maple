zzso sleep zzso syndrome zzso is strongly associated with obesity zzso and is characterized by several changes in zzso functions, zzso zzso zzso adrenal and zzso zzso It is still unclear whether these zzso simply reflect overweight or include peculiar zzso hormonal zzso zzso evaluations have been generally performed in zzso conditions but we have recently reported that zzso is characterized by a more severe reduction of the zzso zzso pool in comparison to simple zzso We aimed to extend our evaluation of anterior zzso function to zzso zzso and zzso zzso under dynamic testing in zzso in comparison with simply obese and normal zzso 

In 15 male patients with zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso years; body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso index, zzso zzso zzso zzso 15 male patients with simple obesity zzso age zzso zzso zzso years; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and in 15 normal lean male subjects zzso age zzso zzso zzso years; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso we zzso zzso the zzso and cortisol responses to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 24 h zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso responses to zzso (5 zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso levels in zzso and zzso were similar and within the normal zzso zzso zzso and cortisol levels were similar in all zzso However, the zzso response to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was markedly higher zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which, in turn, was higher zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, the cortisol response to zzso was not significantly different in the three zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels as well as the zzso response to zzso were similar in all zzso Similarly, both zzso zzso levels and the zzso response to zzso were similar in the three zzso 

With respect to patients with simple abdominal zzso obese patients with zzso show a more remarkable enhancement of the zzso response to zzso but a preserved zzso and zzso responsiveness to zzso These findings indicate the existence of a zzso exaggerated zzso zzso to zzso that would reflect zzso and/or zzso zzso of the neural control of zzso zzso this further zzso is coupled to the previously zzso peculiar reduction of zzso zzso
