We assessed risk for obesity in zzso first-degree relatives zzso and zzso of zzso obese patients at three sites in the USA and one in zzso zzso of obesity prior to adulthood, and especially by age 10, significantly increased relative risk zzso for obesity in adult first-degree zzso This increase in risk was consistent across four different patient samples from two different zzso Higher levels of obesity in patients were also associated with increased familial zzso Age of onset of obesity may be used to select obese adults with high genetic zzso approach that should facilitate the identification of specific genes for human zzso The enhanced ability to identify persons at high genetic risk for obesity provided by this study should increase the effectiveness of efforts to prevent zzso
