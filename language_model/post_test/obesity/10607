Although the prevention of zzso weight loss zzso has become a priority for clinicians in the past few decades, recent work has suggested that zzso may be beneficial for obese zzso We aimed to identify the potential beneficial or adverse associations of zzso with pregnancy outcome zzso by maternal body mass index zzso zzso 

zzso cohort zzso 

Data on zzso zzso singleton deliveries in Bavarian zzso units from zzso were extracted from a standard zzso for which data are regularly collected for the national zzso of zzso zzso 

We calculated the odds ratios zzso for adverse pregnancy outcome by zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso weight gain with adjustment for zzso and zzso by zzso category zzso zzso zzso zzso normal weight, zzso zzso zzso zzso overweight, zzso zzso zzso zzso obese class I, zzso zzso zzso zzso obese class II, zzso zzso zzso zzso obese class III, zzso zzso 40 zzso 

zzso zzso zzso section, zzso delivery, small or large for zzso age zzso birth and zzso zzso 

zzso was associated with a decreased risk of pregnancy zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso section, in overweight and obese women zzso OR zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso section in obese class I zzso The risks of zzso delivery and zzso zzso by contrast, were significantly higher in overweight and obese class zzso mothers zzso OR zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso for zzso in obese class I zzso In obese class III women, no significantly increased risks of poor outcomes for infants were zzso 

The association of zzso with a decreased risk of pregnancy complications appears to be zzso by increased risks of zzso and zzso in all but obese class III zzso
