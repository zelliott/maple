zzso for energy intake in obese children rely on accurate methods for measuring energy expenditure that cannot be assessed zzso 

The aim was to establish and validate new equations for predicting resting energy expenditure zzso specifically in obese zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and body composition zzso zzso zzso were measured in zzso obese subjects aged zzso zzso The first cohort zzso was used to establish zzso zzso the second (and zzso cohort zzso was used to validate these zzso and the third zzso a follow-up group of children who lost weight zzso was used to examine zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso values predicted with the use of various published equations and the new established equation were compared with measured zzso by using the zzso method and zzso zzso zzso 

In cohort 1, significant zzso of the new prediction equations were zzso mass in boys zzso zzso and age and zzso mass in girls zzso zzso External validation conducted by using the zzso method and zzso zzso tests, in cohort 2, showed no significant difference between measured zzso and predicted zzso with the new zzso When already published equations were applied, zzso bias appeared with all published equations except for that of the World Health zzso In cohort 3, the children who lost weight, almost all equations significantly underestimated zzso 

These new zzso equations allow clinicians to estimate zzso in an obese pediatric population with sufficient and acceptable zzso This zzso may be a strong basis for energy recommendations in childhood zzso
