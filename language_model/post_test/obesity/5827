In rats, zzso zzso energy restriction zzso offspring for higher food zzso which in adulthood results in higher body weight in males but not in zzso Here, we aimed to assess whether the effects of moderate energy restriction during gestation and the sex-related outcomes on adult body weight may be related to the zzso programming of zzso expression in different zzso For this purpose, zzso offspring of control and zzso zzso zzso rats (from days zzso of zzso were zzso Body weight and the weight of white zzso tissue zzso zzso and liver were recorded and zzso expression of zzso 1 zzso and selected genes in the zzso liver, muscle and zzso were zzso No differences were found in body weight or the weight of zzso and liver between the control and zzso zzso A similar pattern of zzso zzso expression was found in the zzso liver and skeletal muscle of zzso animals, but in a zzso zzso zzso males showed lower zzso zzso levels than the controls, while no differences were found in zzso A zzso pattern was also observed in the zzso zzso zzso but not zzso also showed lower zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein 2 in zzso and of zzso response element binding protein zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso Both sexes of zzso animals showed lower zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso in the zzso In conclusion, moderate maternal energy restriction during gestation zzso a particular, zzso gene expression profile of zzso in different peripheral zzso which may be related to obesity predisposition in zzso therefore zzso expression emerges as a potential early zzso of obesity zzso
