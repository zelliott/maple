Several zzso investigations have suggested that weight loss is associated with increased mortality risk but have not examined whether the weight loss was intentional or zzso The authors examined whether the association between weight loss and mortality differs by whether the weight loss was intentional or unintentional as part of the Iowa Women's Health zzso a prospective cohort study of health risk factors in zzso zzso Women aged zzso years completed questions about intentional and unintentional weight losses since age 18 years via mail survey in 1992 and were followed through zzso One or more intentional weight loss episodes of 20 or more pounds zzso or zzso zzso during adulthood was not significantly associated with higher total or cardiovascular disease mortality risk compared with never zzso or zzso zzso One or more unintentional weight loss episodes of 20 or more pounds was associated with a zzso higher total mortality risk and a zzso higher cardiovascular disease mortality risk, compared with never losing 20 or more zzso zzso between unintentional weight loss and increased mortality risk were confined mostly to women with prevalent disease, hypertension, or zzso zzso of association did not vary by overweight zzso These findings suggest that the association between weight loss and increased mortality risk observed in zzso studies may be due to unintentional weight loss that reflects existing disease and not due to intentional weight zzso 

The extent to which the association between weight loss and mortality is associated with whether the weight loss was voluntary or zzso is examined using data from the Iowa Women's Health zzso This study involved zzso women aged zzso who completed a mailed survey in 1992 and were zzso through zzso The results suggest that the association between weight loss and increased mortality risk observed in zzso studies may be due to unintentional weight loss that reflects existing disease and not to intentional weight zzso A comment is included by Lewis zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as a response from the authors zzso zzso
