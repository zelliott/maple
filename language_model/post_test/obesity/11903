zzso zzso has been reported to zzso correlate with the degree of zzso in zzso However, the relative contribution of zzso signaling to the development of zzso syndrome in childhood obesity is zzso We overfed zzso male zzso rats a high-fat diet via total zzso zzso zzso caloric intake led to zzso increased body weight and fat zzso zzso zzso fat zzso and zzso zzso zzso of fatty acid zzso zzso was elevated in both liver and skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso was elevated zzso and zzso protein in zzso nuclear extracts was reduced zzso in the face of zzso whereas no increase in zzso zzso or decrease in nuclear zzso was observed in skeletal zzso zzso increased serum zzso concentration from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and positively correlated with increased zzso tissue zzso The expression of the inflammatory zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso in the zzso tissue was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and the expression of genes involved in fatty acid zzso were elevated in both liver and muscle zzso These data zzso demonstrate that excessive intake of a high-fat diet in young rats results in zzso increases in zzso fat deposition and zzso zzso suggest that fatty acid transport is a major mechanism underlying zzso fat deposition, zzso demonstrate zzso differences in the response of zzso signaling to zzso following the development of pediatric obesity and zzso suggest age-related differences in the role of zzso in pathological responses associated with zzso
