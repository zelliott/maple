The mechanisms underlying the maintenance of normal to high rates of linear growth and plasma zzso growth factor I zzso levels in spite of a low growth hormone zzso in obese children remain zzso Among the animal models of zzso zzso obese zzso zzso rats (which are zzso for an zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso are particularly appropriate, because their linear growth shows this growth hormone zzso 

To study the regulation of zzso synthesis in this model, we have established primary cultures of zzso derived from zzso zzso male obese and lean zzso The rat zzso gene contains six zzso and alternative zzso generates different zzso one of which (called zzso has been shown to be decreased by zzso We report steady state zzso levels for zzso (all zzso and for zzso in zzso after 3 days in culture, in freshly isolated zzso and in zzso zzso zzso using zzso specific for zzso or zzso were performed with two different internal competitors for zzso 

In primary cultures of zzso the zzso zzso was increased zzso zzso zzso zzso in cells derived from obese animals as compared with cells from lean zzso However, these transcript levels were not significantly different when measured in freshly isolated zzso or in zzso zzso 

Increased zzso zzso could be an intrinsic characteristic of cultured zzso zzso zzso receptors that bear the zzso zzso However, the zzso of this characteristic by zzso interactions and by in zzso hormone and zzso status remains to be zzso
