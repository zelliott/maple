zzso zzso of the zzso system have been implicated in cardiovascular and zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene and zzso zzso of the zzso II type 2 zzso zzso gene affect blood pressure and other zzso zzso changes in response to low-energy diets using meal replacement shakes for weight zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso profiles were measured before and after a zzso intervention in 32 obese women (age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso restricted to 1200 zzso zzso zzso The zzso were determined with an zzso zzso probe zzso zzso 

Although weight loss and zzso intake levels did not differ among the zzso the reduction in body fat after weight loss was significantly less in the zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso P zzso The zzso zzso group had significantly less improved levels of zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and fat zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso than the zzso plus zzso zzso 

The present findings suggest that the zzso form of the zzso gene may hinder the improvement of body fat and that the zzso form of the zzso gene may make improving zzso blood pressure and some zzso zzso parameters through a dietary intervention difficult among obese zzso
