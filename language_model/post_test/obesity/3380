zzso contraceptive zzso use seems to have little effect on weight change in normal weight zzso Most previous studies have excluded obese women, so the effect of OC use on weight change in obese women is zzso 

This analysis evaluates weight and body composition change with OC use among obese zzso mass index zzso zzso and normal weight zzso zzso women who were randomly assigned to two OC zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso or 30 zzso zzso and 150 zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred after three to four OC zzso Weight and body composition were measured at baseline and at follow-up using a zzso zzso zzso 

Among 150 women (54 obese and 96 normal zzso who used zzso for 3 to 4 months, there were no clinically or statistically significant weight or body composition changes in the overall group or by zzso or OC zzso zzso 

These findings add to evidence that zzso zzso are not associated with short term weight or body composition change for normal weight women and suggest that zzso are also are not associated with short term weight or body composition change in obese zzso
