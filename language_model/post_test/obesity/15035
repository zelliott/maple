In zzso the prevalence of zzso weight increased from zzso at 6 y to zzso at 12 y of age, opening a window of opportunity to better understand the zzso of zzso The objective of this study was to explore the association between time spent on zzso vigorous physical activity zzso and concurrent gains in zzso fat mass zzso and zzso mass zzso zzso in a cohort of Mexican children followed from kindergarten zzso to 2nd grade elementary school zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso displacement zzso were measured at baseline and zzso zzso between gains in zzso zzso and zzso and changes in zzso were examined using lagged and dynamic zzso models, controlling for energy intake and demographic zzso 

A total of 205 children were zzso Gender affected the effect of zzso on zzso zzso In girls, a high baseline zzso predicted a lower zzso gain zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso decreasing or having a persistently high zzso predicted a lower zzso gain zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso compared to persistently low zzso In boys, increases in zzso were associated with higher gains in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to persistently low zzso 

These results support a protective role of zzso on zzso gain in girls, suggesting that it may play a crucial role in the development of zzso Further research on the gender effect of zzso is warranted to better understand its role in the prevention and control of overweight and zzso
