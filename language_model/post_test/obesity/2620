A zzso zzso electrical device that zzso blocks both zzso near the zzso junction led to significant excess weight loss zzso in an initial clinical trial in obese zzso The study objective was to zzso therapy zzso and determine the zzso achieved with a second-generation device at university hospitals in Australia, Norway, and zzso 

Data acquired during the initial clinical trial were analyzed and subsequently used to select alternative electrical zzso In the second trial, zzso blocking using one selected therapy zzso was initiated 2 weeks after zzso the second-generation zzso The patients were followed up for 6 months to assess the zzso and safety, including adverse zzso 

In the initial clinical trial, zzso blocking zzso zzso of zzso s were associated with greater zzso compared with either shorter or longer zzso zzso zzso The second trial enrolled 27 patients zzso body mass index zzso zzso to evaluate a zzso blocking zzso At 6 months, greater zzso was achieved zzso zzso compared with the initial study and first-generation device zzso zzso zzso In both trials, an association was found between the number of zzso zzso delivered daily and greater zzso zzso No deaths, unanticipated zzso adverse events, or medically serious adverse events were associated with the zzso 

This second-generation zzso blocking device, using a therapy zzso of zzso zzso resulted in a clinically acceptable safety profile and significantly greater zzso compared with the first-generation device delivering a wider range of therapy zzso zzso
