zzso of developing the zzso syndrome may be influenced by nutritional environment early in zzso We examined the effects of zzso zzso and zzso zzso diets consumed during pregnancy and zzso on zzso hormones and expression of genes involved in zzso and zzso metabolism in zzso zzso zzso were fed a control zzso zzso or zzso diets during pregnancy and zzso At zzso litters were culled to ten zzso At 21 zzso all zzso were weaned onto C zzso At 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 d after birth, blood was zzso for zzso hormones and zzso for zzso expression in zzso No differences were observed in litter size or birth zzso At 21 zzso offspring of zzso zzso had greater adjusted zzso mass and lower liver weight than those of C but not of zzso zzso Plasma zzso at 28 d and zzso at 7, 14 and 28 d were lower in zzso zzso C and zzso zzso zzso zzso was higher in zzso offspring than in zzso offspring at 7 d but was higher in zzso zzso C offspring at 21 zzso zzso of zzso zzso had higher zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression at 21 d zzso C and zzso zzso In brown zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was associated with increased zzso and zzso zzso zzso The present study demonstrates that maternal diet composition zzso regulates circulating zzso hormones and genes involved in zzso transport and energy metabolism in zzso These early changes could have long-term consequences for obesity zzso
