The zzso nervous system zzso is a key factor in the regulation of energy balance and body fat zzso to what extent the physical activity during the childhood years contributes to variations in zzso function is still zzso The present study was designed to investigate the zzso activity in lean and obese children, focusing on the differences in physical activity zzso 

This study was performed on zzso school children initially recruited to the present zzso In all, 24 physically active and 24 inactive obese children zzso or zzso of the standard body zzso were chosen as zzso Then, 24 zzso and 24 zzso children, who were matched individually in age, zzso zzso and the amount of sports activity, were carefully selected from the remaining zzso 

Physical activity was classified as the frequency of participation in after-school sports activities zzso or zzso times per week, zzso zzso The zzso activities were measured during the resting condition by means of heart rate zzso zzso power spectral analysis, which enables us to identify separate frequency zzso that is, low frequency zzso zzso zzso reflecting mixed sympathetic zzso and zzso nervous system zzso activity, high frequency zzso zzso zzso mainly associated with zzso activity, and total power zzso zzso zzso evaluating the overall zzso zzso The spectral powers were log transformed for statistical zzso 

The zzso group demonstrated lower resting zzso as well as significantly higher zzso zzso and zzso powers compared to the remaining zzso In contrast, the zzso group showed significantly lower zzso zzso vs the remaining zzso zzso zzso vs the lean zzso and zzso power zzso vs the lean zzso zzso The zzso and zzso groups were nearly identical in all spectral zzso The correlation analysis revealed that zzso among 48 inactive children was significantly and zzso associated with the percentage of body fat zzso zzso however, such correlation among 48 active children was modest zzso zzso 

Our data suggest that obese children possess reduced sympathetic as well as zzso nervous activities as compared to lean children who have similar physical activity zzso Such zzso reduction, associated with the amount of body fat in inactive state, might be an zzso factor of onset or development of childhood zzso On the other hand, regular physical activities could contribute to enhance the overall zzso activity in both lean and obese zzso These findings further imply that regular physical activity might be effective in preventing and treating obesity beginning in the zzso
