So as to estimate the appropriate dose of zzso drugs in obese children, prediction of the volume of distribution in these children was attempted based on zzso zzso concepts which had been constructed from results in zzso zzso zzso zzso data after intravenous drip infusions of zzso and zzso were analyzed using zzso analysis of obese children in whom the degree of obesity ranged from 30 to zzso Volume of distribution at steady state zzso per total body weight of zzso was significantly less than that for zzso children zzso less than zzso whereas the value of zzso was almost equal to that for zzso zzso The equation to express the difference of zzso between zzso and zzso obtained in zzso children failed in obese children, suggesting that there is a large decrease in the zzso space in obese children exceeding the zzso variations in zzso zzso The zzso value zzso for zzso was predicted by using the equation zzso zzso zzso body weight zzso + zzso zzso zzso body weight zzso - ideal body weight zzso The zzso value of zzso was predicted to be zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso + zzso zzso total body weight zzso A good correlation between the predicted and the observed zzso values was zzso
