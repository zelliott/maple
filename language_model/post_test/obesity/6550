In contrast to zzso fuels such as zzso or zzso bodies, the use of lipids as an energy source for zzso has required the development of complex structures for their transport through the zzso zzso In the case of zzso zzso zzso this is achieved by the assembly and zzso of zzso zzso which provides the necessary stability in an zzso zzso An essential component of this assembly process is zzso zzso zzso changes which require an increase in zzso zzso zzso appear to be accompanied by increases in the availability of functional zzso zzso zzso questions relate to: zzso the zzso zzso of zzso association with zzso B, and zzso the zzso by which the availability of functional zzso B at this site responds to zzso and hormonal signals which reflect dietary status and, thus, the need to zzso zzso As regards the latter, although in some cases changes in zzso B synthesis occur in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso levels appear to be quite stable in zzso zzso switching of zzso B between the zzso and zzso pathways may be important in controlling zzso assembly and zzso modifications of the zzso may also play a role by influencing its ability to bind to zzso Transport is not the only problem associated with the zzso of a concentrated energy source such as zzso and the complex problems of waste product disposal and recycling have to be dealt zzso In the case of zzso potentially toxic waste products include zzso remnants and zzso The overall problem, then, in the zzso involves the development of a zzso means of utilizing zzso and this requirement accounts for much of the complexity of plasma zzso zzso In this area, the rat could teach the human a few zzso One of these appears to be the zzso of zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso for zzso assembly in response to increases in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Under these conditions, the remnants of zzso zzso zzso by peripheral zzso are cleared from the plasma much more readily via a process which seems to involve the cycling of more zzso back to the liver than that which occurs in zzso The means by which this is zzso though, are obscure and may involve a zzso remnant zzso the nature of which, itself, remains zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
