Evaluate the effect of zzso zzso and zzso on zzso fatty pancreatic disease and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in mice fed high-fat zzso zzso zzso 

zzso male mice were fed standard zzso zzso zzso 10) or zzso zzso zzso zzso 40) for 6 zzso Afterward, zzso mice were grouped by zzso zzso zzso and zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso were administered for 5 zzso After treatment, the zzso was removed and analyzed by zzso zzso and zzso 

The zzso mice showed altered zzso zzso zzso and insulin zzso increased body zzso and zzso zzso masses, pancreatic fat zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso and insulin but induced weight zzso zzso zzso weight gain, but only zzso prevented zzso zzso The zzso stain was improved in all treatments, and there were no zzso in zzso There were zzso signs of zzso with zzso although there were no zzso in zzso and zzso zzso exacerbated pancreatic fat zzso zzso vs zzso group), and zzso increased zzso expression in pancreatic zzso 

zzso is shown for the first time to exacerbate pancreatic fat zzso therefore, precaution has to be taken when zzso is prescribed to obese zzso
