Although cardiovascular disease zzso is the leading cause of death in women in the United States, a knowledge gap persists regarding the mechanisms and management of zzso in zzso Before treatment can be zzso the role of cardiovascular risk factors must be zzso 

This review provides an updated assessment of cardiovascular risk factors in women, with a focus on zzso zzso 

zzso and Cochrane Library databases, and statistics from the National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso and the American Heart Association, were searched from 1990 to September 2008 using the following terms: cardiovascular risk factors, women, zzso zzso risk, abdominal zzso and zzso zzso Publications were classified as zzso original data, reviews, and clinical zzso zzso data were zzso Data were extracted by 2 zzso zzso

Increased knowledge of zzso risks for zzso has led to national campaigns to educate zzso In addition to traditional risk factors, zzso risk is an important consideration in zzso zzso exists regarding the exact definitions and usefulness of the term zzso syndrome, but it is clear that the presence of certain factors contributes to increased morbidity and mortality in affected zzso zzso obesity links insulin resistance, zzso and hypertension through complex zzso zzso Current research is identifying gene zzso gender zzso and continued research is necessary to explore the relationship of sex steroids and cardiovascular risk in both men and zzso
