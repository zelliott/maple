To assess insulin sensitivity, pancreatic zzso function, and compare circulating levels of zzso and zzso in obese women with and without zzso 

Ninety-nine obese women with a body mass index zzso or zzso 25 zzso and age at least 40 years without previous history of diabetes participated in this zzso zzso zzso tolerance test was performed in all zzso zzso for insulin, zzso and zzso were obtained at zzso Data were expressed as mean zzso zzso 

zzso zzso tolerance test revealed 66 zzso zzso and 33 diabetic zzso zzso Despite a similar degree of zzso women without diabetes had near normal insulin sensitivity zzso zzso zzso zzso D, zzso zzso zzso p zzso and beta cell function zzso zzso zzso zzso D, zzso zzso zzso p zzso as assessed by the zzso zzso zzso subjects had higher serum zzso levels despite similar zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso D, zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso subjects with diabetes had lower serum zzso levels than obese zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso D, zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso p zzso 

zzso women without diabetes have less pancreatic beta cell dysfunction and higher insulin sensitivity than obese women with zzso Higher circulating zzso may play protective roles in obese zzso subjects, but the significance of higher zzso level should be further zzso
