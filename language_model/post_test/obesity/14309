The effects of body mass index zzso on zzso zzso in young men have not been studied in zzso The zzso and zzso intervals are measured to estimate the duration of the zzso zzso As new zzso zzso the time intervals between the J point to the zzso of the T wave zzso the zzso and the end of T wave zzso may be associated with zzso in clinical zzso The aim of this study was to compare zzso zzso parameters in overweight and normal weight healthy young zzso 

zzso overweight men zzso zzso mean zzso zzso and 149 men within normal limits zzso zzso mean zzso zzso were included in this zzso controlled zzso The body mass index of 25 to zzso zzso was defined as overweight and scores of zzso to zzso zzso were accepted as zzso zzso zzso parameters including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso intervals duration and heart zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso intervals duration were obtained from lead V2 and considered to be representative of the zzso zzso zzso 

We found similar zzso zzso parameters zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in overweight and normal zzso zzso and corrected zzso zzso parameters were not correlated with zzso 

zzso zzso features in young men who are overweight in terms of zzso seem to show no significant difference when compared to normal weight zzso
