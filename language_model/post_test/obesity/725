This study analyzes the relationship between risk factors related to zzso insulin resistance, zzso zzso hypertension, zzso function and genetic zzso associated with: zzso appetite regulation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso differentiation and insulin sensitivity zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso and free fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso fatty acid transport zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso E zzso zzso zzso The 122 members of 40 obese Caucasian families from southern Poland participated in the zzso The zzso were analyzed by restriction zzso length zzso chain reaction zzso or by direct zzso zzso related to obesity zzso mass index zzso zzso body mass zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and insulin, as well as insulin during oral zzso tolerance test zzso (4 points within 2 zzso and during oral zzso tolerance test zzso (5 points within 8 zzso were zzso The insulin sensitivity zzso zzso model assessment of insulin resistance, whole body insulin sensitivity index, zzso insulin sensitivity and early zzso response to an oral zzso load zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The single gene zzso such as zzso T zzso and zzso zzso zzso linked to zzso obesity were not detected in our zzso A weak correlation between obesity and certain gene zzso was zzso Being overweight zzso zzso or zzso 30 zzso significantly correlated with worse zzso tolerance in male zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance was found in female zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso linked to the zzso Pro zzso carriers was characterized by high zzso output during zzso We conclude that the zzso we investigated were zzso correlated with obesity but significantly modified the risk factors of the zzso zzso
