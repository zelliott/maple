We assessed the role of circulating zzso zzso on the blood pressure regulation in patients with essential hypertension, cardiac diseases, diabetes zzso and zzso diseases by measuring zzso zzso zzso Plasma zzso zzso tended to correlate with blood pressure in all patient zzso Plasma zzso correlated to plasma zzso concentration in patients with essential hypertension, which suggested close zzso between zzso and zzso metabolism with adrenal zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso levels significantly correlated with blood zzso Because plasma zzso levels correlated with serum zzso increased levels of insulin could have induced sodium retention leading to increased zzso zzso zzso substance, but not insulin, would have directly increased blood pressure in patients with abnormal zzso zzso Plasma zzso levels significantly correlated with the severity of zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso Plasma zzso highly correlated with amounts of plasma zzso particularly with zzso which would be due to the binding of zzso with zzso in zzso Because the level of zzso zzso is extremely low when zzso with a zzso it was impossible to assess the level of a zzso of zzso zzso active zzso That could be a reason why the correlation between the zzso and the other parameters was not highly zzso zzso these findings suggest that the zzso is one of the major zzso of blood pressure rises, regardless of any zzso
