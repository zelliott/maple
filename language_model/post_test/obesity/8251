Diabetes zzso zzso is regarded as a new risk factor for zzso zzso zzso but few studies have focused on the potential role of zzso in the progression of zzso to zzso as well as in patients with simple zzso zzso 

A cohort of zzso patients, treated at our hospital and with a hospital discharge diagnosis of zzso and/or zzso was zzso Among them, zzso were diagnosed with chronic zzso infection and 370 were analyzed statistically according to the zzso inclusion and exclusion zzso The zzso clinical, zzso zzso zzso zzso and pathological features were analyzed and the zzso zzso zzso model was used to determine the potential role of zzso 

In 248 zzso patients, 76 were diabetic and their mean duration of zzso was zzso zzso In 122 zzso patients with zzso 25 were diabetic and their mean duration of zzso was zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that compared with zzso patients, the zzso patients had a higher percentage in males zzso a lower percentage in zzso patients zzso a higher percentage in cigarette smokers zzso a higher percentage in patients with zzso zzso zzso higher values of white blood cells zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso higher total zzso zzso and zzso levels zzso and a lower international zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso was an independent associated factor for zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Even after the zzso patients were restricted to those with zzso zzso and compared with zzso zzso patients, the similar result was observed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is an independent factor in the progression of zzso to zzso but the role may be contrary to our current zzso To clarify the zzso relationship of zzso and zzso prospective and experimental studies are zzso
