The objectives of this study were to compare patterns of blood zzso monitoring among patients with type 2 diabetes initiating therapy with insulin or oral medication and to examine the relationship between the quantity of prescribed monitoring strips and zzso zzso 

Data were obtained from the UK General zzso Research zzso Patients were eligible if they were identified as having type 2 diabetes, initiated therapy with insulin or an oral agent, and had 12-month zzso zzso zzso in patient characteristics and number of test strips prescribed between the insulin zzso and oral zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso examined the relationship between quantity of monitoring and zzso control for a subset of patients zzso zzso zzso zzso with available zzso zzso zzso zzso 

During the 12-month zzso period, patients using insulin were prescribed approximately twice as many test strips compared with those patients using oral medication zzso zzso 78, zzso zzso zzso revealed that individuals who initiated insulin therapy and were prescribed enough test strips to test at least once per day in the 6 months prior to the zzso test date had, on average, a zzso lower zzso value zzso compared with individuals who were prescribed fewer test zzso 

zzso indicate significant differences in the prescription of blood zzso monitoring zzso with patients initiated on insulin prescribed almost twice as many test strips compared with patients initiated on zzso The greater number of blood zzso test strips prescribed was associated with lower zzso values for insulin zzso
