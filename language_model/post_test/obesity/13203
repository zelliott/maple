A zzso intervention study and zzso follow-up zzso 

A total of 47 zzso sedentary individuals zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recruited through a diabetes education zzso 



daily PA assessed by zzso zzso

Relative to the zzso group, zzso participants increased their zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso during the intervention zzso zzso and hip zzso decreased zzso 2-3 zzso but did not differ significantly between zzso zzso changes did not emerge for any of the other zzso 

The zzso is a practical intervention that elicits an immediate and profound change in walking zzso Such change is an important zzso zzso towards increasing the volume and/or intensity of PA necessary to improve long-term health outcomes in this largely sedentary and overweight or obese zzso zzso by 24 weeks indicates that other strategies such as booster sessions are needed to maintain lifestyle zzso Further research must determine realistic and responsive health outcomes for this population that are achievable through practical, real-world zzso
