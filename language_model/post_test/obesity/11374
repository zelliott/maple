Several studies have shown no significantly increased risk of zzso mortality for obese patients after coronary artery bypass zzso zzso However, the effect of obesity on zzso survival has not been adequately zzso We set out to examine whether zzso survival following zzso is affected by zzso 

We performed a retrospective study of zzso consecutive patients undergoing isolated zzso between April 1997 and September zzso Body mass index zzso was used as the measure of zzso with zzso patients zzso as non-obese zzso zzso and zzso patients as obese zzso or zzso 30 zzso Patient records were linked to the National Strategic zzso Service, which records all deaths in the community, to establish current vital zzso Deaths occurring over time were described using zzso zzso To control for differences in patient zzso we used Cox zzso hazards analysis to calculate adjusted hazard ratios zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso 

Three hundred and thirty zzso deaths occurred during the study period, with a mean follow-up of zzso zzso The crude zzso of zzso mortality for obese patients was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After adjustment for core zzso factors, the adjusted zzso of zzso mortality for obese patients was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The adjusted freedom from death in the obese patients at 30 days, 1, 2, 3, and 4 years was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the non-obese zzso 

Although zzso mortality after zzso does not seem to be adversely affected by obesity there appears to be a significant increase in mortality in obese patients during a zzso follow-up zzso
