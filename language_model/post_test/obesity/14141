A zzso study was conducted from 1993 to 2003 with an average follow-up of zzso years of a zzso community population on the south side of zzso Participants were zzso zzso adults aged 65 and older who participated in at least two zzso A composite measure of global cognitive function was used which was derived from the average of standardized scores from four cognitive zzso 

There was a significant zzso association between zzso and cognitive function scores at baseline for both black zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso subjects zzso zzso p zzso zzso In a mixed model adjusted for age, sex, race, and education, higher zzso was associated with less cognitive decline in both black zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso subjects zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso for zzso illnesses did not change these findings zzso However, the associations were much smaller and no longer significant among participants with no cognitive decline at baseline as measured by a zzso State zzso score of greater than zzso 

The findings suggest that greater body mass index in old age is not zzso of cognitive decline in a cognitively zzso community zzso
