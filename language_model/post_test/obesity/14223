zzso X-ray zzso zzso is often cited as a criterion method for body composition zzso We have previously shown that a new zzso software version zzso Discovery zzso will affect zzso bone mineral results for subjects weighing zzso zzso We wished to zzso pediatric zzso scans in order to assess the impact of the new software on pediatric zzso body composition zzso 

We zzso zzso pediatric scans (for ages zzso zzso using zzso software zzso previously analyzed using zzso zzso analysis and zzso were used to compare body fat zzso body fat zzso percentage fat zzso and zzso lean body mass zzso for the two versions, adjusting for zzso age and zzso 

Software zzso yielded values that were higher for zzso lower for zzso and unchanged for zzso weight in subjects weighing zzso zzso Body composition values for younger, smaller subjects were most affected, and girls were more affected than zzso Using the new software, zzso of the girls and zzso of the boys were reclassified from the zzso zzso range to zzso risk of zzso while 7 and zzso respectively, were reclassified as zzso 

zzso newest zzso software has a significant effect on zzso results for children weighing zzso zzso The effect is greater for girls than zzso zzso of zzso estimates with previous studies that use older zzso instruments and software should be done with zzso zzso has not yet achieved sufficient reliability to be considered a zzso zzso for body composition assessment in pediatric zzso
