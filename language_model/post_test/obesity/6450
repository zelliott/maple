We have recently shown that human zzso cells express functional zzso receptors and that zzso is capable of inducing the expression and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso has zzso and possibly zzso properties, it has also been shown to antagonize the action of zzso at the zzso level in zzso thereby inducing zzso zzso We have therefore examined whether zzso levels are increased in human zzso conditions, such as zzso To this end, we measured serum zzso levels in 20 zzso obese zzso subjects zzso mass index zzso 45 zzso 6 zzso serum zzso 52 zzso 20 zzso as well as in 10 zzso and zzso lean controls zzso 22 zzso 2 zzso serum zzso 7 zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso proved to be elevated zzso in the obese subjects, and they were positively correlated in a linear manner with the zzso levels zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso although lean body mass zzso and the insulin resistance index were even better zzso of zzso levels zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso Six months after 15 of the 20 obese subjects had undergone bypass surgery for their zzso zzso their mean zzso and zzso levels decreased to 33 zzso 7 zzso and 18 plus minus 12 zzso zzso This change in zzso zzso was associated with a significant reduction in zzso levels zzso zzso However, there was a better correlation between the decrease in zzso level and the change in zzso than with the reduction in zzso levels, indicating that zzso is not the sole zzso of circulating zzso in zzso In zzso we demonstrate that zzso levels are highly elevated in human obesity and that its zzso decrease after weight loss from bypass zzso However, zzso and insulin resistance are better zzso of serum zzso zzso than are zzso levels, suggesting that additional zzso factors control the zzso of this zzso zzso Although the zzso consequences of this zzso remain unknown, it is tempting to speculate that the zzso increase in zzso might contribute to the central resistance to zzso in obese patients, similar to the zzso of the zzso signaling of zzso by zzso in zzso
