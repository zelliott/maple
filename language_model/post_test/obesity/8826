Physical age, energy restriction zzso and weight loss have been reported to suppress zzso of innate zzso which may increase the risk of zzso To evaluate these zzso we recruited older, zzso women zzso to 80 zzso to fill one of the following zzso zzso zzso zzso groups: beef zzso zzso zzso reported zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso chicken zzso zzso 15; 51% zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso 59% zzso zzso zzso or a zzso control zzso zzso zzso 

zzso blood was collected before and after zzso to determine zzso zzso zzso zzso burst capacity, natural killer cell activity, zzso zzso and zzso production, and blood zinc and iron zzso 

No significant effects of zzso zzso weight zzso or PRO quantity and source were found for the majority of zzso of innate zzso Small but significant zzso zzso declines in zzso production were found in the chicken and zzso groups only; however, the clinical significance of this finding is not zzso 

In the present study, 9 weeks of moderate zzso did not suppress immunity in zzso zzso Also, contrary to our hypothesis, differential zinc and iron zzso did not significantly alter zzso
