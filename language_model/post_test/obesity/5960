Current research has focused upon the potential links between novel markers of vascular risk such as zzso dysfunction, zzso stress, inflammation and insulin resistance in the zzso of Type 2 diabetes and its zzso zzso seed extract zzso a zzso product, is a potential zzso of these zzso This study aimed to test the hypothesis that zzso may improve these markers in high-risk cardiovascular subjects with Type 2 zzso 

zzso Type 2 diabetes zzso patients, prescribed diet or oral zzso agents, received zzso zzso zzso or zzso for 4 weeks in a zzso zzso crossover zzso zzso of zzso function zzso by zzso zzso stress zzso zzso status zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso inflammation zzso sensitive zzso protein zzso urinary zzso : zzso zzso insulin resistance zzso model zzso resistance zzso and metabolism zzso zzso zzso was measured at baseline and after intervention with zzso or zzso 

zzso characteristics (16 male and 16 zzso age zzso zzso zzso years; body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso diabetes duration zzso zzso zzso zzso Following zzso (but not zzso significant changes were noted in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 273 zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso whole blood zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Total cholesterol concentration also decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso No statistically significant changes were shown in zzso function, zzso or zzso 

zzso significantly improved markers of inflammation and zzso and a sole marker of zzso stress in obese Type 2 diabetic subjects at high risk of cardiovascular events over a zzso period, which suggests it may have a therapeutic role in decreasing cardiovascular zzso
