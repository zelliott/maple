In a zzso association study performed in the zzso zzso zzso individuals zzso for the zzso C zzso located upstream of zzso gene 2 zzso were reported to incur an increased risk of zzso This finding was later zzso in four out of five populations zzso The goal of the study reported here was to assess the role of the zzso single zzso zzso zzso in zzso to obesity in the prospective zzso zzso zzso in Communities zzso study zzso zzso zzso and in three other zzso the zzso zzso zzso Development in Young Adults zzso study zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso Network of zzso zzso study zzso zzso zzso and extremely obese and lean individuals zzso at the University of Ottawa zzso zzso zzso The combined study sample is comprised of zzso white, African-American, and Mexican-American zzso 

zzso in mean body mass index zzso and other zzso measures including weight, waist zzso and zzso ratio were assessed by a general linear model in individuals zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to predict the risk of obesity zzso 30 zzso 

There was no zzso variation in the zzso of the three zzso zzso zzso observed between white, Hispanic, and African-American obese individuals and non-obese study zzso When the relationship between zzso and zzso considered either as a zzso variable or a continuous variable was zzso no significant association with obesity was found for participants in any of the four study populations or in a combined analysis zzso zzso zzso under a zzso genetic zzso There was also no association between the zzso zzso and the zzso quantitative traits except for a reduced zzso ratio in white ARIC study participants zzso for the C zzso and an increased zzso ratio in African-Americans in the ARIC cohort with the same zzso zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso An association with zzso ratio was not seen when the combined study sample was analyzed zzso zzso zzso 

These results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso does not play a major role in determining obesity risk in a racially and ethnically diverse sample of zzso individuals from four zzso
