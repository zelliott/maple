The recently identified zzso zzso has raised great expectations as a potential target in the conservative treatment of zzso This review focuses on studies exploring the effects of zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in skeletal muscles is induced by exercise followed by expression of the membrane protein zzso type III domain containing zzso After zzso from zzso type III domain containing 5, zzso is zzso into blood increasing zzso by zzso of subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso Although clear-cut data have been reported in zzso the zzso effect of zzso in humans remains zzso The initially reported zzso increase of zzso in humans could not be confirmed in most zzso However, a robust finding in human studies is the association of zzso with zzso 

The discovery of zzso provides more insight into zzso zzso of zzso zzso and therefore leads to a better understanding of mechanisms underlying body weight regulation and further down the road possibly may lead to treatment strategies of diseases with greatly altered body weight such as obesity or anorexia zzso
