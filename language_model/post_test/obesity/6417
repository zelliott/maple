This study was designed to examine the effect of a high-fat zzso zzso zzso zzso diet zzso which is known to induce obesity and zzso on zzso tissue and skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso and zzso density zzso zzso zzso protein zzso Female Fischer rats were placed on either a zzso or a zzso zzso zzso diet for 22 months beginning at 2 months of zzso After 20 months, a zzso of the zzso rats were switched to the zzso diet for 2 months zzso Body weight, feed efficiency, plasma total cholesterol, zzso zzso zzso cholesterol zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso cholesterol ratio were all significantly raised by the zzso diet and improved by conversion to the zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso and total zzso activity expressed per cell were significantly increased in the zzso zzso However, zzso protein abundance zzso against total cellular protein was unchanged in the zzso zzso This observation is consistent with the presence of zzso tissue zzso zzso muscle zzso protein abundance and zzso activity were reduced by the zzso diet and improved after switching to the zzso zzso Both zzso tissue and skeletal muscle zzso protein levels were significantly reduced by the zzso diet and increased after conversion to the zzso zzso We conclude that an zzso diet zzso changes in zzso and zzso in a manner which favors zzso of dietary fat from skeletal muscle to zzso tissue and decreases zzso zzso clearance contributing to increased plasma lipids and zzso zzso to a zzso diet can zzso the zzso and tissue changes induced by long-term zzso diet zzso
