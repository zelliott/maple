Increased zzso of plasma zzso an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease zzso in obese children have been zzso The underlying mechanism for this, however, remains to be zzso In the current study, we measured the fractional synthesis rates zzso of plasma zzso in six healthy zzso obese girls zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso and six zzso lean normal control girls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso during a zzso continuous infusion of zzso in the zzso zzso The method involved zzso of plasma zzso by use of zzso zzso followed by measurement of zzso enrichment using gas zzso ratio mass zzso The zzso of zzso in obese girls zzso zzso zzso was almost double that in lean girls zzso zzso zzso and this increase was associated with a relative increase in plasma concentration of zzso as well as zzso in the subjects zzso zzso subjects had high zzso insulin levels zzso zzso 47 zzso compared with lean subjects (54 zzso 11 zzso whereas their zzso zzso were similar zzso zzso zzso zzso in obese and zzso zzso zzso zzso in lean zzso suggesting insulin zzso The doubling of the zzso of zzso provides novel insight into the mechanism of elevated levels of plasma zzso and suggests a primary role for increased synthesis in producing the zzso associated with zzso This finding may have important implications in the design of therapies for modulating plasma zzso levels in obesity and/or zzso in zzso
