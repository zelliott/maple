This study determined the effects of zzso zzso zzso and zzso OC zzso on obesity in obese rats fed a high-fat zzso 

THE zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso THREE zzso a high-fat zzso diet group, zzso + OC diet group, and zzso + zzso diet zzso All groups were fed the diet and water ad zzso for 14 zzso 

zzso reduced the body weight and zzso tissue mass, whereas OC did zzso OC and zzso reduced zzso levels of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso and fatty zzso protein in white zzso zzso The zzso levels of genes related to zzso or zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso were increased by the OC and zzso relative to the zzso zzso Both OC and zzso clearly zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso In particular, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity were significantly increased in the zzso group compared to in the OC zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso activity whereas OC did zzso 

From these results, zzso could be suggested as a potential zzso agent in obese rats fed a zzso zzso The effects of the zzso on obesity were associated with changes of multiple gene zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso in white zzso zzso
