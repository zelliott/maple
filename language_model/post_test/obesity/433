Data from a population health survey of 2900 adults (18 years or zzso conducted in 2002 was linked with geographic measures of access to food zzso Based upon a ratio of the number of fast-food restaurants and convenience stores to zzso and specialty food stores, a Retail Food Environment Index zzso was calculated for 800 m and 1600 m buffers around people's zzso In a series of zzso zzso associations between the zzso and the level of obesity among adults were zzso 

The median zzso for adults in Edmonton was zzso within an 800 m buffer around their residence and zzso within a 1600 m buffer around their zzso zzso zzso of the respondents were classified as being zzso The odds of a resident being obese were significantly lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso if they lived in an area with the lowest zzso zzso zzso in comparison to the highest zzso zzso and zzso These associations existed regardless of the zzso included in the zzso No significant associations were observed between zzso within a 1600 m buffer of the home and zzso 

The lower the ratio of fast-food restaurants and convenience stores to grocery stores and produce vendors near people's homes, the lower the odds of being zzso Thus the proximity of the zzso environment to individuals appears to be an important factor in their risk for zzso
