Nine obese males of zzso origin were examined with a zzso zzso zzso zzso computerized zzso zzso technique before and after a small weight reduction zzso zzso The total zzso tissue zzso volume was reduced by zzso zzso zzso as a percentage of initial depot volume, there were significant reductions zzso zzso in the AT zzso of zzso zzso upper limbs zzso subcutaneous trunk zzso and lower limbs zzso while the AT of head and neck zzso did not decrease significantly zzso zzso zzso These results indicated a changed fat patterning and evidence for this was obtained by expressing the AT volume of each depot as a percentage of the total AT volume both before and after the weight zzso zzso AT constituted zzso of the total AT before and zzso after weight zzso Thus, the fraction of AT in zzso was changed by zzso zzso zzso units which was significantly different from the change in leg AT zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tended to be different from the change of subcutaneous AT zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, the AT distribution was changed in a zzso direction by weight zzso Changes in zzso AT area ratios of different trunk scans were not consistent and, in a stricter sense, fat patterning cannot be studied with area zzso since AT areas cannot be expressed as zzso of the total AT zzso
