The reduction in plasma cholesterol with increase in large and lower dense LDL zzso zzso obtained by statins is usually associated with a prompt reduction in cardiovascular risk, but after zzso surgery for zzso obesity a delay of some years is zzso No data regarding LDL pattern are available in obese subjects after zzso zzso 

To evaluate the modifications in LDL composition and LDL density after zzso zzso 

29 patients (17 type 2 diabetics zzso 2) and 12 zzso zzso with zzso zzso who failed previous attempts to decrease weight by diet, were studied before and 6 months after zzso diversion for zzso zzso 

In all subjects, besides zzso circulating zzso zzso and insulin, LDL and zzso composition were determined and LDL density was evaluated as zzso 

After surgery we observed a significant reduction of all circulating zzso including zzso zzso zzso The decrease was more marked for total cholesterol zzso than for zzso zzso without a significant difference between type 2 and zzso After surgery, LDL presented a marked decrease in the percentage of cholesterol (from 36 to zzso with a marked increase in the percentage of zzso (from 13 to zzso without appreciable modification of zzso After surgery, 1 patient changed from pattern B to A, while 2 patients previously pattern A became pattern zzso Also a decrease in HDL and zzso was evident in all the subjects with an increase in the zzso 

Our data indicate that after zzso zzso the plasma zzso profile improves along with improvement of plasma zzso and insulin sensitivity, but the zzso become richer in zzso It is possible that the greater zzso of these zzso is compensated by an improvement in the general zzso zzso
