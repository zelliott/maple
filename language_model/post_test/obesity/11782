The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of plasma zzso levels with respect to zzso zzso age and insulin levels in the native zzso zzso The zzso natives live at high zzso in isolated regions in the north of Chile, and they maintain distinctive genetic and cultural zzso Plasma zzso and insulin levels were correlated with body mass index zzso sex and age in a sample of 147 adult zzso subjects who participated in a zzso zzso zzso analysis showed significant differences in zzso levels zzso zzso natural log of zzso by gender zzso zzso and by zzso zzso zzso without significant statistical interaction between gender and zzso The effect of age achieved statistical significance in the zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and insulin are independently associated with plasma zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso analysis of the plasma insulin concentration zzso zzso natural log of insulin zzso shows that insulin is strongly associated with zzso zzso zzso although zzso significant differences of insulin levels by sex zzso zzso zzso or age zzso zzso zzso were detected at alpha zzso zzso Thus, in the special zzso where the zzso population live, a strong and independent association between sex, obesity and insulin levels with plasma zzso levels has been zzso
