To examine whether zzso and zzso fat zzso may contribute to the association between diabetes and cardiovascular risk, including sex-related differences, and the role of zzso we evaluated data in patients with obesity and without diabetes zzso zzso or with impaired zzso tolerance or type 2 diabetes and in lean zzso zzso 

zzso resonance imaging and zzso were used to measure left zzso zzso function and abdominal zzso and visceral fat areas to estimate respective masses, zzso fat zzso and zzso zzso content in 53 subjects (10 lean zzso 25 obese zzso six zzso and 12 type 2 diabetic patients with zzso zzso gender effects and zzso levels were evaluated in the available subset of zzso 

zzso and zzso fat increased progressively across study zzso They were lower in obese women than men zzso zzso zzso but cardiac zzso caught up in zzso women zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso was zzso related with both fat zzso zzso zzso and zzso mass zzso zzso zzso and positively with zzso function zzso zzso zzso In multiple zzso analysis, zzso and zzso fat were independently related with plasma zzso levels, only zzso fat mass was associated with visceral zzso and zzso fat with cardiac output and zzso 

We conclude that zzso zzso zzso and cardiac workload are associated with, and zzso and male gender are independent positive zzso of, heart zzso Once zzso tolerance becomes impaired, the evolution of cardiac zzso is more pronounced in zzso
