An excessive insulin releasing effect of zzso hormone zzso and zzso fragments has been considered as a possible factor contributing to the zzso of genetically obese zzso zzso zzso To investigate this possibility, plasma zzso and insulin responses of zzso to zzso fed lean and zzso mice were examined after zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso each at a dose of 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produced a marked and rapid increase of plasma insulin in both lean and zzso mice, the effect being much greater in the zzso zzso zzso increases of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at 10 zzso in lean and zzso mice respectively, P less than zzso In lean mice plasma zzso zzso showed a protracted decreased zzso decrease of zzso zzso zzso zzso at 120 zzso whereas zzso zzso were increased zzso increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso at 60 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso produced zzso similar but generally smaller effects than zzso zzso while zzso zzso did not significantly affect zzso and insulin zzso In 24 h zzso mice, zzso zzso produced similar but generally smaller effects than in fed zzso The results suggest that the effects of zzso on zzso and insulin zzso are zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso may exert acute effects which contribute to the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
