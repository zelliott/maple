We evaluated the efficacy of zzso behavioral weight control in the management of severe pediatric zzso 

Participants were 192 children zzso to zzso years of age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The average zzso zzso for age and gender was zzso zzso zzso Families were assigned randomly to the intervention or usual zzso zzso were conducted at zzso 6 months, 12 months, and 18 zzso The primary outcome was percent overweight zzso over the median zzso for age and zzso Changes in blood pressure, body zzso waist zzso and zzso quality of life also were zzso Finally, we examined factors associated with changes in child percent overweight, particularly session zzso 

zzso was associated with significant decreases in child percent overweight, relative to usual care, at 6 zzso zzso analyses documented that intervention was associated with a zzso decrease in child percent overweight at 6 months, compared with a zzso decrease with usual care, but differences were not significant at 12 or 18 zzso Small significant improvements in medical outcomes were observed at 6 and 12 zzso Children who zzso or zzso of intervention sessions maintained decreases in percent overweight through 18 zzso Lower baseline percent overweight, better zzso higher income, and greater parent zzso reduction were associated with significantly greater reductions in child percent overweight at 6 months among intervention zzso
