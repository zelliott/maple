To understand the influence of obesity on the morbidity and mortality outcomes of patients who have sustained fractures of the zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso 

zzso level I trauma zzso 

Motor vehicle crash victims enrolled in zzso databases were zzso 

zzso zzso for obese zzso mass index, zzso or zzso 30 zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso patients included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fracture types, length of hospital stay, zzso zzso and zzso Short Form zzso zzso 

We included 665 cases from the database, of which 461 zzso were zzso and 204 zzso were zzso There was no difference in sex, mechanism of injury, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The obese population was older with a mean age of 44 years compared with 41 years for the zzso zzso zzso and had a greater zzso of reported baseline cardiac disease zzso zzso and diabetes zzso zzso zzso patients had more severe injury patterns zzso B and C zzso in the zzso zzso fractures zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso rates did not show a statistically significant difference zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso The baseline physical component on the zzso Short Form zzso zzso was lower among the obese but not statistically different zzso zzso zzso At 6 and 12 months post injury, a decline was noted in both zzso however, no differential decline was noted between the groups zzso zzso 

zzso patients are significantly more likely to have more severe zzso zzso fractures compared with zzso when involved in motor vehicle zzso In this study, there was no statistically significant difference in length of stay, zzso or mortality in obese zzso
