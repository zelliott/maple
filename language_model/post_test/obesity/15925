Our hypothesis was that morbidity related to zzso is already evident in infants and young zzso The major objectives of this study were zzso to assess the prevalence of overweight in a sample of hospitalized infants and zzso to assess the prevalence of morbidity in overweight infants in a community-based zzso 

The hospital admission study population included zzso zzso zzso months of age, who were admitted for any reason to the pediatric department at the zzso Zion Medical Center in zzso For the community-based sample, we identified overweight infants zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso months zzso zzso months of age, in 8 mother and child health care facilities in the Haifa zzso of zzso Parents of infants were interviewed by using a structured zzso 

We found that overweight infants zzso to 94th zzso had fewer admissions and fewer repeated admissions than zzso zzso zzso zzso had more admissions than expected, as well as a larger number of repeated zzso In the second part of the study, we found that rates of zzso delays zzso delayed gross motor zzso and zzso were significantly higher in infants zzso zzso In addition, although the results were not statistically zzso infants with overweight suffered more frequently from breathing problems, such as asthma and zzso When the mothers were asked to assess whether their child was overweight, only zzso of mothers of overweight children thought that the child was zzso 

The high admission rates for infants zzso zzso and the high zzso rates of respiratory zzso zzso and delayed gross motor skills in overweight infants support our hypothesis regarding early morbidity associated with zzso
