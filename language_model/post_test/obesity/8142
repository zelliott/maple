zzso zzso gene is one of the most promising candidate genes for zzso Previous studies have tested the association of zzso in zzso gene with obesity and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin level, zzso level and zzso zzso However, the results of these studies were still zzso To determine whether zzso gene is associated with obesity in zzso population, we performed a zzso association study between zzso zzso and obesity and zzso zzso zzso 

Seven single zzso zzso zzso in zzso region of zzso gene were zzso in three zzso families including 33 zzso The previously reported zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated by zzso and direct sequencing zzso Single zzso association and zzso association analyses were performed using the zzso association test zzso To determine zzso zzso of these zzso in general population, 52 unrelated individuals from the general zzso population were also zzso 

Two zzso showed significant associations with plasma zzso level zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso were constructed with these zzso the risk AA zzso zzso zzso was positively associated with plasma zzso level zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso and zzso are predicted to modify zzso binding zzso 

Our study provided that two functional zzso in zzso regulatory region of zzso gene are associated with plasma zzso level as a quantitative zzso It suggested that zzso and zzso have an important role in regulating plasma zzso zzso
