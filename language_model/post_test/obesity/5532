To investigate the association between the zzso of beta zzso zzso gene and obesity in patients with type 2 zzso 

Body mass, zzso ratio, blood pressure and blood lipids were measured in 154 type 2 diabetic zzso zzso chain reaction and the restriction zzso length zzso analysis were used to determine the wild, zzso and zzso forms of beta zzso zzso zzso 

The frequency of the zzso zzso was zzso and the frequency of zzso zzso was zzso The zzso frequency of the genetic types was significantly different between the obese and non-obese type 2 diabetes zzso zzso The body mass, zzso blood pressure, zzso blood pressure, zzso were significantly different, when those with zzso zzso were compared with those with zzso zzso 

The genetic zzso of beta zzso zzso in patients with type 2 diabetes is probably related to zzso
