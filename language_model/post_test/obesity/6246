Blood pressure, zzso zzso data, and red blood cell zzso zzso transport zzso were obtained in 27 men with body mass indexes zzso greater than zzso zzso and 21 men with zzso less than zzso zzso zzso with higher zzso had significantly higher zzso and zzso pressure measured both zzso and zzso P less than zzso zzso zzso blood flow zzso was substantially higher in the heavier subjects, P less than zzso whereas zzso vascular resistance zzso levels were not different, P greater than zzso Despite the higher baseline zzso blood flow, the high zzso group displayed a greater rise in flow, P less than zzso in response to a regional zzso infusion, an index of vascular zzso zzso of multiple zzso analysis suggested that overweight was indirectly correlated with vascular zzso via a relationship with zzso plasma zzso zzso a marker of sympathetic drive, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that in overweight men zzso higher zzso is not fully zzso by lower zzso zzso increased vascular zzso contributes to the altered zzso relationship and thereby to the elevated blood zzso and zzso greater sympathetic drive and zzso zzso activity may explain the elevated vascular zzso
