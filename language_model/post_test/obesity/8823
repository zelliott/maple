zzso obesity assessment is not easy, and although zzso zzso zzso is an accurate zzso this technique is expensive and sometimes not suitable in clinical zzso We developed a new two-dimensional elliptical zzso equation to zzso visceral obesity and evaluated the zzso and the reliability of the new equation compared with zzso 

We collected zzso and CT data from zzso subjects zzso zzso 61, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A validation group of 32 subjects was also zzso An equation for the assessment of visceral obesity was developed using multiple zzso zzso Once zzso the equation was compared with previous zzso Tests for accuracy included mean differences, analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Multiple zzso analysis revealed that the zzso and zzso diameters and the zzso zzso were significant contributors to the zzso The final equation was: visceral area zzso area zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso diameter - zzso zzso zzso diameter - zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients with zzso area ratio zzso zzso were classified as having visceral zzso The zzso equation was zzso showing a significant association with zzso assessed by CT zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso test showed no significant differences with zzso zzso zzso zzso The reliability was high zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

The new two-dimensional and elliptical zzso equation is valid to assess visceral obesity and is more precise than previous zzso
