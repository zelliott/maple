The zzso protein zzso zzso is the downstream constituent of a zzso cascade that acts as a sensor of cellular energy zzso Current data unequivocally indicate that zzso zzso plays a key role in the control of the whole body energy balance, by zzso peripheral signals, such as hormones and zzso with central signals, such as zzso and zzso zzso changes in energy zzso Although the molecular details of these interactions are not fully zzso recent evidence has suggested that the interaction between zzso with zzso zzso metabolism and other zzso sensors, such as the zzso protein 2 zzso the zzso target of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso 1 zzso may play a main role in the zzso control of feeding and energy zzso Here, we zzso the role of zzso zzso as whole body energy zzso zzso this key zzso and especially its functions at central level may provide new therapeutic targets for the treatment of zzso zzso and zzso
