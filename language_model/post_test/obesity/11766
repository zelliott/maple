This study was undertaken to determine the effect of previous exercise on zzso tissue responsiveness to zzso stimulation and on zzso tissue blood flow zzso Eight lean and 8 obese men zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso v zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were investigated with abdominal subcutaneous zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso infusion zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was administered in zzso in the zzso zzso before and 2 hours after a zzso exercise bout (90 minutes of cycling at zzso of zzso zzso zzso No differences in the response zzso in zzso zzso v zzso zzso to zzso infusions were found between the 2 zzso In both groups, there was no difference in the response to zzso versus zzso zzso When the zzso agent zzso zzso g zzso zzso was infused into the zzso zzso to control for the vascular effects of zzso an interaction effect between exercise and zzso dose was zzso zzso showed an attenuated response to the high zzso dose after exercise zzso 251 zzso 42 zzso zzso zzso zzso obese, 288 zzso 77 zzso zzso zzso versus before exercise zzso 352 zzso 62 zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso v zzso obese, 380 zzso 94 zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso v zzso indicating a zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso plasma zzso increased after exercise in both groups, but the increase was delayed in obese zzso zzso plasma insulin was higher in the obese versus lean subjects at all times, and decreased during recovery in both zzso In conclusion, abdominal subcutaneous zzso tissue responsiveness to zzso is not enhanced zzso in lean and obese men, whereas previous exercise increases zzso Furthermore, the data suggest slower zzso zzso zzso and resistance to the zzso effect of insulin in the zzso
