The goal was to estimate the sibling zzso ratio for Type 2 diabetes in families with diabetes occurring in middle zzso Because diabetes zzso involves environmental zzso and genetic zzso we sought to identify zzso of the recurrence zzso 

We surveyed patients diagnosed at ages zzso years zzso zzso zzso to obtain information on the occurrence of diabetes in their relatives, particularly siblings zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of diabetes in the US population were used for zzso 

The overall sibling zzso ratio for diabetes was low, about zzso in the zzso families and even lower in three other studies that were zzso for zzso In all studies, the diabetes risk in siblings of index cases without a history of diabetes in a parent was similar to that in the general population, suggesting that genetic factors contributed to the occurrence of diabetes in only a minority of these zzso The fact that zzso ratios were elevated only in families with one or two diabetic parents indicates that zzso to Type 2 diabetes is transmitted primarily through an affected zzso In addition, the sibling zzso ratios were elevated even further in families with diabetes in both a parent and zzso of the index case, and in siblings of non-obese index cases zzso ideal body weight zzso 

The selection of families with non-obese index cases and vertical transmission of diabetes through three generations may improve the success of efforts to map zzso genes for Type 2 zzso
