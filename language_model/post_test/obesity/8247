zzso gastric bypass zzso surgery, an effective treatment for zzso zzso commonly leads to near complete resolution of type 2 zzso The underlying mechanisms, however, remain unclear and factors other than weight loss alone may be zzso 

To determine whether increased zzso insulin sensitivity after zzso drives the rapid improvement in zzso zzso zzso rats received either an insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso or a control zzso zzso that was zzso into the zzso zzso zzso Six weeks later, rats underwent zzso or control gastrointestinal zzso 

Four weeks after surgery, weight loss was comparable in zzso and surgical zzso Nevertheless, only zzso rats that received the control zzso demonstrated both improved zzso and peripheral insulin zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso production zzso by 50% zzso zzso with zzso whereas the effect of insulin on zzso was completely absent in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By contrast, both zzso groups displayed an identical twofold increase in zzso peripheral zzso zzso The animals that underwent control gastrointestinal surgery failed to show any improvement in either zzso or peripheral insulin zzso zzso zzso did not influence the magnitude of insulin zzso 

Our findings demonstrate that zzso surgery in zzso obese rats enhances zzso and peripheral insulin sensitivity independently of weight zzso The improved zzso but not the zzso response to insulin is zzso centrally at the level of the zzso These data provide direct evidence that the zzso benefits of zzso surgery are not simply a consequence of weight loss but likely in part involve the central nervous zzso
