For most individuals, long-term maintenance of weight loss requires zzso supportive zzso Internet-based weight loss maintenance programs offer considerable potential for meeting this zzso zzso design processes are required to maximize adherence and minimize zzso 

This paper describes the development, zzso and use of a Web-based intervention program designed to help those who have recently lost weight sustain their weight loss over 1 zzso 

The weight loss maintenance zzso was developed over a zzso period by an interdisciplinary team of public health researchers, behavior change intervention experts, applications developers, and interface zzso Key interactive features of the final site include social support, zzso written guidelines for diet and physical activity, links to appropriate zzso supportive tools for behavior change, check-in zzso tailored reinforcement messages, and problem solving and zzso prevention zzso The weight loss maintenance program included a reminder system zzso zzso and telephone zzso that prompted participants to return to the zzso if they missed their check-in zzso If there was no log-in response to the zzso and telephone automated zzso a staff member called the zzso We tracked the proportion of participants with at least one log-in per month, and analyzed zzso as a result of automated zzso 

The mean age of the 348 participants enrolled in an ongoing zzso trial and assigned to use the zzso was 56 years; zzso were female, and 38% were African zzso While weight loss data will not be available until zzso zzso use remained high during the first year with over zzso of the participants still using the zzso during month zzso During the first 52 weeks, participants averaged 35 weeks with at least one zzso zzso and telephone zzso appear to be very effective at helping participants sustain ongoing zzso zzso 

zzso interactive zzso is expensive, complex, and time zzso We found that extensive paper zzso well in advance of programming and a versatile product manager who could work with project staff at all levels of detail were essential to keeping the development process zzso
