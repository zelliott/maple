The effect of obesity on the relationship between very low density zzso zzso zzso production rate and concentration was studied in 80 subjects whose zzso zzso ranged from zzso zzso zzso and whose relative weight varied from zzso There was a positive correlation between zzso production rate and plasma zzso concentration in all 80 patients zzso zzso zzso which was highly statistically significant zzso less than zzso Both male and female subjects were subdivided into zzso on the basis of relative zzso the relationship between zzso production rate and plasma zzso concentration was found to be comparable in all zzso These observations suggest that moderate degrees of obesity do not affect zzso zzso in patients whose plasma zzso levels vary over an extremely wide zzso
