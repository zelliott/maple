zzso drilling into the zzso areas of zzso zzso of the zzso head remains a challenging zzso particularly in obese zzso This study was conducted to evaluate the precision of zzso based drilling and the associated radiation exposure in an zzso model of zzso 

In an zzso model of zzso zzso in zzso 20 zzso were drilled under the guidance of an zzso navigation system zzso zzso zzso zzso and 20 more were drilled conventionally under zzso control zzso 

A statistically significant difference was found with respect to the distance from the drill tip to the desired zzso of the zzso with a mean distance of zzso zzso for the zzso group and zzso zzso for the control zzso Furthermore, a significant difference was found in the number of drilling corrections required, as well as the radiation exposure time: The zzso group required a mean of zzso second zzso or corrections of the drilling direction, compared to zzso for the control group, and the duration of radiation exposure was less than 1 second for the zzso group and zzso seconds for the control zzso 

zzso guided by the zzso navigation system shows high precision, even under difficult circumstances such as those encountered in zzso with a marked reduction in the duration of radiation zzso
