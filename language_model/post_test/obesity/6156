We investigated the molecular zzso that play a role in zzso signaling during the development of left zzso zzso zzso due to pressure zzso To this end, zzso zzso deficient and zzso control mice were subjected zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Control sham zzso and zzso mice, along with zzso and zzso zzso deficient mice were subjected zzso zzso zzso zzso for 15 days and then evaluated for zzso zzso and molecular changes associated with pressure overload zzso 

zzso by zzso revealed a significant increase in left zzso mass zzso and wall thickness in zzso mice subjected to zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared to zzso Analysis of the expression of molecular markers of zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a blunted increase in the level of zzso in zzso mice as compared to zzso zzso We observed that zzso plays a role in modulating the zzso activity of the promoter of the zzso zzso zzso acts by regulating zzso a member of the nuclear factor activated T cell zzso family of zzso factors in zzso Our in zzso studies revealed that zzso mice subjected to zzso failed to activate the zzso in the heart, however, zzso injection of zzso in zzso mice restored the zzso zzso activity and induced expression of the zzso zzso 

This study establishes the role of zzso as an zzso agent during pressure overload zzso and suggests that a key molecular event is the zzso zzso zzso of zzso that regulates the zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso
