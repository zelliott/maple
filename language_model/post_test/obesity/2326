To measure the prevalence of persistent zzso in zzso 

We collected demographic and zzso data and 4 zzso blood pressure zzso zzso on zzso zzso The mean of the second, third, and fourth zzso zzso determined each student's zzso status per visit, with up to 3 total zzso Final zzso status was classified as normal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at the first zzso variable zzso zzso 90th zzso or zzso zzso zzso at the first visit and subsequently zzso abnormal zzso zzso 90th zzso or zzso zzso zzso at 3 visits but not zzso or zzso zzso zzso 95th zzso at 3 zzso The abnormal group included those with persistent zzso zzso zzso 90th zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on 3 zzso zzso analysis allowed for comparison of groups and identification of characteristics associated with final zzso zzso 

Of zzso students zzso zzso were classified as normal, zzso as zzso zzso as zzso and zzso as zzso The prevalence of persistent zzso was zzso zzso similarly affected the odds for variable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and abnormal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and dramatically increased the odds for hypertension zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Almost zzso of the students had at least one elevated zzso measurement significantly influenced by zzso Treating obesity may be essential to preventing zzso and/or zzso
