zzso of obesity in adult life is subject to programming during zzso To examine whether in zzso exposure to maternal obesity increases the risk of obesity in zzso we developed an zzso model of maternal obesity in rats utilizing zzso feeding of diets via total zzso zzso Feeding liquid diets to adult female rats at 220 zzso per day zzso excess zzso compared with zzso zzso per day for 3 zzso caused substantial increase in body weight gain, zzso serum insulin, zzso and insulin zzso zzso or obese female rats were zzso with ad zzso zzso male zzso Exposure to obesity was ensured to be limited only to the maternal in zzso environment by zzso zzso to lean zzso having ad zzso access to zzso diets throughout zzso Numbers of zzso birth weight, and size were not affected by maternal zzso Male offspring from each group were weaned at zzso day zzso to either zzso diets or high-fat diets zzso fat zzso Body weights of offspring from obese zzso did not differ from offspring of lean zzso when fed zzso diets through zzso However, offspring from obese zzso gained remarkably greater zzso zzso body weight and higher % body fat when fed a high-fat zzso Body composition was assessed by zzso X-ray computerized zzso and weights of zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin sensitivity, and food intake were also assessed in the zzso Our data suggest that maternal obesity at conception leads to fetal programming of zzso which could result in obesity in later zzso
