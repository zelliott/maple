zzso plays an important role in the control of food intake and energy metabolism by interacting with its zzso zzso in the zzso Several alternatively spliced zzso of zzso have been zzso To study the expression patterns and the potential biological function of these zzso in the brain, the distribution of zzso zzso zzso zzso was examined by in zzso zzso In agreement with previous studies, strong signals for zzso zzso were detected in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, intense signals were observed in several other brain areas including zzso cortex, zzso cell layer of the zzso and zzso zzso With zzso zzso a differential expression pattern of zzso was zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso and zzso are abundantly expressed in the zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso are significantly expressed in the zzso zzso The preferential expression of zzso in the zzso is in support of its role in zzso the zzso effect of zzso The zzso of zzso with zzso in the zzso may suggest a possible interaction between the two zzso Finally, the detection of zzso zzso in a number of other brain regions may indicate the involvement of zzso in additional as yet undefined zzso zzso
