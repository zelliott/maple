Recently Zhang et zzso cloned a gene that is expressed only in zzso tissue of the zzso The obese zzso of the zzso mouse is linked to a zzso in the obese gene that results in expression of a truncated inactive zzso Human and rat zzso for this gene are zzso Previous experiments predict such a hormone to have a zzso zzso zzso zzso Y stimulates food zzso decreases zzso and increases plasma insulin and zzso levels making it a potential zzso Here we express the obese protein in zzso coli and find that it suppresses food intake and decreases body weight dramatically when administered to normal and zzso mice but not zzso zzso mice, which are thought to lack the appropriate zzso zzso binding was detected in the rat zzso One mechanism by which this protein regulated food intake and metabolism was zzso of zzso synthesis and zzso
