zzso dysfunction is associated with childhood obesity and is closely linked to the amount and function of zzso zzso zzso However, it remains unclear whether zzso zzso cells increase with after-school exercise in overweight and obese zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of an after-school exercise zzso on zzso cell function in overweight and obese zzso 

A total of 29 zzso children zzso zzso zzso zzso were randomly divided into control zzso no after-school exercise, zzso zzso zzso and after-school exercise zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso after-school exercise intervention consisted of 3 days of combined zzso and resistance exercise per zzso Each zzso exercise zzso included 10 minutes of zzso and 10 minutes of zzso after zzso zzso (a cell surface marker on zzso stem zzso zzso (a cell surface marker on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks using flow zzso 

Increased percentages of zzso zzso and zzso cells were observed in the after-school exercise group zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso compared with the control zzso zzso zzso thickness decreased after 12 weeks in the after-school exercise group zzso zzso zzso compared with the control zzso 

This study provides preliminary evidence that a combined after-school exercise zzso may represent an effective intervention strategy for improving vascular repair and zzso cell function, leading to improved cardiovascular health in overweight and obese zzso
