Few studies have assessed secular changes in the levels of cardiovascular risk factors zzso in populations of low or middle income zzso The systematic collection of a broad set of both traditional and zzso zzso in 1989 and 2004 in the population of the zzso islands provides a unique opportunity to examine trends at a fairly early stage of the zzso era in a country in the African zzso 

Two examination surveys were conducted in independent random samples of the population aged zzso years in 1989 and 2004, attended by respectively zzso and zzso participants zzso zzso All results are zzso to the WHO standard zzso 

In 2004 zzso 1989, the levels of the main traditional zzso have either zzso zzso smoking zzso zzso zzso p zzso mean blood pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso or only moderately increased, zzso median zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In contrast, marked zzso trends were found for obesity zzso zzso zzso p zzso and several zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso median zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso mean blood zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso median insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso median zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso and diabetes zzso zzso zzso p zzso At age zzso the prevalence of elevated total cardiovascular risk tended to decrease zzso zzso risk zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the prevalence of the zzso syndrome (which zzso several zzso zzso nearly doubled zzso zzso zzso p zzso Data on physical activity and on intake of alcohol, fruit and vegetables are also zzso Awareness and treatment rates improved substantially for hypertension and diabetes, but control rates improved for the former zzso Median levels of the zzso zzso increased between 1989 and 2004 within all zzso zzso suggesting that the worsening levels of zzso zzso in the population were not only related to increasing zzso levels in the zzso 

The levels of several traditional zzso improved over time, while marked zzso trends were observed for zzso diabetes and several zzso zzso Thus, in this population, the rapid health transition was characterized by substantial changes in the patterns of zzso More generally, this analysis suggests the importance of surveillance systems to identify risk factor trends and the need for preventive strategies to promote healthy lifestyles and zzso
