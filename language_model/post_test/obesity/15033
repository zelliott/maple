Being overweight or obese increases risk for zzso zzso Although both body mass index zzso and waist circumference zzso measure the level of overweight and zzso zzso may be more important because of its closer relationship to total body zzso Because zzso is typically not assessed in clinical practice, this study sought to develop and verify a model to predict zzso from zzso and demographic data, and to use the predicted zzso to assess zzso zzso 

Data were obtained from the Third National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso in Communities Study zzso We developed linear zzso models for men and women using zzso data, fitting waist circumference as a function of zzso For zzso those zzso were applied to ARIC data, assigning a predicted zzso to each zzso We used the predicted zzso to assess abdominal obesity and zzso zzso 

The model correctly classified zzso of zzso subjects with respect to abdominal zzso Median differences between actual and predicted zzso were zzso zzso for men and zzso zzso for zzso In zzso the model closely estimated the observed zzso zzso difference: zzso zzso for men, zzso zzso for zzso correctly zzso zzso of ARIC subjects with respect to abdominal obesity and zzso to zzso as to zzso zzso model is zzso to Caucasian and African-American adult populations because it was constructed from data on a large, zzso sample of men and women in the United States, and then validated in a population with a larger representation of zzso 

The model accurately estimates zzso and identifies zzso zzso It should be useful for health care practitioners and public health officials who wish to identify individuals and populations at risk for zzso disease when zzso data are zzso
