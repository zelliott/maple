There are different equations to estimate insulin sensitivity by using zzso with a reasonable approximation to whole body sensitivity obtained with the zzso zzso Further work is needed to address their role in clinical practice as markers of the zzso syndrome and zzso for cardiovascular zzso In the present study, we determined plasma zzso and insulin values during an zzso test in 144 overweight and obese zzso We assessed insulin resistance by the use of different equations and established their relationship with cardiovascular risk factors associated to the insulin resistance zzso zzso the patients by zzso of body mass index zzso the different surrogate measures clearly demonstrated that the more obese individuals were the most insulin zzso a similar but not significant trend was observed related to the other cardiovascular risk zzso Efforts to use both zzso and zzso zzso and insulin zzso to create indexes for routine use in clinical practice do not seem to be particularly useful in overweight or obese patients, as most of these patients will be zzso and insulin resistance is closely linked but not equal to the zzso zzso
