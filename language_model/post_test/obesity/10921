To evaluate the impact of moderate body weight loss on both zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso activity and expression and to verify whether variation in zzso could be related to changes in zzso zzso 

zzso study of a zzso weight reducing program zzso zzso zzso zzso below the subjects' estimated sedentary energy zzso 

Thirty two obese subjects zzso men and 18 zzso zzso aged zzso zzso whose body zzso ranged from 34 to zzso zzso 

zzso tissue zzso from the abdominal and zzso zzso various zzso and fat distribution parameters zzso zzso and zzso zzso plasma zzso of zzso and zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso and zzso at baseline and 4-6 weeks after the zzso weight reducing program, when subjects were weight zzso 

In response to weight loss, zzso activity of both regions did not change in men, but decreased in zzso Regarding zzso zzso no interaction between time and sex was observed in response to the zzso In both zzso the higher was the zzso zzso activity, the greater was the reduction of this zzso activity in response to weight loss, in both the abdominal and zzso zzso zzso P values ranging from zzso to zzso Body weight loss promoted a significant reduction in plasma zzso zzso insulin and zzso zzso zzso in men whereas only plasma zzso and zzso levels were decreased in women zzso Although the average reduction in zzso levels in response to weight loss was not zzso the higher was the decrease in zzso zzso activity, the greater was the reduction in plasma zzso levels zzso zzso in response to weight loss, in zzso An inverse relationship was observed between changes in zzso zzso activity and zzso levels variation in men zzso zzso 

zzso variation in zzso activity differs between men and women in response to moderate body weight loss although the corresponding zzso zzso levels remain zzso and zzso changes in zzso zzso activity are related to weight loss induced variation in plasma zzso zzso
