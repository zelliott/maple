zzso the zzso gene product, centrally regulates weight zzso zzso recipients are exposed to many factors affecting body zzso zzso has been reported to activate the peripheral immune zzso In this study, we evaluated serum zzso levels and factors contributing to zzso the relationship between serum zzso levels and zzso stem and mature zzso and their role in the rejection process in zzso transplant zzso 

zzso zzso transplant recipients were included in the zzso Patients were grouped according to serum zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We determined serum zzso levels by zzso and absolute number of zzso zzso zzso zzso stem cells, zzso and zzso zzso in peripheral blood by flow zzso 

The zzso patients constituted zzso of the transplant zzso The mean peripheral blood zzso zzso count was significantly higher in zzso patients than in zzso or zzso patients zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, zzso There were no significant differences in the mean zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso count and zzso ratio among the groups with respect to serum zzso zzso zzso zzso count was positively correlated with serum zzso levels zzso zzso 

zzso is not rare during the zzso zzso Our data support the results of previous experimental studies that have demonstrated the effect of the zzso hormone on zzso stem zzso The central and peripheral effects of zzso may differ on zzso stem cells and a serum threshold level may apply for the central zzso
