Increased zzso in abdominal zzso has been suggested to be of importance for the insulin resistance typical for abdominal zzso In order to differentiate between fat distribution, measured as zzso ratio zzso and amount of body fat, zzso disposal during a zzso clamp as well as zzso in isolated cells from abdominal and zzso regions were studied in 20 obese and 20 lean zzso women with a high zzso zzso 10) and low zzso zzso 10) zzso zzso The zzso response was increased in cells from obese women irrespective of zzso Furthermore, zzso was enhanced in abdominal compared with the zzso cells in obese women with a high zzso zzso blood zzso and insulin were increased in both groups of obese women while the degree of insulin resistance was most pronounced in the obese women with a high zzso It is concluded that increased body fat is associated with both insulin resistance and increased zzso and that this relationship is stronger in the presence of a high zzso A high zzso may increase the expression of obesity as a risk for insulin resistance and this may be zzso through an increased zzso zzso
