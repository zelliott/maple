zzso and hypertension are two closely associated conditions and obesity probably zzso to zzso In this investigation we evaluated central, systemic zzso and zzso volume characteristics of 51 established zzso obese subjects zzso for degree of zzso zzso according to body mass index zzso was as zzso lean zzso 17 subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso moderately obese, 19 subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso severely obese, 15 subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso by significantly increased cardiac output and total plasma volume zzso less than zzso and by decreased total peripheral resistance (not zzso and left zzso ejection fraction zzso less than zzso These changes appear to be related to the degree of zzso zzso correlation zzso between body mass index and cardiac zzso total blood volume, total peripheral resistance and ejection fraction were also zzso In conclusion, established hypertension in the severely obese patient appears to be a separate zzso zzso
