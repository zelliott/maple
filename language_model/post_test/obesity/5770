This study aimed to investigate the influence of childhood obesity on energetic cost during normal walking and to determine if obese children choose a walking strategy zzso their gait zzso 

Sixteen obese children with no functional abnormalities were matched by age and gender with 16 zzso zzso All participants were asked to walk along a nearly circular track 30 m in length at a self-selected zzso zzso data, zzso and ground reaction force were collected during walking using a three-dimensional motion analysis zzso zzso cost was collected by a portable gas zzso zzso 

The mechanical energy expenditure zzso was zzso higher in obese children than in zzso zzso The net zzso cost was zzso higher in obese zzso No difference was found in the zzso rate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mechanical efficiency between the obese and zzso zzso The obese children walked with a zzso zzso slower walking speed, zzso shorter zzso and zzso longer zzso phase compared with zzso zzso In addition, no differences were found in the zzso and vertical body center of mass zzso 

Body mass played a dominant role in the total zzso and mechanical cost per zzso zzso children may adopt a walking strategy to avoid an increase in the zzso cost and the mechanical work required to move their excess body zzso
