The zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin levels, insulin resistance, cholesterol, zzso zzso and zzso levels were significantly higher in ST patients compared to controls zzso The zzso analysis between zzso components and ST showed that only high zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso and low HDL levels zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly associated with zzso zzso linear zzso analysis of the zzso of high plasma zzso levels, showed that high zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso and low HDL levels zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso were significant zzso 

The results of this study suggested that the presence of both ST and zzso in patients with zzso may be associated with high levels of zzso and low levels of HDL and this could suggest that changing the life style of patients with ST may have a beneficial zzso
