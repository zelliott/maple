zzso is characterized by decreased rates of skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso Since zzso equals the product of the zzso zzso difference zzso across muscle and blood flow into muscle, reduced blood flow and/or tissue activity zzso can lead to decreased zzso To examine this issue, we studied six lean zzso 68 zzso 3 zzso mean zzso zzso and six obese zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso The insulin zzso zzso for whole body and leg zzso were constructed using the zzso clamp and leg balance techniques over a large range of serum insulin zzso In lean and obese subjects, whole body zzso zzso blood flow, and leg zzso increased in a dose dependent fashion and zzso rates of all parameters were reduced in obese subjects compared to lean zzso The zzso zzso for whole body zzso leg zzso and zzso were zzso in obese subjects with an zzso two- to zzso higher than that of lean subjects for each zzso zzso blood flow increased approximately twofold from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso in lean, P less than zzso and from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso in obese subjects, P less than zzso The zzso for zzso effect to increase leg blood flow was about fourfold higher for obese zzso zzso than lean subjects zzso zzso P less than zzso zzso decreased insulin sensitivity in human obesity is not only due to lower zzso extraction in zzso zzso but also to lower blood flow to these zzso Thus, in zzso insulin resistance can be due to a zzso in insulin action at the tissue level and/or a zzso in zzso zzso action to increase blood flow to insulin sensitive zzso
