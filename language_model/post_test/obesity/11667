To examine the association between baseline testosterone levels and changes in visceral zzso in zzso zzso 

Prospective zzso zzso 

zzso zzso males enrolled in a community-based population zzso 

At zzso 110 men received a zzso oral zzso tolerance test zzso and an assessment of body mass index zzso visceral zzso measured as zzso fat area zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin and zzso zzso and total testosterone zzso zzso was zzso after zzso zzso zzso fat areas were also measured by CT in the abdomen, zzso and zzso The total fat zzso was calculated as the sum of zzso and total subcutaneous fat areas zzso 

After zzso zzso increased by a mean of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso total testosterone was significantly correlated with change in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not to any appreciable degree with change in zzso zzso or zzso In a linear zzso model with change in zzso as the dependent zzso baseline testosterone was significantly related to this outcome while adjusting for baseline zzso zzso zzso age, diabetes zzso status zzso by the WHO diagnostic zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for baseline testosterone zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

In this zzso male zzso lower baseline total testosterone independently predicts an increase in zzso This would suggest that by zzso to an increase in visceral zzso low levels of testosterone may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes zzso
