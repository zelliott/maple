zzso association studies zzso have identified some common zzso associated with obesity risk in European zzso However, their influences on zzso zzso for the Chinese children at zzso are not widely clear zzso To address this question, we conducted a study that aims to examine effects of eight previously reported zzso zzso zzso zzso on four zzso zzso in a sample of Chinese children aged zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were measured in zzso children zzso years, zzso zzso from Shanghai Children's Sleep zzso Eight zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were zzso using zzso laser zzso of flight mass zzso Linear zzso and genetic additive model were used to test for the association zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso body mass index zzso zzso ratio and body zzso 

Only two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were associated with all zzso zzso with zzso After adjusting for multiple tests, zzso is the only one significantly associated with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso explained zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso respectively, that are almost zzso of the previously zzso zzso In addition, zzso was associated with four zzso in boys, but not in zzso In contrast, zzso showed a strong association only in zzso Six other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not associated with obesity zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso are associated with obesity zzso during zzso in Chinese children, but candidate zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have no significant effects on obesity zzso The findings also suggest that obesity zzso genes may exert more obvious effects during children's zzso In addition, gender differences may exist in various zzso zzso
