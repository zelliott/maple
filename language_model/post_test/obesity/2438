There is increasing evidence that peptides in the brain are important in the control of food zzso Administration of zzso and zzso peptides have zzso hunger and zzso zzso To evaluate the interaction of these peptides and their role in the central nervous system, zzso of zzso were measured in the zzso of rats following peripheral administration of zzso in addition, effects of feeding and zzso and obesity were zzso In zzso zzso zzso rats zzso zzso were decreased in the zzso nucleus zzso zzso nucleus zzso zzso nucleus zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In fed compared with zzso rats zzso zzso were higher in the anterior zzso zzso and lower in the zzso in obese compared with lean rats, zzso were higher in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lateral zzso and zzso These results show that peripheral injections of zzso can decrease zzso of zzso in the brain and suggest a mechanism by which these peptides may interact to influence zzso In addition, the findings support the hypothesis that the zzso which is typical of obese rats may be due to increased zzso of zzso
