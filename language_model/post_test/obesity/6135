To examine the prevalence of zzso and zzso obesity zzso as defined by different zzso including zzso skeletal muscle mass zzso skeletal muscle mass index zzso and zzso for Korean adults, and to explore the association between SO and zzso zzso 

Our study sample included 526 participants zzso women, 198 zzso for whom complete data on body composition were collected using available dual X-ray zzso zzso National zzso Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria were used to identify the individuals with zzso zzso 

The prevalence of zzso and SO is higher in older zzso Using two zzso of zzso below reference values from young, healthy adults as a definition of zzso the prevalence of zzso and SO was zzso and zzso in older zzso or zzso zzso men and zzso and zzso in older women, zzso The prevalence of zzso using the zzso method was zzso in older men and zzso in older zzso In addition, using two zzso of zzso the prevalence of zzso and SO was zzso and zzso respectively, in older men and zzso and zzso respectively, in older zzso Among women, SO subjects defined by the zzso had three times the risk of zzso syndrome zzso ratios zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso and zzso obese subjects had approximately twice the risk of zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso compared with normal zzso Similar trends were observed in zzso 

The prevalence and zzso values of zzso and SO in the Korean population were evaluated using different zzso Among the different zzso of zzso and zzso SO only defined using the zzso was associated with the risk of zzso zzso As the Korean population gets older and more obese, the zzso of SO need to be zzso
