zzso differentiation is a zzso program under regulation by several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso serves as a master regulator of zzso However, the zzso zzso for zzso remained elusive until zzso was identified recently as an zzso zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso alcohol zzso 2 zzso here termed zzso zzso zzso is a new member of zzso zzso family that converts zzso to zzso zzso is accelerated when zzso zzso is silenced in zzso zzso whereas forced expression of zzso significantly decreases zzso zzso expression decreased during zzso zzso accompanied by an increased level of zzso zzso exerts a potent zzso effect by enhancing zzso activity, whereas zzso of zzso in zzso zzso markedly suppressed the zzso effect of zzso by zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these findings demonstrate for the first time that zzso is a novel zzso and plays a critical role in zzso of normal zzso differentiation via regulation of zzso zzso Thus, zzso of zzso might provide a novel avenue for treating obesity and related zzso zzso
