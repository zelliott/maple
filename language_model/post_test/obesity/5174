Several different zzso zzso are known to cause varying degrees of diabetes and obesity in zzso The severity of the diabetes produced depends on both the zzso itself and the interaction of the zzso gene with the zzso zzso zzso the nature of these zzso interactions should aid us in our understanding of similar interactions that occur in human zzso The documentation of several different genes that produce similar, if not zzso zzso syndromes suggests that zzso in many pathways can cause zzso An understanding of these defects in mice should help us to understand similar defects involved in the human zzso The zzso stages in each zzso are zzso The early symptoms include zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of the beta cells of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and severe diabetes are secondary features that result from insulin resistance and the failure to sustain the zzso of massive amounts of zzso All models appear to be able to zzso their food in a more efficient manner than zzso Even when restricted to 50% of that amount of food eaten by a normal zzso zzso are able to maintain their weight and still remain zzso On zzso the stored fat is zzso more zzso One cause of this efficiency in obese and diabetes mice is the ability to convert zzso (the end product of zzso zzso to zzso which, in turn, can be converted to zzso which can sustain continued zzso The occurrence of increased efficiency in obesity and diabetes zzso lends zzso to the zzso hypothesis regarding the maintenance of the deleterious diabetes genes in human zzso
