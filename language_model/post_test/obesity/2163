zzso zzso zzso is extremely common in obese subjects and is associated with the development of insulin resistance and zzso zzso zzso and zzso synthesis predominantly occurs through zzso of zzso However, an alternative zzso for zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso could also contribute to zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and the expression of the three genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined in liver zzso from obese human subjects before and after gastric bypass zzso zzso expression was also assessed in liver of subjects with zzso fatty liver disease zzso or control zzso All zzso genes were expressed in liver, and zzso zzso activity was readily zzso in liver zzso The zzso expression of zzso was highly correlated with zzso activity, whereas zzso and zzso expression was not, and zzso of zzso expression attenuated zzso activity in a zzso cell zzso zzso weight loss following gastric bypass surgery was associated with a significant reduction in zzso and zzso zzso which were also zzso in zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso is active and zzso regulated in human liver and could be an important target for zzso intervention for the treatment of zzso insulin resistance and zzso
