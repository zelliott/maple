The dramatic increase in zzso diseases emphasizes the need to zzso the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying fat zzso zzso of zzso differentiation has been suggested to be an important strategy for preventing or treating zzso In our previous study, we characterized an zzso zzso extract and zzso zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso We showed that these zzso inhibited zzso differentiation and zzso zzso in zzso zzso as assessed by Oil Red O zzso As part of our ongoing search for zzso agents derived from zzso zzso in this work, we characterized five known zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A, all of which were isolated from the active zzso zzso fraction of zzso zzso We determined the chemical structures of these zzso through comparisons of published nuclear magnetic resonance zzso spectral zzso Furthermore, we screened these zzso for their abilities to inhibit zzso over a range of zzso zzso zzso Of these five zzso zzso zzso and zzso A significantly zzso inhibited zzso zzso in zzso cells without affecting cell zzso In addition, the five isolated zzso also significantly reduced the expression levels of several zzso marker zzso including zzso activated zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso although they did so to different zzso These results suggest that the molecular weight of a zzso is an important factor affecting its ability to inhibit zzso differentiation and zzso the expression levels of zzso marker zzso
