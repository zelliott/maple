zzso and related conditions, notably zzso are increasingly zzso zzso influences are known to influence offspring health outcome, but the impact of paternal obesity and zzso on the zzso health of subsequent generations has been zzso 

A high-fat diet zzso was used to induce obesity but not diabetes in male zzso mice, which were subsequently zzso to zzso zzso zzso offspring were raised on a control diet and their zzso were investigated for signs of zzso zzso offspring were generated from both first generation sexes and their zzso were similarly zzso 

We demonstrate a zzso paternal initiation of zzso in both male and female offspring of two generations of zzso Furthermore, we have shown that diminished zzso and zzso functions are transmitted through the first generation paternal line to both sexes of the second generation and via the first generation maternal line to second-generation zzso Our previous findings that founder male obesity alters the zzso of zzso could provide a basis for the zzso programming of zzso in subsequent zzso 

This is the first observation of paternal transmission of diminished zzso health to future generations and could have significant implications for the zzso amplification of zzso observed worldwide in zzso
