We aimed to clarify whether age influences the independent relationship between zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

We explored the effect of age on the independent relationships between indexes of central zzso zzso circumference zzso and zzso ratio zzso and zzso zzso central zzso index zzso or pressure wave amplification assessed from zzso zzso zzso obtained at the zzso zzso and zzso arteries in 508 randomly selected zzso years of age in a population sample of African ancestry with a high prevalence of excess zzso ( approximately zzso overweight or zzso 

In women a strong interaction between age and either zzso or zzso was associated with zzso independent of zzso and the individual terms zzso zzso zzso P zzso This translated into a markedly greater increase in zzso with increases in either zzso or zzso in women older than the median age as compared to women younger zzso of zzso relationships zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso In women older than the median age for the group, a one zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso translated into a zzso zzso increase in zzso as compared to a zzso zzso decrease in zzso for each one zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso in women younger than the median age zzso zzso No index of zzso was independently associated with the log of zzso or zzso wave zzso 

In women of African zzso a greater independent effect of zzso on zzso is noted in older as compared to younger zzso
