There may be concerns about the zzso of kinetic models when studying locomotion in obese subjects zzso The aim of the present study was to improve and validate a relevant representation of obese subject from four kinetic zzso Fourteen teenagers with severe primary obesity zzso zzso 40 zzso zzso zzso were studied during zzso The jumps were filmed by six cameras zzso 50 zzso associated with a zzso zzso zzso All the tested models were zzso the linear mechanical analysis of the jumps gave similar results zzso zzso but there were significantly different segment zzso when considering the subjects' abdomen zzso zzso which was associated with a significantly higher mechanical internal energy expenditure zzso zzso than that estimated from zzso and zzso model, by about 40 and zzso The validation of a zzso specifically for obese subjects will enable a better understanding of their zzso
