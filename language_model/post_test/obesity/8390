Proper sleep is associated with reduced cancer zzso For example, multiple studies have found that habitual sleeping pill usage is related to death from cancer, suggesting that sleep zzso may increase cancer zzso However, other studies have not found a zzso connection between sleep and cancer zzso For this reason, we analyzed US cancer mortality data and sleep quality data to see if there was zzso 

zzso data on sleep zzso in 50 US states and the District of Columbia are from zzso insufficient rest or sleep among zzso States, zzso zzso zzso mortality data are from American Cancer Society Cancer Facts and zzso zzso data are from Vital zzso zzso obesity prevalence among zzso States, zzso Data on race by state are from the 2010 US Census zzso 

There was a significant correlation between percentage of persons who reported insufficient sleep every day in the preceding 30 days versus zzso mortality in 50 US states and the District of Columbia zzso zzso Because cancer survival is higher in whites than blacks and lower in obese individuals, multiple linear zzso was zzso The association of insufficient sleep every day in the preceding 30 days with zzso mortality was significant zzso zzso zzso independent of the percentage obese zzso zzso and unrelated to percentage white population zzso zzso zzso 

zzso in zzso function, perhaps abnormal cortisol metabolism resulting from zzso sleep, may be in part responsible for the increased zzso mortality we report zzso Further studies would be zzso
