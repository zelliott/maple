zzso is an established risk factor for zzso but whether abdominal zzso contributes independently to the risk, particularly in men, remains zzso 

The purpose of the study was to examine the associations of abdominal circumference and zzso ratio, as measures of abdominal zzso with the risk of symptomatic zzso disease in zzso 

We zzso studied measures of abdominal obesity in relation to the zzso of symptomatic zzso disease in a cohort of 29 zzso men who were free of prior zzso disease and who provided complete data on waist and hip zzso Data on weight, zzso and waist and hip zzso were collected in 1986 and in 1987 through self-administered zzso As part of the Health Professionals zzso zzso men reported newly diagnosed symptomatic zzso disease on questionnaires mailed to them every 2 zzso 

We documented zzso new cases of symptomatic zzso disease during 264 185 zzso of zzso After adjustment for body mass index and other known or suspected risk factors for zzso men with a zzso waist zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had a relative risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P for trend zzso compared with men with a zzso waist circumference zzso zzso zzso zzso Men with a zzso zzso or zzso zzso had a zzso relative risk of zzso zzso zzso P for trend zzso compared with men with a zzso ratio zzso 

Our data suggest the presence of a significant association between abdominal zzso and the zzso of symptomatic zzso zzso As measures of abdominal zzso abdominal circumference and zzso ratio predict the risk of developing zzso independently of body mass zzso
