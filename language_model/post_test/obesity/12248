zzso acid zzso has been implicated in zzso of obesity by burning off excessive accumulated zzso zzso a peripheral zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso elevated fat zzso without added energy zzso Its impact on food zzso body weight changes and zzso zzso were examined in rats fed standard zzso and in zzso obesity zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and analgesia responses were measured to examine the brain activity of zzso The acute effects of zzso on food zzso body weight change and zzso zzso profiles were investigated in zzso Energy zzso with zzso was examined by indirect zzso zzso treatment of zzso mice was used to evaluate the long-term effects of zzso 

Distribution of zzso was significantly biased in favor of the periphery instead of the brain, as shown by its low zzso concentration ratio and confirmed by the negative response of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso When administered to rats at 20 zzso zzso zzso showed a unique spectrum of effects with significant weight loss without altered food zzso Furthermore, zzso increased serum levels of free fatty acids and zzso bodies and reduced zzso zzso zzso with preservation of liver zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso profiling of zzso revealed a similar trend, shifting zzso energy zzso toward fat zzso but without elevated energy zzso In zzso mice with chronic treatment, animals treated with zzso at 20 zzso zzso resisted weight gain and showed a reduction of zzso zzso abnormalities such as zzso abdominal fat and liver zzso 

The induction of fatty acid zzso without zzso zzso of energy expenditure by the peripheral zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to cause substantial weight loss in zzso zzso In the presence of zzso fat zzso zzso resists weight gain and zzso zzso zzso risk zzso
