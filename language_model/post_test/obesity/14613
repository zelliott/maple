To investigate whether catch-up growth after maternal zzso would favor the development of obesity in zzso 

zzso rats were submitted to protein or calorie restriction during the course of zzso During zzso zzso were zzso normally zzso or overfed zzso litter size, control zzso zzso At zzso rats were transferred to zzso or to a zzso diet zzso known to induce zzso Body weight, food zzso blood zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso factors contributing to cardiovascular disease development were zzso 

zzso and calorie restriction during gestation led to growth zzso at zzso If zzso was prolonged throughout zzso adult body weight was permanently zzso However, zzso offspring overfed during the zzso period underwent a rapid catch-up growth and became heavier than the normally fed zzso zzso of zzso rats gained more weight than those of zzso fed zzso zzso Feeding an zzso zzso amplified the effect of calorie zzso and offspring that underwent catch-up growth became more obese than zzso The zzso was associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin resistance, and zzso zzso The magnitude of effects varied depending on the type and the timing of early zzso The expression of genes zzso factors implicated in cardiovascular disease was also modulated differently by early zzso and adult zzso 

zzso growth immediately after early zzso should be a key point for the programming of zzso
