Recent surveys have reported a higher prevalence of hypertension and obesity in the zzso population, suggesting a possible link between these two zzso zzso zzso through zzso and zzso mechanisms may contribute to hypertension in zzso zzso patients on zzso whereas the converse may be true in overweight zzso 

The relationship between blood pressure zzso and body mass index zzso was examined in zzso patients on chronic zzso using zzso and zzso zzso 

Based on a zzso zzso zzso zzso 38% were zzso in the zzso zzso A similar figure for a zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Unlike in the general population, there was no positive correlation between zzso and zzso in simple zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The percentage of patients with zzso hypertension was higher among the zzso zzso zzso than the normal weight zzso zzso or overweight patients zzso and were 35, 29 and zzso zzso Furthermore, a negative zzso albeit weak, existed between zzso zzso and markers of nutrition such as serum zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and serum zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso suggesting a plausible link between impaired nutrition and elevated zzso In multiple zzso analysis, the lack of a positive correlation between zzso and zzso persisted zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in spite of adjusting for zzso characteristics and parameters related to zzso and zzso 

We demonstrate for the first time that, unlike the general population, no positive correlation exists between zzso and increasing zzso in zzso zzso Further analysis is necessary to verify our observation and to test the possibility of whether nutritional improvement would aid in the better control of hypertension in dialysis zzso
