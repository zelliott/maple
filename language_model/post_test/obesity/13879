Although described initially as an zzso zzso zzso zzso it is now clear that zzso zzso zzso is expressed in multiple zzso and plays a number of roles in zzso zzso including that of a neutral zzso zzso zzso The major zzso is a single zzso with a molecular mass of zzso 84 zzso and which comprises three major zzso a zzso domain, a regulatory domain zzso several zzso sites and an zzso domain involved in zzso and zzso zzso The activity of zzso is regulated acutely by several mechanisms, including zzso zzso by a number of different protein zzso zzso to different sites within the cell and interaction with a number of zzso some of which may serve to direct the zzso products of zzso away from the zzso It is also apparent from work with zzso zzso mice that more than one zzso species may be classified as a zzso zzso The possible presence of zzso in zzso remains controversial, and the role of the protein in pancreatic zzso has yet to be fully zzso zzso expression of zzso in different cell types may be associated with a number of pathological states, including zzso zzso and Type II zzso
