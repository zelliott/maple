zzso in the zzso of zzso in zzso tissue play a key role in inflammation and insulin resistance zzso The zzso of zzso in subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso and the relationship between zzso markers and zzso in women with zzso zzso syndrome zzso remain zzso The objectives of this study are to characterize the gene expression of zzso markers and zzso in the SAT of zzso women and to estimate their relationships with circulating levels of zzso and zzso 

The zzso study involves 16 zzso women and 18 normal control zzso zzso and zzso markers in the circulation and SAT were determined using zzso quantitative zzso or zzso zzso zzso was estimated using the zzso model assessment zzso 

The gene expression levels of zzso along with zzso zzso and zzso in SAT remained significantly higher in zzso women than in normal women zzso However, no significant differences were found in zzso zzso expression in SAT between women with and without zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso abundance provided a stronger contribution to models predicting serum levels of zzso zzso than did zzso zzso zzso Lastly, increased zzso was associated with increased zzso in zzso women, and this association was independent of both overall and visceral zzso 

The high expression level of zzso zzso in SAT was proved to be an important feature in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso abundance made a stronger contribution to models predicting zzso in which existing zzso properties might significantly contribute to the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso
