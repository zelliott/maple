zzso zzso has been implicated as one factor controlling body weight and feeding zzso We studied the association between obesity and zzso by investigating the brain zzso zzso zzso binding in 16 zzso twin pairs with varying body mass index zzso zzso The zzso zzso was used for single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging of zzso zzso zzso zzso was also identified for each zzso We hypothesized reduced zzso binding in twins with higher zzso as compared to their zzso zzso and increased zzso binding in subjects with zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso and SS zzso In zzso zzso twins with higher zzso had higher zzso binding than their zzso zzso in the zzso zzso binding ratios zzso zzso zzso zzso The difference was striking in women zzso zzso zzso zzso but not in men zzso zzso zzso zzso In individuals, no correlation between zzso binding and zzso was zzso and no differences were found in zzso binding between the three zzso zzso Our finding suggests an association between acquired obesity and the zzso system, particularly in zzso However, this association was seen only in twin data, where genetic effects and many shared environmental factors are zzso
