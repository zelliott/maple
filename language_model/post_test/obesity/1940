To define the zzso implications of insulin resistance zzso we compared 10 zzso zzso women who had abnormal zzso tolerance tests with 10 zzso healthy zzso women with normal zzso tolerance tests with respect to mental zzso and zzso zzso zzso variables obtained at baseline and during stress included heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac zzso and systemic vascular zzso The zzso group weighed more zzso versus 66 zzso zzso zzso was similar zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso between groups although baseline zzso zzso at testing day was higher in the zzso group than control group (75 versus 65 zzso zzso zzso The zzso group showed a significantly greater increase in zzso zzso versus zzso zzso and zzso zzso versus zzso zzso blood pressure responses to mental stress than the control zzso During mental stress, the control group demonstrated increased cardiac output zzso zzso and decreased systemic vascular resistance zzso zzso zzso s zzso zzso whereas zzso subjects demonstrated increased systemic vascular resistance zzso zzso zzso s zzso zzso group difference, zzso with only a small increase in cardiac output zzso zzso zzso also caused a greater increase in systemic vascular resistance in the zzso group zzso versus 64 zzso zzso s zzso zzso zzso with a zzso greater increase in blood pressure than control zzso zzso blood pressure was correlated with weight zzso zzso and stress blood pressure with zzso insulin zzso zzso and zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso We conclude that insulin resistance is associated with an exaggerated blood pressure response to zzso an enhanced zzso to stress may mediate this zzso This zzso may be a marker for future hypertension in obese, zzso zzso zzso
