Research suggests the neighborhood built environment is related to child physical activity and zzso 

The purpose of this study was to determine if characteristics of the neighborhood environment moderate the relationship between obesity treatment and weight loss, and if outcomes of particular treatments are moderated by built environment zzso 

The relationship between the built environment and standardized zzso zzso changes for 191 zzso children who participated in one of four randomized, controlled trials of pediatric weight management was assessed using mixed models analysis of zzso 

At zzso zzso greater zzso fewer convenience stores, and fewer zzso were associated with greater zzso reduction across all zzso No treatments zzso with characteristics of the built zzso 

zzso and zzso built neighborhood characteristics are associated with child success in behavioral obesity zzso zzso may be improved by zzso treatments based on built environment zzso
