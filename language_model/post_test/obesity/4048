Several types of experimental zzso are characterized by the occurrence of an early zzso of insulin that produces an increase in both zzso zzso by the liver and fat deposition in zzso zzso This zzso of insulin, together with other zzso factors, is subsequently responsible for a state of insulin zzso The early zzso of insulin in zzso and genetic zzso zzso zzso zzso can be zzso zzso Thus, within 20 zzso of acute zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso is greater in zzso than in zzso control zzso this increase can be blocked by zzso acute zzso Moreover, an infusion of zzso to zzso zzso control and genetically zzso rats zzso animals zzso to become obese but with a normal body weight at this zzso elicits much greater zzso in the zzso than in the controls, despite similar zzso zzso values in zzso This increased insulin zzso in the zzso rats can be restored to normal by zzso them acutely with the zzso zzso zzso Thus, in these two types of zzso an increased zzso tone appears to be of importance for the early occurrence of insulin zzso zzso produced by increased tone of the zzso nerve appears to be reinforced by the decreased activity of the sympathetic system observed in obese zzso In many obese zzso plasma growth hormone levels are zzso zzso The inadequate zzso of this zzso hormone may explain why, in some types of obesity syndrome, zzso is not necessarily present, despite insulin zzso zzso resistance in experimental zzso has been shown to occur at the level of the zzso zzso the muscles and more recently, the zzso The latter has been demonstrated using the in zzso zzso clamp zzso thus, zzso of genetically obese zzso rats could not be shut off, as in controls, by either zzso or increased plasma insulin zzso This particular zzso is therefore insulin zzso The precise zzso of the early zzso of insulin in zzso rats is, however, zzso with zzso zzso the origin is clearly the central nervous system zzso but the pathways actually interrupted by the zzso and those responsible for the zzso of the zzso remain to be zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
