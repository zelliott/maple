The relationship between obesity and physical function is not well zzso Physical activity may be a key factor zzso on the relationship between obesity and physical zzso

zzso of obesity from 1982 to 1995 and measures of physical activity from 1982 to 1995 were related to physical function in zzso However, zzso zzso analysis to predict physical function in 1999 controlling for the presence of chronic conditions indicated that physical activity from 1982 to 1995, and not obesity from 1982 to 1995, was an independent predictor of physical function zzso adjusted zzso zzso zzso F zzso zzso P zzso gait zzso adjusted zzso zzso zzso F zzso zzso P zzso
