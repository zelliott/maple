We have shown a significant disruption of zzso pattern of plasma zzso zzso and zzso hormones in zzso zzso Our objective was to assess the effect of a high-fat diet zzso zzso on mean levels and zzso pattern of several zzso in zzso A normal zzso rats zzso zzso were used as zzso When body weight of zzso rats attained values about zzso higher than controls (after 66 days of zzso the animals were killed at six different time intervals throughout a zzso zzso Plasma zzso of insulin, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were measured in a zzso profiling by using the zzso zzso zzso necrosis factor alpha zzso and zzso were measured by zzso zzso zzso A significant zzso developed in zzso rats, together with a significant increase in plasma zzso Mean levels of plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso The normal daily pattern of plasma insulin, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso became disrupted in zzso zzso The results indicate that a high-fat diet may bring about signs of insulin resistance and mild inflammation in rats, together with the disruption in daily variations of circulating insulin and zzso and of several zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
