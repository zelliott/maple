Using the zzso difficulty scale zzso we sought to confirm that obese patients are more difficult to zzso than lean zzso We assessed classical bedside tests and included neck zzso 

We zzso compared the zzso of difficult zzso zzso in 70 obese zzso mass index zzso or zzso 30 zzso and 61 lean patients zzso zzso zzso The zzso scores, zzso as difficult zzso zzso 5) or not zzso zzso zzso zzso and the patient data, were compared between lean and obese zzso zzso zzso zzso neck circumference (at the level of the zzso zzso zzso of mouth zzso zzso distance, and zzso zzso medical history of zzso sleep zzso syndrome, and several scores zzso Wilson, El zzso were zzso The view during direct zzso was zzso and the zzso was zzso We then compared patients with zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso 5, concerning each zzso 

The results indicate that difficult zzso zzso is more frequent in obese than in lean patients zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso In the patients with zzso 5, zzso distance, zzso large neck zzso and higher zzso score were the only zzso of potential zzso zzso 

We found that problematic zzso was associated with zzso distance, increasing neck zzso zzso and a zzso score zzso or zzso zzso Neck circumference should be assessed preoperatively to predict difficult zzso
