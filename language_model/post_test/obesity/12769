zzso sensitivity was evaluated in 16 zzso patients and in 15 obese persons with Type 2 diabetes zzso by using zzso zzso and analysis of insulin zzso characteristics on zzso zzso decreased insulin sensitivity index zzso was found in both zzso and obese Type 2 diabetic patients as compared with healthy non-obese controls zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso 100, p zzso No difference was observed between both groups of zzso zzso clearance rate of zzso was strongly reduced in obese diabetic patients but it was normal in zzso patients in comparison with healthy persons zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso A decreased insulin binding on specific receptors caused by reduced binding capacity was observed only in zzso patients but not in obese Type 2 diabetic zzso A significant negative correlation was proved between body mass index zzso and insulin sensitivity index zzso zzso zzso p zzso indicating that zzso is the main determining factor of insulin resistance in the total cohort of examined zzso We conclude that insulin resistance was caused by zzso changes in obese Type 2 diabetes, whereas a decreased insulin binding capacity together with zzso zzso was present in zzso zzso
