zzso studies report a positive relationship between serum zzso C and cardiovascular outcomes in zzso Here, we tested the relevance of zzso C as a zzso for early vascular zzso in severely obese zzso 

Two hundred zzso obese zzso zzso zzso years, zzso zzso zzso and 262 non-obese children zzso zzso zzso years, body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C was measured by zzso zzso media thickness zzso incremental elastic zzso and zzso and zzso zzso were determined at the common carotid artery and the zzso artery in obese zzso 

zzso children had significantly higher serum zzso C than normal weight controls zzso zzso zzso zzso In obese children, serum zzso C zzso positively with zzso and the zzso model assessment index and zzso with the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index and zzso A positive relationship was found between serum zzso C and carotid zzso zzso zzso which remained significant in zzso models adjusted for zzso zzso and zzso with a trend towards significance zzso 

This study positions zzso C and zzso as zzso associated with zzso wall thickness in obese zzso Although the underlying zzso linking zzso C to early vascular disease remains to be zzso zzso C may represent a novel zzso zzso zzso implicated in zzso zzso early in zzso
