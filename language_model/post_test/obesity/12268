Physical zzso like recreational computer use is a likely factor in the rising obesity prevalence among Latino zzso 

Using the data from California Health zzso Survey, we test the hypothesis whether zzso is associated with recreational computer use among Latino zzso 

We run linear zzso of the weekly time spent on recreational computer use among Latino zzso zzso first by gender and then by age group zzso and 15-17 zzso Years living in the United States and language at home are used as key variables for zzso 

For all four zzso living in the United States for less than 5 years is significantly associated with fewer hours on recreational computer use, compared with those zzso Among female zzso those who lived in the United States for 10 years or more spent fewer hours on recreational computer use than those zzso Among adolescents under 15, speaking English only and speaking English plus another language are both significantly associated with more hours on recreational computer use, compared with those who speak a zzso language at zzso 

Educators and health professionals should heed the Latino adolescents' possible increase in recreational computer zzso
