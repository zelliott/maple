zzso studies emphasize the possible role of persistent organic pollutants zzso in obesity and the zzso zzso These pollutants are stored in zzso tissue zzso 

Our aim was to study the effects of zzso on human zzso cells and zzso zzso 

Using human zzso zzso stem cells, we carried out large-scale gene expression analysis to identify the major pathways modified by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 126 zzso and zzso and to evaluate their toxic zzso The effects of zzso on gene expression and AT zzso were also assessed in zzso 

The most significantly regulated genes in both precursor cells and zzso were those involved in the zzso response, cancer, and metabolism zzso Interestingly, the fold induction and the number of modulated genes were higher in precursors than in zzso suggesting that the former could be more sensitive to the effect of zzso When cells were treated with combinations of pollutants, the effects of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were dominant compared with those of the zzso zzso The effects of zzso zzso were reduced by the zzso zzso zzso The regulation of inflammatory zzso was observed in zzso AT but not in zzso zzso 

Both in zzso and in zzso studies showed that zzso cells were targets of zzso zzso and suggest that inflammation is one of the main regulated zzso These observations suggest a possible contribution of pollutants to zzso AT inflammation that accompanies the zzso of zzso zzso
