In severe zzso zzso zzso regulation of zzso oxide zzso formation is compromised in response to zzso zzso and major arteries have suppressed zzso zzso Because normal zzso are highly dependent on zzso stimulation of NO generation and are responsive to zzso and zzso oxygen zzso they are likely a major site of impaired zzso zzso This study evaluated the blood flow and zzso aspects of zzso zzso regulation and NO production in zzso obese rats just before the onset of zzso zzso zzso was used to inhibit zzso to determine whether flow or zzso NO regulation was zzso Blood flow zzso was increased by forcing zzso to zzso approximately 50% larger tissue areas by zzso of nearby zzso and oxygen tension in the bath was lowered to create a modest oxygen zzso When compared with lean zzso rats, the zzso NO concentration zzso for obese rats was approximately zzso below zzso At elevated zzso rates, the zzso for zzso of obese animals was zzso below those in the zzso of lean rats, and the NO response to decreased oxygen was about half normal in obese zzso All of these regulatory problems were essentially corrected in obese rats by zzso blockade with only minor changes in the zzso behavior in lean zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells during obesity suppressed NO regulation both at rest and in response to increased flow zzso and decreased oxygen zzso
