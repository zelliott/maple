Investigators first described the zzso syndrome zzso which consists of morning zzso evening zzso and insomnia, in 1955, but, to our knowledge, this syndrome has never been subjected to careful clinical zzso 

To characterize zzso on the basis of behavioral characteristics and neuroendocrine zzso 

A behavioral zzso study was conducted between January 1996 and June 1997 in a weight and eating disorders program at the University of zzso A neuroendocrine study was conducted from May through August 1997 at the Clinical Research Center of the University Hospital, zzso zzso 

The behavioral study included 10 obese subjects who met criteria for zzso and 10 matched control zzso The neuroendocrine study included 12 night eaters and 21 control zzso zzso study subjects were observed for 1 week on an zzso basis, and neuroendocrine study subjects were observed during a 24-hour period in the zzso 

The behavioral study measured timing of energy zzso mood level, and sleep zzso The neuroendocrine study measured zzso levels of plasma zzso zzso and zzso 

In the behavioral study, compared with control subjects, night eaters had more eating episodes in the 24 hours zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso and consumed significantly more of their daily energy intake at night than did control subjects zzso vs zzso zzso They averaged zzso zzso zzso per night compared with zzso zzso by controls zzso In night zzso zzso of these zzso were associated with food zzso with a mean intake per zzso of zzso zzso zzso None of the controls ate during their zzso In the neuroendocrine study, compared with control subjects, night eaters had zzso of the nocturnal rise in plasma zzso and zzso levels zzso for zzso and higher zzso levels of plasma cortisol zzso zzso zzso 

A coherent pattern of behavioral and neuroendocrine characteristics was found in subjects with zzso
