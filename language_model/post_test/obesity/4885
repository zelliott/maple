The observation that loss of zzso zzso zzso causes human zzso raises the possibility that other acquired disorders might also result from loss of zzso zzso To test this possibility for body weight, mice with selective loss of zzso concentrating hormone zzso zzso were zzso zzso was chosen to test because induced zzso of the zzso gene in mice cause zzso and zzso Mice with zzso of zzso zzso were generated using toxin zzso zzso zzso The mice appeared normal but, after 7 weeks, developed reduced body weight, body zzso fat mass, lean mass, and zzso zzso zzso was characterized by zzso and increased energy zzso To study the role of zzso zzso on obesity secondary to zzso zzso we generated mice deficient in both zzso gene product zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso mice improved zzso diabetes, and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso are important zzso of the response to zzso zzso These data show that loss of zzso zzso can lead to an acquired zzso This has implications for the zzso of acquired changes of body weight and might be considered in clinical settings characterized by substantial weight changes later in zzso
