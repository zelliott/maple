Little is known about the relations of fitness and zzso to left zzso structure and function in obese zzso This project had 2 purposes: 1) to determine the correlations of cardiovascular fitness and zzso to left zzso parameters in obese zzso and 2) to see the effect of 8 months of physical training zzso at low and high zzso 

zzso zzso to zzso (N zzso zzso were tested at baseline and then randomly assigned to lifestyle education zzso alone, zzso plus zzso zzso or zzso plus high-intensity zzso zzso testing was conducted 8 months zzso Because no significant differences were found between zzso and high-intensity zzso the groups were combined to form a zzso + zzso zzso 

Eight months of zzso offered 5 days per week with the target energy expenditure for all zzso participants being 250 zzso and zzso every 2 zzso zzso zzso Left zzso mass divided by height to the zzso power zzso zzso fractional zzso zzso and relative wall thickness zzso were measured using zzso zzso zzso fitness was measured by a zzso zzso treadmill zzso percent body fat zzso with zzso zzso zzso and visceral zzso tissue zzso with magnetic resonance zzso 

At zzso high levels of zzso were associated with higher zzso zzso zzso zzso and lesser MFS zzso zzso zzso Compared with the zzso group, the zzso + zzso group significantly improved in cardiovascular fitness and decreased in zzso and zzso However, there were no significant differences between groups on changes in zzso zzso or zzso Individual changes in cardiovascular zzso zzso and zzso did not correlate significantly with zzso changes in left zzso structure and zzso 

High levels of zzso were associated with zzso left zzso structure and zzso However, no evidence was provided that an zzso zzso program, which improved cardiovascular fitness and reduced general and visceral zzso improved left zzso structure and zzso Future studies consisting of longer training programs and/or greater weight reductions are needed to see whether the adverse left zzso effects of obesity can be ameliorated by exercise zzso
