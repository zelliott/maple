This study was conducted to zzso the molecular mechanisms of zzso a traditional Korean herbal medicine commonly used for the treatment of zzso 

zzso zzso were differentiated into zzso in the presence or absence of zzso Changes in zzso or protein levels were analyzed using zzso real-time zzso chain reaction and western zzso zzso Small interference zzso zzso experiments were conducted to zzso the essential role of zzso 

zzso analyses showed that components of the zzso zzso including zzso zzso D1 and zzso 2 were zzso more than zzso as a result of zzso treatment during zzso which were confirmed by real-time zzso and western zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso resulted in the nuclear zzso of zzso Both zzso zzso zzso formation and expressions of zzso genes including zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were inhibited by zzso were significantly recovered by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso components of the zzso zzso during zzso and zzso plays a crucial role in the zzso mechanism of zzso
