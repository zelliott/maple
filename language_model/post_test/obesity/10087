The objectives of this study were 1) to examine zzso among zzso zzso tissue zzso and other zzso indexes, 2) to identify a visceral obesity index that is independent of total zzso and 3) to examine sex and ethnic zzso compared with African zzso differences in zzso We measured zzso and subcutaneous abdominal zzso tissue zzso using zzso zzso and total fat mass zzso by zzso X-ray zzso in a zzso sample of 101 children aged zzso zzso zzso y weighing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was highly variable zzso zzso SE; 31 zzso 22 zzso zzso zzso zzso and related to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso slope between zzso and zzso was significantly lower in African Americans zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than in whites zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Within each ethnic group there was no effect of sex on zzso adjusted for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in white boys and girls, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in African American boys and girls, zzso We conclude that in children 1) there is wide variation in visceral zzso 2) zzso relative to zzso is an index of visceral fat, independent of zzso allowing examination of the unique effects of zzso and 3) the relative distribution of zzso tissue in the zzso compared with the subcutaneous abdominal region is significantly lower in African Americans than in zzso
