zzso are the zzso zzso for the zzso factor zzso type 2 zzso which is implicated in regulating energy balance and/or zzso zzso We determined the effects of chronic zzso zzso on metabolism in zzso by generating and zzso transgenic mice zzso the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Body zzso zzso zzso insulin sensitivity, energy efficiency and expression of key zzso genes were assessed in adult male zzso 3 transgenic mice zzso under control conditions and following an zzso high-fat diet zzso zzso 

zzso mice had increased skeletal muscle mass with zzso zzso zzso peripheral zzso zzso increased respiratory exchange ratio and zzso on zzso demonstrated increased zzso zzso zzso tolerance and zzso of zzso zzso were zzso indicating these effects were not zzso by increased insulin zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso (also known as zzso mice negated key aspects of the zzso zzso zzso mice were protected from the zzso zzso and increased zzso seen in control mice despite consuming more zzso zzso of zzso proteins 2 and 3 was higher in zzso muscle, suggesting increased zzso zzso IGF-1 abundance was zzso in zzso muscle, providing a potential zzso mechanism in which zzso 3 acts upon zzso to link the altered metabolism and muscular zzso zzso 

zzso 3 acting on zzso in skeletal muscle of zzso mice results in a novel metabolically zzso zzso with lean body composition and protection against zzso obesity and zzso zzso and zzso may be of interest as potential therapeutic targets for zzso
