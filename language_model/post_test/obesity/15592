Many newly diagnosed obese African-American patients with history of severe zzso or diabetic zzso zzso are able to zzso pharmacological treatment with continued good zzso zzso However, many of these individuals zzso into zzso within 1 zzso In such patients, we compared the effect of zzso zzso and dietary therapy in the prevention of recurrence of zzso 

We conducted an zzso study in 35 obese newly diagnosed diabetic patients (17 with zzso and 18 with severe zzso After zzso of insulin, seven of 17 patients with zzso and seven of 18 patients with zzso were managed with diet and zzso zzso zzso whereas other patients were followed with diet zzso In all patients, pancreatic insulin reserve was documented 1 day after resolution of zzso crises and within 1 week of zzso of zzso zzso of zzso was defined as zzso blood zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or random blood zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso on two or more consecutive zzso or zzso zzso 

Both treatment groups were comparable in age, sex, duration of diabetes, months of insulin therapy, zzso zzso and zzso At zzso the acute zzso response to zzso in obese zzso patients was lower than in patients with zzso zzso zzso but responses were comparable after zzso of zzso zzso treatment significantly reduced recurrence of zzso in both obese zzso and obese zzso patients zzso zzso zzso With a median follow-up of 16 months, zzso recurred in six of 10 zzso patients and in five of 11 zzso patients treated with diet alone, compared with one of seven zzso and one of seven zzso patients treated with zzso zzso with zzso zzso occurred in four patients treated with diet but in none of the patients treated with diet and zzso
