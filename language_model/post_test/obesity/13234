The present study was designed to examine the hypothesis that zzso axis activity as measured by zzso cortisol production rate zzso and plasma levels of free cortisol is linked to increased body fat in adults, and that increased cortisol levels with aging results from increased zzso zzso healthy men and women volunteers with a wide range of body mass indexes and ages underwent measurement of zzso by isotope dilution measured by gas zzso zzso zzso zzso and free cortisol in pooled zzso zzso body zzso and zzso zzso clearance rates were determined from the zzso disappearance zzso of zzso after zzso infusion in a separate group of lean and obese subjects with adrenal zzso Although zzso significantly increased with increasing body mass index and percentage body fat, free cortisol levels remained independent of body composition and zzso levels due to increased cortisol clearance zzso zzso and free cortisol levels were, however, significantly higher in men than zzso In addition, zzso plasma free cortisol levels were increased with age in association with increased zzso independent of body zzso This increase in zzso axis activity may play a role in the zzso in body composition and central fat distribution in men zzso women and with zzso
