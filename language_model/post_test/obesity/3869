The zzso of zzso diabetes and cardiovascular disease have been increasing in both the developed and developing zzso zzso numbers of human studies suggest that these serious health outcomes may have zzso origins originating from nutritional deficits in the zzso period, with maternal nutrition around the time of conception now shown to have important effects on the length of zzso trajectory of fetal growth and on zzso growth and zzso zzso research using the pregnant sheep has been widely employed to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms zzso There is growing awareness that this field of research has major implications for the livestock production zzso From our own studies on sheep we have evidence that maternal zzso during the zzso period results in altered fetal zzso axis zzso development, an increased rate of premature birth, altered fetal pancreatic function, insulin zzso and zzso acid zzso and also zzso in maternal adaptation to zzso We are currently studying the zzso consequences of these zzso Other research groups have shown that restricted nutrition of sheep in the early part of pregnancy alters zzso muscle development, fat deposition, cardiovascular regulation and zzso zzso One aim of this review is to illustrate how biomedical research using animals such as the sheep has been used to gain a better understanding of the consequences of reduced maternal nutrition during the zzso zzso We suggest that there are equally important consequences of this research for the livestock production zzso
