A link between zzso resistance, zzso and salt sensitivity has been zzso zzso rats zzso were used to study the effect of gene dosage of a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso on salt sensitivity and response to a combined zzso A and B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso lean zzso male zzso were fed a low salt diet zzso zzso for 7 days, followed by a high salt diet zzso zzso for 7 zzso There were no significant differences in zzso blood pressure between zzso on low zzso In response to high salt, zzso had significantly greater zzso pressure than zzso and zzso On high salt diet, zzso showed a significant increase in 24 h urinary zzso zzso and increased zzso expression of zzso zzso There was no effect of high salt diet on zzso zzso of zzso oxide zzso or on gene expression of zzso zzso or zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso prevented the high zzso zzso in zzso blood pressure in zzso This was associated with a doubling of zzso zzso zzso but without changes in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso antagonism did not zzso zzso pressure in any of the zzso Our studies indicate that obesity secondary to zzso resistance zzso results in increased salt sensitivity that is zzso by zzso in the zzso zzso
