The present study aimed to investigate the regulation and involvement of zzso in the differentiation of human zzso zzso zzso stem cells zzso The relationships between zzso and zzso markers and zzso were also zzso 

Eight zzso zzso were obtained from four obese zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso and four lean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were induced to zzso and the related gene expression were measured in the zzso zzso using real-time reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso 

During zzso zzso was significantly zzso zzso zzso levels were lower in zzso zzso from obese subjects than in the corresponding zzso from lean zzso Higher zzso zzso levels were associated with lower levels of zzso In addition, the zzso levels in the zzso were zzso correlated with zzso 

Our results support the link between zzso and obesity development as well as obesity related inflammatory zzso
