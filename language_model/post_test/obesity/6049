zzso is a zzso and cardiovascular risk zzso A low calorie diet zzso is one of the treatment zzso for weight zzso zzso advanced zzso end products zzso are linked to increased zzso and inflammation in diseases such as diabetes and zzso zzso zzso has an inflammatory zzso but interestingly there are no studies on serum zzso levels in obesity or on the effects of LCD as a therapeutic measure on these markers of zzso 

We hypothesized that weight loss by caloric restriction has a beneficial effect on serum zzso zzso We investigated the prospective effects of a sole LCD intervention for weight loss on serum zzso in a cohort of overweight and zzso obese but otherwise healthy zzso 

A total of 37 Japanese subjects (30 zzso 7 zzso mean age zzso zzso zzso zzso with a mean zzso of zzso zzso zzso participated in this zzso During the intervention period of 2 months, they were placed on an LCD zzso zzso zzso with meal replacement every zzso The following data were evaluated zzso and zzso zzso zzso waist zzso blood pressure, serum zzso cholesterol, zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

After the intervention, zzso levels were clearly reduced by zzso zzso zzso waist circumference by zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso % zzso zzso At zzso zzso levels were 63 zzso 11 zzso for obese subjects and 63 zzso 14 for control subjects (not zzso After intervention, zzso were reduced by zzso zzso zzso p zzso The percent change in zzso was significantly and positively correlated with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso waist circumference zzso zzso zzso p zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso We show for the first time that serum zzso can be reduced by an LCD intervention on weight loss, a change that zzso with the reduction in zzso This may zzso be a reflection of a reduction in zzso due to the caloric restriction and its zzso consequences, or it may be due to the decreased intake of food containing zzso or a combination of zzso
