zzso the zzso syndrome, and aging share several zzso features in both humans and zzso zzso including insulin resistance and zzso Since muscle and liver are considered key zzso of zzso we sought to determine in zzso from lean and obese aging zzso monkeys the nature of defects in insulin zzso and, further, the potential for zzso of such defects by an in zzso insulin zzso zzso and a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso reduced zzso improved insulin sensitivity, lowered plasma zzso and free fatty zzso and increased plasma zzso In muscle of obese zzso previously shown to exhibit defective insulin zzso the insulin zzso improved insulin zzso of zzso protein zzso C zzso the defective direct zzso of zzso by zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso zzso but it did not improve insulin zzso of insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso B, or zzso zzso We found that, although insulin signaling was impaired in muscle, insulin zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso B, and zzso was largely intact in liver and that zzso improved insulin signaling to zzso in muscle by improving responsiveness to zzso
