zzso literature search for zzso evidence for an association of short sleep with weight gain and eventual development of obesity provided 71 original studies and seven reviews of various zzso of these zzso We have summarized the evidence for such an association with particular emphasis on prospective zzso The studies showed that short sleep duration is consistently associated with development of obesity in children and young adults, but not consistently so in older zzso We have identified critical aspects of the evidence, and assessed the possibility for interpretation of the evidence in terms of zzso We have discussed the requirement of zzso sequence between putative exposure and outcome and the implications of the time lag between them, the problems in adequate zzso of exposure and effects, the possible zzso zzso effects, the necessary distinction between zzso and zzso the possible zzso by weight history, and the possibility of common or upstream underlying zzso In conclusion, zzso interpretation of the association is hampered by fundamental conceptual and zzso zzso Experimental studies may zzso mechanisms, but adequate coverage of the entire zzso from sleep zzso through obesity development is not zzso zzso trials are needed to assess the value of targeted zzso
