zzso zzso accumulate fat reserves in long zzso but show a long-term decrease in food intake and body weight when exposed to a short winter zzso The aim of this study was to determine the role of central zzso 3/4 receptors zzso in generating this chronic zzso state by investigating the effects of zzso a zzso zzso on food intake and associated zzso In adult male zzso zzso infusions of zzso significantly increased food intake in a zzso zzso The time course of action was slow, food intake being increased between 4 and 24 h after zzso zzso A similar degree of increase in food intake occurred in fat zzso in long days and in lean zzso chronically exposed to short zzso zzso treatment with zzso (a zzso zzso significantly decreased food intake for up to 24 h after treatment, and zzso reversed these zzso effects between 4 and 24 h after treatment, a similar time course to that observed when zzso was administered zzso We conclude that zzso zzso peptides acting via zzso are involved in the regulation of food intake in zzso in both anabolic and zzso states, but these acute studies do not provide evidence that increased activity of this zzso system zzso the seasonal decrease in food intake that contributes to the long-term zzso state in short zzso
