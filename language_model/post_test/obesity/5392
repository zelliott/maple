To establish an Inuit body mass index zzso norm from a healthy, not zzso pure Inuit population and to investigate the development of overweight in the Inuit in zzso 

zzso study with 35 years follow-up on overweight among Inuit in zzso 

The heights and weights of zzso of all inhabitants in zzso in 1963 zzso were recovered recently and zzso zzso We obtained similar data in zzso of the zzso population in zzso in 1998 and in a random sample of zzso of individuals aged zzso years in the capital zzso zzso 

zzso or zzso as defined by the World Health Organization zzso was found in zzso of all men and zzso of all women in zzso in 1963, and in zzso of young Inuit hunters in zzso Such high rates were incompatible with a zzso way of zzso zzso zzso norms from data on healthy Inuit aged zzso years in 1963 were zzso men, zzso women, zzso These differed from the WHO zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso norm for the zzso of zzso Inuit in 1963 and 1998, the fraction of overweight men increased by over six times zzso to zzso zzso and overweight increased with zzso zzso The fraction of overweight women by the Inuit zzso norm doubled from 1963 to 1998 zzso to zzso zzso while median zzso remained zzso zzso because the fraction of slim women more than doubled zzso to zzso zzso 

A steep increase in the fraction of overweight Inuit men and women calls for zzso zzso predicted increased zzso In women the increased number of obese people was accompanied by an increased fraction of slim zzso This illustrates that transition can be modified and indicates that monitoring of populations in transition should observe gender zzso Finally, the historical data argue against the global zzso of the WHO zzso of normal zzso
