Physical activity zzso is zzso associated with obesity but the effect has been difficult to zzso using zzso In particular, the shape of the association has not yet been well zzso zzso provide an opportunity to better characterize the zzso 

Residents of households over the age of 25 years in randomly selected census districts in zzso were eligible to participate in the zzso zzso survey conducted in zzso 1848 completed the zzso survey and zzso of these zzso women and 517 zzso wore a zzso for zzso zzso data on recent zzso TV time and other factors were zzso The outcomes were waist circumference (in zzso and body mass index zzso zzso 

zzso daily steps were associated with a decline in the obesity zzso The zzso nature of the associations was indicated by a sharper decline for those with lower daily zzso For example, an additional 2000 steps for those taking only 2000 steps per day was associated with a reduction of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso in waist circumference among men (for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a baseline of only 2000, steps compared to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduction (for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for those already walking 10,000 steps zzso In the multivariable analysis, clearer associations were detected for PA and these obesity measures using daily step number rather than PA time by zzso 

zzso measures of activity indicate that the inverse association between recent PA and obesity is zzso in form with the greatest impact for a given zzso step number increase seen at lower levels of baseline zzso The findings from this study need to be examined in prospective zzso
