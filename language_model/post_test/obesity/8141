zzso is characterized by chronic widespread pain and sleep zzso zzso and zzso which lead to zzso changes, are additional zzso that are rarely zzso although they are highly prevalent in patients with zzso 

We compared the plasma levels of zzso and zzso zzso in 17 women with zzso zzso and 16 healthy women zzso with similar age, zzso zzso and levels of physical zzso We also investigated the relationships between these two zzso and sleep and various pain characteristics in patients with zzso zzso zzso were recorded, and physical activity levels were assessed using a zzso zzso intensity was measured using visual analogue scales zzso general and mean pain zzso Sleep was assessed using an zzso zzso 

Compared to the control group, the patient group had increased zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso level was not significantly correlated with any of the zzso zzso zzso level was zzso correlated with the weekly mean pain score zzso zzso and the weekly general pain score zzso zzso Multiple zzso analysis revealed that the variations in zzso zzso levels accounted for zzso of the weekly general pain and zzso of the weekly mean pain zzso 

These findings indicate that the decreased zzso zzso levels in women with zzso are related to pain zzso
