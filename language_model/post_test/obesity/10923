21 zzso healthy male zzso 

Body fat composition by zzso X-ray zzso zzso Exercise test at zzso of zzso muscle zzso type zzso muscle zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity zzso serum insulin, zzso and cortisol zzso 

zzso body fat was zzso correlated to the proportion of type I muscle zzso zzso zzso In addition percent trunk fat was zzso correlated with percent type I zzso zzso zzso while this relationship was not present for percent leg zzso There was no relation between zzso at rest or during exercise and muscle zzso type composition or percent body zzso 

Body fat and percent type I muscle zzso were zzso supporting skeletal muscle zzso type as a potential zzso factor in zzso No correlation was observed between percent body fat and zzso zzso at rest or during moderate exercise, indicating that muscle fuel zzso mix does not appear to provide a mechanism for this relation under either zzso
