Along with the rising prevalence of zzso rates of zzso diabetes zzso zzso and associated adverse outcomes also have zzso We conducted a zzso retrospective cohort study to assess the association of weight gain between zzso with zzso delivery for the subsequent pregnancy among women with a history of zzso 

Using linked zzso data for women with at least two singleton zzso in Washington State during the period from zzso we identified zzso women with zzso who delivered zzso at the baseline pregnancy zzso pregnancy on zzso The zzso weight change zzso zzso zzso for each woman was calculated and assigned to one of three zzso weight loss (more than 10 zzso weight stable zzso zzso or weight gain (more than 10 zzso Multiple zzso zzso was used to calculate the risk zzso ratio zzso of zzso delivery at the subsequent pregnancy among the zzso and weight-loss groups relative to the zzso zzso 

Among zzso eligible women, zzso lost more than 10 zzso between zzso zzso were zzso and zzso gained more than 10 zzso Women who gained more than 10 zzso had an adjusted OR for subsequent zzso delivery of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso of women who gained zzso whereas the adjusted OR for women who lost weight was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of women who lost zzso 

Women with a history of zzso who gained more than 10 zzso between zzso are at increased risk of future zzso zzso zzso weight management among women with a history of zzso may result in decreased zzso delivery rates along with decreases in associated excess risks and zzso
