zzso zzso potential channel zzso zzso functions as a zzso zzso channel in various cells and plays zzso roles in zzso and zzso zzso However, the function of zzso in energy metabolism is zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso results in increased muscle zzso capacity and resistance to zzso obesity in zzso Although no difference in body weight was observed between zzso and zzso mice when fed a standard zzso diet, obesity zzso induced by a high-fat diet were significantly improved in zzso mice, without any change in food zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed the zzso zzso of many zzso including those for zzso factors such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and for zzso zzso such as zzso zzso These zzso genes were especially prominent in zzso skeletal muscle, in which the activity of zzso zzso zzso was zzso suggesting that other zzso channels function in the skeletal muscle of zzso zzso Indeed, gene expressions for zzso and zzso increased in the muscles of zzso mice compared with those of zzso zzso The number of zzso type I fiber also increased in the zzso muscles following zzso gene zzso These results strongly suggested that zzso of zzso zzso zzso increases in zzso and zzso production, and zzso of zzso activity, affecting energy metabolism through increased expression of genes involved in fuel zzso in skeletal muscle and thereby contributing to increased energy expenditure and protection from zzso obesity in zzso
