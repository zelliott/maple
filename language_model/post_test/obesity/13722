The effect of a moderate energy intake plus exercise zzso vs a low energy intake without exercise zzso on weight loss and energy expenditure was examined in two groups of moderately overweight women confined to a zzso zzso An initial zzso baseline period was used to determine weight maintenance energy requirement zzso This was followed by a zzso weight reduction zzso Energy intake was decreased to zzso zzso in zzso and treadmill exercise was individually prescribed to increase energy expenditure to zzso zzso Energy intake was decreased to zzso zzso in zzso Thus, both energy intake and expenditure were manipulated to result in an energy deficit of 50 zzso Although total weight loss was significantly higher in zzso compared to zzso zzso vs zzso zzso fat loss did not differ zzso vs zzso zzso hence the proportion of weight loss due to fat was greater in zzso zzso capacity, measured by maximum oxygen zzso significantly improved in zzso zzso to zzso zzso but did not change in zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso rate, energy cost of standardized activities, and zzso zzso response to a test meal did not change in either group throughout the zzso Thus, a 50 percent energy deficit, achieved by either diet alone or diet in combination with exercise, did not result in conservation of energy expenditure in moderately overweight zzso
