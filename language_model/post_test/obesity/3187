To examine the effect of maternal overweight and obesity on labor zzso 

We analyzed data from zzso zzso women with a term pregnancy that participated in the zzso zzso and Nutrition Study from 1995 to zzso The median duration of labor by each zzso of cervical zzso was zzso for zzso zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso overweight zzso zzso zzso and obese zzso zzso zzso women and used as a measurement of labor zzso 

After adjusting for maternal zzso labor zzso membrane zzso zzso use, zzso zzso net maternal weight gain, and fetal size, the median duration of labor from 4 to 10 zzso was significantly longer for both overweight and obese women, compared with zzso women zzso zzso and zzso hours, zzso For overweight women, the zzso was concentrated around 4-6 zzso whereas for obese women, their labor was significantly slower before 7 zzso 

Labor progression in overweight and obese women was significantly slower than that of zzso women before 6 zzso of cervical zzso Given that nearly one half of women of zzso age are either overweight or obese, it is critical to consider differences in labor progression by maternal zzso zzso before additional interventions are zzso
