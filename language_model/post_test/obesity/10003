The relationship between plasma insulin level and zzso blood pressure zzso was investigated by multiple linear zzso procedure in 410 Chinese zzso The significant positive correlation between zzso and zzso plasma insulin zzso zzso after zzso zzso load was found in the zzso zzso mass zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso after the adjustment for age, sex, zzso smoking and plasma cholesterol zzso zzso zzso However, this significant correlation was gradually diminished with the expansion of the zzso range, zzso P zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso group, P zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso group, and P zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso group after the same adjustment of zzso Interestingly, the significant inverse correlation between zzso interaction term zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso was found zzso zzso zzso in the presence of the significant positive correlation between zzso plasma insulin and zzso zzso zzso zzso after adjustment of the above mentioned five factors in the whole group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicated that zzso is independently correlated with plasma insulin level in the studied population, and that the zzso obesity may interfere the net effects of insulin on the zzso of blood zzso
