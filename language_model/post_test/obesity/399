zzso zzso acids are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and have been implicated in the zzso of obesity and type 2 diabetes zzso zzso It is established that high-fat saturated zzso relative to low-fat zzso induce zzso and zzso insulin zzso Here, we test the hypothesis that markers of an obese, zzso state zzso liver, visceral fat zzso insulin zzso are also worsened with provision of a low-fat diet containing zzso acid zzso the zzso zzso acid zzso found in the human food zzso Male zzso zzso rats were fed a zzso zzso acid enriched zzso diet for 8 zzso At zzso 3 and 6 weeks, in zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso assessed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8) determined zzso and zzso insulin sensitivity followed by high-resolution ex zzso zzso to assess tissue zzso zzso fed the zzso diet were in positive energy balance, largely explained by increased energy zzso and showed significantly increased visceral fat and liver zzso zzso relative to the low-fat control zzso Net zzso synthesis was also increased in the zzso zzso A reduction in zzso zzso independent of zzso zzso was observed in rats fed the zzso diet, whereas in rats fed a zzso saturated fat zzso diet, impaired zzso disposal corresponded to increased zzso Neither diet induced an increase in zzso These findings imply that zzso acids may alter zzso handling in liver, zzso zzso and skeletal muscle and that the mechanism by which zzso acids induce insulin resistance differs from diets enriched with saturated zzso
