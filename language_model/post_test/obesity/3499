zzso zzso factor zzso and its zzso zzso are critical components of the neural zzso controlling appetite and body zzso zzso zzso signaling in mice results in severe zzso and zzso In humans, zzso zzso and the functional zzso zzso zzso have been linked to elevated food intake and body zzso The mechanisms underlying this dysfunction are poorly zzso We demonstrate a chief role of zzso a calcium channel zzso and zzso zzso in triggering zzso in mice with central zzso zzso We show reduced zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an energy zzso zzso This deficit contributes to the zzso exhibited by zzso zzso mice because selective zzso of zzso by zzso infusion into zzso zzso significantly increases feeding and body weight zzso zzso zzso zzso rescue in zzso zzso zzso significantly zzso their zzso zzso and liver zzso and zzso deficits in zzso zzso zzso recordings in zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed normal calcium currents but reduced frequency of zzso These results suggest calcium zzso effects of zzso on feeding and zzso zzso interactions known to facilitate zzso zzso zzso Our findings identify a central mechanism zzso the zzso effects of zzso on zzso They also demonstrate a novel and critical role for zzso in appetite control and suggest a mechanism underlying weight gain in humans treated with zzso zzso
