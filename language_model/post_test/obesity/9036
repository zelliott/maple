On the basis of our experience in recent years, we hypothesized that acute zzso occurs more frequently in young adult patients zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso now than previously zzso We reviewed the CT findings, clinical features, and demographic data of a cohort of patients who presented with acute zzso at an urban zzso academic medical zzso 

We used our hospital and zzso databases to identify 104 adult patients with both CT and clinical diagnoses of acute zzso Clinical parameters recorded included age, sex, ethnicity, zzso or zzso management, and therapy zzso treatment, zzso zzso or zzso CT studies were evaluated for the site of zzso associated zzso and the presence of abdominal zzso as determined by measurement of zzso abdominal zzso 

The study group was composed of 55 men and 49 women (age range, zzso years; mean age, zzso years; median age, zzso zzso zzso zzso were 50 years old or younger, and 22 were 40 years old or zzso zzso complications were noted in 38 patients zzso There was no significant age difference between the zzso zzso 50 zzso 50 years old age groups for hospital admission (90 patients, zzso medical therapy zzso zzso or surgery or zzso zzso drainage zzso zzso zzso obesity measured by zzso abdominal diameter was present in 48 zzso and 37 zzso of the zzso zzso 50 zzso 50 years old age groups, zzso The mean zzso abdominal diameter for patients zzso zzso 50 years old zzso zzso was greater than that for zzso 50 years old zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In this urban population, acute zzso occurred more frequently in patients zzso years old than previously zzso This group had significantly greater abdominal obesity than the older zzso Severe disease requiring hospital admission, surgery, or zzso drainage (or both surgery and zzso zzso was common in all age zzso
