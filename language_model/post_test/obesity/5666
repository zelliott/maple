This study was conducted to assess whether changes in zzso zzso factor zzso zzso could account for the zzso of the early phase of zzso To this end, 8 AM zzso and 10 AM zzso plasma zzso zzso were determined daily and compared with plasma zzso activity and zzso levels in 8 obese subjects submitted to a zzso total zzso zzso constant daily sodium intake zzso zzso urinary sodium zzso increased from 35 zzso 7 to 109 zzso 8 zzso after 4 days of fast zzso less than zzso and declined zzso zzso zzso zzso progressively increased over the whole period of zzso zzso less than zzso Interestingly, zzso induced a decrease in plasma zzso zzso zzso less than zzso A contrast analysis revealed no significant change in zzso during the initial zzso phase of zzso but a decrease at the end of zzso averaging zzso zzso less than zzso and zzso zzso less than zzso at 8 and 10 AM zzso In contrast, plasma zzso rose during zzso zzso less than zzso the difference being significant at the end of zzso zzso less than zzso Plasma zzso activity and cortisol did not change significantly over the zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso changes of zzso zzso zzso and cortisol were preserved during zzso zzso less than zzso zzso changes of zzso were, however, attenuated at the end of zzso zzso less than zzso These data indicate that the zzso zzso cannot be explained by changes in zzso levels but that the loss of sodium may contribute to a decline of zzso zzso levels, with an zzso of their zzso zzso changes, and to a stimulation of the zzso zzso
