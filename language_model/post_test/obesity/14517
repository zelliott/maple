We investigated the progression of vascular dysfunction associated with the zzso syndrome with and without zzso in lean, zzso obese, and zzso diabetic fatty zzso zzso zzso of zzso and small coronary and zzso arteries were measured to zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso stress were increased in serum from zzso rats throughout the study, whereas values were increased in zzso obese rats later in the study zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in serum from zzso to zzso lean, zzso obese, and zzso rats, zzso zzso zzso relaxation was not altered in vessels from lean animals from zzso zzso zzso relaxation was nearly abolished in coronary arteries from zzso to zzso zzso obese rats and by zzso zzso in zzso rats and was attenuated in zzso and zzso vessels from zzso rats zzso to 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in coronary zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso vessels from zzso to zzso lean, zzso obese, and zzso rats, zzso The attenuated zzso relaxation was improved when vessels were incubated with zzso suggesting zzso as a mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso relaxation was not altered in zzso or coronary arteries and was zzso in zzso arteries from zzso obese zzso Our data suggest that diabetes enhances the progression of vascular zzso zzso in zzso of zzso stress zzso the development of dysfunction and may serve as a marker of zzso zzso
