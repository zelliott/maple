Previous studies on mice with zzso zzso gene zzso knockout have focused on obese zzso Because humans with functional zzso zzso show zzso zzso we determined the onset of excessive fat deposition in zzso to zzso mice, taking into account sex and litter zzso Total body fat content of zzso on day 35 and zzso on day 56 significantly exceeds that of zzso Plasma zzso levels increase in proportion to fat zzso According to cumulative food intake and energy expenditure zzso from day 21 to 35, onset of excessive fat deposition in zzso is fueled by zzso and zzso partially by zzso In zzso to zzso mice, zzso nucleus zzso Y zzso zzso decreases and zzso zzso zzso increases with fat content and plasma zzso levels independently of zzso Taking into account fat content by zzso zzso however, increases in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso due to zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso not zzso is the primary zzso initiating excessive fat deposition in zzso mice at weaning and that the overall changes in zzso and zzso expression tend to antagonize the onset of excessive fat zzso
