The development of obesity through childhood, often characterized by using body mass index zzso has received much recent interest because of the rapidly increasing levels of obesity zzso However, the extent to which the zzso trajectory in the first year of life (the zzso 'peak' in zzso is associated with zzso in later childhood has received little zzso 

The zzso Family Study includes zzso families, zzso mother, father and two consecutive singleton zzso both of whom were delivered at the zzso Academic Hospital, Sweden, between 1987 and zzso The children's zzso growth data, including serial zzso of height and weight (from which zzso was zzso were obtained from health zzso All children had a physical examination when they were aged between 5 and 13 years, at which height and weight were again recorded and used to calculate zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso growth zzso were fitted to the infant zzso data using penalized zzso with random zzso and from these the location of the zzso peak for each participant was zzso A zzso zzso approach was used to assess the relationships between the zzso peak and zzso zzso in later zzso 

The zzso peak occurred, on average, slightly later in female children, with a higher zzso peak in male zzso zzso zzso both age and zzso at zzso peak were positively associated with later zzso zzso zzso zzso both dimensions of zzso peak retained their positive zzso 

The growth trajectory associated with higher childhood zzso appears to include a later and/or higher zzso peak in zzso
