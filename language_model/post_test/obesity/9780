The vascular responses to acute resistance exercise and resistance exercise training zzso in overweight women are zzso zzso the purpose of this study was to examine the zzso and wave reflection responses to acute resistance exercise before and after zzso In all, 24 zzso zzso women zzso years of zzso volunteered for this zzso zzso blood flow zzso zzso capacity in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso and wave reflection zzso zzso were measured, before and zzso after five sets of leg press at zzso maximum zzso zzso of pulse wave reflection included the zzso index zzso and the time of the reflected wave zzso zzso were collected at zzso after a zzso control period zzso zzso and after 12 weeks of zzso zzso using three sets of five exercises at zzso of zzso There were no differences in vascular zzso at baseline or before zzso for any zzso zzso zzso zzso and peak zzso zzso increased significantly zzso after zzso compared with before zzso zzso zzso zzso and peak zzso zzso also increased significantly zzso after zzso compared with before zzso zzso zzso decreased significantly zzso whereas zzso increased significantly zzso compared with rest at all time zzso However, zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso The zzso zzso zzso increased the resting and zzso zzso as well as zzso capacity without changing wave reflection in zzso overweight zzso zzso may be an important zzso therapy for reducing cardiovascular risk in overweight and obese zzso zzso
