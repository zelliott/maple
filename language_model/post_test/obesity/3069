zzso changes underlying zzso pulmonary cellular zzso were evaluated by lung zzso and zzso in zzso male zzso rats made obese by nursing in small litters with subsequent feeding of a high-fat zzso Control animals were raised in zzso litters and then fed standard rat zzso Compared with controls, obese rats had significant zzso in body weight zzso fat pad weight zzso fat pad zzso weight ratio zzso zzso length zzso zzso length zzso serum insulin concentration zzso fixed lung volume zzso and the ratios of lung volume to body weight zzso and lung volume to body zzso zzso zzso of obese rats had enlarged zzso with significant increases in mean zzso and total zzso zzso volume, mean chord length zzso and mean zzso and total zzso zzso surface zzso Surface density zzso zzso ratio zzso and zzso density zzso of zzso in obese rats were significantly diminished compared with lungs of control zzso zzso were total zzso number and zzso volume zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso within the obese and control groups were zzso These results indicate the presence of zzso enlargement with relatively diminished respiratory surface area in lungs of young rats made obese by zzso This relative decrease in zzso area may contribute to zzso and functional zzso present in zzso
