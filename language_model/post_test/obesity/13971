Muscle strength zzso may be impaired in obese zzso and this impairment may be a consequence of both obesity and low physical zzso 

We investigated whether zzso differed between obese zzso mass index zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and lean zzso zzso elderly subjects and compared the zzso of sedentary and active subjects according to their zzso zzso 

The study included 215 obese zzso zzso zzso age: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 630 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso lean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso women with good functional zzso A zzso design was zzso zzso measures zzso zzso measures of zzso skeletal muscle mass (by zzso X-ray zzso zzso knee and elbow extension (by zzso and zzso zzso strength (by zzso and data on health status and zzso recreational physical activity zzso walking, zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

Absolute zzso zzso was higher in obese than in lean women zzso zzso except for zzso strength zzso zzso When adjusted for age, zzso zzso pain, depression, and zzso skeletal muscle mass, zzso did not differ significantly between obese, zzso and lean subjects, except for knee extension zzso interaction effect with zzso P zzso zzso With increasing zzso lower limb strength did not change in the sedentary women but increased in active zzso or zzso 1 zzso zzso or zzso 1 zzso zzso or zzso 1 zzso zzso All adjusted zzso measures in active participants were significantly higher zzso zzso than those in their sedentary zzso 

The adjusted zzso of elderly women is not associated with obesity but is higher in active subjects than in sedentary ones, especially in the lower limbs of obese zzso
