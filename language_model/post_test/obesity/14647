Although the adverse health consequences of obesity in the general population have been well zzso recent evidence suggests that obesity is associated with better outcomes in patients with heart failure zzso Studies of patients with zzso that specifically examined the impact of body mass index zzso on outcomes have suggested the existence of an zzso zzso However, closer examination of these studies raises important questions on the zzso of the zzso First, the diagnosis of zzso in obese patients, particularly when made using clinical zzso may not be zzso the obese patients in these studies may actually be zzso than their zzso zzso Second, the deleterious effects of zzso rather than the zzso ones of zzso are likely the main reason for the inverse correlation between zzso and zzso outcome, especially once the underlying zzso mechanisms behind zzso and obesity in patients with zzso are zzso Furthermore, few studies have specifically examined the more severely obese population zzso zzso when assessing zzso and those that have suggest that severely obese patients may have worse outcomes than patients with normal weights or those who are mildly zzso zzso a zzso outcome curve according to zzso for patients with zzso may actually exist, in which mortality is greatest in zzso zzso lower in normal, overweight, and mildly obese zzso but higher again in more severely obese zzso Further prospective studies assessing the impact of more marked degrees of obesity on outcomes in patients with zzso are needed to more zzso determine whether the obesity paradox truly zzso
