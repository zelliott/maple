zzso zzso mice were treated for 24 or 48 h with either 25 zzso of zzso or zzso After an overnight fast, the animals were killed and pancreatic zzso were incubated with zzso or zzso or zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso from zzso into carbon 2 of medium zzso and the yield of zzso from zzso and zzso from zzso were zzso zzso treatment for 48 h significantly increased the rate of zzso of zzso in zzso both at zzso zzso (24 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso treatment also inhibited insulin release by approximately zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso either in the presence or absence of 10 zzso zzso but had no effect when insulin release was zzso by 1 zzso zzso Moreover, zzso treatment with zzso significantly increased zzso cycling at low and high zzso zzso in the medium and inhibited insulin responsiveness to zzso and zzso In conclusion, short-term zzso treatment increases zzso flux through zzso in zzso from zzso zzso This effect may contribute to the decreased insulin response to zzso and zzso found in animals treated with zzso
