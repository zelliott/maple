We have previously shown that the zzso zzso mouse will develop obesity and diabetes if raised on a high-fat zzso Because high fat feeding is associated with zzso the present study was designed to separate the effects of fat from those of excess caloric consumption in this animal zzso B6 mice were fed a low-fat diet zzso zzso diet, high-fat diet zzso zzso diet, or zzso diet zzso group), in which intake animals were zzso a high-fat diet to caloric level consumed by zzso for 11 zzso Within 3 weeks, zzso were significantly heavier than zzso and, after 11 weeks, weight and zzso levels, but not insulin, were significantly increased in zzso when compared to zzso Body composition analysis showed the weight increase in zzso arose from an increase in percent fat zzso We conclude that reducing the number of zzso consumed from a high-fat diet zzso but does not prevent the development of type 2 diabetes and obesity in the B6 zzso
