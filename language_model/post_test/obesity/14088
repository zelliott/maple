No previous research has examined the association between zzso syndrome zzso and zzso quality of life zzso using standard criteria for defining zzso We hypothesized that zzso would be associated with lower zzso on measures of physical and mental zzso 

Participants were zzso individuals in two zzso weight loss zzso zzso was defined by the National zzso Education Panel zzso The Medical Outcomes zzso Short zzso zzso was used to assess zzso zzso in zzso and in clinical and zzso characteristics were compared among participants with and without zzso Multiple zzso was used to determine zzso of zzso 

zzso was associated with lower scores on the physical function and general health zzso of the zzso and on the physical component summary zzso zzso This association remained after controlling for age or depression but was eliminated by controlling for zzso zzso was not associated with lower mental quality of life, a higher depression score, tobacco or alcohol use, or a higher rate of zzso zzso 

zzso with zzso reported lower zzso This appeared to be an effect of increased weight, rather than a unique effect of zzso zzso studies are needed to assess whether zzso may have an independent effect on zzso
