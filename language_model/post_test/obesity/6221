A zzso zzso study of abnormal zzso tolerance in the adult zzso carried out within the zzso National Diabetes zzso has recently been zzso During the zzso zzso abnormal as compared to normal zzso tolerance was found to be related to a significantly higher zzso the zzso relative risks of death were zzso times in diabetic females and greater than 2 times in zzso and diabetic zzso In the repeat zzso survey zzso subjects zzso of the initial zzso were zzso with the oral zzso being interpreted according to zzso 1985 zzso The zzso prevalence rates, in the zzso males and zzso were respectively zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso and zzso for zzso These gradually increased after age 40, zzso zzso in the zzso year groups and diabetes 10 years zzso zzso (especially diabetes in close zzso seemed a major influence, whilst excess body weight appeared the more important associated environmental zzso The zzso levels zzso per zzso of diabetes during the zzso were zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso this seven times higher risk in the latter was slightly lower in females than zzso but significantly higher in the less than zzso compared to older zzso Of the initial zzso zzso remained zzso and zzso reverted to normal zzso zzso whilst zzso of the initial zzso deteriorated to zzso The zzso more strongly influencing worsening of zzso tolerance were age zzso than 50 zzso baseline zzso zzso greater than zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso greater than zzso zzso and initial body mass index zzso than 27 zzso In conclusion the data permit a better insight into the natural history of, and risk factors for, disturbed zzso tolerance in this zzso
