Over the last decade, associations between Body Mass Index zzso and a variety of candidate genes have been reported, but samples have almost all been limited to zzso The purpose of the present study was to test the zzso origins of some of these associations in a large zzso sample of zzso 

For 10 zzso zzso zzso in candidate genes reported to be associated with zzso in adults, we examined associations with zzso in a sample of zzso children zzso twin zzso with zzso data at 4, 7 and 10 zzso Association analyses were performed using the zzso zzso zzso Test and we corrected for multiple testing using the False Discovery zzso 

Despite having zzso power to detect associations that account for as little as zzso of the zzso of zzso none of the 10 zzso were significantly associated with zzso at any age, although two zzso showed trends in the expected zzso 

The lack of association for these ten previously reported associations, despite our large sample size, is typical of associations between candidate genes and complex zzso However, some of the reported zzso associations with zzso might emerge as we continue to follow the sample into adolescence and zzso This report highlights the importance of zzso appropriate candidate zzso
