zzso environments may be an important contextual explanation for the growing obesity epidemic, including its unequal social zzso The objective of this study was to determine whether geographic access to fast-food outlets varied by neighborhood deprivation and school socioeconomic ranking, and whether any such associations differed to those for access to healthier food zzso 

Data were collected on the location of fast-food outlets, supermarkets, and convenience stores across New zzso The data were zzso and geographic information systems used to calculate travel distances from each census zzso zzso zzso and each school, to the closest fast-food zzso Median travel distances are reported by a zzso index of socioeconomic deprivation for each neighborhood, and by a Ministry of Education measure of socioeconomic circumstances for each zzso zzso were repeated for outlets selling healthy food to allow zzso 

At the national level, statistically significant negative associations were found between neighborhood access to the nearest fast-food outlet and neighborhood deprivation zzso for both multinational fast-food outlets and locally operated zzso The travel distances to both types of fast food outlet were at least twice as far in the least socially deprived neighborhoods compared to the most deprived zzso A similar pattern was found for outlets selling healthy food such as zzso and smaller food outlets zzso These relationships were broadly linear with travel distances tending to be shorter in zzso zzso 

There is a strong association between neighborhood deprivation and geographic access to fast food outlets in New Zealand, which may contribute to the understanding of environmental causes of zzso However, outlets potentially selling healthy food zzso zzso are patterned by deprivation in a similar zzso These findings highlight the importance of considering all aspects of the food environment zzso and zzso when developing environmental strategies to address the obesity zzso
