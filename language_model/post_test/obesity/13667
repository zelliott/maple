To investigate whether insulin resistance zzso and the zzso syndrome zzso are associated with kidney dysfunction in obese zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso age zzso 41 zzso 14 zzso zzso subjects zzso or zzso 30 zzso range zzso 43 zzso 8 zzso were zzso zzso measures, blood pressure, zzso zzso insulin, zzso profile, and serum zzso were zzso zzso zzso rate zzso was estimated zzso with the zzso of Diet in Renal Disease zzso zzso kidney disease zzso was defined as zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was associated with gender zzso lower in zzso zzso zzso zzso and age zzso zzso zzso was present in 32 subjects zzso who were older zzso zzso and more frequently affected by hypertension zzso zzso zzso as compared to subjects without zzso zzso was present in 212 zzso zzso They were older zzso had lower zzso zzso zzso zzso and were more frequently affected by zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than those without zzso However, differences in zzso values and in the risk of zzso were no longer statistically significant after adjusting for age zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the risk of zzso zzso zzso model assessment of zzso zzso index was neither higher in subject with zzso zzso zzso zzso nor zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

In zzso individuals the risk of zzso is independent of the zzso and related zzso This suggests that these individuals are not susceptible to a further deleterious role on kidney function on the top of that played by obesity zzso
