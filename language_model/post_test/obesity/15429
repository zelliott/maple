The discovery of the zzso gene and its product, zzso is a good example of the contribution made by molecular biology to the understanding of mechanisms initially hypothesized from classic zzso zzso zzso is produced in zzso tissue and acts on the central nervous system to regulate multiple neuroendocrine zzso In three rare cases of human zzso zzso the discovery of zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso genes shows that zzso plays a crucial role in the control of weight and several zzso functions zzso zzso These studies also illustrate the limits of zzso in the investigation of zzso forms of animal zzso and the difficulties of linking molecular findings to the zzso of complex diseases, such as human common zzso Previous searches for zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso genes indicated that these are probably not major genes for common forms of human zzso This review focuses on the recent molecular findings that have indicated a putative role for the zzso axis in human zzso
