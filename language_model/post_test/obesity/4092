zzso of the zzso zzso zzso system, consisting of the zzso zzso and zzso may be beneficial for treatment of insulin resistance and/or obesity by interfering with de zzso zzso and zzso We have evaluated effects of pharmacological zzso of zzso by zzso zzso on high fat zzso zzso insulin resistance in zzso 

Male zzso mice were fed control zzso a zzso diet or a zzso diet supplemented with SP zzso or 100 zzso 

Body weight gain and total body fat content of zzso animals were significantly reduced compared with zzso zzso zzso synthesis of zzso was significantly reduced in mice treated with SP, indicative for zzso zzso Plasma zzso levels were significantly elevated by SP, reflecting simultaneous zzso of zzso zzso Mice treated with SP showed improved peripheral insulin sensitivity, as assessed by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso system is of potential use for treatment of key components of the zzso zzso
