zzso is associated with enhanced zzso oxygen species zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, a zzso role for zzso in zzso tissue expansion after high fat feeding is not zzso The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the cell permeable zzso zzso zzso and zzso scavenger zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso tissue expansion and zzso in response to high fat diet zzso in zzso 

Male zzso mice were fed normal zzso or high fat diet zzso and treated with saline or zzso for 5 zzso The effects of zzso on body zzso whole body energy zzso zzso tissue zzso and gene expression were zzso 

zzso attenuated weight gain and zzso through a reduction in zzso zzso zzso and fatty acid zzso in zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso white zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso reduced zzso death and inflammation in zzso and diminished circulating levels of free fatty acids and zzso Despite these improvements, the development of systemic insulin resistance and diabetes after zzso was not prevented with zzso zzso 

Taken together, these data suggest a zzso role for zzso in the development of zzso visceral zzso but not in the development of insulin resistance and type 2 zzso
