This study examined changes in zzso Y zzso zzso zzso binding in the brains of zzso mice in response to different levels of high-fat diets via three dietary intervention zzso high-fat diet, switching from zzso to low-fat diet and finally, energy restricted high-fat zzso zzso zzso male mice were fed a high-fat diet for 8 weeks and then classified as zzso obese zzso or zzso zzso mice according to the highest and lowest body weight zzso zzso The zzso and DR mice were then randomly divided into three groups each and either continued on their high-fat diet ad zzso zzso and zzso changed to a low-fat diet zzso and zzso or zzso via energy restricted high-fat diet zzso and zzso for a further 6 zzso During the course of this study, body weight, energy intake and plasma zzso zzso zzso were zzso The study revealed that the replacement of a high-fat diet with a low-fat diet was associated with a significant lowering of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding in both the zzso and zzso mice zzso zzso and also a lowered plasma zzso level in the zzso mice zzso Despite a continued consumption of the high-fat diet, energy restricted pair feeding caused a lower zzso zzso zzso binding in the obese mice zzso following weight loss compared to the zzso mice zzso In conclusion, this study showed that changing diets from zzso to low-fat can significantly lower the zzso zzso zzso binding irrespective to the obesity zzso Energy zzso even while on high-fat zzso can cause a lower zzso zzso zzso binding compared to DR mice even after body weight loss to similar zzso This suggests either a possible intrinsic nature of the zzso mice or a body weight zzso zzso to drive body weight zzso
