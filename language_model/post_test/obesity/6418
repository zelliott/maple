Several studies have shown that zzso markers of inflammation and zzso dysfunction are zzso of zzso events, and correlated with indirect measures of zzso and insulin action, thus providing a possible link between zzso insulin resistance and zzso We examined the relationship between zzso markers of inflammation and zzso dysfunction and direct measures of zzso and insulin action in zzso Indians, a population with a very high prevalence of obesity and insulin resistance, but a relatively low propensity for zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso of the inflammatory markers zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso and of the zzso markers zzso and von zzso factor zzso were measured in 32 zzso zzso Indians (18 zzso zzso age zzso zzso in whom percent body fat and zzso zzso disposal zzso were assessed by zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were all positively correlated with percent body fat zzso zzso and zzso all zzso zzso and zzso were not correlated with percent body fat, but were zzso correlated with M zzso zzso and zzso both zzso and positively correlated with zzso zzso and zzso both zzso These findings indicate that zzso markers of inflammation increase with increasing zzso in zzso Indians whereas zzso markers of zzso dysfunction increase primarily in proportion to the degree of insulin resistance and zzso Thus, obesity and insulin resistance appear to be associated with zzso inflammation and zzso dysfunction, respectively, even in an zzso and zzso population with relatively low propensity for zzso
