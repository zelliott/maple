We characterized the zzso and zzso blood pressures of zzso males from 15 zzso mouse strains and found that blood pressures among strains were continuously distributed and that strain zzso had the lowest mean zzso and zzso pressure zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and a strain with obesity and diabetes, zzso had the highest zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso To understand the relationship of blood pressure with insulin resistance and zzso we produced F1 and zzso progeny from zzso crosses of zzso the strain with zzso diabetes, and high blood pressure, and the strain with the lowest blood pressures, zzso Mean zzso pressures of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso males were similar to each other zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and were intermediate to those of the parental zzso zzso pressure of zzso males zzso zzso zzso was distributed normally about the mean, suggesting that blood pressure is a zzso zzso The body mass index zzso and plasma insulin levels of zzso progeny correlated significantly and positively with plasma zzso levels, suggesting that obesity is associated with insulin zzso In contrast, zzso pressure did not correlate with zzso plasma zzso levels, and plasma insulin levels, suggesting that genes underlying the development of hypertension in this zzso are not associated with the development of obesity and insulin zzso Our results demonstrate that the progeny of zzso and zzso zzso are a practical and powerful tool for identifying blood pressure genes and for understanding human zzso zzso
