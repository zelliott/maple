We evaluated 1492 adults, aged zzso years, who were selected using random zzso zzso During a general interview, participants were asked to report their current height and weight and actual anthropometrical zzso were obtained as part of a subsequent physical zzso We classified as unaware subjects who reported not to know their height or zzso 

In this sample, 185 zzso subjects reported not to know their height or weight zzso of females and zzso of zzso p zzso Women unaware of their weight or height were older, less educated, overweight or obese, never smoker and more frequently reported no regular physical exercise zzso In men, only zzso were significantly less aware of their weight or zzso In women, the prevalence of obesity using measured data was zzso decreasing to zzso when considering only participants aware of their weight and zzso Using zzso data the obesity zzso in zzso was zzso 

A large proportion of adults, mainly women and older zzso reported not to know their weight and height and the exclusion of those participants results in differential errors depending on the actual zzso The exclusion of participants unaware of their weight or height is an additional source of bias that decreases the sensitivity in detecting obesity and zzso the real problem, namely in the older zzso
