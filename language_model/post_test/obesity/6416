The effects of zzso on zzso and zzso transcript zzso and zzso protein zzso expression in the zzso zzso nucleus of obese zzso mice were zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso mice relative to levels in lean zzso zzso The zzso expression of these zzso in either young zzso zzso mice or rats treated with zzso a synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso did not differ significantly from that in the corresponding zzso After a zzso fast, which decreased the concentration of serum zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression decreased and increased, respectively, in zzso zzso The expression levels of these zzso in zzso zzso zzso double zzso were comparable to those in zzso zzso zzso zzso thus zzso both zzso and zzso zzso expression in obese zzso mice, whereas zzso signals are blocked at the zzso zzso Taken together, the present findings indicate that differential expression of these zzso in zzso and zzso mice results in dissimilar progression toward zzso
