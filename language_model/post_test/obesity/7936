zzso plasma zzso of total homocysteine zzso and obesity are risk factors for cardiovascular zzso The relationship between zzso and obesity has not been totally zzso 

The first aim of the study was to investigate whether zzso zzso and insulin resistance contribute to the variation in homocysteine levels in obese zzso Our second aim was to determine if any relationship exists between the carotid zzso thickness zzso and plasma zzso levels in obese subjects without traditional cardiovascular risk zzso 

Fifty-five obese (15 male, 40 zzso and 30 (11 male, 19 zzso zzso and zzso apparently healthy volunteers were zzso zzso criteria were smoking, hypertension, diabetes, vitamin zzso zzso zzso failure, liver disease, pregnancy, menopause and secondary obesity such as zzso syndrome, zzso zzso zzso vitamin B12 levels, zzso insulin, zzso total cholesterol, zzso zzso LDL zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso clearance were zzso zzso ultrasound zzso of carotid zzso were zzso 

zzso levels and carotid zzso were comparable between obese and non-obese zzso zzso ratio zzso was related to zzso and carotid zzso zzso subjects zzso zzso had greater zzso than zzso zzso Both zzso levels and carotid zzso were higher in male subjects both in obese and non-obese zzso No association was observed between insulin resistance and zzso and carotid zzso Renal function and abdominal obesity were significant zzso of plasma zzso zzso 

We concluded that, in obese subjects who are free from zzso and impaired zzso function, plasma zzso levels do not differ from healthy zzso Plasma zzso zzso are not related to carotid zzso in obese subjects during the zzso zzso Although no significant difference was observed between zzso and zzso subjects compared to the plasma zzso levels, the relationship between zzso levels and some components of the insulin resistance syndrome may support the opinion that zzso may be considered a component of the insulin resistance zzso
