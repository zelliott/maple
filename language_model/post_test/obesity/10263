To explain the considerations governing the zzso management of pregnant patients with zzso syndrome zzso zzso syndrome is a zzso vascular disease characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso and limb zzso and is associated with both zzso and zzso zzso The importance of this diagnosis, including the presence of zzso vascular anomalies, is often zzso by both zzso and zzso zzso While regional zzso management of patients with zzso has been discussed by others, we present a case in which regional zzso presented an zzso risk to the zzso 

An obese, zzso zzso with a fetus in the zzso position underwent zzso delivery at 35 weeks gestation secondary to evolving zzso Unfortunately, no zzso imaging of this patient's spine was zzso The patient underwent an attempted external zzso version, a failed zzso zzso and, ultimately, a zzso delivery under general zzso The resulting infant was without any zzso of zzso Both mother and infant did well during the course of their zzso and were discharged home without zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso of zzso may be associated with underlying zzso and zzso vascular zzso zzso of these vascular anomalies during regional zzso may lead to zzso zzso formation, which may be further compounded by a zzso zzso observed in some cases of zzso If zzso vascular anomalies cannot be ruled out zzso regional zzso should be zzso Additionally, regardless of the zzso technique zzso the zzso profile of these patients should be verified for signs of zzso
