Weight regain after weight loss is a major hurdle for combating zzso The aim of this study is to examine zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso nucleus zzso in response to weight loss after chronic energy intake zzso Thirty mice were fed with a high-fat diet for 8 weeks and then classified as zzso obese zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso mice according to the highest and lowest body weight zzso Five mice from zzso and DR groups were placed on an energy restricted diet or continued on their high-fat diet ad zzso for 6 zzso An additional five mice were on a zzso diet throughout the course of this study as zzso zzso showed that a zzso energy restricted diet completely reversed the increased body weight, fat mass and zzso in the zzso mice to the levels of the zzso and DR zzso Arc zzso Y zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso expression in zzso mice after obesity reversal were significantly higher than zzso mice without obesity reversal zzso zzso both zzso while the Arc zzso zzso and zzso and zzso transcript zzso zzso showed no zzso Both zzso and zzso expression in zzso mice were zzso correlated with plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, while chronic energy restriction will lead to weight loss, it can zzso zzso zzso zzso which may be an important contributing factor to weight regain after a weight loss program from an energy restricted zzso
