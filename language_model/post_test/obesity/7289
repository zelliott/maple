It has been difficult to distinguish the independent effects of caloric restriction versus exercise training on insulin zzso 

zzso zzso feeding and supervised exercise training, we examined the influence of caloric restriction zzso exercise training with and without weight loss on zzso and peripheral insulin zzso 

Thirty-four obese, older subjects were zzso to: caloric restriction with weight loss zzso exercise training with weight loss zzso exercise training without weight loss zzso or zzso Based on an equivalent caloric deficit in zzso and zzso we induced matched weight zzso zzso in the zzso group received caloric zzso Combined with zzso an zzso zzso zzso insulin infusion was performed to determine suppression of zzso production zzso and zzso zzso disposal zzso zzso zzso scans were performed to assess changes in fat zzso 

Body weight decreased similarly in zzso and zzso and did not change in zzso and zzso The reduction in visceral fat was significantly greater in zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso compared to zzso and zzso The increase in zzso was also almost zzso greater (27 zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso promoted similar improvements in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso promoted the most significant reduction in visceral fat and the greatest improvement in zzso zzso increases in zzso were noted in zzso and zzso whereas zzso provided a modest zzso Based on our results, zzso promoted the optimal zzso changes in body fat distribution and systemic insulin zzso
