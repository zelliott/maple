The role of zzso in contributing to zzso cardiovascular and zzso risk has gained much zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso and subcutaneous fat were collected from 16 lean subjects and 32 central obesity zzso The expression of zzso in zzso and subcutaneous fat was zzso by western zzso method, and correlations with plasma zzso zzso model assessment insulin resistance zzso and zzso were zzso 

In obese female, zzso expression was higher in the zzso than in the subcutaneous fat zzso There was no significant difference in the levels of zzso between subcutaneous and visceral fat in obese zzso zzso positive correlations were found between zzso zzso protein and plasma zzso levels in zzso In obese female subjects, zzso zzso protein levels showed a close association with most of the parameters zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In obese male population, correlations between zzso zzso protein levels and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso may play a key role in contributing to cardiovascular risk in central obesity zzso
