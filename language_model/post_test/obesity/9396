zzso characterized by zzso in insulin production and zzso is zzso associated with prostate cancer risk irrespective of zzso zzso a diabetes risk factor, is zzso associated with localized disease but positively associated with advanced zzso To understand the complex association between zzso and prostate cancer, we evaluated the association of plasma zzso an insulin zzso marker, with prostate cancer risk in a zzso study zzso in a prospective community zzso zzso cancer cases zzso zzso zzso and matched controls zzso zzso zzso were identified in the zzso II cohort between 1989 zzso and zzso zzso concentration was measured in baseline plasma by zzso zzso ratios zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso zzso were estimated using conditional zzso regression, adjusting for being overweight or obese and family zzso Median zzso concentration was lower in cases zzso zzso than in controls zzso zzso P zzso zzso Men in the highest zzso zzso fourth of zzso had a lower risk for prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso primarily localized disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were similar to overall, when excluding cases diagnosed during the first 5 years of zzso men with diabetes, or men who had not had a zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration was zzso associated with subsequent diagnosis of prostate cancer, primarily localized disease, similar to the association for zzso However, we cannot rule out detection bias that might result if men with higher zzso have lower zzso zzso irrespective of whether prostate cancer is present or zzso
