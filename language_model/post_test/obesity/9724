zzso zzso Kappa zzso also termed zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso has been implicated in the zzso zzso of zzso and has been zzso correlated with obesity in mice and zzso We investigated zzso in zzso mice and surprisingly found no difference in the levels of total serum zzso or the level of high molecular weight zzso zzso when compared with normal zzso zzso zzso gel zzso and western zzso also showed a similar distribution of low, middle and zzso zzso in normal and zzso zzso Variation in zzso has been correlated with zzso tolerance and with the levels of zzso zzso but we found similar zzso tolerance and similar levels of zzso zzso protein zzso in normal and zzso zzso zzso our findings suggest that zzso is not absolutely required for zzso zzso in zzso and alternate pathways may be activated in zzso zzso
