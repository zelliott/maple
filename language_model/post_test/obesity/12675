Three separate experiments in lean subjects confirmed that a zzso zzso zzso supplement at breakfast suppressed appetite 90 zzso later but had no effect on a test meal given after zzso zzso A zzso zzso fat supplement produced no zzso action on measures of appetite at any time zzso zzso fat and zzso do not have identical effects on the appetite zzso In a further study in obese subjects, a novel experimental design was used to assess the zzso efficiency and zzso response of zzso Eating from a range of either high-fat or zzso foods, obese subjects voluntarily consumed twice as much energy from the fat items, thereby indicating a weak action of fat on zzso In turn, this large intake of fat exerted a disproportionately weak effect on zzso These studies suggest that the zzso system may have only weak zzso mechanisms to prevent the passive overconsumption of dietary zzso The results indicate how this action could induce a positive energy balance and lead to a gradual upward drift in body mass zzso
