zzso promotes zzso zzso into zzso tissue and is associated with increases in several cardiovascular zzso zzso of zzso II zzso to mice zzso formation of abdominal zzso zzso zzso with profound zzso and zzso zzso zzso We sought to determine whether obesity promotes zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso tissue surrounding abdominal zzso and increases zzso zzso 

zzso white zzso surrounded abdominal zzso whereas brown zzso surrounded zzso zzso of obese zzso zzso abundance of zzso zzso zzso and their receptors were elevated with obesity to a greater extent in abdominal compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso surrounding abdominal zzso of obese mice released greater zzso of zzso and promoted more zzso migration than zzso from zzso zzso Male zzso mice were fed a high-fat zzso diet for 1, 2, or 4 months and then infused with zzso zzso zzso for 28 zzso AAA zzso increased progressively with the duration of zzso feeding zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso mice exhibited increased zzso compared to lean controls zzso compared to zzso respectively, zzso zzso of zzso to obese mice promoted further zzso zzso into zzso and visceral zzso zzso and obese mice exhibiting zzso had greater zzso content in visceral zzso tissue than mice not developing zzso 

Increased zzso zzso in zzso zzso tissue surrounding abdominal zzso of zzso obese mice is associated with enhanced AAA zzso
