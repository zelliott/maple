Food reinforcement is zzso related to zzso and energy intake in adults, and zzso predicts weight gain in children, but there has not been any research studying food reinforcement as a predictor of adult weight zzso 

This study examined whether the relative reinforcing value of food versus sedentary activities, as measured on a progressive ratio schedule, predicts 12-month weight gain in a sample of 115 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and dietary restraint were also examined as potential zzso of this zzso 

In a zzso zzso controlling for baseline age and weight, dietary hunger, income, sex, and minority status, food reinforcement and predicted weight gain zzso zzso zzso significantly increased the zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso moderated this relationship zzso zzso zzso and increased the zzso an additional zzso zzso zzso zzso such that individuals with high food reinforcement had greater weight gain if they were also high in zzso 

These results suggest that food reinforcement is a significant contributor to weight change over time, and food reinforcement may have the biggest effect on those who are most responsive to food zzso
