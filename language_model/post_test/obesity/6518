Half the rats fed a zzso diet develop zzso obesity zzso the remainder are zzso zzso Since zzso zzso both food intake and body weight, this study was conducted to identify potential differences in brain zzso binding which might zzso some animals to become zzso zzso and others DR zzso when fed a high energy zzso zzso rats can be zzso identified by high and zzso rats by a low plasma zzso zzso response to zzso zzso Here 28 zzso rats were tested for zzso zzso release and the 6 highest and 6 lowest plasma zzso zzso were identified as being most likely to be zzso and zzso zzso zzso to brain zzso was studied in these 12 rats by zzso zzso using 1 zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso and 1 zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso There were no differences in zzso binding in any of 18 brain areas zzso However, zzso zzso binding was only zzso of zzso levels in 9 areas including 4 zzso zzso the lateral area, zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso median zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Although it is unclear whether this widespread decrease in zzso binding implicates brain alpha zzso in the zzso of zzso it does correlate with a zzso marker zzso zzso zzso zzso which predicts the subsequent development of zzso on a zzso zzso
