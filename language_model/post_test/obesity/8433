The present study was designed to evaluate the frequency of an increase in the urinary zzso zzso rate zzso and the factors involved in this zzso in zzso obese zzso 122 zzso obese patients were zzso None had zzso or history of zzso or zzso zzso of them had moderate zzso Compared with a group of 22 lean controls, zzso was significantly higher in the obese patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso h vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso was elevated zzso 20 zzso zzso in 29 patients zzso zzso of zzso was not significantly different in zzso than in zzso zzso However zzso was significantly higher in the 32 patients with a family history of hypertension zzso zzso zzso zzso h vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso In patients with zzso body weight was significantly higher zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso plasma zzso was significantly lower zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso and the estimated value of fractional zzso clearance was significantly zzso These results show the high frequency of zzso in zzso obese zzso They suggest that zzso level may be an index of family hypertension in obese patients and that zzso is part of a widespread zzso of the zzso zzso
