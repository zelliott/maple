To evaluate kinetic defects in insulin action, we performed zzso studies during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in seven subjects with zzso zzso zzso 29 zzso and in seven lean and seven obese zzso zzso The time course of zzso zzso disposal rate zzso leg zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso output zzso and muscle insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The obese and zzso subjects had marked delays in zzso of zzso zzso 74 zzso 14 and 95 zzso 15 zzso respectively, compared with 33 zzso 2 zzso in lean control zzso zzso zzso difference zzso 80 zzso 12 and 109 zzso 31 zzso compared with 30 zzso 3 zzso and zzso zzso 89 zzso 25 and 98 zzso 27 zzso compared with 29 zzso 4 zzso All three zzso reached normal levels in the zzso group after 4-5 h of insulin zzso Although only a limited number of data points could be obtained from serial muscle zzso no delay in the rate of zzso of zzso was apparent in the obese and zzso zzso In conclusion, 1) in obese and zzso subjects, zzso zzso and zzso are delayed to a similar zzso 2) mass action zzso zzso and zzso in zzso but only after several hours of insulin zzso and 3) The kinetic zzso in zzso and obesity most likely involves zzso zzso zzso to zzso of the insulin zzso zzso
