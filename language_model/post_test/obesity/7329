This work was planned to check for the association of zzso related to zzso zzso zzso and zzso converting zzso zzso genes with zzso among Saudi subjects from zzso zzso 

This work included 130 subjects having overweight or obesity and 111 normal zzso Their age mean zzso zzso was 27 zzso zzso and 24 zzso zzso years zzso Their DNA was analyzed for zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes using real-time zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso of studied zzso in cases of zzso showed no significant statistical difference compared to that of zzso However, on analysis of body mass index zzso cases showed slightly higher but statistically zzso mean zzso zzso values among those carrying the zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso D zzso zzso + zzso zzso II, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition controls having the zzso and ID zzso showed higher statistically significant values of zzso than those of the II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, p zzso 

There is no solid association of zzso related to zzso and zzso genes with zzso overweight or obesity among Saudi subjects from zzso zzso
