The zzso cardiac protection was studied in zzso obese zzso zzso were divided into five groups: group 1, lean zzso group 2, obese control zzso group 3, obese rats treated orally with 5 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso for 2 zzso group 4, obese rats received zzso zzso solution ad zzso for 3 zzso zzso and group 5, obese rats received zzso zzso for 3 zzso and zzso zzso during the 2nd and 3rd zzso Body weight, serum zzso and insulin were measured, and then hearts were isolated and subjected to 30 zzso of zzso followed by 120 zzso of zzso Heart rate, coronary flow, zzso flow, developed pressure, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso size were zzso zzso reduced body weight and serum zzso in the OR compared with the OC values zzso zzso 10 g and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, to zzso zzso 12 g and zzso zzso zzso zzso but insulin levels were zzso The same results were obtained for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso improved zzso cardiac function in the presence or absence of zzso intake compared with the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso size was reduced by 83 and zzso in the OR group, and 67 and zzso in the zzso group, compared with the OC and zzso groups, zzso zzso increased zzso expression and reduced zzso expression and cardiac zzso in zzso hearts in the presence or absence of zzso zzso Thus the protective effect of zzso could be related to its direct effects on the zzso
