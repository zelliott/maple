Role of obesity in zzso pathological and structural changes remains poorly investigated, and this study was designed to examine the pathological effects of obesity on zzso structural components in patients with chronic kidney diseases zzso 

The study subjects were obese zzso mass index, zzso or zzso 25 zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso 26), zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso benign zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and thin basement membrane disease zzso zzso zzso zzso and 65 zzso controls zzso zzso 20, 20, 10, and 15, zzso Patients were evaluated for zzso zzso zzso proliferation and focal zzso zzso zzso size, and thickness of zzso basement membrane zzso 

zzso protein was higher in obese zzso zzso and zzso groups than in the respective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were noted in all obesity zzso The zzso were larger in size in obese than in zzso patients of the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso patients were significantly larger in size than those of zzso zzso zzso zzso were thicker in obese than in zzso patients irrespective of types of zzso diseases, but only significantly so in zzso and zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso and zzso obesity worsens zzso and is associated with structural changes such as zzso and zzso zzso similar to changes observed in zzso zzso zzso seems to zzso the zzso state in zzso
