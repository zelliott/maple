We analyzed data from workers from the zzso Australian National Health zzso zzso Participants reported their activity at work zzso sitting, standing, walking, or heavy zzso zzso walking, zzso sitting and physical zzso Body mass index was zzso zzso zzso Cox zzso hazard zzso models examined associations between occupational activity category, zzso sitting, physical activity and obesity zzso 

zzso proportions of men zzso and women zzso mostly sit at zzso Workers with sitting jobs were significantly more likely to be sufficiently active during zzso than workers with mostly standing, walking or heavy labor jobs zzso zzso zzso zzso Workers with mostly sitting jobs had significantly higher zzso risk than workers with mostly standing jobs zzso zzso zzso zzso independent of physical activity and zzso zzso Workers with zzso sitting of less than four hours per day had significantly lower obesity risk than workers with four or more hours per day of zzso sitting zzso zzso zzso independent of physical activity and occupational zzso 

Sitting time and physical activity are independently associated with zzso zzso sitting may have a stronger association with obesity risk than occupational zzso
