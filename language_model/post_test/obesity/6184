zzso has previously been shown to correlate with higher stage and decreased survival in pancreatic zzso The aim of this study was to determine the impact of obesity on operative zzso zzso and overall zzso 

A review of our zzso patient prospective zzso database was performed to identify patients undergoing pancreatic zzso from January 1991 to August 2008 for zzso zzso was defined as a body mass index zzso 30 zzso Data was analyzed using zzso zzso test, and zzso zzso Survival was analyzed using zzso zzso zzso complications were assessed using a zzso zzso P zzso was considered zzso 

Of zzso patients undergoing pancreatic zzso for pancreatic zzso zzso 68 were defined as zzso There was no significant difference seen in length of stay, operative time, tumor size, or zzso zzso zzso patients had a higher operative blood loss zzso 650 zzso 400 zzso P zzso zzso zzso patients were more likely to suffer zzso complications zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was no significant difference seen in zzso survival or overall survival zzso months for obese zzso zzso months for zzso P zzso zzso zzso months for obese zzso zzso months for zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso patients had a higher rate and greater severity of zzso zzso with increased operative blood zzso However, obese patients did not demonstrate any significant difference in specific zzso factors or zzso These data suggest an equivalent zzso effect of obesity on pancreatic cancer zzso
