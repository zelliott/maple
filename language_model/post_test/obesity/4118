Few studies have explored the relationship between weight bias and weight loss treatment zzso 

This investigation examined the relationship between implicit and explicit weight bias and zzso program attrition, zzso weight loss, zzso zzso zzso zzso daily exercise levels and overall caloric zzso zzso daily caloric zzso and zzso daily caloric deficit among zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso adults zzso mass zzso or zzso 27 zzso participating in an zzso zzso behavioral weight loss program completed implicit and explicit measures of weight zzso Participants were instructed to zzso and zzso report daily energy zzso exercise, and energy zzso 

Greater weight bias was associated with inconsistent zzso greater caloric zzso lower energy expenditure and exercise, creation of a smaller caloric deficit, higher program attrition, as well as less weight loss during the self-help phase of the zzso zzso 

Weight bias may interfere with zzso zzso adults' ability to achieve optimal zzso
