Recently, great progress has been made towards understanding the molecular basis of body fat zzso Identification of zzso in several genes in spontaneous zzso animal models of obesity and development of transgenic models have indicated the zzso roles of many genes in the regulation of body fat zzso In humans, zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes have been described in patients with severe zzso Most of these obesity disorders exhibit a distinct zzso with varying degrees of zzso and zzso dysfunction and a zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso has a zzso zzso with dominant zzso These zzso suggest the critical role of central signaling systems composed of zzso zzso and zzso stimulating zzso in human energy zzso Although the genetic basis of zzso disorders of body fat distribution, such as zzso generalized zzso and familial partial zzso zzso zzso is still unknown, the genes for these have recently been localized to zzso zzso and zzso zzso The advances in our knowledge of the zzso manifestations and underlying molecular mechanisms of genetic body fat disorders may lead to better treatment and prevention of obesity and other disorders of zzso tissue in the zzso
