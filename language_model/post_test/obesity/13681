zzso has been recognized for its involvement in food zzso control of energy zzso and zzso zzso However, the roles of genetic variations in the zzso precursor gene zzso on body compositions and serum lipids are not clear in zzso Our study investigated five zzso zzso zzso within zzso to determine their relationship with body fat percentage zzso trunk fat percentage zzso lower body zzso fat percentage zzso and serum lipids in zzso subjects, which were recruited from the genetically homogeneous population of zzso and Labrador zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin, total cholesterol, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Five zzso are zzso zzso a transition substitution in zzso 1), zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso near the 3' untranslated zzso of zzso were zzso using zzso validated or functionally tested zzso zzso zzso Our study found no significant evidence of an zzso or zzso association between any of the zzso sites and body compositions or serum zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso were not found to be significantly different between lean and obese zzso In zzso the results of our study do not support a significant role for genetic variations in zzso in the differences of body fat and serum zzso profiles in the NL zzso
