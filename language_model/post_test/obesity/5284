Blood zzso free fatty acid and insulin responses to oral zzso and the zzso serum lipids were measured in 3 groups: 32 non-obese zzso age: zzso zzso and 9 obese zzso age: zzso zzso male patients with coronary heart disease and 12 non-obese male controls zzso age: zzso zzso The oral zzso tolerance tests were repeated after 3 years in 16 of the non-obese patients with coronary heart zzso The results were as zzso 1) zzso tolerance was impaired in 19 of 32 non-obese patients zzso There was a significant correlation between impaired zzso tolerance and zzso zzso and/or zzso 2) In obese patients zzso levels at 30, 60, and 120 zzso after oral zzso administration were significantly elevated and zzso decrease was delayed with a drop to minimum levels at 180 zzso 3) The insulin response after oral zzso administration in the group of non-obese patients with normal zzso tolerance was similar to that of non-obese zzso In the group of non-obese patients with impaired zzso zzso serum insulin levels went up to normal levels, but the peak was zzso The serum insulin levels in obese patients were significantly higher than those of controls of 0, 60, zzso and 180 zzso After 3 years the change in insulin response to oral zzso was not related to zzso symptoms or zzso findings, but was related to body weight change in patients with minor changes in zzso zzso 4) The zzso pattern in the non-obese group with impaired zzso tolerance resembled that of zzso zzso in delayed response of insulin and zzso and mild zzso These findings suggest that obesity may contribute to zzso in patients with coronary heart disease and that impaired zzso tolerance observed in patients with coronary heart disease is in part due to zzso zzso
