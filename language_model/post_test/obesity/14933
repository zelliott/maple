The assessment of carotid zzso thickness zzso may improve cardiovascular risk zzso The optimal protocol for zzso measurement is zzso zzso may be measured in the common carotid artery zzso carotid zzso zzso and internal carotid artery zzso but zzso from CB and zzso are more difficult to zzso We studied the influence of body mass index zzso and zzso plaques on the capacity to obtain zzso zzso at different carotid zzso 

Using an automatic system, zzso was measured in 700 subjects aged zzso in the near and far walls of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso zzso and vascular risk factors were zzso 

zzso zzso in zzso were possible in all except one zzso It was not possible to obtain zzso zzso at CB or zzso in zzso of normal weight and zzso of obese zzso The likelihood of obtaining zzso measurement at all carotid sites decreased as the zzso zzso zzso plaques in a carotid segment did not zzso zzso measurement at this zzso 

zzso zzso in zzso carotid segments are more challenging in obese zzso zzso zzso at zzso remains feasible in obese subjects and should be the primary zzso in these zzso Nevertheless, CB and zzso zzso when zzso would improve risk zzso
