For more than a decade, insulin resistance has been proposed as the key linking factor for the zzso syndrome disease cluster of zzso zzso hypertension, zzso zzso and cardiovascular zzso Although most of the zzso zzso and clinical evidence still support the role of insulin resistance as an important component of this multifaceted syndrome, there is evidence amassing that a zzso zzso including an zzso role for zzso probably plays a more fundamental zzso This is supported by the strong associations between zzso especially central zzso and all components of the zzso syndrome, in contrast to the inconsistent relationships between blood pressure and markers of insulin zzso However, much of the effect of visceral fat on cardiovascular risk factors is zzso through the zzso actions of free fatty acids zzso on insulin resistance, thus resolving any obesity versus insulin resistance zzso In addition to the roles of obesity and zzso in the development of insulin resistance syndrome, the high prevalence rates of this disease cluster among subjects from low socioeconomic groups as well as from developing countries have led to alternative hypotheses to better our understanding of the zzso roles of zzso in zzso and genetic factors in this zzso More recently, the zzso roles of iron overload and liver dysfunction have also been zzso In this article, the various hypotheses which have been put forward to explain the diverse clinical manifestations of the zzso or insulin resistance syndrome are summarized and put into zzso While there is clinical and experimental evidence to support many of these independent zzso alternative statistical methods such as factor analysis or structural equation modeling may be needed to unravel the complex nature of these interacting zzso Finally, these zzso if zzso will add new dimensions to our current strategies and emphasize the need to focus on behavioral and socioeconomic interventions in addition to the use of pharmacological therapy in our attempt to control this epidemic disease of modern zzso
