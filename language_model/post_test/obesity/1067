The simultaneous launch of zzso and zzso in 1998 provoked much media attention, particularly around the role of lifestyle drugs and their potential costs if controls were not zzso zzso were also expressed that primary care would be overwhelmed by demand, and little information was available about the attitude of zzso to their new role as zzso of zzso zzso Partly in response to these concerns, tight prescribing guidelines and licensed zzso for zzso and zzso respectively, were zzso 

Our aim was to describe levels of demand for zzso and zzso in general practice, whether this demand was translated into a prescription, adherence to prescribing zzso indications and the zzso perception of appropriateness of an zzso prescription for either of these zzso 

We carried out an zzso study in primary care conducted over a zzso period during zzso zzso zzso were zzso each from a different zzso All zzso consultations were recorded for the study period and the zzso completed a structured questionnaire each time zzso or zzso were discussed in a zzso 

zzso was discussed in zzso zzso zzso of consultations and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso thought that a corresponding zzso prescription would be highly appropriate in 57 and zzso of cases, respectively, although for both lifestyle drugs, nearly zzso of zzso thought such prescriptions were zzso An zzso prescription was issued in zzso of consultations in which zzso had been discussed and zzso in which zzso had been zzso Five out of 29 zzso zzso prescriptions were issued to patients failing to zzso the requirements of prescribing zzso similarly, one out of 14 zzso prescriptions fell outside licensed zzso There were four examples of zzso prescriptions for zzso which were given even when the zzso thought the drug to be inappropriate, whereas zzso was never given when the zzso thought it zzso 

zzso of demand for the two lifestyle drugs, zzso and zzso were modest when compared with earlier media zzso Neither was there evidence that zzso was pitted against patient in their negotiation concerning a lifestyle drug zzso prescription since most zzso agreed with their patients that such a prescription was zzso zzso guidelines and licensed indications were generally zzso to, but the modest level of demand raises questions about expanding the guidelines for zzso
