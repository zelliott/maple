To investigate the effect of massive weight loss on zzso knee pain and zzso zzso zzso inflammation and zzso status and zzso joint zzso in obese patients with knee zzso zzso 

140 patients involved in a gastric surgery zzso were screened for painful knee zzso and 44 were included (age 44 zzso zzso years, body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Clinical data and biological samples were collected before and 6 months after zzso 

Before surgery, zzso 6 zzso levels were correlated with levels of zzso C zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso of cartilage zzso and the Western Ontario and zzso Universities zzso Index zzso function score zzso Surgery resulted in substantial decrease in zzso zzso zzso of insulin and insulin resistance were decreased at 6 zzso zzso pain decreased after surgery zzso zzso 21 zzso vs 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso and scores on all zzso zzso were zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were decreased after zzso Weight loss resulted in a significant increase in zzso zzso of type zzso collagen levels zzso zzso a zzso of cartilage zzso and a significant decrease in cartilage zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso a zzso of cartilage zzso Changes in zzso concentration were correlated with changes in insulin levels zzso and insulin resistance zzso 

zzso weight loss improves pain and function and decreases zzso zzso Change in levels of joint zzso with weight loss suggests a structural effect on zzso
