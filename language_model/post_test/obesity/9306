Data from zzso of zzso association studies provided evidence for an association of zzso with body mass index zzso and gene expression results indicated a role of these zzso in the zzso It was zzso hypothesized that these associations might be evoked by a zzso of nutritional intake or energy zzso 

It was our aim to investigate the association of these genetic factors with zzso in a large zzso zzso sample to explore the association of these zzso with lifestyle factors related to nutritional intake or energy zzso and whether such lifestyle factors could be zzso of the detected zzso zzso zzso with zzso It was a further aim to compare the proportion of zzso explained by genetic factors with the one explained by lifestyle zzso 

The association of seven zzso in or near the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was analyzed in zzso subjects from the zzso zzso zzso zzso Information on lifestyle factors was based on standardized zzso For statistical analysis, zzso models were zzso 

The minor zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The other zzso were not significantly zzso zzso factors were correlated with zzso and explained zzso of the zzso zzso as compared with zzso of explained zzso by the associated genetic zzso The genetic zzso associated with zzso were not significantly associated with lifestyle factors and there was no evidence of lifestyle factors zzso the zzso zzso 

Our data first confirm the findings for zzso with zzso in a single study on adults and also confirm the findings for zzso and zzso There was no evidence for a direct zzso zzso
