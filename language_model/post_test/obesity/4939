zzso of vascular zzso growth factor zzso has improved the outcome in experimental zzso of various origins, including diabetic zzso in a type 1 diabetic rat model and a type 2 diabetic mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso in these zzso We examined the zzso effects of zzso blockade in an obese rat model of type 2 diabetic zzso and investigated the mechanism underlying the zzso of zzso zzso 

Twenty female zzso diabetic fatty zzso rats, fed a high-fat diet and aged 10 weeks, were treated with zzso zzso or an irrelevant zzso zzso Ten zzso zzso zzso served as additional zzso lean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso clearance zzso were assessed at zzso and at 3 and 5 zzso zzso weight and zzso volume were determined at the end of the zzso zzso zzso was examined with zzso zzso zzso 

All obese animals had established diabetes, zzso and normal blood pressure, which were not influenced by zzso zzso zzso zzso control rats had increased zzso zzso kidney weights and zzso volumes compared with zzso lean control zzso zzso zzso treatment prevented the zzso zzso but did not affect zzso zzso and kidney zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not different between the zzso 

zzso of zzso prevented early zzso zzso in zzso rats with established zzso Increased zzso of zzso zzso cells does not appear to zzso the zzso of zzso zzso
