Previously, we identified a locus on zzso influencing obesity in families with type 2 zzso Based on mouse studies, we selected zzso as a functional candidate gene and performed association studies to determine whether this controls zzso We analyzed the zzso of 13 single zzso zzso zzso around zzso in zzso unrelated type 2 diabetic patients with known zzso zzso One zzso zzso was found to have a significant effect on zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso This association was confirmed in a population enriched for type 2 diabetes, using 750 individuals who were not selected for type 2 zzso Two zzso in linkage zzso with zzso and mapping to the 3' end of zzso zzso and zzso also affected zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso Combined analysis confirmed this association zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso Moreover, comparing zzso obese subjects zzso zzso from the combined cohort with zzso normal subjects zzso zzso zzso revealed that the protective zzso have a lower frequency in obese subjects zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Altogether, data from the zzso mouse as well as these data suggest that zzso could be an important factor in controlling the central regulation of body weight in zzso
