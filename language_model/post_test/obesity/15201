zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso in association with zzso elevated free zzso zzso and/or free zzso zzso have been consistently found in obese zzso To examine relationships between zzso insulin sensitivity, and zzso zzso and zzso 

240 zzso zzso children were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso sensitivity and resistance were estimated zzso insulin check index zzso insulin sensitivity index zzso and zzso insulin resistance zzso Body fat was measured by zzso X-ray zzso The central obesity index was calculated as the ratio of fat tissue in the trunk region to fat tissue in the leg zzso 

The multiple zzso analysis with age, gender and measures of zzso as zzso showed that zzso was the only significant negative predictor of zzso and central obesity index the strongest positive predictor of zzso in association with either age or zzso insulin resistance index, and that the only positive zzso of zzso was zzso insulin resistance zzso 

zzso insulin sensitivity is associated with zzso zzso and zzso while progressive central fat zzso is strictly related to a parallel increase in zzso levels, independently from total body zzso Further studies are needed to understand mechanisms linking zzso function to insulin sensitivity and body composition in obese zzso
