zzso is increasingly regarded as a key process underlying zzso diseases in obese zzso In particular, obese zzso tissue shows features characteristic of active local zzso At present, however, little is known about the sequence of events that comprises the inflammatory cascade or the mechanism by which inflammation zzso We found that large numbers of zzso zzso T cells infiltrated obese zzso zzso tissue in mice fed a high-fat diet, whereas the numbers of zzso helper and regulatory T cells were zzso The zzso by zzso T cells preceded the zzso of zzso and zzso and genetic depletion of zzso T cells lowered zzso zzso and zzso tissue inflammation and ameliorated systemic insulin zzso zzso adoptive transfer of zzso T cells to zzso mice aggravated zzso zzso zzso and other in zzso experiments revealed a vicious cycle of interactions between zzso T cells, zzso and zzso zzso Our findings suggest that obese zzso tissue activates zzso T cells, which, in turn, promote the recruitment and zzso of zzso in this zzso These results support the notion that zzso T cells have an essential role in the initiation and propagation of zzso zzso
