This study examines the zzso effects of zzso in an animal model of zzso zzso Mice were fed a standard diet or high-fat diet zzso for 5 zzso After that, the mice were divided into four experimental groups, with 10 mice per group, including a standard diet group, zzso group, zzso containing zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso group and zzso containing zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso The zzso supplementation group had significantly decreased zzso gain, food efficiency ratio and relative liver and zzso fat mass compared with the zzso zzso The mice supplemented with zzso showed significantly reduced zzso total cholesterol and zzso zzso levels in the zzso Liver zzso induced by the zzso improved in the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso affected the zzso expression patterns of zzso zzso tissue genes such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fatty acid binding protein and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may be considered for use in improving zzso
