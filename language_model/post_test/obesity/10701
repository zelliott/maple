zzso studies and zzso loading tests were carried out in order to define the zzso of zzso in 8 patients with zzso bypass surgery for severe zzso two healthy volunteers were also zzso In the bypass patients, urinary zzso was markedly elevated zzso zzso 43 zzso mean zzso zzso when they were on a high zzso diet zzso zzso zzso of dietary zzso was confirmed by the markedly increased urinary recovery of zzso given in a test zzso In addition, the zzso zzso was zzso in urine far more slowly than in healthy volunteers, suggesting that the colon was a major site of zzso zzso zzso urinary zzso zzso persisted, averaging 38 zzso 12 zzso despite zzso of a very low zzso diet zzso 6 zzso suggesting that the diet contained zzso substances other than zzso dietary zzso which also contributed to dietary zzso in these zzso zzso zzso decreased in 7 of 8 patients, however, when protein-rich foods were removed from the diet, suggesting that at least one dietary factor was zzso products of protein or zzso These results confirm the current view that in patients with zzso secondary to zzso zzso the majority of urinary zzso derives from dietary zzso that is absorbed from the zzso zzso or bacterial production of zzso or an zzso precursor from dietary constituents associated with zzso however, also appears to contribute to urinary zzso The results provide an explanation for the reported difficulty of eliminating secondary zzso by restriction of dietary zzso zzso
