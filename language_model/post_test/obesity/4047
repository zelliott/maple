The regulation of body weight depends upon the control of food intake and the regulation of energy zzso In man, the control system for food intake may be overwhelmed by psychological or social influences and the zzso response to a variable energy input may play an important role in the energy regulatory zzso Energy expenditure can be divided into 3 zzso zzso zzso rate, zzso and physical zzso Of these 3 zzso zzso zzso the energy zzso above the zzso rate in the resting zzso is the zzso The two main factors which contribute to zzso zzso food intake and cold exposure, elicit zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso It is of interest to study zzso in individuals who present a tendency to gain weight, in order to assess whether the zzso responses may be lower in these subjects than in lean zzso It has recently been shown that zzso consists of two separate components which can be described as zzso and zzso zzso The former is due to the energy costs of zzso absorbing and converting the nutrients to their respective storage zzso The latter is an energy zzso zzso mainly studied in zzso There is good experimental evidence showing that brown zzso tissue zzso is involved in the zzso zzso observed in rats fed a varied and palatable zzso zzso In addition, a zzso zzso in BAT has been demonstrated in adult as well as young genetically obese animals, and this zzso is present not only in adult, but also in young (12 day old) zzso mice, zzso before the development of zzso Thus, a defective zzso seems to be a cause, rather than a consequence, of obesity in these zzso In man, the role of zzso in energy balance regulation is not yet zzso Some conflicting results may have arisen from inadequate techniques to measure energy zzso In our laboratory, we have developed three different techniques to measure energy expenditure in man, namely direct zzso indirect zzso using an zzso zzso hood system, and a respiratory zzso Data from recent studies on zzso in man support the concept that a zzso in zzso may contribute to energy imbalance and weight gain in obese zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
