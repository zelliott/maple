This study was undertaken to investigate zzso association between zzso administration, zzso gene zzso and zzso response in humans in the presence and absence of zzso zzso Six healthy males (age zzso zzso zzso zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso body fat zzso zzso zzso received 10 zzso oral zzso in five divided doses twice zzso A and zzso 1-2 weeks apart beginning at zzso h on day 1 and ending at zzso h on day zzso The zzso administration was combined with two subcutaneous abdominal fat zzso performed at zzso h before and after zzso administration zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protocol zzso clamp carried out between zzso and zzso h on day zzso zzso gene expression zzso zzso did not zzso In both protocols on day 2, the zzso h zzso levels nearly doubled zzso zzso whereas zzso h levels nearly quadrupled zzso zzso The zzso in zzso persisted until zzso h of day 3 (24 h after last zzso zzso with its subsequent rapid zzso The short-term zzso zzso zzso zzso had no additional effect on the zzso zzso zzso We zzso that: 1) zzso administration of zzso has a marked zzso effect on circulating zzso levels but not on zzso gene expression in the subcutaneous abdominal zzso 2) The effect is sustained for the next 24 zzso 3) zzso zzso has no additional zzso We conclude that zzso is a powerful zzso of zzso production in zzso through a mechanism that appears to be independent of zzso gene zzso in the human subcutaneous abdominal zzso
