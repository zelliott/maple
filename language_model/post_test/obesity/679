Estimates of the zzso of zzso primary cardiac arrest zzso have typically relied solely upon emergency medical service or death certificate records and have not investigated zzso in clinical zzso zzso and zzso patterns of CA zzso were investigated in clinically defined groups using systematic methods to ascertain zzso Estimates of zzso were derived from a zzso zzso study in a large health plan from 1986 to zzso zzso were zzso aged 50 to 79 years who had had CA zzso zzso zzso A zzso random sample of zzso who had not had CA was used to estimate the population at risk with various clinical characteristics zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to estimate zzso overall and for zzso time periods zzso to 1988, 1989 to 1991, and 1992 to zzso The overall CA zzso was zzso zzso and varied up to zzso across clinical zzso For example, zzso was zzso zzso in subjects with any clinically recognized heart disease compared with zzso zzso in subjects without heart zzso In zzso with heart disease, zzso was zzso zzso in subjects with prior zzso zzso and zzso zzso in subjects with heart zzso zzso decreased by zzso from the initial to the final time period, with a greater decrease observed in those with zzso compared with those without zzso clinical heart zzso Thus, CA zzso varied considerably across clinical zzso The results provide insights regarding absolute and zzso risk in clinically defined subgroups, information that may aid strategies aimed at reducing mortality from zzso
