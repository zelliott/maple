zzso diabetes is characterized by zzso insulin zzso zzso resistance and accompanying zzso have been reported to play an important role in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso a mixture of zzso and geometric zzso of zzso acid, has attracted considerable attention because of its potentially beneficial biological zzso Previous studies showed that dietary zzso zzso diabetes through improvement of zzso tolerance and zzso zzso transport activity in skeletal muscle of diabetic zzso zzso muscle plays an important role both in zzso zzso metabolism and in zzso zzso In the present study, we evaluated zzso the effect of dietary zzso on the expression of genes related to zzso metabolism and insulin sensitivity in the skeletal muscle of obese, diabetic zzso zzso After 8 weeks of zzso expression of zzso genes was decreased in zzso while expression of zzso genes was markedly increased by dietary zzso Additionally, expression of zzso insulin sensitivity, such as zzso zzso 1, was significantly zzso and zzso level of zzso zzso activated zzso known as a zzso factor related zzso metabolism and insulin signaling in skeletal muscle, was markedly increased in zzso zzso We also showed that dietary zzso significantly decreased the level of tumor necrosis zzso zzso associated with the development of insulin resistance, in the skeletal muscle of zzso zzso We suppose that the attenuated zzso zzso in skeletal muscle may contribute to the zzso of expression of several genes and the zzso of insulin resistance in zzso zzso zzso
