zzso improves insulin sensitivity, which is correlated to zzso fatty acid composition in obese type 2 zzso We aimed at investigating the relationship between zzso and fatty acids in obese insulin resistant zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso trial was performed in 21 zzso and zzso insulin resistant zzso individuals receiving either zzso or zzso zzso sensitivity together with zzso parameters and fatty acids in serum zzso were measured at baseline and at 20 zzso A significant decrease in body weight, zzso percentage body fat, the sum of saturated fatty acids in serum zzso and increase in insulin sensitivity index were observed following the zzso zzso These changes did not differ significantly between the zzso Energy restriction rather than zzso treatment appears to be responsible for the observed zzso The associations previously found in diabetics between insulin sensitivity and zzso fatty acids may not be zzso by zzso
