zzso zzso ultrasound is a generally accepted diagnostic tool for zzso zzso enlargement, although no standard zzso data for the sizes of unaffected zzso and zzso zzso zzso A lot of case reports describe zzso swelling of zzso zzso as symptoms of eating disorders like anorexia zzso or zzso zzso They might be the only visible sign for the zzso With our prospective study we tried to zzso and compare zzso the zzso zzso in eating zzso patients, obese and zzso healthy zzso A total of 70 females between 16 and 40 years of age were included of which 25 were healthy zzso All subjects underwent three-dimensional high resolution zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso volumes were calculated and a multiple zzso analysis was done to investigate the influence of an eating disorder on zzso zzso zzso A significant difference in the size of the zzso zzso was seen between our three study groups of zzso and eating zzso patients and healthy, zzso zzso The zzso zzso volumes were seen in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso volume zzso zzso zzso where the mean value was more than twice as high as in the control group zzso zzso By using body mass index and group characteristic the zzso zzso volume as the dependent variable could be estimated with an r zzso of zzso in multiple zzso zzso Only the zzso zzso were significantly zzso while the zzso zzso show no signs of zzso Eating disorders influence size of zzso zzso still the factors and the zzso leading to this enlargement seem to be different in zzso on the one and different types of eating disorders on the other zzso Standard zzso volumes could be established, comparable to former initial zzso zzso zzso remains unaffected by these zzso We could show that high-resolution ultrasound assessment of zzso zzso volume adds a complementary quantitative zzso of organ affection in eating disorders zzso zzso
