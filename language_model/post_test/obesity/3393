zzso inflammation is known to promote zzso zzso in obesity and type 2 zzso Although the precise origin of the unchecked inflammatory response in obesity is zzso it is known that overproduction of zzso zzso by innate immune cells affects zzso For example, zzso contributes to the inability of cells to respond to insulin and to the increase in levels of zzso Whether this zzso itself is part of a feedback loop that affects the progression of chronic zzso inflammation is zzso In this article, we show that regulatory T cells zzso express the insulin zzso and that high levels of insulin impair the ability of zzso to suppress inflammatory responses via effects on the zzso signaling zzso zzso activated zzso signaling in zzso leading to zzso of both zzso production and the ability of zzso to suppress the production of zzso by zzso in a zzso zzso The effect of insulin on zzso suppression was limited to zzso production and it did not alter the expression of other proteins associated with zzso function, including zzso zzso and zzso In a model of zzso zzso zzso from the visceral zzso tissue of zzso obese mice showed a similar specific decrease in zzso production, as well as a parallel increase in production of zzso These data suggest that zzso may contribute to the development of zzso inflammation via a previously unknown effect of insulin on the zzso function of zzso
