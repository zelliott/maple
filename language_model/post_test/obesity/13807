This report: 1) examines the importance of long-term follow-up zzso zzso in zzso mortality associations in eight zzso zzso from the Chicago Heart Association zzso Project in zzso and 2) addresses the impact of previously identified zzso problems in studies on zzso associations, which include no adjustment for cigarette smoking, adjustment for zzso effects of zzso and no exclusion of early zzso 

zzso were adjusted for age and ethnicity only, then for zzso and for zzso blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and diabetes, for three periods of zzso 0 to 15, 6 to 15, and 16 to 25 zzso 

In zzso follow-up with exclusion of deaths for 0 to 15 years, there was a positive association in all zzso with seven zzso both with and without adjustment for smoking or zzso risk zzso In contrast, with adjustment for zzso risk factors and no exclusion of early deaths in zzso zzso zzso there were two zzso positive, three zzso zzso one significant positive, and one significant zzso zzso 

Failure to address potential zzso problems can substantially alter associations in zzso studies and may contribute to observed differences among zzso The long-term outlook with overweight or obesity is adverse and deserves concerted efforts in prevention and zzso
