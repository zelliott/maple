zzso assessment of tissue metabolism in zzso is important to understand the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso are potential candidates to be used for this zzso The aim of this study was to compare the zzso and metabolism of zzso zzso in obese zzso and lean zzso zzso rat zzso with zzso and the measurement of zzso and zzso with or without insulin zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso 10) and lean zzso zzso zzso zzso rats underwent a zzso study after zzso either with or without insulin zzso zzso zzso were inserted in the jugular zzso zzso muscle and zzso After 110 zzso tissue zzso and zzso zzso of zzso were studied in blood, liver, skeletal muscle, subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue and zzso 

When measured with zzso zzso zzso disappeared from the blood pool and zzso space of skeletal muscle and liver more effectively in lean rather than in obese zzso zzso skeletal muscle and zzso zzso was impaired in obese zzso rats compared with lean zzso zzso zzso zzso was six to zzso higher than in other measured zzso but was attenuated in obese zzso In liver and in zzso fat, zzso zzso zzso in lean rats compared with obese zzso 

zzso zzso analogue zzso combined with zzso and tissue analysis, is a feasible method in studying zzso metabolism at the cellular level in animal zzso
