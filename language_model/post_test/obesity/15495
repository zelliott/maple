zzso is a zzso zzso from zzso tissue at a rate commensurate with the size of the body's fat zzso In addition to its zzso and zzso central actions, zzso is known to act on peripheral zzso including the pancreatic zzso where it zzso insulin zzso and reduces insulin transcript zzso However, the role of zzso zzso through its full-length zzso zzso in the zzso remains zzso In the present study, we show that zzso activates a signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso mechanism in pancreatic zzso and in a rat model of the pancreatic zzso zzso zzso induced DNA binding to a zzso consensus zzso and resulted in zzso zzso from zzso reporter zzso in a manner consistent with zzso zzso Western zzso analysis confirmed zzso of zzso in zzso and isolated rat zzso zzso that mimic increased zzso activity resulted in zzso of zzso zzso DNA binding but had no significant effect on zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, zzso activated the zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The present study provides a framework for zzso zzso mechanisms in the programming of the zzso by zzso and suggests that increased zzso activity may zzso this zzso
