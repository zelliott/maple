To establish the relationship between zzso and zzso 

A group of 19 obese patients zzso mass index, zzso zzso was compared with a control group of 45 zzso individuals zzso zzso 20 zzso Both groups underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and measurement of the zzso zzso muscle by zzso 

zzso patients had higher zzso values and enlarged zzso zzso muscle diameter zzso zzso Indeed, bilateral zzso was observed in zzso of obese zzso However, this did not cause any zzso zzso In some cases the difference in zzso pressure was enlarged but together with the zzso not statistically zzso 

Standard values for zzso and zzso zzso may have to be adapted for obese zzso In several cases the eye signs had a remarkable resemblance to patients with zzso zzso So in each patient with bilateral zzso and eye signs suspicious of zzso zzso obesity should be considered as a possible zzso
