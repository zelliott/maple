We studied the effects of genetic background on the zzso of zzso mice, a model of severe zzso insulin resistance, and diabetes caused by zzso zzso Despite a comparable degree of obesity and zzso zzso zzso mice had much milder zzso and, surprisingly, normal circulating zzso levels despite zzso signs of insulin zzso zzso clamp revealed relatively less zzso and muscle insulin resistance in zzso zzso mice, whereas liver insulin resistance tended to be more severe than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice had also more rapid clearance of circulating zzso and more severe zzso zzso We suggest that zzso distinction in zzso handling is the most important player in the differences in diabetic zzso and insulin sensitivity, whereas the impact of circulating zzso levels on the overall zzso of zzso mice is less zzso
