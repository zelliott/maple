zzso zzso information about the risk for zzso zzso sleep zzso zzso in the acute stroke period is challenging as many stroke patients have deficits that hinder zzso We examined agreement between stroke patients without communication limitations and family members zzso in the zzso risk for zzso 

zzso pairs zzso were interviewed independently as part of the Brain zzso Surveillance in Corpus Christi zzso Project from May 2010 to April zzso The Berlin questionnaire was used to measure a high risk for zzso defined as the presence of at least two of the following conditions: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso daytime zzso and zzso hypertension or zzso zzso agreement was assessed using a zzso zzso 

zzso percent of patients zzso as being at high risk for sleep zzso and zzso of proxies identified patients as high zzso zzso agreement for high risk for zzso zzso was fair zzso with better agreement for spouses and children proxies zzso than for other family zzso zzso also was fair for most individual zzso 

zzso and child proxy use of the Berlin questionnaire may be an option to assess a patient's zzso likelihood of sleep zzso Whereas prospective studies of incident stroke in patients with and without zzso confirmed sleep zzso would require formidable resources, our results suggest that an alternative strategy may involve proxy use of the Berlin questionnaire in a retrospective study zzso
