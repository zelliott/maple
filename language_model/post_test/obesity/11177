zzso and zzso syndrome are associated with systemic inflammation and increased zzso zzso zzso improves zzso and inflammatory zzso in zzso zzso Using in zzso and in zzso models, we examined the effect of zzso on maternal and fetal zzso 

Female zzso rats zzso weeks old) were fed a normal diet zzso or a zzso diet zzso for 5-6 weeks to induce zzso zzso After mating with zzso male rats, one-half of the zzso female rats received zzso zzso zzso by mouth zzso All zzso continued their respective diets until zzso day 19, at which time maternal and fetal outcomes were zzso zzso and fetal plasma and zzso were analyzed for zzso and inflammatory zzso zzso human zzso zzso cells were zzso with vehicle or zzso (10 zzso zzso before tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso 50 zzso and zzso were zzso for zzso zzso 

zzso rats gained more zzso weight than zzso rats zzso zzso zzso had higher levels of plasma insulin and zzso and exhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso that were exposed to the zzso diet had elevated plasma zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 levels zzso zzso and enhanced zzso zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso did not impact maternal markers but significantly decreased zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 in the fetal zzso Finally, zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso and zzso levels in cultured zzso zzso zzso 

Diet zzso syndrome during pregnancy significantly enhanced fetal and zzso zzso zzso maternal zzso reduced fetal zzso zzso Similarly, zzso treatment of a zzso cell line suppressed zzso zzso levels by zzso zzso
