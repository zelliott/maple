To evaluate the precision of the zzso for total body composition and fat distribution zzso in severely obese zzso 

zzso severely obese participants with a mean age of 46 zzso 11 years, zzso of 49 zzso 6 zzso , and a mean body mass of zzso zzso zzso zzso took part in this zzso Two consecutive zzso scans with repositioning of the total body were conducted for each zzso The zzso of variation zzso the zzso zzso averages of standard zzso of repeated zzso the corresponding zzso least significant change, and zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

Precision expressed as % zzso for total body bone mineral content, fat free mass, total body fat, total body lean, and % total body fat were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Precision was zzso for zzso fat distribution and zzso for zzso fat zzso zzso The zzso in all zzso zzso were zzso with % zzso having the lowest at zzso 

The GE zzso zzso demonstrated excellent precision for total body composition assessments and is the first study to assess zzso in severely obese zzso
