Type 2 diabetes, obesity and insulin resistance are characterized by zzso and zzso zzso of lipids in liver and skeletal zzso zzso encodes a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso the first step in the de zzso zzso zzso zzso mice show lower weight and resistance to zzso and genetically induced zzso Here, we examined whether common or zzso zzso in zzso associate with type 2 diabetes or related zzso traits in a Danish zzso 

Eleven zzso selected by a candidate gene approach capturing the common and zzso variation of zzso were zzso in zzso zzso from four study populations of middle-aged zzso The zzso study involved zzso type 2 diabetic and 5,934 zzso individuals, while studies of quantitative zzso traits were performed in zzso zzso participants of the zzso zzso 

None of the zzso zzso zzso were robustly associated with type 2 diabetes in the Danish zzso zzso Moreover, none of the zzso zzso showed association with measures of obesity zzso circumference and zzso serum zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso load levels of plasma zzso and serum insulin, or estimated zzso of insulin zzso or insulin zzso 

Common and zzso zzso in zzso do not significantly associate with type 2 diabetes zzso or influence related zzso traits such as zzso zzso or zzso of insulin sensitivity or insulin zzso in the population zzso
