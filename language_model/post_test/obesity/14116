To explore whether an imbalance between the visceral and subcutaneous fat zzso and a corresponding zzso of the zzso milieu is associated with excessive zzso of fat in the liver and muscle and ultimately with insulin resistance and the zzso zzso 

We zzso our zzso cohort of 118 obese adolescents into zzso based on the proportion of abdominal fat in the visceral zzso zzso and liver fat were measured by magnetic resonance imaging and muscle zzso zzso zzso by zzso magnetic resonance zzso 

There were no differences in age, zzso Z score, or zzso mass across zzso However, as the proportion of visceral fat increased across zzso zzso and percentage of fat and subcutaneous fat zzso while zzso fat zzso In addition, there was an increase in zzso zzso insulin, zzso zzso levels, and insulin zzso zzso both zzso and total zzso were significantly lower in zzso 3 than 1, while zzso protein and zzso were not different across zzso There was a significant increase in the odds ratio for the zzso syndrome, with subjects in zzso 3 zzso times more likely to have the zzso syndrome than those in zzso zzso 

zzso adolescents with a high proportion of visceral fat and relatively low abdominal subcutaneous fat have a zzso reminiscent of partial zzso These adolescents are not necessarily the most severely obese, yet they suffer from severe zzso complications and are at a high risk of having the zzso zzso
