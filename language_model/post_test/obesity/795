Weight loss zzso reduces bone mass and increases fracture zzso zzso regulating calcium metabolism during zzso are zzso 

The objective was to assess the effect of 6 zzso of zzso at 2 different amounts of calcium intake zzso zzso 1 zzso high zzso zzso zzso on true fractional calcium zzso zzso bone zzso and zzso hormones in overweight zzso zzso 

zzso women zzso mass index, zzso zzso zzso zzso were recruited either to consume a moderately zzso diet zzso zzso or to maintain their body weight zzso zzso zzso and were randomly assigned to either the zzso or the zzso group in a zzso zzso zzso underwent weekly diet counseling, and zzso were taken at baseline and after 6 zzso 

zzso women completed the study and had a baseline zzso of zzso zzso zzso Energy restriction significantly decreased the total calcium absorbed zzso zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso compared with the zzso group zzso zzso 25; analysis of zzso zzso analysis showed that a greater rate of weight loss suppressed zzso and the total calcium absorbed zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The women in the zzso zzso group absorbed inadequate amounts of calcium zzso zzso 49 zzso whereas the women in the zzso zzso group absorbed adequate amounts zzso zzso 118 zzso zzso hormone explained zzso of the zzso in calcium absorbed in the zzso group zzso 

We suggest that zzso is associated with elevated calcium requirements that, if not met, could activate the zzso hormone axis to absorb more zzso zzso zzso of calcium during energy restriction result in inadequate total calcium zzso and could ultimately compromise calcium balance and bone zzso
