To measure the zzso and zzso volume with three-dimensional zzso in patients diagnosed of zzso zzso syndrome with zzso zzso treatment, and to zzso the differences between the patients treated with zzso zzso versus zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso patients were zzso Twenty zzso cycles were obtained with zzso zzso and 17 with zzso zzso plus zzso zzso in case of obesity or zzso zzso volumes and vascular indexes were studied with zzso and results were zzso by zzso 

There were no statistical differences of zzso volume by treatment along the cycles, although bigger volume were found in zzso cycles compared to zzso ones zzso versus zzso zzso p zzso zzso No statistical differences were also found concerning vascular indexes, neither by treatment nor by the zzso of zzso in the zzso 

zzso volume and vascular indexes measured with three-dimensional zzso in patients diagnosed of zzso zzso syndrome do not show zzso values in patients treated with zzso zzso alone versus zzso zzso plus zzso
