The purpose of this study was to determine whether there are differences in zzso contraction blood volume and zzso responses among groups of type 2 diabetes zzso zzso obese, and lean individuals zzso using zzso Eight zzso patients were individually matched by age, sex, and race to zzso individuals with similar body mass index zzso and lean zzso zzso zzso was performed using a zzso zzso zzso imaging sequence with a repetition time of 1 s and at two echo times zzso zzso 6 and 46 zzso Data were acquired before, zzso and after zzso zzso zzso zzso performed at 50 and zzso of zzso voluntary contraction zzso zzso zzso signal intensity zzso changes from the zzso anterior and zzso zzso zzso muscles were plotted as functions of time for each zzso From each time course, the difference between the minimum and the maximum zzso zzso zzso were determined for TE zzso 6 zzso zzso and TE zzso 46 zzso zzso reflecting variations in blood volume and zzso zzso zzso Following 50% zzso zzso the mean zzso zzso values were similar in the three zzso Following zzso only, and in the zzso muscle only, zzso and obese participants had zzso lower zzso than the lean zzso Also following zzso only, the zzso response in the zzso was lower in zzso subjects than in lean zzso These data suggest that skeletal muscle small vessel impairment occurs in zzso and body mass zzso subjects, in zzso and contraction zzso zzso
