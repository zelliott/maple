The study evaluated the accuracy of body mass index zzso in detecting zzso during oral zzso tolerance testing zzso in severely obese zzso 

A zzso study was carried zzso 

A total of 118 obese children and adolescents zzso females and 69 zzso aged zzso years were zzso studied at an zzso zzso zzso zzso was defined as a value of zzso zzso zzso 80th zzso and zzso zzso as a value of the zzso area under the curve zzso of zzso 80th zzso The study hypothesis was tested using a zzso zzso model with zzso as the outcome variable and the zzso of zzso corrected for age zzso as the predictor zzso zzso characteristic zzso zzso were used to evaluate zzso 

The mean zzso zzso for age of the children was zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso standard zzso zzso The odds ratio zzso of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso for each unit increase of zzso and the corresponding zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In comparison, the OR of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso for each unit increase of zzso and the corresponding zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso is reasonably accurate in detecting zzso zzso in severely obese zzso
