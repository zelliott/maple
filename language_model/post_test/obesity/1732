For decades, research efforts have tried to uncover the underlying genetic basis of human zzso to a variety of zzso zzso studies have resulted in highly zzso findings and helped identify quantitative trait zzso zzso for many complex zzso however identification of specific zzso accounting for linkage remains zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether with a sufficient number of zzso a linkage signal can be fully zzso 

We used comprehensive zzso using a dense set of single zzso zzso zzso across the entire quantitative trait locus zzso on human zzso zzso linked to plasma zzso zzso zzso included measured zzso and combined linkage association zzso 

zzso this linkage region, we found an over representation of zzso significant associations in five genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, no single genetic zzso was sufficient to account for the zzso On the other hand, multiple zzso capturing the variation in these five genes did account for the linkage at this zzso zzso analyses suggested that this reduction in zzso score was unlikely to have occurred by chance zzso zzso zzso 

With recent findings, it has become clear that most complex traits are influenced by a large number of genetic zzso each contributing only a small percentage to the overall zzso We found that with a sufficient number of zzso the linkage can be fully zzso The results from this analysis suggest that perhaps the failure to identify zzso zzso for linkage zzso may be due to multiple zzso under the linkage peak with small individual effect, rather than a single zzso of large zzso
