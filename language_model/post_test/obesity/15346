For a given body mass index zzso mortality is higher in patients with central compared to generalized zzso zzso play an important role in determining body fat distribution, but circulating cortisol zzso are reported to be normal in obese zzso Our recent studies show enhanced conversion of inactive zzso zzso to active cortisol zzso through the expression of zzso zzso type 1 zzso in cultured zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso production of F may be a crucial factor in the zzso of central zzso We have now analyzed F metabolism in subjects with zzso between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B), and more than 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso 12 in each zzso six males and six zzso zzso aged zzso zzso zzso were measured using a zzso oral zzso tolerance test, and each subject had total body and regional fat zzso zzso hip, and zzso zzso using dual energy zzso zzso zzso total F zzso zzso by gas zzso zzso were increased in subjects with obesity zzso A, zzso zzso zzso zzso h zzso zzso zzso group C, zzso zzso zzso although not significantly so zzso zzso zzso There was a significant reduction in the urinary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso ratio in obesity zzso A zzso C, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both P zzso zzso free F zzso zzso was similar in all three groups, as was the zzso free E zzso zzso The zzso h circulating zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso suppression values were similar in all three groups, but a reduction in the generation of serum F from zzso values after oral zzso zzso zzso zzso was evident in both obese groups zzso 546 zzso 37 zzso in group A zzso 412 zzso 40 in group B zzso zzso and 388 zzso 38 in group C zzso zzso 180 zzso zzso zzso resistance was present in groups B and C, but zzso analysis revealed no relationship between F zzso or the zzso zzso zzso ratio and insulin action zzso model assessment analysis and insulin values in the oral zzso tolerance zzso There was, however, a highly significant relationship between the zzso zzso zzso ratio and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and total body fat zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated an inverse relationship between zzso and zzso and waist fat zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and a direct relationship with hip and thigh fat zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in both zzso The fall in the zzso + zzso ratio but unchanged zzso ratio together with impaired F zzso after oral E indicates zzso of zzso in subjects with zzso This results in an increased zzso for zzso explaining the increased F zzso rate in obesity in the face of normal circulating F zzso zzso activity is highly related to body fat distribution, with zzso or central zzso but not zzso zzso associated with reduced activity in both zzso This reduction in zzso activity raises new questions as to the primary role of zzso in the zzso of insulin resistance and central zzso
