Growth hormone zzso affects body composition by a relatively reduced fat mass and increased fat free zzso The intake of protein as well as the specific zzso acids zzso and zzso zzso stimulate zzso zzso This study investigated associations between zzso of zzso zzso zzso and subsequent zzso change in body composition among zzso zzso 

Data of 364 children were collected from zzso Denmark, during zzso and zzso later as part of the European Youth Heart zzso Body mass index among children was subdivided by fat free mass index zzso and fat mass index zzso based on zzso zzso zzso intake was estimated via zzso zzso zzso between zzso of protein as well as zzso zzso and change in zzso and zzso were zzso by multiple linear zzso adjusted for social economic status, zzso stage and physical activity zzso 

Among lean girls inverse associations were found between protein as well as zzso and zzso intake and change in fat mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso among girls with a body mass index in the 5th zzso protein intake was associated with zzso zzso and more specific when zzso intake was high, zzso intake was associated with zzso zzso 

Among girls high protein zzso may decrease body fat gain and increase fat free mass gain, depending on the available amounts and combinations of zzso and zzso
