The zzso transition is characterized by increased body fat zzso including zzso from peripheral to central fat zzso This distribution is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease that are linked to zzso zzso We determined whether zzso women have higher levels of inflammatory zzso compared with zzso zzso We also wanted to determine whether these markers are reduced by stable weight loss in obese zzso 

zzso data, blood samples and subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso were collected from normal weight zzso and zzso women and obese women before and 2 years after gastric bypass zzso zzso zzso protein levels and zzso tissue gene expression of inflammatory markers were zzso 

zzso expression in zzso tissue and circulating levels were higher in zzso vs zzso zzso zzso expression was associated with waist zzso independent of zzso zzso zzso expression and serum levels of zzso zzso protein zzso were higher in zzso vs zzso zzso Two years after zzso surgery, zzso expression of zzso zzso necrosis zzso and zzso decreased zzso zzso insulin levels were associated with zzso gene expression before zzso surgery, but these associations disappeared after zzso 

zzso women have an increased inflammatory response in the subcutaneous fat and zzso zzso markers in zzso tissue decreased significantly after zzso weight zzso This effect may be beneficial for zzso control and reduced cardiovascular risk after weight zzso
