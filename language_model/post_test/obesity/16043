zzso status and zzso fuels are factors involved in the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso responses to zzso The effects of feeding on zzso zzso release were studied in 13 normal women, 14 obese women, and 9 women with anorexia zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was administered at zzso h after an overnight fast or at zzso h after a normal meal at zzso zzso and at the same times 45 zzso after a zzso meal on different zzso The mean peak plasma zzso responses to zzso administered before a meal at zzso h were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in normal women, zzso zzso zzso zzso in obese women, and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso When zzso was administered before a meal at zzso zzso the mean peak plasma zzso levels were lower than those at zzso zzso this reduction was zzso in normal women, zzso in obese women, and zzso in women with anorexia zzso After zzso the plasma zzso responses to zzso were blunted in normal women at zzso h zzso and zzso h zzso compared with the zzso peak zzso In obese women the plasma zzso response to zzso after feeding was increased compared with that when these women had zzso zzso at zzso h and zzso at zzso zzso Finally, differential effects of feeding were present in zzso zzso the response was lower at zzso h zzso and greater at zzso h zzso We conclude that there is an zzso variation in zzso zzso zzso and that the responses differ according to nutritional status and body zzso
