zzso energy needs in critical illness can be difficult because of uncertainties about the influence of multiple factors on energy zzso zzso these components is important to avoid limiting optimal outcome by zzso and to avoid complications of zzso zzso strategies often use a patient's weight to estimate zzso For overweight patients, there is controversy as to whether actual or modified weight should be used in zzso This study was designed to evaluate a proposed technique to improve the accuracy of predicting energy needs in critically ill, overweight zzso zzso energy needs were predicted zzso zzso equation zzso and zzso per zzso zzso zzso by using both actual weight and an adjusted weight developed to attempt to more accurately reflect lean zzso zzso were compared with measured energy expenditure determined by indirect zzso zzso indicated that use of actual weights in predictions for overweight subjects may lead to zzso Use of adjusted weights led to more accurate energy predictions with the zzso than with the zzso zzso zzso strategies could zzso zzso of the zzso of resting energy expenditure in subjects zzso of ideal body zzso zzso of this study suggest that using adjusted weights with the zzso prediction strategy may be preferable for this population, particularly for zzso or zzso zzso of ideal body zzso This study also indicated that multiple diagnoses may not lead to increased energy zzso
