zzso fat is a relatively neglected component of the zzso The purpose of this review was to examine the zzso and zzso data on zzso zzso to examine the relationship of zzso fat to obesity and to explore the potential role of zzso fat in the relationship of obesity to coronary zzso zzso zzso fat covers zzso of the heart's surface and constitutes zzso of total heart zzso It is present along the distribution of the coronary zzso over the right zzso especially along the right border, anterior surface and at the zzso There is three- to fourfold more zzso fat associated with the right than the left zzso zzso zzso functions of zzso fat are based on zzso data and include: zzso coronary arteries against the zzso induced by the zzso pulse wave and cardiac contraction, zzso coronary artery zzso regulating fatty acid zzso in the coronary zzso and providing fatty acids to cardiac muscle as a local energy source in times of high zzso A considerable amount of the data on zzso fat originates from autopsy series that have the inherent problem that conditions leading to death may have altered body composition and zzso With this zzso data indicate that zzso fat mass increases age until age zzso years but thereafter the amount of zzso fat is not dependent on zzso The amount of zzso fat zzso with heart weight but the presence of zzso zzso and zzso does not alter the ratio of zzso fat to cardiac muscle zzso A number of properties differentiate zzso fat from other fat zzso specifically its smaller zzso size; different fatty acid zzso high protein zzso high rates of fatty acid zzso fatty acid zzso zzso zzso or fatty acid zzso low rates of zzso zzso low expression zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and slow zzso during weight zzso There is a significant direct relationship between the amount of zzso fat and general body zzso Clinical imaging studies have demonstrated a strong direct correlation between zzso fat and abdominal visceral zzso Several lines of evidence support a role for zzso fat in the zzso of coronary artery disease, namely the close zzso relationship between zzso fat and coronary zzso the positive correlation between the amount of zzso fat and the presence of coronary zzso and the ability of zzso tissue to zzso hormones and zzso that zzso coronary artery zzso Thus, zzso fat maybe an important factor responsible for cardiovascular disease in zzso
