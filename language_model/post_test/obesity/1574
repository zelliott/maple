zzso levels and muscle expression of the zzso zzso increase markedly in response to exercise in zzso Because several studies have established zzso factors as important contributors of zzso effects of exercise, this study aimed at investigating the effect of increased expression of zzso zzso on systemic and intramuscular zzso zzso with focus on fatty acid zzso and zzso metabolism in skeletal zzso By zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso muscle in mice, significant zzso in muscle and serum zzso within a zzso range were zzso At 3 zzso of high-fat zzso visceral and subcutaneous fat mass were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso lower, respectively, in zzso mice compared with control zzso Also, zzso zzso mice had zzso zzso zzso lower visceral fat mass and zzso zzso zzso lower subcutaneous fat mass compared with zzso control zzso These reductions in zzso of zzso tissue were accompanied by improved zzso tolerance and insulin zzso Furthermore, in zzso muscles, muscular ex zzso fatty acid zzso was significantly enhanced compared with control muscles zzso zzso zzso P zzso high-fat zzso zzso P zzso and also showed increased expression levels of major fatty acid zzso genes zzso zzso I, and zzso Finally, zzso expression was associated with increased muscle zzso expression of zzso and zzso suggesting a role for zzso in muscle zzso In conclusion, our data show that zzso of zzso within a zzso range zzso zzso zzso likely zzso through a zzso improvement of fatty acid zzso and zzso capacity in skeletal muscle zzso
