zzso visceral zzso in early pregnancy has been associated with impaired zzso tolerance in later zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso abdominal obesity in combination with zzso is a clinical marker of visceral zzso Our study aimed to assess the association between the zzso zzso in early pregnancy and zzso intolerance in later zzso 

Plasma zzso and waist zzso were measured at zzso weeks of gestation among 144 white pregnant zzso zzso was measured following a zzso oral zzso tolerance test performed at zzso weeks of zzso 

A waist zzso greater than 85 zzso in combination with a zzso level zzso zzso zzso in the first zzso was associated with an increased risk of two-hour zzso zzso zzso zzso following the zzso oral zzso tolerance test zzso ratio zzso zzso p zzso zzso This risk remained significant even after we controlled for maternal age, zzso zzso at first zzso and previous history of zzso diabetes zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso of waist zzso in combination with measurement of zzso zzso in the first zzso of pregnancy could improve early screening for zzso zzso zzso
