A widely used zzso simulator is generally accepted to give valid predictions of zzso status during disturbances in breathing associated with zzso We compared predicted measures with zzso zzso available in the literature, or derived from other zzso 

Five studies were selected from the literature which explored zzso zzso with or without zzso in clinical situations or through mathematical modeling as well as the evolution of the fraction of expired oxygen zzso during zzso zzso zzso from these studies were simulated on the zzso Patient zzso simulator, and the data were compared with the results in the zzso 

zzso zzso without zzso zzso an zzso pulse zzso zzso decrease that is not observed on the zzso zzso In humans, after 8 minutes of zzso zzso decreased below zzso while the worst value was zzso during the zzso The zzso time to reach zzso was less with obese patients than with healthy simulated patients and was shortened in the absence of zzso However, the data in the literature include zzso simulator confidence zzso zzso values only for healthy humans receiving zzso The decrease in zzso during zzso zzso started at zzso was slower on the zzso simulator than the values reported in the zzso zzso evolution during zzso maneuvers on the zzso simulator with various inspired oxygen zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was very close to those reported in humans when perfect mask seal is zzso In practice, this seal is impossible to obtain on the zzso zzso 

zzso decreased much later during zzso on the zzso simulator than in a clinical situation, whether zzso was performed or zzso The zzso after simulation of critical situations or the use of the zzso simulator to test a new equipment must consider these zzso
