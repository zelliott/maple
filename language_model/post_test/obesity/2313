There are contrasting results in studies of cardiovascular risk in patients with zzso 1 chronic zzso C zzso zzso We evaluated the prevalence of carotid zzso compared with a control population in order to assess the potential association between zzso host and viral factors, and liver zzso zzso In all, 174 consecutive zzso zzso zzso patients were evaluated by zzso and zzso zzso and 174 patients attending an zzso zzso unit were used as zzso zzso thickness zzso and carotid zzso defined as focal zzso zzso zzso at the level of common zzso were evaluated using zzso All zzso zzso zzso were scored by one pathologist for staging and zzso and graded for zzso zzso plaques were found in 73 zzso zzso zzso patients compared with 40 zzso control patients zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso patients had a greater zzso compared with control patients zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that older age zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and severe zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso were independently linked to the presence of carotid zzso In patients zzso years, zzso cases with zzso zzso zzso had carotid zzso compared with zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By contrast, in zzso years the prevalence of carotid plaques was similar in those with or without severe zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Severe zzso zzso is associated with a high risk of early carotid zzso in zzso zzso zzso
