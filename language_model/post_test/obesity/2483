zzso zzso analyses of zzso crest zzso were performed after zzso double labeling in 24 patients with zzso obesity and in 30 zzso and zzso zzso The amount and structure of bone were determined from zzso of total biopsy zzso fractional length of zzso space, fractional zzso bone volume, zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and dynamic variables of bone zzso and formation were determined, and the balance of the zzso level was estimated from final zzso depth and mean wall thickness of zzso structural zzso In the obese patients the total biopsy length was increased, with a normal proportion of zzso space to total biopsy zzso The mean fractional zzso bone volume was reduced due to an increased distance between zzso of normal mean zzso The total biopsy length in the obese patients was found to be positively related to the zzso distance and zzso related to the fractional zzso bone zzso The remaining zzso variables describing bone formation rate at zzso zzso and cellular levels, the amount of bone formed, the zzso process, zzso lag time, bone zzso and the balance between zzso and formation were all normal in the obese zzso
