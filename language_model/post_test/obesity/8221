zzso is a zzso trait caused by complex interactions between genes and environment, including zzso zzso interactions are difficult to study in humans because the human diet is hard to zzso Here, we used mice to study dietary obesity zzso by four zzso First, we bred zzso zzso mice from strains that are susceptible zzso zzso or resistant zzso zzso to dietary zzso zzso body fat was assessed after mice ate low-energy diet and again after the same mice ate zzso diet for 8 zzso zzso analyses identified zzso associated with dietary zzso Three methods were used to filter candidate genes within the zzso zzso zzso association mapping was conducted zzso zzso zzso differential gene expression and zzso comparison of zzso DNA zzso using two strains closely related to the zzso strains from zzso zzso The zzso effects depended on whether the mice were male or female or which diet they were recently zzso After feeding a low-energy diet, percent body fat was linked to zzso 7 zzso After feeding a zzso diet, percent body fat was linked to zzso 9 zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso and zzso 17 zzso The zzso 7 and 12 zzso were sex dependent and all zzso were zzso The combination of filtering methods highlighted seven candidate genes within the zzso locus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, these filtering methods have limitations so gene identification will require alternative strategies, such as the construction of zzso with very small donor zzso
