zzso interacting protein zzso has recently been described as a key regulator of energy metabolism through zzso actions that include zzso sensing in the zzso zzso zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso specific zzso zzso and the circuits downstream from zzso zzso engaged to regulate energy zzso remain zzso To evaluate the zzso role of zzso activity specifically within zzso zzso zzso we generated zzso zzso zzso and zzso mouse models using zzso mice, zzso zzso mice, and a zzso expressing the human zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso predisposed to zzso obesity and zzso tissue storage by decreasing energy expenditure and spontaneous zzso without affecting food zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso deletion protected against zzso obesity and zzso tissue storage by increasing energy expenditure and spontaneous zzso also without affecting food zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso did not primarily affect zzso control, whereas deletion of zzso in zzso zzso improved zzso zzso levels and zzso tolerance independently of its effects on body weight and zzso zzso manipulation of zzso expression induced zzso changes in central zzso sensitivity and the neural regulation of zzso Together, these results identify a critical role for zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso obesity through the regulation of energy expenditure and zzso tissue zzso independently of food zzso They also reveal a previously unidentified role for zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
