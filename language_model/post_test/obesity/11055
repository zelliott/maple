zzso women demonstrate a distinctive zzso body fat distribution and circulating zzso status is associated with the maintenance of this zzso zzso zzso role in zzso of regional zzso may occur through zzso receptors zzso which are present in human zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to determine regional differences in the protein content of zzso zzso and the G zzso zzso zzso zzso between the abdominal zzso and zzso zzso subcutaneous zzso tissue of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of the subcutaneous AB and zzso zzso tissue were performed in 15 zzso women (7 zzso African American, zzso zzso zzso years, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue protein content was measured by western zzso analysis and correlation analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between zzso protein content and zzso zzso composition zzso 

We found that zzso protein was higher in AB than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso arbitrary units zzso zzso zzso protein was higher in zzso than AB zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio was higher in AB than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein content was similar in AB and zzso zzso subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso ratio was zzso related to zzso zzso zzso zzso and positively related to zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso 

These results indicate that depot specific zzso content may be an important underlying zzso of regional effects of zzso in upper and lower body zzso tissue of zzso zzso zzso
