The effect of obesity on surgical outcome is becoming an increasingly relevant issue given the growing rate of obesity zzso 

To investigate the specific impact of obesity on zzso 

A retrospective comparative study of a zzso maintained database was carried out to investigate the specific impact of obesity on the technical aspects and zzso outcome of zzso 

Between 1999 and 2006, 92 consecutive patients underwent zzso using a standardized zzso The study population was subdivided according to the presence or absence of zzso 

zzso zzso patients were obese and 73 zzso patients were zzso The two groups were comparable in terms of zzso American Society of Anesthesiology zzso score as well as nature and type of zzso zzso The rate of clinically relevant pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and hospital stay zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly increased in obese zzso non-obese patients, zzso zzso zzso was responsible for one-half of the deaths zzso and two zzso zzso The zzso of the other zzso and general zzso complications were not significantly different between the two zzso zzso fat was increased in 10 obese patients zzso and correlated positively both with zzso zzso and with the occurrence of pancreatic zzso zzso 

zzso patients are at increased risk for developing pancreatic zzso after zzso Special surgical caution as well as vigilant zzso monitoring are therefore recommended in obese zzso
