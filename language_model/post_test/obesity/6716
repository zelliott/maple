zzso zzso are small, zzso zzso sequences that zzso regulate gene expression at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been associated with zzso disorders such as obesity and diabetes, which are also associated with zzso zzso syndrome zzso 

We aimed to evaluate the effects of sex, sex hormones, and zzso and their interactions with obesity on the expression in the circulation of these zzso 

This was a zzso zzso 

The setting was an academic zzso 

We included 12 control women, 12 patients with zzso and 12 men selected as to have similar body mass index zzso and zzso Six subjects per group had normal weight zzso zzso zzso and six subjects per group were obese zzso zzso 30 zzso 

Blood samples were collected early in the morning after a 12-hour zzso 

We measured whole blood expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso significantly reduced the expression of zzso zzso and zzso However, there was a significant interaction between obesity and the group of subjects in the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso consisting of obesity reducing the expression of these zzso in control woman and men, but tending to increase their expression in women with zzso These differences paralleled those observed in serum T zzso 

The present results suggest that zzso that play an important role in zzso and immune system processes are influenced by obesity and circulating zzso zzso
