To examine the changes in the zzso function in zzso obese rats and investigate the oral efficacy of zzso a new zzso type 5 zzso zzso on penile zzso in obese zzso 

The rats were fed a zzso diet for 12 weeks and divided into three groups: an zzso zzso control group, an zzso zzso control group, and an zzso treatment zzso zzso The zzso zzso responses were measured in all zzso The body weight, plasma cholesterol, zzso and zzso levels were also zzso 

In the zzso control group, the maximum zzso pressure zzso and zzso pressure zzso ratio after electric stimulation were significantly lower than those in OR control zzso The corresponding area under the curve zzso of the zzso ratio, the zzso time and the baseline cavernous pressure were also lower than those in the OR control group, but this difference was not zzso The body weight gain, plasma cholesterol and zzso level in the zzso group were significantly higher than those in the OR zzso After administering the zzso a significant increase in the maximum zzso and the zzso ratio were zzso The corresponding zzso in the zzso group were also higher than those in the two control zzso Furthermore, the zzso time was significantly prolonged after treatment with zzso 

These results demonstrate that zzso obesity affects the zzso function in rats and these zzso dysfunction zzso can be improved by the treatment with zzso indicating zzso might be a treatment option for zzso associated with zzso
