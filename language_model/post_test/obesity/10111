Absolute weight loss may not always be the best measure of adherence and response to therapy in obese adolescents if weight gain zzso to linear growth is not zzso We wished to compare short-term absolute weight and height changes with changes in body mass index zzso in a group of severely obese adolescents to determine the most meaningful measure of treatment zzso 

We analyzed weight, zzso and zzso in 27 zzso zzso years of age, referred for management of severe zzso zzso attended clinic on at least three occasions within a zzso zzso zzso profiles of usual daily food zzso physical activities, and family and environmental zzso were zzso and specific goals to achieve weight control were negotiated with adolescents and their families at each zzso zzso zzso and zzso at the initial visit and at the most recent visit were zzso 

While zzso of our population actually lost weight, zzso either had no change or a decrease in zzso during the observation zzso zzso between initial and most recent heights and zzso were statistically zzso but weight changes were not zzso 

In addition to weight, zzso should be routinely used and reported when monitoring the response to specific interventions in growing zzso zzso of weight alone may underestimate the zzso adherence to treatment zzso
