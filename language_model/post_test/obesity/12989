Previous studies demonstrated elevated plasma zzso and zzso zzso levels in essential zzso However, a few studies investigated the relationship between zzso and zzso levels in both lean and zzso obese zzso The aim of the present study was therefore to examine the relationship between blood pressure, zzso and plasma zzso activity in zzso and in both lean and zzso patients with essential zzso Two groups of subjects who were carefully matched for age, zzso zzso ratio and body mass index zzso were zzso 28 zzso zzso zzso zzso years old, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 33 newly diagnosed mild to moderate essential zzso zzso zzso zzso years old, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No significant differences in age, zzso zzso ratio, zzso blood zzso and zzso were detected between zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso and zzso pressures, mean zzso blood pressures, plasma zzso levels and zzso were significantly higher in zzso group than in zzso group zzso zzso zzso Plasma zzso levels were strongly correlated with zzso in zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso groups zzso P zzso zzso Plasma zzso levels were correlated with plasma zzso levels in both zzso and zzso groups zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso both P zzso zzso There was no correlation between zzso or zzso and zzso zzso pressures, or mean zzso blood zzso Furthermore, the patients were divided as lean zzso and zzso zzso zzso 17) and compared with zzso zzso In both subgroups, plasma zzso and zzso levels were also higher than those of zzso Our results showed that elevated plasma zzso and zzso are associated with hypertension in both lean and zzso zzso Moreover, plasma zzso was significantly correlated with plasma zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso mass is an important zzso of blood pressure, although the mechanism is not zzso
