zzso encodes zzso factor zzso 7, a member of the zzso family of zzso factors, initially shown to play important roles in cellular development and zzso and reported to be specifically involved in zzso Several single zzso zzso zzso have been identified in zzso of which the zzso of zzso has been associated with type 2 diabetes in a Japanese population; however, a possible association of zzso zzso with obesity has not been zzso We aimed to identify variation in the putative promoter region, the coding regions, zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and to examine identified zzso in relation to zzso type 2 diabetes, and related quantitative traits in Danish zzso 

zzso zzso were investigated for association with type 2 diabetes in zzso individuals and with obesity in 14 zzso zzso 

We identified four common zzso in low zzso linkage zzso three in the putative promoter region zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We failed to confirm an association between zzso and type 2 zzso Neither was zzso associated with type 2 zzso however, the minor zzso of zzso protected against obesity zzso zzso zzso and in studies of quantitative traits zzso the zzso associated with decreased body mass index zzso and waist circumference zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were not associated with obesity or type 2 zzso 

We identified a novel association between the minor zzso of zzso zzso and protection against obesity in the Danish zzso
