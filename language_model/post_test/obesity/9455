To study the impact of obesity on zzso morbidity and outcome following surgical zzso of primary zzso zzso zzso 

From a prospective database, we compared zzso findings zzso zzso surgical approach, zzso differentiation and zzso zzso zzso zzso length of zzso zzso survival zzso and overall survival zzso between 56 obese zzso mass index zzso zzso and 86 non-obese zzso zzso patients with zzso 

In this consecutive series, there were 118 male and 24 female patients with a median age of 63 years zzso zzso zzso For all patients, the zzso zzso was zzso with a median survival of 20 zzso No significant differences zzso were found between obese and non-obese patients, with respect to age, zzso surgical approach zzso vs zzso zzso duration of hospital stay, zzso mortality or zzso However, compared with non-obese patients, obese patients had a higher frequency of zzso respiratory complications zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence intervals zzso zzso zzso and zzso at 5 years were increased for patients who were obese at the time of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is not associated with increased zzso complication rates or adverse outcome following zzso zzso and should therefore not be considered a relative zzso to the surgical management of zzso The improved survival of obese patients who underwent zzso zzso for zzso suggests that further investigation of the association between obesity and zzso zzso is now zzso
