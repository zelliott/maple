Previous studies have indicated a relationship between zzso and zzso transcript zzso and zzso The present study used quantitative zzso and in zzso zzso to examine this zzso relationship in different animal zzso With zzso injection, the function of this zzso was also zzso The results demonstrate that zzso zzso in the zzso nucleus zzso was significantly increased in subjects fed a high-fat diet zzso compared to low-fat diet zzso It was also elevated in obese zzso lean rats and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In each group tested, zzso zzso in the ARC was positively correlated specifically with circulating levels of zzso Its close association specifically with zzso was further supported by a zzso effect of this hormone on zzso zzso This zzso relationship in the zzso in contrast, was less consistent or zzso in the zzso nucleus and lateral zzso Central injection of zzso zzso zzso increased circulating zzso fatty acid levels and decreased zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso These results suggest that, on a zzso diet, this zzso zzso originating in the ARC zzso excessive body fat zzso by causing a shift from zzso storage toward zzso zzso
