To evaluate the effects of two zzso procedures versus intensive medical therapy zzso on zzso function and body zzso 

This was a zzso randomized, controlled trial of 60 subjects with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso and moderate obesity zzso 36 zzso 2 zzso zzso to zzso alone, zzso plus zzso gastric zzso or zzso plus sleeve zzso Assessment of zzso function zzso tolerance zzso and body composition was performed at baseline and 12 and 24 zzso 

zzso control improved in all three groups at 24 months (N zzso zzso with a mean zzso of zzso zzso zzso for gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso for sleeve zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for each surgical group versus zzso Reduction in body fat was similar for both surgery groups, with greater absolute reduction in zzso fat in gastric bypass versus sleeve zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso sensitivity increased significantly from baseline in gastric bypass zzso P zzso zzso and did not change in sleeve zzso or zzso zzso function zzso disposition zzso increased zzso in gastric bypass from zzso was markedly greater than zzso zzso zzso zzso and was not different between sleeve zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso At 24 months, zzso function zzso correlated with zzso fat and zzso free fatty acid zzso 

zzso surgery provides durable zzso control compared with intensive medical therapy at 2 zzso Despite similar weight loss as sleeve zzso gastric bypass uniquely restores pancreatic zzso function and reduces zzso fat, thus reversing the core defects in zzso
