zzso resistance is associated with zzso syndrome and type 2 diabetes, representing a risk factor for cardiovascular zzso This relationship may be modulated to some extent by age-related changes in sex hormone zzso We examined whether lower testosterone or sex zzso zzso zzso levels in older men are associated with insulin resistance independently of measures of central zzso 

zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso men zzso or zzso 70 zzso 

Age, body mass index zzso and waist circumference were zzso Early morning zzso were zzso for total testosterone, zzso zzso and insulin zzso Free testosterone was calculated using mass action zzso and insulin resistance was assessed using a zzso model zzso 

Total testosterone, free testosterone and zzso declined progressively across increasing zzso of zzso (all zzso and correlated zzso with log zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, all zzso After adjusting for age, zzso waist zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels, total testosterone was independently associated with log zzso zzso zzso while zzso was zzso zzso total testosterone zzso zzso was associated with zzso in the highest zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso as was total zzso or zzso 8 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In older men, lower total testosterone is associated with insulin resistance independently of measures of central zzso This association is seen with testosterone levels in the low to normal zzso Further studies are needed to evaluate interventions that raise testosterone levels in men with reduced insulin zzso
