Childhood zzso has been associated with an increased risk of obesity in adulthood, but the causes are zzso This study zzso that zzso significantly reduces both resting and activity energy zzso 

To assess and describe energy expenditure of low zzso Maya children and to determine whether zzso is independently related to energy expenditure after controlling for lean zzso 

zzso urban Maya children, 17 boys, aged 7-9 years, living in zzso Mexico, were measured for zzso weight and zzso zzso analysis zzso Body composition was estimated from zzso Energy expenditure was measured for one week using the zzso zzso heart rate and zzso 

zzso zzso below the zzso zzso of zzso III based zzso affected zzso of these physically active zzso Using multiple linear zzso analysis, greater lean body mass predicted higher resting and activity energy zzso zzso was not a significant predictor of resting energy zzso A lower zzso zzso but not zzso as a zzso zzso significantly predicted lower activity energy zzso 

The hypothesis that zzso reduces total energy expenditure zzso + zzso in children is not zzso Rather, children with shorter stature and less lean body mass have lower total energy zzso Complex interactions between body size, body zzso and zzso activity appear to elevate the risk for later life obesity in these Maya zzso
