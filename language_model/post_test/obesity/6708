To investigate the effects of zzso zzso sprint zzso training zzso compared to traditional exercise recommendations zzso in sedentary obese zzso 

Sixteen subjects zzso body mass index zzso zzso were randomly allocated to zzso of either zzso (6 sessions of zzso zzso or zzso zzso sessions of zzso at zzso peak oxygen consumption zzso cycle zzso zzso plasma zzso insulin, zzso fatty acids zzso zzso model assessment of insulin sensitivity zzso body composition and zzso were assessed at baseline and approximately zzso after the final training zzso zzso muscle biopsy samples were also obtained before and zzso after training and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso II, zzso IV, zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso 

No changes in zzso body zzso zzso zzso insulin, zzso and zzso were observed after training, either within or between zzso zzso muscle markers of zzso metabolism and zzso function also remained zzso after zzso of exercise zzso 

Our findings show that zzso of zzso zzso or zzso did not elicit any measurable zzso adaptations in sedentary obese zzso Further work is needed to determine the minimal amount of exercise required for short-term adaptations in this zzso
