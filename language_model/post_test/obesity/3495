zzso evidence suggests that gut zzso play an important role in the zzso of zzso fatty liver disease zzso Our previous studies show that zzso natural killer T zzso cells play a significant role in the zzso of zzso In this study, we explore the mechanism by which modification of gut zzso leads to the zzso of zzso zzso cells and improvement of zzso Mice were fed a high-fat zzso diet to induce zzso Some of them also received different doses of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Animal weight, zzso zzso liver zzso and zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso extracts from zzso were tested for their ability to activate zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso knockout mice were also evaluated for their responses to zzso zzso zzso zzso was more effective than zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the improvement of zzso zzso cell depletion and zzso The lipids extracted from zzso zzso zzso cells both in zzso and in zzso In contrast, lipids from zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso cell zzso in zzso but were able to stimulate zzso zzso zzso knockout mice have a similar response to zzso zzso cell depletion and zzso These results suggest that zzso in the gut zzso have profound effects on zzso zzso cells and zzso which are both zzso and zzso but not through zzso zzso Furthermore, these data suggest that zzso may contain bacterial zzso zzso that directly zzso the zzso functions of zzso zzso zzso
