zzso needle length for subcutaneous insulin injection may differ for obese and zzso patients, which could affect management of diabetes zzso zzso 

The aim of this study was to determine whether 31 gauge zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso needles are appropriate alternatives to 29 G zzso zzso zzso zzso needles in obese patients with zzso 

A zzso zzso randomized, zzso crossover trial was conducted in zzso patients with type 1 or 2 zzso with body mass zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration zzso All patients used the same injection device and were zzso to receive 12 weeks of therapy with 1 injection site zzso or zzso and 1 of the 2 needle zzso Patients used the same injection site but the alternate needle during the second zzso zzso 

zzso patients zzso men, 31 zzso mean zzso age, zzso zzso years; age range, zzso zzso received zzso zzso patients completed all 24 weeks of zzso No differences in zzso control were zzso zzso assessments of pain scores and leakage zzso and results from the World Health Organization Diabetes Treatment zzso zzso and most sections of the zzso Treatment zzso zzso zzso indicated no zzso However, patients indicated greater satisfaction with the shorter needle on the zzso zzso zzso The most common adverse event was zzso bruising zzso zzso for the longer needle vs zzso zzso for the shorter zzso P zzso zzso zzso percent of patients zzso preferred the shorter needle zzso zzso and zzso zzso had a strong, very strong, or extremely strong preference for zzso 

In obese patients, use of 31 G zzso 6 zzso and 29 G zzso zzso zzso needles produced comparable zzso values, zzso pain and leakage scores, zzso and ease of zzso However, patients preferred the shorter zzso
