zzso appear to be major regulators of zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso serum zzso are increased in human zzso and are under strong genetic zzso We tested the hypothesis that the zzso gene might be a candidate for zzso 

We investigated the frequency of a zzso zzso tandem repeat zzso in the zzso 2 of zzso gene in 52 lean zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso 133 overweight zzso zzso zzso and 76 obese zzso or zzso zzso otherwise healthy Korean zzso Total fat mass and percent body fat were determined by zzso X-ray zzso zzso DNA was extracted and used for zzso chain zzso zzso of zzso 

zzso of the zzso 2 did not show a significant difference in physical and clinical zzso The zzso or zzso distribution did not differ markedly between the three zzso The relative risk of being obese in comparison with lean group tended to be higher in zzso 2 carriers, but not zzso 

We found no relationship between the zzso zzso and zzso in Korean zzso
