zzso is zzso exclusively by zzso zzso in zzso forms, and zzso at high zzso in zzso This review summarizes recent studies highlighting cellular effects of zzso and its role in human zzso metabolism and zzso 

zzso is an important zzso factor in zzso tissue that zzso differentiation of zzso and favors formation of mature zzso It also functions as an zzso factor, influencing zzso metabolism via effects on target zzso zzso zzso exert differential zzso effects, with the zzso zzso associated with favorable zzso effects zzso greater insulin sensitivity, reduced visceral zzso mass, reduced plasma zzso and increased zzso zzso influences plasma zzso levels by altering the levels and activity of key zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso It thus influences zzso by affecting the balance of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and by modulating cellular processes involved in foam cell zzso 

Recent studies emphasize the role played by zzso in the zzso of zzso tissue and in the zzso of the zzso syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and zzso These zzso effects make it an attractive therapeutic target for zzso zzso
