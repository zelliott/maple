zzso linear cutting zzso are commonly used in zzso zzso Although many staple sizes are available, the clinical results of a staple line vary depending on the staple size and tissue zzso To help surgeons choose the proper staple size as well as establish design parameters for the development of new zzso devices, understanding the mechanical properties of the tissue is zzso Knowing the distribution of the thickness of the stomach tissue would allow for increased accuracy in defining key design parameters for zzso devices, thus improving their performance in the operating zzso To this end, 50 zzso zzso specimens were obtained in a consecutive series from individuals undergoing weight loss zzso zzso zzso were performed at six predetermined zzso zzso show that stomach thickness varies from thinnest at the zzso end near the zzso junction to thickest near the zzso The data also suggest that the stomach is thinner along the greater zzso Due to the variation in thickness of the stomach, zzso linear cutting zzso with thicker staples are recommended when zzso the zzso This thickness data will facilitate the development of devices with appropriate zzso closure for correct tissue zzso
