The aim of this study was to examine whether there is an association of insulin sensitivity with zzso infection in a zzso zzso adult zzso 

A zzso of the Health 2000 zzso zzso zzso consisted of zzso subjects without any indication of diabetes, aged between 30 and 64, and who had never zzso The outcome variable was zzso infection measured by means of the number of teeth with zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity was measured using the zzso model assessment index for insulin zzso zzso zzso models were used to estimate the relative risks and zzso confidence zzso 

We found that insulin sensitivity was associated with zzso infection in the age group zzso but not in persons aged zzso Controlling for body weight made the association between insulin sensitivity and zzso infection zzso 

The lack of knowledge of the underlying zzso model prevents making zzso conclusions about the role of reduced insulin sensitivity in the zzso of zzso zzso
