The abundance of the alpha and beta zzso of the zzso proteins zzso that zzso hormonal messages to zzso zzso was assessed in zzso zzso from lean zzso and obese zzso mice, using zzso with bacterial toxin and zzso Both methods revealed two zzso alpha species zzso and 42 zzso in the zzso Compared with those of lean mice, the zzso from obese mice contained substantially less of the 48 zzso species of zzso zzso as assessed by both zzso zzso by zzso toxin showed that only half as much zzso was incorporated into zzso alpha in the zzso from obese as compared with lean zzso zzso revealed two separate zzso alpha peptides zzso and 40 zzso and showed that the 40 zzso species was less abundant in the zzso from obese mice, whereas the amount of the 39 zzso species was similar in zzso from both lean and obese zzso Based on zzso zzso in zzso from lean mice the ratio zzso zzso alpha was zzso whereas in the zzso from obese mice it was zzso Similar amounts of zzso beta zzso were found in both types of zzso On the basis of the currently accepted zzso model of zzso zzso zzso the decrease in the abundance of the zzso alpha zzso in zzso zzso from obese mice could account for the abnormal zzso of the zzso in these zzso
