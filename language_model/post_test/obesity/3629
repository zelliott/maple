To evaluate the impact of maternal zzso on zzso interventions and adverse outcomes that may influence choice of planned birth setting in healthy women without additional risk zzso 

Prospective cohort zzso 

zzso random sample of English zzso zzso 

zzso women without medical or zzso risk factors other than zzso 

zzso log zzso zzso was used to evaluate the effect of zzso on risk of zzso interventions and adverse maternal and zzso outcomes adjusted for maternal zzso 

zzso intervention or adverse outcomes requiring zzso care zzso of: zzso instrumental delivery, zzso zzso section, general zzso blood zzso zzso degree zzso zzso zzso unit admission or zzso zzso 

In otherwise healthy women, obesity was associated with an increased risk of zzso zzso zzso section and some adverse maternal outcomes but when interventions and outcomes requiring zzso care were considered together, the magnitude of the increased risk was modest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso 35 zzso relative to low risk women of normal zzso zzso low risk women of normal weight had higher absolute risks and were more likely to require zzso intervention or care than otherwise healthy zzso women with zzso 35 zzso zzso composite zzso zzso versus zzso The zzso composite outcome exhibited a similar zzso 

Otherwise healthy zzso obese women may have lower zzso risks than previously zzso zzso should be considered in conjunction with parity when assessing the potential risks associated with birth in zzso unit zzso
