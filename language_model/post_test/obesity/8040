Numerous association studies have been performed to evaluate the relationship between the zzso gene and the essential hypertension, but their results are zzso The conflicting results may be explained by zzso reasons, particularly genetic differences in the population samples, zzso differences in the zzso populations zzso lack of appropriate control for other hypertension risk factors in some studies, or limited statistical power among many zzso Furthermore, hypertension is a public health issue of great relevance in zzso Islands zzso For these reasons we performed an association study about the relationship between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene and hypertension in a population from zzso zzso zzso in which a considerable zzso with respect to ethnicity and environmental factors could be zzso This population was composed of 109 patients and 107 zzso zzso of the zzso gene were determined by zzso and restriction site zzso zzso The different zzso were tested for association with dependent variables by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso analysis we found no evidence of association between the zzso gene zzso and zzso This lack of association was independent of zzso familial history of hypertension and diabetes for the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso however, in the zzso analysis the zzso zzso showed an almost significant positive association with hypertension zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso p zzso zzso The zzso zzso also showed a significant negative association with obesity zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso p zzso zzso that remained after adjustment by sex, hypertension and diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso p zzso zzso Our zzso a) are in contrast with the results from most previous studies that found a relationship of the zzso zzso with hypertension, as in those studies the zzso zzso was responsible for the zzso b) emphasize the need for rigorous control for zzso in the studies of association between the zzso gene and zzso c) underscore the importance and the utility of using concrete populations to carry out studies on the genetic dissection of zzso
