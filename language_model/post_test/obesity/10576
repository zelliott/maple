Children with zzso coordination disorder zzso are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease risk factors such as obesity and reduced zzso zzso However, there is limited data using laboratory measures for assessing the risk of cardiovascular disease associated with zzso The purpose of this study was to examine differences in left zzso structure and function between children with zzso and healthy zzso The study involved 126 children zzso zzso zzso with significant motor impairment zzso zzso zzso and healthy controls zzso zzso zzso matched for age, sex, and zzso The Movement ABC test zzso was used to zzso children as probable zzso zzso zzso dimensions were measured using ultrasound zzso Left zzso mass zzso was elevated in children with zzso zzso zzso 17 zzso compared to controls zzso zzso 21 zzso however, this difference was not zzso When zzso was zzso to zzso no difference was evident between groups zzso g and 26 g for the zzso and controls, zzso However, the zzso group demonstrated significantly elevated stroke volume zzso zzso zzso cardiac output zzso zzso volume zzso zzso zzso and left zzso diameter in zzso zzso zzso zzso Also, peak zzso zzso for fat free mass zzso was significantly lower zzso zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso heart rate zzso zzso zzso and percent body fat zzso were significantly higher in zzso In zzso zzso zzso was a significant predictor of stroke volume and cardiac output even after accounting for zzso zzso zzso and zzso Children with zzso do not demonstrate significantly elevated zzso or depressed zzso function compared to healthy zzso However, cases with zzso demonstrate significantly elevated zzso volume, zzso chamber size, stroke volume, and cardiac zzso These differences indicate obesity related changes in the left zzso and may represent the early stages of developing left zzso zzso
