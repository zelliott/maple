zzso zzso treatment has been reported to be associated with obesity and high zzso serum insulin zzso in parallel with an zzso serum zzso profile and zzso and zzso zzso in zzso The zzso mechanism underlying these changes has remained unknown, although several mechanisms have been zzso 

Fifty-one patients receiving zzso zzso male and 20 female zzso were included in this study, with 45 zzso male and 22 zzso healthy control zzso These participants were zzso clinically zzso and blood samples for zzso plasma zzso serum insulin, zzso and zzso zzso were taken after an overnight zzso 

The zzso patients had zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the control zzso p zzso although the zzso serum zzso and zzso zzso were not significantly higher in the patients than in the control zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso ratios zzso zzso zzso were lower zzso zzso in the zzso patients when compared with the control subjects zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively), and they also had lower zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than the control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso 

This study suggests that zzso does not induce insulin zzso but might interfere with the insulin metabolism in the liver, resulting in higher insulin zzso in the peripheral zzso These changes are seen irrespective of zzso weight gain, suggesting that increased insulin zzso induce weight gain and not vice zzso
