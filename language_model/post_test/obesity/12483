zzso protein zzso is an zzso that may be important in type 2 zzso Previous studies have examined the association between serum zzso zzso and clinical zzso in patients with type 2 diabetes, although the results obtained have been zzso We conducted a zzso aiming to investigate the association between serum zzso zzso and clinical indicators of diabetes, zzso function, zzso syndrome and obesity in subjects with type 2 zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso databases were searched from 2005 through November 2011, and the search identified 21 clinical variables from seven studies zzso zzso zzso zzso For each zzso summary correlation zzso zzso ) were estimated using a zzso zzso 

None of the diabetes markers were correlated with serum zzso zzso in subjects with type 2 diabetes, whereas all of the zzso function markers and many zzso syndrome markers were significantly zzso zzso correlation zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for estimated zzso zzso rate and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso In addition, plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plasma total cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cholesterol level zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were positively correlated with serum zzso zzso 

The results obtained in the present study suggest that serum zzso zzso in patients with type 2 diabetes may be associated with zzso zzso dysfunction and imbalances in zzso zzso
