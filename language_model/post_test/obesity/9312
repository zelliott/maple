Human obesity is closely associated with a state of chronic zzso zzso which also involves the zzso tissue with enhanced production of zzso substances zzso zzso restriction zzso reduces zzso production and improves zzso profile in zzso Some of these effects are zzso through zzso of the zzso 1 zzso zzso and in this study, we investigate whether the natural zzso zzso zzso which is a potent zzso zzso has zzso effects in human zzso tissue zzso 

The effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso change of zzso zzso gene expression and zzso were measured in human zzso tissue zzso 

Exposure of human zzso tissue in zzso to zzso for zzso increased zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein 1 zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso reversed the zzso zzso zzso and gene expression zzso of these zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso expression zzso a zzso that was reversed by zzso zzso Similar effects were observed in differentiated human zzso in primary culture, indicating that human zzso are a potential target for zzso zzso Finally, the effects were neutralized by zzso a zzso zzso 

This study is the first to show zzso effects of zzso on zzso expression and zzso in human zzso tissue in zzso through the zzso zzso Thus, zzso is hypothesized to possess beneficial effects and might improve the zzso profile in human zzso
