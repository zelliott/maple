To investigate whether the genetic zzso of the zzso protein zzso and beta 3 zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso were associated with differences of weight loss in obese patients submitted to a low calorie zzso 

zzso clinical intervention study of a zzso restriction in energy intake with respect to zzso 

zzso patients with a body mass index above zzso 

Body weight and body mass index at baseline and after zzso months, zzso by zzso chain reaction followed by zzso zzso 

For the zzso zzso two zzso 1 and 2 were identified with respective zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso 1 was associated with lower body weight loss after zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso 1-2 and 2-2 zzso respectively zzso zzso No difference in weight loss was found according to the beta 3 zzso zzso zzso 

A genetic zzso of the zzso gene is associated with a resistance to low calorie zzso This result, together with previous data on body weight gain, supports the hypothesis of a role of zzso and brown zzso tissue in the body weight regulation in zzso The importance of the zzso zzso of the beta 3 zzso in the resistance to low calorie diet is still to zzso
