Exposure to zzso air pollutants, including zzso aromatic zzso zzso from traffic emissions and other combustion sources, and childhood zzso have been implicated as risk factors for developing zzso However, the interaction between these two on asthma among young urban children has not been studied zzso 

Exposure to early childhood zzso was measured by two week residential indoor monitoring at age 5-6 years in the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health birth cohort zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso at age 5 was defined as a body mass index zzso greater than or equal to the 95th zzso of the year 2000 zzso and zzso growth charts zzso for Disease zzso Current asthma and recent zzso at ages 5 and 7 were determined by validated zzso Data were analyzed using a modified zzso zzso in generalized zzso equations zzso to estimate relative risks zzso after adjusting for potential zzso 

Neither zzso zzso or obesity had a main effect on asthma or recent zzso In models zzso by zzso of zzso a significant positive association was observed between an zzso range zzso increase in natural zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and asthma in obese children zzso No association in non-obese zzso children was observed at age 5 zzso Similar associations were observed for zzso zzso and zzso at age zzso 

zzso young children may be more likely to develop asthma in association with greater exposure to zzso and zzso in particular, than non-obese zzso
