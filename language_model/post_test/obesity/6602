zzso is a long-term source of cellular stress that zzso to chronic kidney disease zzso zzso is a zzso mechanism for cellular quality control through the disposal and recycling of cellular zzso During times of cellular stress, zzso zzso mechanisms to manage stress by selectively zzso the cell of the zzso of potentially toxic zzso lipids and zzso The zzso processes employed may vary between cell types and selectively adjust to the insult by inducing components of the basic zzso machinery zzso by the cells while not under zzso In this review, we will discuss the zzso responses of zzso to cellular zzso such as high-fat diet, obesity and diabetes, and how these mechanisms may prevent or promote the progression of zzso The identification of early cellular mechanisms in the advent of zzso and zzso zzso complications could afford avenues for future therapeutic zzso
