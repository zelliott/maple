zzso resistance, a hallmark of type 2 diabetes, is associated with zzso zzso However, the role of zzso oxygen species or specific zzso zzso in its development has not been tested under zzso zzso The objective of our study was to investigate the impact of zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso an zzso zzso that reduces hydrogen zzso zzso in zzso on zzso metabolism and insulin zzso The zzso zzso and zzso male mice zzso zzso zzso were fed a zzso diet zzso zzso from 8 to 24 weeks of zzso Compared with the zzso the zzso mice developed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 149 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and elevated plasma zzso (5 zzso 16 zzso at 24 weeks of zzso Meanwhile, these mice were heavier zzso zzso 27 zzso P zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso fat, P zzso than the zzso zzso At zzso zzso after an insulin challenge, the zzso mice had zzso less zzso zzso of a decrease in blood zzso than the zzso zzso Their insulin resistance was associated with a zzso reduction zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of insulin zzso zzso in liver and zzso zzso and zzso in liver and zzso zzso Here we report the development of insulin resistance in zzso with elevated expression of an zzso zzso and suggest that increased zzso activity may interfere with insulin function by zzso zzso zzso oxygen species required for insulin zzso
