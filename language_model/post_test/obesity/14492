zzso zzso receptors zzso are located on the zzso zzso and cell zzso of zzso zzso where they zzso regulate the synthesis and release of zzso In addition, zzso are also located on zzso zzso acting as zzso to regulate the releases of other zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso The present study investigated the effects of zzso zzso on appetite and zzso regulation by using zzso and zzso mice zzso because brain zzso plays a pivotal role in energy zzso The results showed that zzso an zzso inverse zzso increases, whereas zzso an zzso zzso decreases appetite and body weight in zzso obese zzso zzso zzso Moreover, in zzso zzso mice, but not in zzso zzso mice, zzso reduced fat mass, plasma zzso of zzso and insulin, and zzso zzso zzso The zzso effects of zzso were associated with a reduction in zzso release, but a comparable reduction in zzso release with zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso increased zzso Moreover, the zzso effects of zzso were independent of the zzso system, because zzso comparably reduced appetite in zzso 3 and 4 zzso zzso The results provide roles of zzso in energy zzso and suggest a therapeutic potential for zzso zzso in the treatment of obesity and diabetes zzso
