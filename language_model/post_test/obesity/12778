This prospective zzso study compares the safety and efficacy of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso approach zzso in obese patients with zzso zzso 

Recently, a zzso zzso approach has been described with benefits of avoiding the respiratory and zzso effects of carbon dioxide zzso zzso and giving direct access without the need to mobilize abdominal zzso 

zzso zzso were performed in 9 patients (2 men, 7 zzso mean age, zzso zzso zzso years old; range, 16 to 74 years old) with zzso zzso and in 6 women zzso age, zzso zzso zzso years old; range, 34 to 62 years old) with zzso zzso zzso gave 10 zzso and 11 zzso zzso blood gas samples, mean zzso pressure, heart rate, and clinical parameters were zzso 

The partial pressure of carbon dioxide zzso increased in both zzso and zzso CO2 zzso compared with zzso values zzso zzso and the zzso showed a greater rise in the zzso level compared with the zzso at 30 minutes zzso zzso zzso a significant increase zzso zzso of mean zzso pressure was observed in the zzso compared with zzso No significant changes in heart rate were observed in both zzso The operative time with the zzso and zzso in patients with zzso was zzso versus 105 minutes, respectively zzso zzso not significant zzso and in patients with bilateral zzso was zzso versus zzso minutes, respectively zzso zzso zzso No patients required blood zzso The number of doses of zzso with zzso and zzso in patients with zzso was zzso versus zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso and in patients with bilateral zzso was zzso versus zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso The hospital stay with zzso and zzso in patients with zzso was zzso versus zzso days, respectively zzso zzso zzso and in patients with bilateral zzso was zzso versus zzso days, respectively zzso zzso zzso The days to return to normal activity with zzso and zzso in patients with zzso were zzso versus zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso and in patients with bilateral zzso were zzso versus zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso Two patients with bilateral zzso and zzso had urinary zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso may become the techniques of choice for surgical removal of the adrenal zzso in zzso zzso The zzso approach might be a better option in patients with previous abdominal surgery and in patients with pre-existing zzso zzso
