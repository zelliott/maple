To examine whether childhood obesity is associated with zzso control, we compared healthy weight and obese zzso children's task performance along with the zzso and zzso components during a zzso zzso zzso indicated that obese children exhibited lower response accuracy relative to healthy weight children during the zzso task requiring greater amounts of zzso control, whereas no such difference was observed during the Go zzso zzso data indicated that healthy weight children exhibited a more frontal distribution for the zzso zzso relative to the Go zzso whereas obese children had similar zzso zzso between the Go zzso and zzso zzso Further, obese children had larger zzso zzso zzso relative to the Go zzso whereas this difference was not observed for healthy weight zzso These findings suggest that childhood obesity is zzso and selectively associated with prefrontal zzso zzso
