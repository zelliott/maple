zzso and zzso sleep zzso zzso in children share multiple zzso risk factors and the prevalence of zzso is higher in zzso children, suggesting that the latter may be at increased risk for zzso Since both asthma and zzso are inflammatory disorders, we hypothesized that zzso demonstrated zzso would be more frequent among poorly controlled zzso zzso and that treatment of zzso if present, would zzso the frequency of acute zzso zzso zzso 

Children with zzso were referred for an overnight sleep study, and zzso zzso and zzso zzso was performed if zzso was zzso zzso of asthma symptoms and zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso children, ages zzso years, with a mean frequency of zzso of zzso zzso zzso were zzso referred for a sleep zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was present in 58 patients zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso compared to the prevalence of zzso in a zzso zzso Information at zzso follow-up was available for 35 zzso children after zzso The annual frequency of zzso rescue zzso use, and asthma symptoms in this zzso decreased compared to no changes in the group without zzso 

The prevalence of zzso is markedly increased among zzso children and treatment of zzso appears to be associated with substantial improvements in the severity of the underlying zzso zzso
