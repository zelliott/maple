zzso is an increasingly serious health problem in the zzso Body mass index zzso percentage fat mass, and body fat mass are important zzso of zzso For a sample of zzso that zzso relative pairs (including zzso zzso zzso that are useful for linkage zzso we performed a zzso linkage zzso using 380 zzso markers to identify zzso regions that may contain zzso zzso zzso for zzso Each pedigree was zzso through a zzso who has extremely low bone mass, which translates into a low zzso A major zzso for zzso was identified on zzso near the marker zzso with a zzso score of zzso in zzso analysis and a maximum zzso score zzso of zzso in zzso zzso The zzso region near zzso also achieved an zzso for percentage of fat mass and body fat zzso For the putative zzso on zzso as much as zzso of zzso variation (after adjustment for age and zzso may be attributable to this zzso In addition, several other zzso regions that may contain zzso zzso are zzso For example, zzso near the marker zzso may contain a zzso for zzso variation, with a zzso score of zzso in zzso analysis and an zzso of zzso in zzso zzso The zzso regions identified in this and earlier reports are compared for further exploration in extension studies that use larger samples and/or denser markers for confirmation and zzso studies, to eventually identify major functional genes involved in zzso
