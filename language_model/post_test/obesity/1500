It has been reported that beta cell function progressively declines in patients with type 2 zzso The objective of this study was to assess the effect of obesity on declining beta cell function after diagnosis of type 2 zzso We conducted a zzso study of zzso consecutive subjects with type 2 diabetes who were admitted to our hospital from 2000 to zzso zzso and zzso serum zzso zzso zzso and urinary zzso levels had been measured during zzso The subjects were zzso according to zzso and time since zzso zzso index was calculated as zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso All zzso zzso were significantly higher in the 263 obese zzso zzso subjects compared to the zzso lean subjects zzso zzso There was a significant negative correlation between zzso zzso and duration of diabetes, suggesting a progressive decline in beta cell function after diagnosis of type 2 zzso However, this decline was more apparent in obese subjects zzso zzso index zzso compared to lean subjects zzso The significant difference in serum zzso zzso between the lean and obese subjects was lost in subjects more than 10 years after zzso In conclusion, our observations suggest that beta cell function shows a greater progressive decline in obese subjects than in lean subjects with type 2 zzso Treatment of obesity may be an important strategy to preserve beta cell function in patients with type 2 zzso
