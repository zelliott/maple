zzso fatty zzso protein zzso plays a key role in zzso insulin resistance and inflammation which may be involved in the zzso of zzso obesity zzso This study examined the association of SO with serum zzso levels in Korean zzso 

Two hundred zzso eight adults aged zzso years were examined using dual X-ray zzso and zzso zzso and measuring serum zzso zzso zzso was defined as the zzso skeletal muscle mass zzso divided by weight zzso of zzso zzso below the mean values of young adults in both zzso zzso was defined as visceral fat area zzso zzso 100 zzso 

zzso zzso levels were higher in groups with SO compared to zzso groups in both men and zzso In the zzso model, serum zzso levels were positively associated with zzso and zzso associated with zzso Even after adjusting for possible zzso factors, zzso was found to be independently and zzso associated with serum zzso zzso In addition, multiple zzso zzso analysis showed that increased serum levels of zzso were independently associated with the presence of zzso 

The present findings indicate that serum zzso levels may be valuable markers of the presence of zzso
