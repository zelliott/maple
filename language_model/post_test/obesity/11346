zzso invasive zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso has proven to be effective in the treatment of zzso and degenerative disc disease zzso Compared with the traditional open zzso the zzso procedure has been associated with less blood loss, less zzso pain, and a shorter hospital zzso However, it is uncertain whether the advantages of an zzso zzso also apply specifically to obese zzso This study was dedicated to evaluating whether obese patients reap the zzso benefits similar to those seen in patients with normal body mass index zzso when undergoing zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is, those with a zzso of at least 30 zzso had undergone single-level zzso were zzso identified and zzso according to zzso Class I zzso zzso zzso zzso Class II zzso zzso zzso zzso or Class III zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In each obesity class, patients were zzso by zzso approach, that is, open versus zzso zzso zzso including zzso estimated blood loss zzso complications zzso zzso and 30-day zzso and hospital length of stay zzso were zzso The zzso test, Fisher exact test, or zzso Student zzso were used when zzso 

One hundred zzso patients were included in the final zzso 49 underwent open zzso and 78 underwent zzso zzso zzso patients had Class I obesity zzso open and 38 zzso zzso 45 patients, Class II (19 open and 26 zzso and 21 patients, Class III (7 open and 14 zzso Overall, mean zzso was zzso zzso and mean hospital LOS was zzso zzso zzso invasive zzso was associated with significantly less zzso and a shorter hospital stay than open zzso when all patients were evaluated as a single cohort and within individual obesity zzso Overall, the complication rate was zzso zzso invasive zzso was associated with a significantly lower total complication rate zzso zzso vs zzso zzso and zzso complication rate zzso zzso vs zzso zzso as compared with open zzso When zzso by obesity class, zzso zzso was still associated with lower rates of total and zzso zzso This effect was most profound and statistically significant in patients with Class III obesity zzso open vs zzso zzso 

zzso invasive zzso offers obese patients zzso benefits similar to those seen in patients with normal zzso who undergo the same zzso These benefits include less zzso a shorter hospital stay, and potentially fewer complications compared with open zzso Additional large retrospective studies and zzso prospective studies are needed to verify these zzso
