Age, zzso and gender can have a significant impact on the zzso of adults aged 65 and zzso The aim of this study was to investigate differences in body segment parameters derived using two zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso method zzso et zzso zzso and zzso traditional zzso models zzso zzso zzso The impact of aging, zzso and obesity on the potential differences between these methods was zzso zzso healthy older adults were recruited for zzso Participants underwent a zzso zzso scan zzso zzso zzso Mass, zzso center of mass, and radius of zzso were determined for each zzso In addition, traditional zzso were used to estimate these parameters zzso zzso zzso A mixed linear zzso model was performed zzso zzso zzso zzso type was significant in every variable of interest except zzso segment zzso The obesity and gender differences that we observed translate into differences associated with using traditional zzso to predict zzso variables in an aging zzso Our data point to a need to consider age, zzso and gender when utilizing zzso data sets and to develop zzso models that accurately predict body segment parameters in the geriatric population, considering gender and zzso
