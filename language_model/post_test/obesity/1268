We compared the effects of long-term treatment with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and triple therapy zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso and zzso features in the zzso zzso zzso a genetic model of zzso diabetes zzso and zzso zzso male zzso rats (4 to 6 weeks old) were fed a zzso zzso diet containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso After 2 months on the diet, rats were assigned to one of three groups: one group zzso received zzso zzso the second group zzso received triple therapy zzso and the third group zzso did not receive zzso Treatment was maintained for 3 to 4 zzso Body weight, food zzso and zzso levels of serum zzso and insulin did not differ among the three zzso Control rats exhibited progressive zzso in parallel with the rise in zzso blood pressure zzso Both zzso and zzso equally lowered zzso to normal levels and reduced zzso in treated zzso However, the reduction of zzso was greater and more sustained with zzso than with zzso zzso whereas the effect of zzso on zzso was zzso Plasma zzso activity was increased in zzso and zzso rats compared with control rats zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso showed that the percentage of zzso with zzso expansion and sclerosis and the zzso score (an index of severity of zzso zzso namely zzso zzso inflammatory cellular zzso and zzso zzso was reduced in both zzso and zzso zzso However, the reduction of zzso and zzso zzso was greater in zzso than in zzso rats zzso The percentage of zzso sclerosis was positively correlated with the severity score of zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is more effective than zzso in halting the progression of zzso in the zzso rat with zzso diabetes zzso and zzso The zzso effect of zzso is associated with significant reduction in zzso and zzso zzso independent of the effect of treating zzso
