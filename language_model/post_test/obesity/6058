zzso insulin resistance of zzso and zzso metabolism may also affect protein zzso notably at the muscle zzso 

We hypothesized that muscle protein response to insulin and zzso acid is blunted during zzso 

Total zzso and zzso zzso muscle proteins fractional synthesis rates zzso together with zzso protein zzso zzso have been determined in zzso state zzso and during a zzso zzso zzso clamp by using a continuous infusion of zzso in six obese and eight zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso disposal rate and protein breakdown to insulin and zzso acid infusion were significantly lower in obese than in zzso subjects zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly lower zzso zzso in obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in comparison with zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was similarly zzso by insulin and zzso acid in both groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso obese zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso was increased in zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso but not in obese subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso not zzso 

The zzso impairment of protein metabolism is characterized by 1) a reduced turnover rate of skeletal muscle proteins in PA; 2) a lack of stimulation of zzso protein synthesis by insulin and zzso zzso and 3) a lower zzso of zzso zzso by insulin and zzso zzso zzso of selective muscle protein zzso may zzso obese subjects to muscle zzso dysfunction leading to type 2 zzso
