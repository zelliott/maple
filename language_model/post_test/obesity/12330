To define the relationship between regional coronary zzso capacity and zzso zzso strain at rest in normal weight, overweight, and obese individuals with normal global zzso zzso 

zzso blood flow at rest and during zzso zzso was measured with zzso zzso in zzso in normal weight control zzso zzso zzso zzso overweight zzso zzso zzso 10), and obese individuals zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, resting zzso function was evaluated as zzso strain zzso zzso by zzso Global zzso flow reserve zzso did not differ significantly between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso whereas it declined significantly in zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Further, global zzso zzso was comparable between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but it was lowest in zzso when zzso to the zzso product zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso When zzso of the three major coronary territories was correlated with corresponding zzso a positive association was observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and also in zzso when relating zzso to coronary vascular resistance during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Higher coronary zzso capacity is related to corresponding regional zzso strain at rest in non-obese individuals, while this is also observed for reduced zzso in zzso
