The aim of this study was to investigate the zzso of the expression of key zzso genes in the subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso during different zzso of a zzso dietary zzso Fifteen obese women zzso zzso zzso underwent a zzso dietary intervention consisting of 1 month very low calorie diet zzso followed by 2 months low calorie diet zzso and 3 months weight maintenance diet zzso At each phase of the dietary intervention, a needle zzso of the abdominal zzso was obtained to evaluate zzso expression of key zzso genes and a zzso zzso clamp zzso was zzso zzso intervention induced a body weight reduction of zzso % and an improvement of insulin sensitivity as assessed by a zzso Compared to zzso levels, zzso levels of the zzso zzso in zzso were higher at the end of zzso and not different at the end of LCD and zzso In contrast, the expression of the zzso zzso was lower at the end of zzso and LCD compared to the zzso levels and did not differ at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels were lower than the zzso levels at the end of LCD only, while zzso and the insulin zzso levels did not change throughout the dietary zzso The results suggest that the regulation pattern of the genes that are involved in the control of zzso is different at the respective zzso of the dietary intervention and depends on the duration of the diet and the status of energy zzso
