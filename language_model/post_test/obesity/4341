zzso tissue development is associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The class of zzso zzso contributes to these zzso but little information is available on the role of individual zzso We report that zzso zzso zzso has no significant effect on total body weight or on subcutaneous zzso or zzso zzso zzso tissue mass of mice kept on a high fat diet for 15 zzso The zzso size and density in SC and zzso zzso zzso were also comparable in zzso deficient and zzso control zzso Similarly, blood vessel size and density in obese SC and zzso zzso zzso was not affected by zzso zzso zzso parameters and blood cell composition were similar for both zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly reduced in zzso zzso of the deficient mice as compared to the zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso does not significantly contribute to zzso tissue development and associated zzso in a mouse model of nutritionally induced zzso
