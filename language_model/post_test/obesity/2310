zzso characterized by inappropriate expansion of zzso cells zzso zzso is associated with the zzso syndrome and is caused by an inability to recruit and differentiate new precursor zzso We examined the role of bone zzso protein 4 zzso and zzso zzso in the regulation of human zzso cell zzso zzso of differentiation zzso and zzso cells were first removed before the remaining zzso vascular cells of human subcutaneous biopsy specimens were differentiated zzso different zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso of zzso and induction of zzso 1 zzso were markers of precursor cells undergoing excellent zzso The addition of zzso inhibited zzso zzso and promoted zzso in cells with a low degree of zzso The positive effect of zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso by binding to the zzso zzso protein zzso was not seen with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso produced an additive zzso There was an apparent zzso between differentiation and commitment because zzso expression increased in zzso zzso and the addition of the zzso zzso zzso reduced precursor cell zzso Thus, differentiated human zzso cells can promote zzso via zzso zzso zzso and the impaired zzso in zzso obesity is mainly due to an inability to suppress zzso zzso and to induce zzso
