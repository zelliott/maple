Twenty-five obese adolescents zzso zzso 11 zzso age zzso years, zzso zzso were zzso to receive capsules containing either zzso zzso or zzso for 3 zzso The study was performed using a zzso zzso design with a zzso zzso zzso zzso blood pressure zzso and zzso blood samples were obtained before and after each treatment zzso The vascular structure and function was measured after each treatment zzso 

The serum zzso zzso concentration increased with zzso zzso The zzso zzso response improved with zzso treatment compared to zzso zzso zzso supplementation also decreased the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso No difference was found in the total cholesterol, zzso HDL cholesterol, zzso blood pressure, pulse wave zzso or vascular structure between the two treatment zzso
