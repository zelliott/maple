To assess whether pelvic zzso zzso have a zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso databases of two zzso academic departments were used to identify consecutive patients undergoing pelvic systematic zzso as part of the treatment for a variety of zzso zzso All procedures were carried out in a standardized zzso zzso zzso counts were retrieved from pathological zzso 

Four hundred and zzso women underwent pelvic zzso during the study zzso The median zzso zzso count was higher on the right side than on the left side zzso zzso versus 8 zzso zzso A prevalence of zzso zzso was found in 265 zzso patients, while in 44 zzso cases pelvic zzso were equally distributed on the two zzso The zzso prevalence was significantly higher than the expected 50% in each type of zzso and surgical technique zzso The zzso prevalence was statistically significant even when the analysis was performed for different zzso groups zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso versus 4 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 6 zzso versus 5 zzso zzso Moreover, zzso count was higher on the right than on the left in obese zzso zzso versus 8 zzso zzso and zzso women zzso zzso versus 9 zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest the existence of a zzso asymmetry in pelvic zzso zzso distribution, with zzso zzso
