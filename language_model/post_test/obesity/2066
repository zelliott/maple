To compare the effects of weight loss vs zzso exercise training on coronary artery disease risk factors in healthy zzso obese, middle-aged and older zzso 

zzso controlled zzso 

A total of 170 obese zzso mass index, 30 zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso middle-aged and older zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso weight loss interventions, zzso zzso exercise training program, and a zzso control zzso 

Change in body zzso zzso zzso capacity zzso zzso blood pressure, zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of 73 men zzso to weight loss completed the intervention and had a zzso mean reduction in weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso with no 22 change in zzso zzso zzso of 71 men zzso to zzso exercise completed the intervention, increased their zzso max by a mean of zzso zzso zzso and did not change their weight, whereas the 18 men who completed in the control group had no significant changes in body composition or zzso zzso Weight loss decreased zzso zzso zzso by zzso insulin by zzso and zzso and insulin areas during the oral zzso tolerance test zzso by zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso By contrast, zzso exercise did not improve zzso zzso or insulin zzso or zzso responses during the zzso but decreased insulin areas by zzso zzso zzso In analysis of zzso the zzso in zzso zzso and insulin levels and zzso areas with intervention differed between weight loss and zzso exercise when compared with the control group zzso zzso Similarly, weight loss but not zzso exercise increased zzso zzso cholesterol levels zzso zzso and decreased blood pressure compared with the control zzso In multiple zzso zzso the improvement in zzso and zzso metabolism was related primarily to the reduction in zzso 

These results suggest that weight loss is the preferred treatment to improve coronary artery disease risk factors in overweight, middle-aged and older zzso
