zzso muscle is one of the primary zzso responsible for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes zzso The fetal stage is crucial for skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso inflammatory responses, which might regulate zzso through zzso zzso This study evaluated the effects of maternal obesity zzso increase in body mass zzso during pregnancy on zzso and the zzso and zzso pathways in fetal skeletal muscle using an obese pregnant sheep zzso zzso zzso were assigned to a control group zzso fed zzso of National Research Council zzso zzso or zzso zzso fed zzso of National Research Council zzso zzso diet from 60 days before to 75 days after conception zzso approximately 148 zzso when fetal zzso skeletal muscle was sampled for zzso zzso markers including zzso zzso and zzso contents were reduced in zzso compared with C fetal zzso indicating the zzso of zzso The diameter of primary muscle fibers was smaller in zzso fetal zzso zzso of zzso was reduced in zzso compared with C fetal zzso Although the zzso level was lower in zzso than C fetal muscle, more zzso was associated with zzso in the zzso zzso Moreover, we found zzso levels of zzso and zzso were both increased in zzso fetal zzso In conclusion, our data showed that zzso and the zzso signaling zzso were zzso which might be due to the zzso of inflammatory zzso signaling pathways in fetal muscle of obese zzso
