In a precedent study we observed that overall zzso evaluated with the body mass index zzso was correlated with plasma zzso and red blood cells zzso zzso while abdominal obesity as assessed with the waist to hip ratio zzso was correlated with zzso We investigated this issue in 129 women (age zzso years, zzso 15 to 44 zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso who were divided into zzso groups: 17 zzso women zzso zzso 75 normal weigh zzso zzso 11 overweight zzso zzso and 26 obese zzso divided according to zzso into 13 lower body and 13 upper body obese zzso Whole blood zzso significantly increases across obesity classes, and is higher in upper body than in lower body obesity zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso The correlations between whole blood zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso are found zzso The former is explained by correlations of zzso with plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso and red cell rigidity zzso zzso zzso p zzso and the latter is only explained by a correlation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso is also correlated with zzso zzso zzso Actually, when total zzso is evaluated with the percentage of fat zzso given by zzso analysis zzso the picture is slightly different, since zzso is correlated with whole blood zzso and zzso zzso parameters but not with zzso plasma zzso and red cell zzso Fat free mass is also correlated with whole blood zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso due to a correlation with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso but neither zzso zzso nor plasma zzso This study shows that zzso by its own is associated with increased red cell zzso that abdominal fat increases blood zzso due to a rise in zzso and that overall body size as assessed with the zzso is associated with increased plasma zzso and red cell zzso
