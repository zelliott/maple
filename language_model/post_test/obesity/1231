zzso zzso of zzso are closely correlated with body fat mass, and may thus constitute an zzso limb of a system regulating body zzso with zzso limbs that affect energy expenditure and food zzso We studied 50 subjects (27 zzso 23 zzso zzso 31 zzso 19 zzso at usual body weight during active weight loss or weight gain and during the maintenance of body weights zzso above usual zzso + zzso and zzso and/or zzso below usual body weight zzso zzso and zzso zzso to test the hypotheses that the dynamic process of weight change and the maintenance of an altered body weight are associated with significant changes in circulating zzso of zzso and/or the relationship between fat mass and zzso and such changes in the plasma concentration of zzso are related to changes in energy expenditure at altered body zzso zzso were admitted to the Rockefeller University Hospital, and energy metabolism zzso energy zzso resting energy zzso zzso effect of zzso and zzso energy zzso and circulating zzso of zzso and insulin were examined at various weight zzso zzso body weight, zzso above usual body weight, zzso below usual body weight, and zzso below usual body zzso Plasma zzso was also measured in some subjects during dynamic periods of weight gain or zzso Though both plasma zzso zzso and fat mass were significantly correlated with resting energy zzso only the correlation of fat mass and energy expenditure remained significant in a multiple zzso linear zzso zzso Neither absolute nor relative changes in plasma zzso between weight zzso were significantly correlated with any of the observed changes in energy zzso Plasma zzso zzso were significantly lower during weight loss than during weight maintenance at the same body zzso Plasma zzso zzso zzso to fat mass, were significantly lower during the maintenance of a reduced body weight in females and higher during the maintenance of an elevated body weight in males than in the same subjects at usual body zzso At all weight zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso to fat mass were significantly higher in females than in zzso but gender was not a significant zzso of the relationship between zzso and energy zzso zzso serum zzso of insulin was a significant zzso of plasma zzso concentration in zzso but not zzso at zzso initial and zzso + zzso Although plasma zzso is significantly reduced during dynamic weight loss compared with zzso weight maintenance at the same body weight, the lack of correlation between changes in plasma zzso and changes in energy expenditure between weight zzso suggests that zzso is not the primary signal that mediates the changes of energy expenditure that accompany the maintenance of an altered body weight in zzso
