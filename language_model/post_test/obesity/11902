zzso early zzso zzso is a risk factor for future obesity and zzso zzso zzso raised in small litters zzso develop overweight, zzso zzso zzso and hypertension when zzso As obesity is related to zzso zzso resistance and zzso syndrome, we aimed to investigate body zzso plasma hormone levels, zzso tolerance and the zzso signaling zzso in zzso from early overfed animals at weaning and zzso To induce zzso zzso we reduced litter size to three zzso zzso and the groups with normal litter size (10 zzso were used as zzso zzso had free access to standard diet and water zzso Body weight and food intake were monitored daily, and offspring were killed at 21 zzso and 180 days old zzso zzso zzso group had higher body weight and total and visceral fat mass at both zzso zzso mass and serum zzso zzso cholesterol zzso were higher at 21 days and lower at 180 zzso Small litter rats presented higher levels of zzso at both zzso while zzso levels were higher at weaning and lower at zzso There was higher zzso insulin and zzso serum zzso at 21 days old, while no zzso intolerance was observed in zzso zzso signaling zzso was unaffected at zzso However, zzso zzso induced lower zzso and zzso and higher zzso expression in adult animals, indicating central zzso resistance in zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso zzso higher total and visceral fat mass, lower zzso and central zzso resistance in adult zzso
