zzso zzso zzso contributes to the negative health effects of obesity and insulin resistance, which include hypertension, stroke, and increased cardiovascular and zzso zzso Weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity are individually associated with improved central zzso zzso however, their combined effects on zzso zzso are poorly zzso The purpose of this study was to determine how insulin levels modify the improvements in zzso zzso seen with weight loss in overweight and obese young zzso 

To assess the effects of weight loss and decreased zzso insulin on vascular zzso we studied 339 participants in the Slow the zzso zzso of zzso Aging zzso zzso At study entry, the participants were aged zzso zzso zzso and had a zzso index of zzso zzso of pulse wave zzso zzso in the central zzso zzso peripheral zzso zzso and mixed zzso zzso vascular beds were collected at baseline and zzso The effects of zzso change in weight and insulin on measures of zzso were estimated using zzso zzso 

After adjustment for baseline risk factors and change in zzso blood pressure, zzso weight loss and zzso change in zzso insulin independently predicted improvement in zzso but not zzso or zzso There was a significant interaction between zzso weight change and change in zzso insulin when predicting changes in zzso zzso zzso experiencing both weight loss and insulin reductions showed the greatest improvement in zzso 

Young adults with excess weight who both lower their insulin levels and lose weight see the greatest improvement in vascular zzso This improvement in vascular zzso with weight loss and insulin declines may occur throughout the zzso and may not be limited to individual vascular zzso
