zzso therapy may adversely affect protein zzso in obese children given that zzso reactions involving zzso a zzso essential for growth, are zzso Because physical activity influences zzso zzso and may zzso the effects of reduced energy zzso exercise combined with diet therapy may be beneficial with regard to protein zzso The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in protein zzso in response to sequential addition of an exercise program to dietary intervention in obese zzso 

After a zzso baseline period, five subjects aged 8-10 zzso reduced energy intake zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso for 12 zzso A walking program zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was implemented during the final 6 zzso of diet zzso At baseline and after zzso I zzso only) and II zzso and zzso of intervention, zzso was used to assess protein synthesis zzso protein breakdown zzso net turnover zzso zzso zzso - zzso and nitrogen flux zzso 

zzso lost zzso zzso during the zzso intervention period zzso zzso zzso zzso With diet only, zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso due to a reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso accompanied by no change in zzso Although zzso increased with walking zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not return to baseline levels due to a concurrent increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Changes in zzso and zzso yielded an increase in Q zzso zzso zzso zzso a measure of zzso acid cycling between protein and free zzso acid zzso 

These results suggest that exercise offers zzso benefits for obese children during zzso weight zzso zzso studies are needed to assess long-term health outcomes associated with the observed changes in protein zzso
