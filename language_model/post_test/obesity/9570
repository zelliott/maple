The zzso mouse zzso zzso which exhibits zzso zzso but low insulin zzso in captivity responded with zzso without obesity or diabetes on a zzso diet and became obese, and zzso on a diet of zzso zzso A three-month zzso diet induced a marked rise in the activity of regulatory zzso of zzso and zzso in the liver but not in zzso zzso There was also increased energy waste on this diet evident from a zzso rise in the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with an zzso in circulating zzso The obesity in mice maintained for three months on fat rich seeds was associated with moderate zzso mild zzso and little change in circulating zzso There was a decrease in the activity of zzso and zzso zzso both in the liver and zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso activity rose, suggesting that the zzso carrying the zzso fat were better assimilated than the zzso zzso zzso from the dietary zzso Along with zzso tissue gain, zzso deposition was apparent in several muscles, accompanied by increased tissue free fatty acid, zzso and zzso zzso This suggested relation of increased muscle fat zzso with decreased zzso metabolism and insulin zzso zzso responses to diets were thus zzso which were particularly discernible in desert animals surviving on a limited caloric zzso zzso follow up of these zzso and zzso adaptation patterns to selective nutritional affluence may promote the understanding of the mechanisms leading to zzso with zzso and normal zzso zzso versus obesity with diabetes but without zzso
