In a cohort of employees participating in a zzso nutrition and physical activity program, we compared program completion and changes in cardiovascular risk factors by baseline body mass zzso 

In 2007, zzso employees enrolled in a 10 week program at a hospital in Boston, zzso Program completion and change in weight, cholesterol, and blood pressure were compared between obese zzso mass zzso overweight zzso mass zzso and normal weight zzso mass zzso zzso 

At zzso zzso were obese or overweight and had higher blood pressure and cholesterol compared to normal weight zzso Program completion was zzso and did not differ by body mass zzso Mean weight loss was zzso zzso at end of program zzso and zzso zzso at 1 year zzso At end of program, participants with body mass zzso lost zzso body weight zzso zzso for body mass zzso and zzso for body mass zzso zzso but weight loss at 1 year did not differ by body mass zzso Mean cholesterol and blood pressure were lower at end of program and 1 year zzso zzso but did not differ by body mass zzso 

zzso programs can successfully initiate cardiovascular risk reduction among employees, but more intensive interventions are needed to make significant improvements in the health of higher risk obese zzso
