The relative importance of insulin resistance and zzso to the development of zzso remains zzso Furthermore, zzso may be responsible for observed zzso Our aim was to study the relative contributions of zzso insulin resistance and zzso to zzso zzso 

In this zzso analysis of the Netherlands zzso of zzso zzso study, a cohort of persons of zzso years, zzso waist circumference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and insulin zzso were measured and the revised zzso was zzso The carotid zzso zzso zzso was measured by zzso We performed linear zzso analyses between standardized values of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and subsequently included age, sex, ethnicity, education and smoking, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso 

After exclusion of participants with zzso lowering therapy zzso or missing data zzso this analysis included zzso participants, zzso men, and mean zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso per zzso were: zzso 16 zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso 11 zzso zzso These associations attenuated after adjustments, and attenuated most strongly after adjustment for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso per zzso in the full model were: zzso 4 zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso 0 zzso zzso 16 zzso zzso 18 zzso zzso 

In middle-aged individuals, we observed similar contributions of insulin resistance and zzso to zzso zzso These contributions were largely explained by abdominal zzso emphasizing the importance of weight zzso
