Type 2 diabetes is caused by insulin resistance and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rat is an established animal model of human type 2 diabetes that exhibits chronic and slowly progressive zzso and zzso and is accompanied by progressive zzso in the zzso The aim of the present study was to examine whether worsening of zzso insulin resistance, and zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso rats is related to zzso by treating these animals with a zzso drug, zzso The zzso groups of zzso and their control counterpart zzso zzso zzso zzso rats received a zzso diet zzso zzso g normal zzso for 16 weeks, from 12 to 28 weeks of age, while the other groups of rats received standard rat zzso zzso treatment significantly reduced serum zzso zzso and free fatty acid zzso levels, suppressed the increase in zzso size, and inhibited the expression of zzso muscle zzso a marker for activated pancreatic zzso cells that are involved in the zzso of the zzso in the zzso in zzso rats, but had no influences on food zzso body weight gain, abdominal zzso zzso and pancreatic insulin content in both strains of zzso Although zzso significantly reduced circulating zzso levels and suppressed the increase in insulin zzso evaluated by area under the curve zzso analysis in response to an intravenous zzso tolerance test zzso until the end of the experiment, improvement of insulin resistance was observed only for the first 8 weeks after the onset of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is not responsible for the reduced insulin sensitivity, but the impairment of zzso tolerance is the primary zzso in the zzso rats, although improvement of zzso suppressed zzso zzso in the zzso and temporally improved insulin zzso
