Type 2 diabetes is associated with cardiovascular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may be different in obese individuals with and without type 2 zzso We examined zzso responses in zzso and diabetic women aged zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso blood pressure zzso and zzso sensitivity were evaluated before and after a 20 zzso walk at approximately zzso of zzso peak in eight lean, 12 obese without type 2 diabetes and eight women with type 2 zzso zzso zzso were obtained at zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso blood pressure decreased at 10 zzso and 20 zzso zzso in all zzso Total peripheral resistance decreased at 10 zzso in all women, but the subsequent increase at 20 zzso was greater zzso in lean than in diabetic zzso zzso zzso of zzso blood pressure increased zzso at 10 and 20 zzso in all women, but the increase at 10 zzso was smaller zzso in diabetic than in lean zzso Heart rate was increased zzso at 10 zzso in all women and at 20 zzso in both obese zzso Both zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso sensitivity decreased at 10 and 20 zzso of recovery in all zzso A zzso interaction zzso was observed for heart rate and zzso sensitivity as a lower heart rate and higher zzso sensitivity were observed in lean women than in women with type 2 zzso 

zzso zzso zzso sensitivity and responses to zzso cardiovascular activity contribute to an attenuated recovery of heart rate and total peripheral resistance after brisk walking in middle-aged obese women with type 2 zzso
