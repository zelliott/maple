We have determined the blood zzso responses to a zzso zzso period of cafeteria obese rats, in both zzso and late pregnant zzso In the fed condition the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso do not differ when compared in control and obese rats, but zzso and zzso levels are higher in the obese zzso The overall response of the zzso rats to starving seems characterized by decreased rates of zzso and zzso zzso zzso by a more intense zzso of zzso fuels, with excess zzso bodies production and increased zzso of the mobilized zzso What we observed in the obese pregnant response to zzso can be summarized as the additional or superimposed effects of excess fat zzso In the obese pregnant starved rats a less severe zzso lower levels of zzso (as a consequence of increased zzso reduced zzso levels, and increased zzso and zzso levels were zzso It can be assumed that the pregnant obese rat response to zzso is related to the size of the fat zzso the more obese, the more zzso and less zzso and even diminished rates of zzso zzso as indicated by a lower levels, when compared to the lean zzso
