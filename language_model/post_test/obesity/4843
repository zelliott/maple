Type 2 diabetes zzso zzso is estimated to account for zzso of incident pediatric diabetes zzso 

Our objective was to characterize the zzso defects underlying zzso in adolescents and young zzso 

We conducted a zzso study of zzso function and insulin sensitivity in 16 adolescents with zzso and 13 obese zzso and 13 lean zzso zzso zzso subjects at a University Medical zzso 

We provided oral and zzso zzso tolerance zzso 

We measured insulin and zzso levels, insulin sensitivity, acute insulin responses to zzso zzso and the ratio of zzso to zzso zzso 

The diabetic subjects had elevated zzso insulin levels and significantly reduced insulin sensitivity zzso zzso The acute insulin response to zzso zzso was comparable in the zzso and zzso groups zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso but insulin zzso adjusted for insulin resistance, the disposition index, was severely impaired in the diabetic subjects zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The ratio of zzso to zzso insulin did not differ among the three groups in the zzso or zzso zzso Plasma zzso levels were comparable before and after zzso of zzso 

These findings demonstrate that diabetic adolescents have significant insulin resistance, even compared with subjects of similar obesity and body zzso and impaired insulin zzso relative to their degree of insulin zzso However, the adolescent diabetic subjects retained a zzso insulin response to zzso that was comparable to lean controls and did not have zzso or zzso
