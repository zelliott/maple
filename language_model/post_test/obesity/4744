A high prevalence of obesity has recently been reported in zzso women with low trauma zzso suggesting that higher bone mineral density zzso in obese individuals may not be protective against zzso 

The aim of this study was to compare zzso and other risk factors for zzso fracture in zzso obese zzso zzso 

zzso of obese women with and without incident zzso fracture were investigated among the prospective cohort in the Study of zzso zzso 

The Study of zzso zzso is a zzso study of zzso women zzso zzso aged 65 zzso and over who were recruited between September 1986 and October 1988 from zzso listings at four zzso clinical zzso 

The main outcome measure was zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in the spine, zzso neck, and total hip were significantly lower in obese women who experienced fractures than in obese women without zzso mean differences, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso respectively zzso zzso for zzso A previous history of fracture zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso neck zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso decrease in zzso P zzso were independently associated with incident zzso zzso 

zzso zzso women who sustain zzso fractures have significantly lower zzso on average than obese women without fracture and are more likely to have a past history of zzso zzso in obese zzso women thus exhibit some characteristics of fragility zzso
