zzso zzso obese patients were zzso to gastric bypass zzso or zzso zzso and observed for 24 months zzso zzso time and hospital stay were longer and zzso and zzso complications somewhat more common in the bypass than in the zzso zzso But weight loss at 1 year was significantly greater and failures significantly fewer after gastric zzso Four zzso were converted to bypass after zzso months because of failure to lose zzso zzso bypass was judged to be much the preferable of the two zzso zzso occurred in some patients with bypass but not after zzso zzso was not associated with greater weight zzso zzso measured zzso volume showed significant correlation with weight loss after zzso but not after zzso zzso zzso volume and zzso measured zzso diameter were zzso factors, which in multiple zzso analysis could explain observed zzso in weight loss to about zzso after zzso but to a negligible degree after gastric zzso
