Five women and three men, all obese and weighing 95 to 140 zzso were studied by routine pulmonary function tests and by a radioactive xenon technique, while seated upright at rest, to measure the regional ventilation and zzso distribution in the zzso In four subjects in whom the zzso reserve volume averaged zzso of predicted normal, the ventilation distribution as measured with zzso was zzso In the remaining four subjects, in whom the zzso reserve volume was reduced to less than zzso L and averaged only zzso of predicted values, the distribution of a normal tidal breath was predominantly to the upper zzso In all subjects the zzso distribution was predominantly to the lower lung zones but was slightly more uniform than in normal zzso zzso During zzso breathing, therefore, in four subjects the ventilation and zzso distribution was substantially normal, whereas in the remaining four zzso was zzso in the lower zones, to which ventilation was significantly zzso These findings show that there may be significant zzso zzso on a regional basis in obese subjects, this zzso bearing a close relationship to the reduction in zzso reserve volume, a finding predictable from recently published data on normal zzso subjects zzso The abnormalities of zzso relationships that were demonstrated in four of the eight obese subjects could cause a reduction in zzso oxygen tension during resting tidal zzso
