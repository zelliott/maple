The zzso syndrome is a common and complex disorder combining zzso zzso hypertension, and insulin zzso It is a primary risk factor for diabetes and cardiovascular zzso We showed for the first time that the zzso syndrome is associated with a higher fraction of oxidized LDL and thus with higher levels of circulating oxidized zzso zzso and impaired zzso control, independent of zzso levels, were associated with increased in zzso LDL zzso as reflected by the higher prevalence of high oxidized zzso High levels of oxidized LDL were associated with increased risk of future zzso zzso even after adjustment for zzso and other established cardiovascular risk zzso This association is in agreement with the finding that zzso of oxidized LDL, which zzso zzso of smooth muscle cells and zzso to zzso production, was associated with upstream zzso of a vulnerable plaque zzso zzso and insulin resistance in obese LDL zzso mice were associated with increased zzso stress and impaired zzso zzso zzso associated with accelerated zzso due to increased zzso zzso and zzso of oxidized LDL in the zzso The zzso of oxidized LDL was partly due to an impaired zzso zzso zzso due to a decrease in zzso Our data in this experimental model are thus the more relevant because a decrease in zzso activity was found to be associated with a defective metabolism of oxidized zzso by HDL from patients with type 2 zzso Weight loss in zzso obese, and zzso mice was associated with zzso changes of key genes regulating zzso zzso zzso transport and insulin sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso stress and zzso most of which are under the zzso control of zzso We established an important relationship between zzso and zzso for the prevention of the zzso of LDL in the zzso zzso For example we showed that zzso decreased the oxidized LDL zzso by increasing the expression of zzso and zzso In addition, we established a relation between increased zzso expression in the zzso tissue and a change in the gene expression pattern, which explains the decrease of free fatty zzso zzso and the increase in insulin zzso We demonstrated that plaque oxidized LDL correlated with coronary plaque complexity in a zzso zzso zzso zzso LDL correlated positively with the expression of zzso and zzso suggesting a relation between zzso stress and inflammation in coronary zzso zzso zzso LDL induced further the expression of zzso and zzso in zzso in zzso suggesting a zzso zzso As in the mouse model described above, plaque oxidized LDL correlated zzso with zzso expression and zzso inhibited the expression of zzso in zzso in zzso We showed that zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in zzso of obese women at high cardiovascular risk and that weight loss was associated with a zzso decrease of their zzso This suggests that the zzso factor zzso has an zzso effect by inducing zzso zzso The increased expression of zzso and zzso were observed in the absence of an increase in zzso but in the presence of an increase in zzso Interestingly, the expression of zzso correlated also with that of zzso suggesting that it has an zzso effect by inducing the expression of an zzso zzso How zzso prevents this increase remains to be zzso How we plan to do this is explained in the next zzso In aggregate, our studies contributed to a better understanding of the relationships between zzso syndrome, insulin zzso zzso stress and inflammation and zzso We identified zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as possible targets for zzso
