The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk factors of mild cognitive impairment zzso in middle-aged patients with type 2 diabetes zzso 

Montreal zzso Assessment zzso was applied as zzso assessment zzso One hundred and zzso middle-aged type 2 diabetic patients were enrolled in this zzso study (age zzso mean age 55 zzso zzso There were 93 patients with zzso zzso zzso in zzso group and 64 with normal cognitive function zzso score zzso 26) in control zzso Information of history of disease, family history, data of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blood zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and carotid ultrasound zzso zzso carotid resistance index zzso was zzso 

There were significant differences in the rate of patients with hypertension zzso zzso zzso zzso duration of diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso y zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Max zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and no significant differences in the duration of hypertension and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and blood zzso between control group and zzso zzso zzso scores were positively correlated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso correlated with the history of hypertension zzso zzso duration of zzso zzso zzso Max zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Multiple zzso analysis showed that history of hypertension zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly independent zzso for the zzso zzso 

The longer duration of diabetes, history of hypertension, lower serum zzso levels, thickened zzso and higher zzso could be risk factors of zzso in type 2 diabetic zzso This finding could have an important impact on the management of cognitive decline in diabetic zzso
