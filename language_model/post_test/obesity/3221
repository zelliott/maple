The zzso zzso an zzso strain of zzso origin, is presented both as an zzso rat and as a relevant model of successful zzso In the present study, we examined throughout zzso the breathing pattern and the zzso response to zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed by whole body zzso in resting condition and during a hypoxic challenge zzso zzso at 2, 6, 12 and 24 months of zzso zzso rats maintained constant their resting ventilation rate throughout zzso while zzso rats tended to decrease their ventilation with advancing zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso rats increased their frequency rather than their tidal volume in response to zzso As zzso rats did not develop zzso zzso per zzso zzso the effect of fat zzso and prevents old rats to zzso their tidal volume in response to zzso
