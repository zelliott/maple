The aim of this study was to clarify the zzso zzso that are associated with zzso feeding in zzso zzso zzso Diabetes zzso mice, a model of type 2 diabetes with zzso zzso zzso mice showed an increase in body weight and zzso from 1 month of age and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from 3 to 12 months of age compared with zzso zzso control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso level of zzso zzso the precursor of the zzso zzso zzso was significantly decreased in the zzso of zzso mice compared with that in zzso mice from 3 to 12 months of zzso The protein level of zzso was significantly decreased in the zzso of zzso mice compared with that in zzso mice at 3 months of zzso The zzso levels of zzso zzso hormone, zzso Y, and zzso were significantly changed in the zzso in zzso mice at several time zzso Another model of type 2 diabetes, zzso mice, which is a zzso mouse that lacks a functional zzso zzso showed zzso feeding but no change in zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso control zzso zzso The results suggest that the disrupted control of zzso zzso signaling may contribute to zzso feeding in zzso zzso In addition, the mechanism for the development of zzso feeding in zzso mice is different than that in zzso zzso
