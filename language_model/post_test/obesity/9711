To determine whether, and to what extent, physical activity interventions affect the overall activity levels of zzso 

zzso review and zzso 

Electronic databases zzso zzso zzso zzso and reference lists of included studies and of relevant review zzso 

Design: zzso controlled trials or controlled clinical trials zzso and zzso published in peer reviewed zzso 

incorporated a component designed to increase the physical activity of zzso and was at least four weeks in zzso 

measured whole day physical activity zzso with zzso either before or immediately after the end of the intervention zzso 

zzso effects zzso mean zzso were calculated for total physical activity, time spent in moderate or vigorous physical activity, or both for each study and pooled using a weighted random effects zzso zzso explored the zzso of intervention effects in relation to study participants, design, intervention type, and zzso zzso 

Thirty studies zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso measured physical zzso met the inclusion criteria and all were eligible for zzso The pooled intervention effect across all studies was small to negligible for total physical activity zzso mean difference zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso zzso and small for moderate or vigorous activity zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso indicated that the pooled intervention effect did not differ significantly between any of the zzso (for example, for total physical activity, zzso mean differences were zzso for age zzso years and zzso for zzso 10 years, zzso zzso for body mass index across the entire range and zzso for exclusively zzso children, zzso zzso for study duration zzso 6 months and zzso zzso months, zzso zzso for zzso based intervention and zzso for school based intervention, zzso and zzso for higher quality studies and zzso for lower quality studies, zzso 

This review provides strong evidence that physical activity interventions have had only a small effect zzso 4 minutes more walking or running per day) on children's overall activity zzso This finding may explain, in part, why such interventions have had limited success in reducing the body mass index or body fat of zzso
