zzso is an increasing burden affecting developed and emerging societies since it is associated with an increased risk of diabetes and zzso cardiovascular zzso zzso evidence points towards a pivotal role of inflammation in the zzso of vascular zzso Our study aimed to investigate signs of inflammation and their relation to vascular dysfunction in rats receiving a high fat zzso 

zzso obese zzso rats were used as a model since these rats exhibit a human zzso zzso zzso zzso and insulin tolerance tests were conducted on zzso rats and their controls prior to the development of insulin zzso Furthermore, the plasma contents of selected zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the concentration of zzso were zzso Using wire zzso we tested the vascular function of isolated small zzso zzso 

zzso animals had significantly zzso zzso increased body weight zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso and zzso controls zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as a significant increase zzso zzso in body fat percentage zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso No significant difference in zzso plasma insulin levels could be detected between the two groups zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso high zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly elevated in zzso animals zzso zzso as compared to zzso zzso levels were also significantly increased zzso zzso in zzso rats zzso zzso zzso zzso versus controls zzso zzso zzso zzso No difference in vascular or zzso function was evident as determined by responses to zzso sodium zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso rats, which have not yet developed zzso or zzso zzso the levels of inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso are significantly increased without zzso vascular zzso The results show that inflammation and obesity are tightly zzso and that inflammation is zzso prior to significant insulin resistance and vascular zzso
