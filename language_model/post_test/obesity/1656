zzso asthma has been proposed to be a distinct entity, differing in immune zzso from zzso zzso Both zzso inflammation and increase in zzso are potential zzso factors that are poorly defined among zzso We hypothesized that pediatric zzso asthma would be characterized by T helper zzso 1, rather than the zzso polarization associated with zzso zzso Moreover, we speculated that zzso zzso and zzso measures would correlate with pulmonary function tests zzso in obese zzso zzso 

We recruited 120 children, with 30 in each of the four study groups: obese zzso children, zzso zzso children, obese zzso children, and zzso zzso zzso All children underwent pulmonary function zzso Blood was collected for measurement of serum zzso zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso were obtained by flow zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso within the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso children had significantly higher zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and lower zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso and D zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso patterns did not differ between obese zzso children and obese zzso zzso zzso zzso children had lower zzso zzso zzso and residual zzso lung capacity ratios zzso zzso compared with the other study groups, which zzso correlated with serum zzso protein 10 and zzso levels, zzso zzso however, did not correlate with zzso zzso score or waist to hip zzso 

We found that pediatric zzso asthma differed from zzso asthma and was characterized by zzso zzso The altered immune environment zzso correlated with zzso in obese zzso zzso
