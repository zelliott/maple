Acute zzso of G zzso zzso 40 zzso by free fatty acids zzso or synthetic zzso zzso enhances insulin zzso However, it is still a matter of debate whether zzso of zzso would be beneficial for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, since chronic exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso We sought to evaluate the specific role of zzso in zzso and its potential as a therapeutic target using compounds that specifically activate zzso 

We developed a series of zzso zzso zzso and studied their acute and chronic effects on zzso insulin zzso zzso in isolated zzso as well as effects on blood zzso levels during zzso zzso tolerance tests in zzso and zzso knockout mice zzso 

zzso zzso zzso significantly enhanced zzso in isolated zzso and improved zzso tolerance in zzso mice but not in zzso zzso While a zzso exposure to zzso in tissue culture significantly impaired zzso in zzso from both zzso and zzso mice, similar exposure to the zzso zzso did not impair zzso in zzso from zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso enhanced insulin zzso in zzso zzso from zzso zzso diabetic rats and improved zzso levels in mice with high-fat zzso obesity acutely and zzso 

zzso does not mediate the chronic toxic effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso may zzso zzso in humans and be beneficial for overall zzso control in patients with type 2 zzso
