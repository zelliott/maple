The oxygen transporting capacity and the zzso capacity of the zzso zzso muscle were followed in parallel in 9 zzso zzso men during a low intensity training zzso zzso were made at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 30 zzso zzso oxygen zzso increased in an approximately linear fashion during the first 12 weeks zzso but decreased a little zzso during the following 18 zzso Mean body weight decreased zzso zzso zzso during the zzso The distribution of muscle zzso types, including the zzso of type II zzso did not zzso Muscle zzso activities remained essentially unchanged during the zzso It was concluded that zzso zzso zzso adaptation need not occur in zzso and that the leg oxygen zzso capacity probably does not limit the whole body's zzso oxygen zzso
