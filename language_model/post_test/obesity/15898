The dramatic increase in the number of obese and overweight persons has spurred interest in control of zzso body weight, and zzso zzso is the zzso component of a negative feedback loop between zzso tissue and zzso zzso is zzso from fat in proportion to the degree of zzso is transported across the zzso barrier zzso and acts in the brain to decrease appetite and increase zzso actions that ultimately decrease zzso However, zzso fails as an zzso because zzso resistance arises in zzso The zzso zzso is the first part of the feedback loop to fail, producing the so called zzso zzso to zzso In this sense, obesity is a disease of the zzso Failure of zzso as an zzso raises the question of what its primary role is as does its effects on zzso bone, zzso breathing, zzso and zzso zzso analysis shows that the zzso zzso performs most efficiently at low serum levels of zzso suggesting that the feedback loop evolved to operate at lower zzso levels than those seen in ideal body zzso We suggest that low levels of serum zzso inform the brain that zzso reserves are adequate to zzso calories on functions other than zzso such as reproduction and the immune zzso This feedback loop is short-circuited when an animal enters zzso zzso of zzso include decreased zzso of zzso by zzso tissue and zzso zzso inhibit the transport of zzso across the zzso thus attenuating the zzso signal across the zzso and providing a mechanism for peripheral zzso zzso zzso are elevated in both zzso and zzso We zzso that zzso evolved as a zzso signal to the brain that acts in part to inhibit the transport of the zzso across the zzso The zzso of obesity zzso this aspect of the zzso response, inducing zzso resistance at the zzso Thus, the zzso plays important roles in both obesity and zzso
