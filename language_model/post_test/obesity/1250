The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between zzso status and plasma levels of both zzso and zzso factors in men, irrespective of zzso body fat distribution, and zzso zzso zzso apparently healthy men, 40 with a body mass index zzso greater than 25 zzso zzso and obese zzso and 24 non-obese controls with a zzso less than 25, were selected and evaluated for zzso plasma zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso von zzso factor zzso zzso zzso activity, and factor zzso zzso as the zzso zzso zzso plasma levels of tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso protein C, and zzso III as the zzso zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso of insulin and zzso and the zzso pattern zzso zzso and total and zzso zzso zzso zzso as the zzso zzso and zzso free testosterone zzso zzso zzso zzso and sex zzso zzso zzso serum levels as the parameters of zzso Body fat distribution was evaluated by the waist to hip ratio zzso In zzso and non-obese subjects taken together, plasma levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso r zzso zzso P zzso and r zzso zzso P zzso respectively), and the negative relationships of both zzso and zzso with zzso were maintained after zzso multiple zzso zzso Plasma zzso of zzso zzso and zzso activity were also zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and r zzso zzso P zzso respectively), and these associations held irrespective of the other parameters zzso None of the zzso and zzso factors were independently related to serum zzso zzso zzso with a zzso higher than 25 zzso had higher plasma zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso as compared with non-obese controls zzso zzso P zzso and P zzso zzso In addition, in zzso and control subjects as a whole, multiple zzso zzso analysis showed that the associations of zzso with zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity were independent of any other zzso and hormonal zzso Plasma zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso were also directly correlated with zzso in all subjects taken together, irrespective of the other parameters zzso zzso of zzso factors showed that zzso subjects had higher zzso plasma zzso than non-obese controls zzso zzso whereas protein C and zzso III did not differ in the two zzso zzso was also directly correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso in all zzso The results of this study indicate that zzso men with lower zzso serum levels have higher zzso and zzso plasma zzso and those with lower zzso serum levels also have higher levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso irrespective of other factors, obesity per zzso may account for higher zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso plasma levels of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso correlate independently with zzso and zzso among the investigated zzso factors zzso zzso protein C, zzso zzso only zzso zzso plasma zzso are higher in men with abdominal zzso Thus, because of the increase in several zzso factors, men with central zzso particularly those with lower zzso seem to be at greater risk for coronary heart disease zzso Apparently, this risk is not zzso by a parallel increase in plasma zzso of zzso zzso
