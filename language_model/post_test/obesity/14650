The zzso effects of zzso including insulin sensitivity, seem to become stronger with increasing zzso zzso may also affect the relationship of zzso zzso with serum zzso zzso markers of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso fat zzso 

We measured plasma zzso zzso serum zzso and serum markers of zzso zzso and zzso function in 242 Caucasians without type 2 zzso We also measured visceral zzso tissue with magnetic resonance zzso and liver and zzso fat with zzso magnetic resonance zzso 

We divided the study participants into 2 groups: lean zzso zzso total body fat, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the obese group, plasma zzso zzso showed a strong positive association with zzso of HDL cholesterol zzso zzso and negative associations with LDL cholesterol, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6, zzso zzso soluble zzso soluble vascular cellular zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso inhibitor 1, zzso count, and liver and zzso fat (all P zzso In the lean group, zzso showed a less strong association with HDL cholesterol zzso zzso zzso and liver fat zzso zzso zzso and no significant associations with the other variables (all zzso High visceral zzso tissue was a strong predictor of low zzso zzso particularly in the obese group, and attenuated many of the significant zzso 

High zzso plasma zzso are associated with favorable zzso profiles, decreased zzso zzso decreased markers of zzso and zzso function, and low zzso fat zzso particularly in obese zzso zzso may also have a zzso effect on the relationship between visceral zzso tissue and these zzso zzso especially in obese zzso
