The development of a zzso taste zzso zzso was assessed in rats made zzso with zzso knife cuts in the zzso zzso zzso The animals were water deprived and presented with a zzso zzso solution paired with injections of either zzso zzso or sodium zzso In zzso 1, zzso rats tested at a zzso weight level did not differ from zzso control rats in the acquisition and extinction of the zzso In zzso 2, moderately obese zzso rats displayed a stronger zzso than did zzso control rats as evidenced by a slower rate of zzso This effect was not due to the higher absolute dose of zzso given to the obese zzso zzso A second group of obese zzso rats given an amount of zzso equivalent to that given to the control rats also displayed retarded extinction of the zzso The results of these experiments demonstrate that zzso knife cuts do not alter aversive taste conditioning in rats but that zzso obesity does enhance zzso taste zzso This may reflect an zzso suppression in zzso zzso
