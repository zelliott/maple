Over the past 250 years, human life expectancy has increased dramatically and continues to do so in most countries zzso zzso factors account for about one third of variation in life expectancy so that most zzso variation in lifespan is explained by zzso and environmental zzso The zzso process is plastic and is driven by the zzso of molecular damage causing the changes in cell and tissue function which zzso the zzso zzso Early life zzso mark the developing zzso zzso and child with potentially profound implications for the zzso zzso zzso zzso factors including age, smoking, socioeconomic status, infections, nutritional status and season of birth influence offspring life expectancy and the development of age-related zzso Although the zzso processes responsible are poorly zzso many of these factors appear to affect zzso growth directly or via effects on zzso zzso Those born relatively small zzso which did not achieve their genetic potential in zzso appear to be at greatest disadvantage especially if they become overweight or obese in zzso Early life events and zzso which enhance zzso are likely to contribute to molecular damage and/or reduce the repair of such zzso Such molecular damage may produce immediate defects in cellular or tissue function that are retained into later zzso In addition, there is growing evidence that early life zzso produce zzso patterns of zzso marks that are sustained across the zzso and result in zzso of cell zzso zzso
