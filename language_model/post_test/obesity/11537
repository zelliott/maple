To compare changes over time in waist circumference (a measure of central zzso and body mass index (a measure of overall zzso in British zzso 

Representative cross zzso surveys in 1977, 1987, and zzso 

Great zzso 

Young people aged zzso years surveyed in 1977 zzso and 1987 zzso for the British zzso Institute zzso and in 1997 (both zzso for the national diet and nutrition survey zzso 

zzso zzso expressed as a standard zzso score using the first survey as reference, and body mass index zzso expressed as a standard zzso score against the British 1990 revised zzso zzso and obesity were defined as the measurement exceeding the 91st and 98th zzso zzso 

zzso circumference increased sharply over the period between surveys zzso increases for boys and girls, zzso and zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso score units, zzso In zzso terms, waist circumference increased more in girls than in zzso zzso in body mass index were smaller and similar by sex zzso zzso and zzso or zzso and zzso zzso score units, zzso zzso circumference in 1997 exceeded the 91st zzso in zzso zzso of boys and 38% zzso of girls (against zzso for both sexes in zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, exceeded the 98th zzso zzso in zzso zzso The corresponding rates for body mass index in 1997 were zzso zzso of boys and zzso zzso of girls exceeding the 91st zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso exceeding the 98th zzso zzso and zzso in zzso 

Trends in waist circumference during the past zzso years have greatly exceeded those in body mass index, particularly in girls, showing that body mass index is a poor proxy for central zzso Body mass index has therefore systematically underestimated the prevalence of obesity in young zzso
