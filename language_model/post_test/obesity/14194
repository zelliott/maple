The aim of the present study was to describe a large cohort of zzso pulmonary zzso hypertension zzso and its possible zzso zzso The records of all patients with a diagnosis of zzso evaluated at the present zzso zzso from zzso were zzso zzso zzso clinical and zzso data were collected, as well as survival zzso The median duration of zzso exposure was 6 months, with a median of zzso zzso between exposure and onset of zzso Nine zzso out of 40 patients evaluated resulted positive for the presence of zzso bone zzso protein zzso zzso type 2 zzso In these patients, the duration of exposure to zzso was significantly lower than in patients without zzso The median survival was zzso zzso without significant difference between zzso and a control group of idiopathic and familial pulmonary zzso hypertension patients referred to the present zzso zzso during the same time frame and treated zzso zzso of zzso exposure showed no relation to survival, while cardiac index was the only independent predictor of zzso zzso zzso pulmonary zzso hypertension shares clinical, functional, zzso and genetic features with idiopathic pulmonary zzso hypertension, as well as overall survival zzso zzso the present authors conclude that zzso exposure zzso a potent trigger for pulmonary zzso hypertension without influencing its clinical zzso
