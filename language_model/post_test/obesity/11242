zzso is associated with zzso zzso zzso activity, apparently linked to zzso zzso which may repress or zzso the zzso The reduction of zzso activity in cardiac tissue zzso zzso death and cardiac dysfunction, leading to the development of zzso zzso in animal zzso this has also been documented in patients with heart failure zzso During several pathological situations zzso zzso and zzso and in experimental models zzso the heart becomes more sensitive to the effect of cardiac zzso due to a decrease in zzso zzso The primary female sex steroid zzso has long been recognized to be important in a wide variety of zzso zzso Numerous studies, including zzso have shown that zzso is one of the major factors controlling the activity and expression of zzso in the cardiovascular zzso zzso However, the effects of zzso on zzso in both normal and pathological conditions, such as zzso remain zzso zzso our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which zzso mediates its effects on zzso function may help to develop new strategies for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso we discuss the latest data from animal and clinical studies that have examined how zzso conditions such as obesity and the action of zzso regulate zzso zzso
