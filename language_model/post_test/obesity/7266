To examine the degree to which 2 commonly used measures of pain and zzso the Arthritis Impact zzso zzso zzso and the Western Ontario and zzso Universities zzso Index zzso relate to objective gait zzso 

A descriptive study of the influence of zzso pain and perceived functional impairment on gait mechanics in zzso zzso 

A university clinical research zzso 

zzso adults with zzso knee zzso zzso as well as pain and disability associated with the disease zzso 

Not zzso 

The zzso and zzso were administered to determine self-report measures of pain and zzso zzso stride zzso support time, knee angle, and peak vertical force zzso were determined from zzso zzso and kinetic data collected on subjects walking at self-selected normal and fast zzso zzso data and zzso levels of zzso were also zzso 

zzso correlation analysis showed that the zzso physical disability score was zzso correlated with speed, stride zzso and knee range of motion at both speeds and zzso at the fast zzso The zzso function score was zzso correlated with speed and stride length at both speeds and with zzso at fast zzso The zzso pain score was zzso correlated with speed and zzso at the fast zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso physical disability score and body mass index accounted for the greatest variation in speed at the normal zzso Overall, zzso physical disability and zzso function explained a larger proportion of zzso in gait mechanics than zzso measures of zzso disease zzso 

Taken together, the results suggest that the zzso physical disability and zzso function scores are associated with some important measures of gait zzso
