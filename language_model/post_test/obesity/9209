This study attempted to identify the cardiovascular risk factors associated with retention of excess weight following termination of zzso therapy in children with zzso zzso 

We performed a retrospective study of 30 Japanese children (18 zzso 12 zzso aged zzso who had been treated with zzso for zzso zzso syndrome and 32 control children (17 zzso 15 zzso aged zzso The subjects receiving zzso therapy were divided into a retention group zzso or a reduction group zzso on the basis of the presence or absence of a maintained body mass index zzso following zzso zzso zzso zzso age, zzso blood pressure, serum total cholesterol levels zzso and the dose and duration of zzso exposure were evaluated in each group during the study zzso 

The retention group had a significantly zzso increased dose and duration of zzso exposure, and of zzso at the time of last visit compared with the control or reduction zzso Moreover, zzso zzso analysis showed that the adjusted odds ratio for zzso at the time of last visit in the retention group was significantly higher zzso relative to the reduction zzso 

zzso of excess weight during the period of zzso from zzso syndrome following zzso of zzso therapy was related to the dose and duration of zzso exposure and was associated with zzso which might enhance cardiovascular zzso
