The present study investigated the potential of a wild blueberry zzso diet to improve blood zzso profile and zzso the expression of genes related to zzso zzso in obese zzso rats zzso a model of the zzso syndrome with severe zzso For this purpose, zzso zzso and zzso lean zzso rats zzso zzso were placed either on a control zzso or an zzso zzso diet for 8 zzso Plasma total cholesterol zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso The relative expression of six genes involved in zzso metabolism was also determined in both the liver and the abdominal zzso tissue zzso Plasma zzso and zzso zzso were significantly lower in the zzso following zzso consumption zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso than in those on the C diet zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso while there was no change in zzso zzso No significant effects were observed for plasma lipids in the zzso Following zzso consumption, the expression of the zzso factors zzso and zzso in the zzso was increased in the zzso while that of zzso regulatory zzso protein 1 zzso was decreased in the liver and zzso The expression of fatty acid zzso was significantly decreased in both the liver and zzso and that of zzso cassette zzso 1 was increased in the zzso following zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso consumption appears to improve zzso profiles and zzso the expression of key zzso and zzso factors of zzso metabolism in severely zzso zzso
