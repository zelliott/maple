To investigate the effect of obesity and hypertension on left zzso zzso mass in children, we performed zzso and measured the zzso weight, and blood pressure of 267 healthy children (145 boys and 122 zzso aged 12 zzso The percentage of body fat was estimated using zzso zzso to derive the total zzso weight and lean body zzso zzso zzso of zzso parameters were obtained from zzso zzso The zzso mass was calculated by using the formula of zzso et zzso A strong positive correlation was demonstrated between zzso zzso mass and height or other measures of body zzso zzso blood pressure was zzso correlated with zzso zzso mass in zzso The impact of height on zzso mass differed between boys and zzso Thus, different zzso formulas to zzso the zzso mass for height were determined, using the height to the zzso and zzso powers for boys and girls, zzso zzso analysis revealed that only total zzso weight affected the zzso zzso mass, and that the effect of total zzso weight was greater in girls than in zzso The obese children had a significantly greater zzso zzso mass than the zzso zzso The increase in the zzso mass due to obesity appeared to be zzso because of the lack of an association between the zzso of obesity and relative wall zzso Our data indicate that appropriate zzso of zzso mass is necessary for each study population, and that zzso zzso due to obesity begins in zzso
