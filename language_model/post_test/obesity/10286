To assess the long-term impact of zzso during specific periods of fetal life, upon central zzso control of feeding zzso and locomotor zzso 

zzso rats were fed a control or zzso zzso diet, targeted to early zzso mid zzso or late zzso pregnancy or throughout gestation zzso The offspring were studied at 9 and 18 months of zzso 

zzso was assessed by measuring weight of abdominal fat zzso relative to body zzso zzso activity was assessed using an infrared sensor array system in both light and dark zzso zzso expression of zzso for zzso and the zzso 2 zzso zzso was determined using real-time zzso 

At 9 months, male rats exposed to LP in zzso had less fat in the zzso zzso but were of similar body weight to zzso By 18 months, the males of groups zzso and zzso had more abdominal and less subcutaneous zzso zzso deposited more fat centrally than males between 9 and 18 months of age, and this was more marked in groups zzso and zzso Food intake was greater in zzso zzso Among females zzso was noted in groups zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were unaffected by maternal zzso Total locomotor activity was reduced in zzso males and all LP females in the light but not in the zzso 

zzso activity and feeding zzso in aged rats are subject to prenatal programming zzso Fetal zzso does not zzso obesity in rats without zzso dietary zzso
