Numerous signals convey information about body fat status from the periphery to the brain areas that control energy zzso so that, throughout life, body weight remains nearly zzso These signals mainly zzso either from the zzso zzso like zzso and to a lesser extent zzso 6, or from the zzso like insulin and zzso These factors circulate in proportion to body fat mass and they are referred to as zzso zzso It is well established, at least for zzso and insulin, that they enter the brain from the plasma where they zzso a network of important zzso regulators of energy intake and zzso zzso these zzso signals, a growing amount of literature show data relative to zzso zzso most of them belonging to the zzso family, like zzso zzso zzso zzso whose zzso also zzso with body fat mass and that may locally regulate fat mass zzso Others, like zzso are zzso correlated with body fat zzso These zzso zzso have already been involved in insulin resistance associated with obesity and inflammatory zzso They may participate to a complex zzso organ zzso In this review, we will zzso data relative to the role played by insulin, zzso and zzso either alone or through a cross talk, in zzso level zzso at the brain zzso Furthermore, we will develop how zzso zzso through their zzso and/or zzso action may contribute to maintain fat mass expansion, therefore representing new zzso molecules per zzso Lastly, since any distortion in the zzso zzso of energy zzso is susceptible to lead to a pathological status like zzso the impact of known genetic zzso in genes zzso the zzso signals will be zzso
