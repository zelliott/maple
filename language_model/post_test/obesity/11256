To report the feasibility of a novel robotic technique for zzso construction of a double zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso in an adult zzso 

The zzso procedure can be considered as an alternative to zzso zzso when the appendix is not available or in obese zzso To date, the robotic approach has not been zzso We have described all the steps of our surgery, performed on a 35-year-old obese patient with post-traumatic zzso and a zzso zzso We focused on the technical tips and highlighted all the differences with the standard open zzso 

Our technique provided satisfactory zzso No zzso complications zzso The operative time was 250 minutes, and the zzso blood loss was 200 zzso The clinical course was zzso 

We have shown that robotic zzso realization of a double zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso is zzso extending the potential indications of zzso zzso The evaluation of more cases is zzso
