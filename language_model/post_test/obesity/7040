To investigate the effect of high-fat diet on expressions of zzso zzso Y zzso and zzso zzso zzso receptors and the mechanism relative to the zzso of zzso 

zzso female zzso rats were randomly divided into high-fat diet group zzso zzso and zzso food group zzso zzso and given either zzso or zzso diet for 13 zzso Then the zzso diet group was subdivided into dietary induced zzso zzso and dietary induced obesity resistant zzso rat according to the final body zzso Body weight, caloric zzso energy efficiency, visceral fat pads were measured and zzso The levels of plasma and zzso zzso were determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to measure the gene expression of zzso and its receptors in zzso 

Body weight, caloric zzso energy efficiency and visceral fat pads in zzso rats were higher significantly than those in zzso or zzso rats zzso No difference in plasma zzso level was detected among the three groups zzso the zzso zzso level was significantly higher in zzso group than in zzso or zzso group zzso Gene expression levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso receptors were higher significantly in zzso group than in zzso or zzso group zzso while no significant difference was found between zzso and zzso rats zzso except that zzso zzso was lower in zzso rats zzso 

zzso rat fed with a zzso diet showed different zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expressions were closely associated with being predisposed to obesity and zzso of zzso zzso
