Various prospective studies have found that lean zzso patients have greater cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than obese zzso zzso It was therefore hypothesized that hypertension is more benign when associated with zzso In the present study, we evaluated effects of obesity on early target organ damage in patients with essential zzso 

In a total of zzso subjects, systemic and zzso zzso as well as left zzso structure and function were assessed by measuring cardiac output zzso green dye zzso zzso blood flow zzso of zzso zzso zzso and mean zzso pressure zzso and by zzso guided zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso vascular resistance, compliance of the large arteries evaluated by the stroke zzso pressure index, and left zzso mass served as parameters for early target organ zzso All individuals were zzso into four groups: lean and obese zzso as well as lean and obese zzso zzso In obese zzso patients, total peripheral resistance was significantly lower and stroke zzso pressure index was higher than in the lean zzso group, almost reaching values of zzso control zzso No effect of obesity on the zzso circulation was noted, whereas in hypertension, zzso vascular resistance was zzso The degree of left zzso zzso was more pronounced in the zzso groups than in their zzso counterparts and progressively increased with zzso Nevertheless, in obese zzso patients, left zzso function, as measured by fractional fiber zzso and zzso of zzso fiber zzso was maintained despite the fact that the heart had been exposed to the double burden of an increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso had a disparate effect on target zzso in zzso At rest, obesity seemed to mitigate cardiovascular changes in the systemic vascular bed caused by zzso However, no such zzso was observed in the zzso zzso and left zzso zzso was even exacerbated by the presence of zzso Our findings in part zzso the concept that obesity is able to exert a protective effect on early target organ damage in zzso patients and, in particular, on the zzso
