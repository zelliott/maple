To explore the relationship between obesity and zzso asthma by observing the expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in airway smooth muscle cells zzso of obese rats with zzso 

Sixty rats were randomly divided into 4 groups, 2 groups with normal zzso control group zzso zzso zzso group zzso B), and 2 groups with zzso control group zzso zzso zzso group zzso zzso The trachea smooth muscle was obtained from the rats of each group, and zzso were isolated, zzso and cultured in zzso Then the expression of zzso zzso was measured by zzso and the levels of zzso and zzso proteins were measured by Western zzso 

The expression of zzso zzso in airway smooth muscle cells in group B, C and D were higher than that in group A, while it in group D was significantly higher than group B and zzso What's more, the levels of zzso and zzso proteins increased in group B, C and D as compared with group A, and were significantly higher in group D than in group B and C, zzso 

The increased expressions of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso of obese rats with asthma may play a role in the onset of obese asthma and zzso zzso
