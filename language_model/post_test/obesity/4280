The purpose of the study was to evaluate the dynamics of zzso and zzso function from rest to zzso exercise using conventional zzso and tissue zzso imaging zzso in obese zzso boys compared to zzso lean zzso zzso obese (10 with first degree obesity and 8 with second degree obesity according to French curves, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and 17 lean controls zzso zzso zzso aged zzso years were zzso After resting zzso all children performed a zzso exercise zzso Regional zzso and zzso zzso zzso were acquired at rest and each zzso Stroke volume and cardiac output were zzso At rest, obese boys had greater left zzso zzso diameters and zzso zzso Boys in the first degree group showed no zzso or zzso dysfunction, whereas boys with second degree obesity showed subtle zzso zzso During exercise, both obese groups showed greater stroke volume and cardiac zzso First degree obese boys exhibited greater zzso and zzso tissue zzso zzso than controls, whereas second degree obese boys had lower zzso tissue zzso irrespective of exercise intensity and lower fractional zzso at high exercise zzso than zzso In conclusion, no impairment in zzso or zzso function is noticed in zzso boys with first degree of zzso zzso regional zzso function response to exercise was also demonstrated in this population, suggesting zzso zzso cardiac changes in mild zzso However, when obesity becomes more zzso impaired global and regional cardiac function at rest and during exercise can be zzso
