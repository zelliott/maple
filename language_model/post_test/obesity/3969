The purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of diet and zzso on zzso zzso Diet did not affect zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso when expressed as zzso atoms of oxygen consumed per minute per zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, diet did not affect zzso zzso zzso rate, zzso zzso production, or zzso zzso zzso specific zzso When the data for zzso zzso were expressed per gram liver, the rates were significantly lower in rats fed the high fat diet of zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA content zzso indicated that cell size rather than cell number contributed to greater total liver weight in rats fed the zzso high fat zzso In both stock zzso controls and rats fed the zzso high fat diet, zzso protein per gram liver decreased with duration of zzso zzso zzso zzso was unchanged by diet or zzso Thus, neither diet nor diet followed by zzso altered zzso zzso capacity to zzso zzso zzso
