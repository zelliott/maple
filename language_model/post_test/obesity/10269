Women with a history of zzso diabetes zzso are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes zzso zzso later in life, and therefore at increased risk for future cardiovascular zzso 

Three months after delivery we investigated the plasma levels of zzso zzso inhibitor type 1 zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso and von zzso factor zzso in 74 women with zzso and 20 healthy females with normal zzso tolerance during and after pregnancy, as well as the relation of zzso parameters to insulin resistance and zzso zzso All women underwent an oral zzso as well as an intravenous zzso tolerance test zzso zzso model analysis disclosed that 50% zzso each) of the zzso subjects had normal zzso or impaired zzso insulin zzso zzso of interest were determined using commercially available test zzso 

Women with zzso and zzso had significantly increased body fat mass zzso zzso compared with women with zzso and zzso and controls, whereas the waist to hip ratio zzso was similar in both zzso groups but was higher compared with the controls zzso Mean zzso and zzso as well as zzso and zzso plasma zzso of zzso zzso and insulin were zzso whereas the disposition index was lower in women with zzso and zzso compared with women with zzso and zzso and the controls zzso Plasma levels of zzso and zzso did not differ between the zzso zzso women with zzso had higher zzso levels than lean women with zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with the insulin sensitivity index zzso but only in women with zzso zzso On zzso analysis, only zzso zzso and zzso remained significant independent zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso The zzso ratio was elevated in women with zzso independently of their zzso tolerance status zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso inhibitor type 1 is elevated in zzso women with zzso and depends on plasma zzso and abdominal zzso An increase of the zzso ratio further characterizes obese zzso zzso women who may be at risk for diabetes and zzso
