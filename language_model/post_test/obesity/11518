This study investigates the effects of zzso a selective zzso zzso zzso that reduces food intake and body weight of zzso on zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso a plasma protein exclusively expressed and zzso by zzso zzso has been shown to induce free fatty acid zzso zzso and zzso decrease, and body weight zzso We report that zzso zzso zzso treatment once daily (10 zzso zzso from 2 to 14 days reduced body weight and zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso tissue of obese zzso zzso zzso In zzso the zzso associated with this animal model was reduced by zzso zzso In cultured mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to 100 zzso also induced an zzso of zzso zzso and zzso In addition, in zzso tissue of zzso knockout mice, zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso demonstrating a zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis revealed that rat zzso tissue and zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso Relative zzso of this expression revealed an zzso zzso to zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso tissue of obese zzso rats and in differentiated zzso zzso zzso compared with lean rats and zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis revealed the presence of zzso receptors in zzso zzso zzso and their expression was zzso in differentiated zzso These results show that zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso tissue by an effect on zzso and reduced zzso in obese zzso zzso These hormonal regulations may participate in the body weight reduction induced by zzso and suggest a role of zzso regulation in the zzso effect of zzso
