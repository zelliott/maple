To examine the association of zzso with weight and waist circumference zzso changes, we compared women with and without zzso or zzso during zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso study over 10 zzso zzso groups defined by the number of zzso and zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso B1 (1 zzso and B2 zzso zzso Mean changes in weight and zzso for zzso B1 and B2 groups vs zzso were examined separately by race zzso and zzso baseline parity zzso and zzso and baseline weight status zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso sample of zzso women aged zzso y at baseline zzso black subjects and zzso white subjects) from Birmingham, Alabama, Chicago, Illinois, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Oakland, California were examined five times between zzso and zzso 

Weight and zzso zzso were obtained using standardized protocol at baseline and examinations at years 2, 5, 7 and zzso zzso zzso and behavioral attributes were assessed at baseline and follow-up zzso 

Gains in weight and zzso associated with pregnancy and zzso varied by race zzso baseline parity zzso and overweight status zzso Among overweight zzso excess gains in weight zzso zzso 3-5 zzso white zzso 5-6 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso white zzso 5-6 zzso were associated with zzso zzso and one or more zzso during follow-up compared to no zzso zzso and zzso Among normal weight zzso excess gains in weight (about 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso were associated with follow-up zzso zzso Among women zzso at zzso no excess weight gains were found, but excess zzso gains zzso zzso were associated with follow-up zzso 

zzso excess weight gain is associated with both short zzso and a first birth in women overweight prior to initiation of zzso Excess weight gain was not associated with higher order zzso zzso in waist zzso were cumulative with both first and higher order zzso among overweight as well as normal weight zzso zzso to prevent obesity should be targeted at women who are overweight prior to initiation of zzso The impact of excess zzso gains associated with zzso on women's future health risk should be evaluated zzso
