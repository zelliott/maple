The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso were examined in lean and obese, zzso to zzso male zzso rat zzso brown zzso tissue zzso zzso pads from obese rats were heavier zzso had more zzso zzso and more zzso and larger zzso zzso than those from lean zzso Also, zzso from obese rats had no zzso cells, and 50% of their zzso zzso were the size of white fat zzso High affinity binding for zzso zzso 15-18 zzso as well as the estimated zzso values for binding and the 1/2 zzso values for zzso zzso zzso were similar in isolated zzso cells from lean and obese zzso However, zzso from zzso in obese rats had zzso fewer high affinity zzso binding sites per cell zzso compared to those in lean zzso These findings are most compatible with the zzso of zzso by white zzso Such zzso would be expected to reduce the overall zzso capacity of zzso in obese zzso rats and thereby contribute to the maintenance of their zzso
