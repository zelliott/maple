To evaluate the relationships between zzso soluble zzso zzso zzso profiles, and zzso gene zzso in child and adolescent Thai zzso 

zzso study of Thai children and zzso 

116 male and 65 female at risk for zzso child and adolescent Thai subjects, and 33 male and 62 female healthy child and adolescent Thai subjects zzso zzso zzso 

zzso levels, soluble zzso zzso levels, zzso profiles, zzso gene zzso 

zzso higher levels of cholesterol, zzso zzso zzso cholesterol zzso and zzso levels were observed in at risk for zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso cholesterol zzso and soluble zzso zzso levels were significantly lower in the same zzso zzso soluble zzso zzso levels were significantly zzso correlated with zzso The at risk for zzso subjects with the zzso zzso wild type zzso gene had significantly higher cholesterol and zzso levels than those with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, subjects with zzso zzso wild type had significantly lower zzso levels than those with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso There was a statistically significant association between body mass index zzso and zzso zzso zzso OR zzso zzso p zzso zzso and females had more increased risk of zzso than males zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso in adolescent Thai zzso 

The present study is the first report of zzso zzso of the zzso gene associated with cholesterol, zzso and zzso levels in Thai children and zzso zzso zzso levels were significantly higher in the at risk for zzso In contrast, there were significantly lower soluble zzso zzso levels in the same zzso In addition, there was a statistically significant association between zzso sex, and zzso in adolescent Thai zzso
