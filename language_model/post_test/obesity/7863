Several small series have had mixed conclusions regarding the impact of obesity on outcomes of trauma zzso The purpose of the present study was to evaluate a large cohort of critically injured patients to better understand the influence of obesity on the outcomes of patients after severe blunt zzso 

zzso review using the trauma registry and intensive care unit zzso database of all blunt trauma patients admitted to the zzso at our urban, Level I trauma center over a zzso period zzso zzso patients zzso mass index zzso or zzso 30 zzso were compared with non-obese patients zzso zzso zzso 

There were zzso blunt trauma patients admitted to the zzso during the study period, including 283 zzso obese zzso zzso zzso 35 zzso 6 zzso and zzso zzso non-obese zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso 3 zzso zzso There was no difference between groups regarding age, sex, zzso zzso zzso or admission zzso zzso patients had fewer head injuries zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso but more chest zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso and lower zzso zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso There was no difference in the need for zzso zzso or zzso zzso patients suffered more complications zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso Although there was only a trend toward higher mortality in obese patients zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed obesity as an independent risk factor for mortality zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso p zzso zzso Among survivors, obese patients required longer stays in the hospital (24 zzso 21 versus 19 zzso 17 zzso p zzso zzso the zzso (13 zzso 14 versus 10 zzso 10 zzso p zzso zzso and 2 more days of mechanical ventilation (8 zzso 13 versus 6 zzso 9 zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso patients incur different injuries after severe blunt trauma than their non-obese zzso Despite sustaining fewer head injuries, obese patients suffer more zzso require longer stays in the hospital, more days of mechanical zzso and obesity is independently associated with zzso
