zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins play a crucial role as signaling molecules in insulin zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins has been hypothesized as a cause of attenuating insulin zzso The current study investigated zzso zzso activity toward zzso in several models of insulin zzso An in zzso zzso zzso was developed that used partially zzso cell zzso as a zzso and zzso zzso fusion proteins that contained various of zzso fragments as zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was detected in Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso chronically treated with insulin, and in liver and muscle of obese zzso zzso It zzso the zzso zzso acid region of zzso whereas zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso acid regions was not zzso zzso mapping of the zzso region of zzso showed three major zzso zzso zzso and zzso with different patterns of zzso depending on the source of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were strongly zzso when the zzso activity was prepared from zzso Chinese zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso by the zzso activity from zzso zzso zzso and barely zzso when the extract was derived from zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was zzso by the zzso zzso activity prepared from all zzso cells and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso can be explained by zzso protein zzso activity based on the zzso map generated by zzso zzso In contrast, zzso protein zzso failed to zzso the zzso zzso suggesting that another zzso zzso regulates this modification of zzso in zzso zzso
