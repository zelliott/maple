zzso insulin resistance in the zzso defective zzso zzso rat is associated with impaired zzso synthesis and increased activity of zzso We investigated the zzso between zzso and zzso synthesis in zzso from zzso rats by modulating the concentration of zzso Treatment of zzso from zzso rats and zzso controls with a selective zzso inhibitor caused depletion of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and stimulation of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso on zzso synthesis was zzso dependent and at 10 zzso zzso was higher in zzso than zzso zzso There was an inverse correlation between the activities of zzso zzso and zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso zzso had a higher activity of zzso for a corresponding activity of zzso zzso This zzso was, in part, zzso by expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso rats had normal expression of the zzso proteins zzso and zzso but markedly reduced expression of zzso zzso of zzso protein was increased in zzso from zzso rats after incubation with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in the zzso defective zzso rat may be a contributing factor to the elevated zzso activity and/or its high control strength on zzso zzso
