zzso is a new oral zzso agent that is reported to be effective in zzso diabetic animal models by improving insulin zzso It also improves zzso We investigated the mechanism of the reversal of zzso in two types of obese animals using zzso In zzso fatty obese rats, an animal model of genetic zzso zzso plasma zzso and zzso significantly decreased after a single daily oral dose of zzso zzso zzso for 7 zzso In zzso zzso zzso obese rats, an animal model of zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso significantly decreased but zzso plasma zzso levels remained unchanged after treatment with this zzso In zzso zzso rats, zzso plasma zzso and zzso levels remained zzso The zzso zzso fatty and zzso obese rats showed a decrease in insulin, but it was not zzso while the treated zzso rats showed a significant decrease in zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso increased significantly in treated zzso fatty obese and zzso rats, but did not change in zzso obese zzso The zzso zzso zzso rate zzso did not change in any species treated with zzso There was a negative correlation between zzso plasma zzso and plasma zzso levels in zzso fatty obese rats, while no such correlation was observed in zzso obese or zzso zzso The fractional zzso rate zzso for plasma zzso was increased significantly by zzso in both zzso fatty and zzso obese zzso These results suggest that zzso decreases plasma zzso mainly by increasing zzso plasma zzso in zzso fatty obese rats, while it ameliorates an impairment in the ability of zzso tissue to remove zzso from the circulation in zzso obese zzso
