zzso is often associated with insulin resistance, zzso systemic zzso and reduced plasma zzso zzso is also increased in zzso zzso but it is not clear whether the reductions of zzso levels are related to zzso of insulin activity and/or increased zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the interactions of insulin, tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso 6 zzso in the regulation of zzso production using in zzso and in zzso zzso Plasma zzso and parameters of insulin resistance and inflammation were assessed in a cohort of lean and obese zzso zzso In addition, the effect of insulin was examined in zzso using the zzso zzso and in zzso tissue zzso zzso Compared with lean subjects, the levels of total zzso and especially the zzso zzso zzso were zzso low in obese zzso zzso The zzso clamp data confirmed the zzso state in the obese patients and showed that insulin infusion significantly increased the plasma zzso in lean but not obese subjects zzso zzso Similarly, insulin increased total zzso release from AT zzso of lean and not obese zzso Moreover, expression and zzso of zzso and zzso increased significantly in AT of obese subjects and were zzso associated with expression and zzso of zzso In zzso and human zzso cultures, insulin strongly enhanced zzso expression zzso and zzso zzso zzso and not zzso strongly opposed the zzso effects of zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso was especially directed toward the zzso zzso of zzso In conclusion, these studies show that insulin zzso zzso expression and release, and that zzso opposes the zzso effects of zzso A combination of insulin resistance and increased zzso production could explain the decline of zzso levels and zzso of zzso composition in plasma of obese zzso zzso
