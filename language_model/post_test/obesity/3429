Previous studies found normal weight compared to zzso adults with type 2 diabetes had a higher mortality risk, and zzso index zzso studies do not typically account for baseline diabetes zzso 

To determine if diabetes influences the zzso zzso 

Using a prospective study design, we analyzed data from a nationally representative sample of US adults participating in the National Health zzso zzso from 1997 to 2002, and followed for mortality through zzso 

Excluding those with heart disease or cancer, our final zzso sample included zzso zzso never zzso zzso 

zzso was calculated from zzso height and zzso Diabetes status was based on zzso diagnosis from a health zzso We used direct age zzso to calculate zzso mortality rates and adjusted Cox models for zzso mortality hazard ratios by zzso zzso this was done separately for adults with diabetes and without zzso 

Among never smokers, mean age was zzso and zzso were zzso Mean zzso was zzso zzso were obese, and zzso zzso reported diagnosed zzso After zzso there were zzso deaths zzso of zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso among zzso participants, and zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso among zzso never zzso We observed a qualitative interaction with diabetes on the zzso relationship zzso Death rates were substantially higher among participants with diabetes compared to those without diabetes across all zzso zzso However, death rates in participants with diabetes fell with increasing zzso zzso while rates followed a zzso curve among those without zzso In adjusted Cox models, zzso was positively associated with mortality in adults without diabetes, but zzso associated with mortality among participants with zzso 

zzso increased with increasing zzso in adults without diabetes, but decreased with increasing zzso among their counterparts with zzso Future studies need to be better designed to answer the question of whether normal weight adults with diabetes have a higher risk of zzso by minimizing the possibility of reverse zzso Future studies should also account for prevalent diabetes in all investigations of the zzso zzso
