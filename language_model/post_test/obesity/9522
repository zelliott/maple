The effect of two experimental zzso designed to mobilize lipids from zzso tissue have been investigated in rats with zzso knife cuts in the zzso zzso zzso Those animals which displayed zzso during the initial 5 days zzso knife cuts were then restricted in food intake to reduce body weights to levels comparable to that of the zzso zzso Two weeks following the zzso zzso or sham operations, animals in the first experiment were exposed to the cold for 60 zzso and those in the second experiment were injected with zzso zzso The injections of zzso increased the level of zzso in the control animals but not in the animals with zzso knife zzso Both groups showed a rise in zzso Plasma insulin and zzso were the same in both zzso Exposure to the cold increased the level of zzso in both zzso The insulin levels were lower in the corresponding groups with knife zzso These studies show that zzso knife cuts do not produce zzso in zzso zzso
