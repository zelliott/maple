zzso is a condition resulting from the interactions of individual biology and environmental factors causing multiple zzso To understand the system's zzso changes associated with the obesity development and zzso we systematically analyzed the dynamic zzso changes induced by a high-fat diet zzso in multiple biological zzso of rats using zzso and zzso zzso Clinical chemistry and zzso data were obtained as complementary zzso We found that zzso zzso caused systematic zzso changes in blood zzso liver, and urine samples involving multiple zzso pathways including zzso zzso cycle, and gut zzso functions together with the zzso of fatty zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso variations were zzso in rat urine a week after zzso intake and showed clear dependence on the intake zzso zzso and gut zzso played important roles in the obesity development and progression together with changes in zzso cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso caused significant zzso zzso in rat liver highlighted with the enhancements in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso suppression of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso together with altered zzso of zzso zzso acids and zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso ratio in both plasma and liver, indicating the zzso zzso zzso These findings provided essential zzso information about the dynamic zzso responses to the development and progression of zzso zzso This study also demonstrated the combined zzso analysis of multiple biological zzso as a powerful approach for understanding the molecular basis of zzso and disease zzso
