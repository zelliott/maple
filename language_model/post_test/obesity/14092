To assess bone mineral content zzso among obese adolescents who lose weight during a critical period for bone zzso 

Whole body, zzso spine, lower, and upper limb zzso were measured in 62 obese adolescents who completed an intensive 12-month weight loss zzso zzso was adjusted for height zzso zzso using data from a reference group of 66 adolescents (who were zzso zzso 

At zzso the zzso of the obese group was higher than the reference zzso During the 12-month weight loss program, zzso zzso increased among the obese zzso despite successful weight zzso After adjustment for zzso whole body zzso did not change significantly from baseline to 12 months zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso however decreased for the lower zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso P zzso and upper zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso but zzso spine zzso increased zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso P zzso These changes were largely and independently explained by changes in lean and fat zzso 

This study confirms that obese adolescents have high zzso for height and suggests that, unlike adults, their zzso continues to increase during weight loss and remains higher than the zzso of a reference zzso After adjustment for zzso changes, lower and upper limb zzso appears to decrease, while zzso spine zzso appears to zzso These results suggest that to zzso the health benefits of weight loss among obese zzso their bone health should be better understood and zzso
