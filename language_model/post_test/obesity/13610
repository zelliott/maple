First, we sought to estimate the magnitude of the zzso associations between zzso and asthma zzso by gender and by zzso hay fever and second we sought to assess both directions of causality in zzso zzso 

We used zzso and zzso data from a zzso cohort study zzso ages zzso at zzso After zzso years, zzso adults were zzso by zzso zzso height and weight were used to calculate body mass index zzso zzso adjusted prevalence ratios zzso relative risks zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso zzso were calculated using zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso adjusted zzso were comparable for overweight women and men but differed between obese women and men zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were similar when zzso by hay zzso zzso analyses suggested that zzso did not increase asthma risk substantially zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but a relation between asthma and subsequent weight gain could not be excluded zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The prevalence of asthma is almost twice as high in obese versus normal weight women, but not in obese zzso The association between zzso and asthma does not vary by hay zzso A zzso relationship between asthma and incident weight gain cannot be zzso
