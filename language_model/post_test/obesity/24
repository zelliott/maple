The effects of obesity and body fat distribution on zzso insulin metabolism and the relationship to peripheral insulin sensitivity were assessed in 6 zzso and 16 obese zzso zzso When compared with the zzso women, obese women had significantly greater zzso production and portal vein levels of insulin both zzso and following zzso zzso This increase correlated with the degree of zzso but not with zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso however, correlated zzso with the zzso extraction fraction and directly with the zzso delivery of zzso The latter correlated with the degree of peripheral zzso The decline in zzso insulin extraction with increasing zzso also correlated with the accompanying diminution in peripheral insulin zzso zzso zzso is thus associated with insulin zzso The pronounced zzso of upper body fat zzso however, is due to an additional zzso in zzso insulin zzso This zzso is closely allied with the decline in peripheral insulin zzso
