To investigate the interplay between genetic factors influencing baseline level and changes in zzso in zzso 

A zzso twin study of the cohort of Finnish twins (N zzso zzso twin zzso aged zzso years at baseline was conducted and followed up 15 zzso Data on weight and height were obtained from mailed surveys in 1975, 1981, and zzso 

zzso growth models revealed a substantial genetic influence on zzso level at baseline in males and females zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso for males and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and a zzso influence on rate of change in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for males and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso Only very weak evidence for genetic zzso was zzso the genetic correlation between baseline and rate of change in zzso was very modest zzso zzso zzso for males and zzso zzso zzso for zzso 

Our zzso results provide a basis for identifying genetic zzso for change in zzso in particular weight zzso Furthermore, they demonstrate for the first time that such genetic zzso for change in zzso are likely to be different from those affecting level of zzso
