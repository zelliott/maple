The zzso System zzso zzso is a minimally invasive zzso device for the treatment of type 2 zzso The system detects food intake by sensing gastric electrical variations and applies electrical stimulation to the gut synchronized to natural gastric zzso The system is commercially available in Europe and Israel and is in clinical trials in the United zzso It has been tested in 132 patients worldwide to zzso 

To zzso previously reported zzso different zzso This retrospective analysis of the type 2 diabetes zzso analyzed the expected benefit and characterized the significance of baseline zzso in the determination of the expected clinical zzso 

From the total cohort of 132 patients implanted with the zzso device in 10 different centers in Europe and the zzso we identified 50 subjects (27 zzso 23 zzso who were obese with uncontrolled zzso on a stable regime of oral medication for 3 months prior to zzso This population had similar zzso criteria as well as treatment protocols and were all treated for at least 24 zzso The analysis was based on the zzso change compared to zzso 

Data after 24 weeks demonstrated a reduction in zzso in zzso of the patients with average drop in zzso of zzso zzso zzso The average weight loss was zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The results suggest that the zzso stimulation regime can improve zzso levels and induce moderate weight loss in obese zzso zzso
