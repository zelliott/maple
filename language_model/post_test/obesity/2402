We have recently reported an impaired growth hormone zzso response to a single zzso zzso dose of growth hormone releasing factor (1 zzso body zzso in obese zzso We have now investigated whether the zzso administration of low dose zzso zzso zzso by 15 zzso zzso injections for 3 h followed by an zzso zzso (1 zzso to four normal weight women and six obese women results in an enhancement of zzso zzso In the control women low dose zzso given either as a single 10 zzso injection or in zzso of equivalent total zzso produced a zzso response identical to that seen after a single zzso of 60 zzso zzso peak zzso low dose 30 zzso 2 zzso peak zzso large dose 30 zzso zzso zzso In the obese women zzso release was significantly less than the controls after low doses of zzso zzso less than zzso and the peak was delayed compared to that following a single large zzso dose zzso zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso However, three of the obese women who previously showed no response to a large dose of zzso did release zzso after low dose zzso zzso The final zzso of zzso after 3 h of zzso injections did not elicit any additional zzso release in the subjects irrespective of body zzso We conclude that obesity may be characterized by impaired zzso release to zzso zzso The finding that some obese women do not respond to a single large dose injection of zzso but do release zzso after low dose zzso injections supports the hypothesis of a zzso disorder in these zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
