zzso sleep zzso zzso is associated with increased risk for zzso syndrome in both adults and zzso In adults with zzso serum levels of fatty acid binding protein 4 zzso are elevated and associated with the degree of zzso insulin resistance, independent of zzso zzso we assessed plasma zzso levels and zzso zzso zzso in obese and non-obese children with and without zzso 

A total of 309 consecutive children ages zzso were zzso Children were divided into those with zzso and without zzso zzso based on the zzso index zzso zzso were also subdivided into obese zzso and non-obese zzso based on zzso zzso zzso Morning zzso plasma zzso levels were zzso using zzso and 11 zzso zzso zzso within the zzso region were zzso 

Morning plasma zzso levels were increased in all children with zzso even in zzso zzso However, plasma zzso levels were strongly associated with zzso zzso zzso Of the 11 zzso tested, the frequency of zzso zzso minor zzso zzso was significantly increased in zzso This zzso was also associated with increased plasma zzso levels in both zzso and obese zzso The minor zzso frequency of all other zzso was similar in zzso and zzso zzso 

Childhood obesity and zzso are associated with higher plasma zzso levels and thus promote zzso zzso The presence of selective zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene may account for increased plasma zzso levels in the context of obesity and zzso in zzso
