Growing evidence supports a link between obesity and zzso Current research is focused on the role of zzso such as zzso and immune cells, especially zzso in zzso zzso Our aim was to examine the role of inflammation not in tissue but in the peripheral blood of healthy overweight and obese zzso We especially investigated the role of zzso and their possible regulation by zzso 

In healthy zzso overweight, and obese human subjects zzso zzso zzso the peripheral blood zzso of zzso zzso hormones, zzso zzso and zzso as well as the blood count were related to inflammation and zzso at 3 independent days of zzso The response of zzso to stimulation by zzso was also investigated in zzso 

In obese and by tendency already in overweight subjects, inflammation was increased showing a higher zzso ratio, elevated zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso markers zzso and zzso and changes in hormone levels in the peripheral zzso zzso and zzso production of zzso by zzso was elevated in overweight and obese zzso High plasma levels of zzso were associated with reduced zzso production in peripheral blood zzso In zzso production of zzso by zzso was inhibited by zzso 

zzso zzso and enhanced zzso may occur already in the peripheral blood of healthy overweight zzso This process seems to further enhance zzso activity in overweight and zzso
