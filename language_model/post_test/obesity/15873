We present here a detailed study of the genetic contributions to adult body size and zzso in the zzso advanced zzso line zzso an obesity zzso This study represents a first step in zzso obesity quantitative trait zzso zzso in an zzso zzso for zzso in this model were previously isolated to zzso 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, and zzso This study focuses on zzso contributions and the genetic architecture of zzso and organ zzso We analyzed both the zzso and zzso generations of the zzso zzso population zzso zzso zzso zzso with a marker density of approximately 4 zzso We replicate zzso of the previously identified obesity zzso and identify 13 new obesity zzso Nearly half of the zzso zzso were zzso Several broad zzso regions were resolved into zzso zzso zzso The 113 zzso zzso for zzso and body weight clustered into 27 zzso zzso A large number of zzso interactions are described which begin to zzso potential interacting molecular zzso We present a relatively rapid means to obtain zzso details from zzso using dense marker maps and consecutive zzso Analysis of the complex genetic architecture underlying zzso and organ weights in this model may eventually help to zzso not only zzso contributions to obesity but also common gene sets for obesity and its zzso
