zzso circumference zzso also known as upper arm or mid arm zzso can be used as an indicator of muscle mass and fat zzso which are distributed differently in men and zzso Analysis of zzso measures of peripheral fat distribution such as BC could help in understanding the complex zzso behind overweight and zzso The purpose of this study is to identify genetic zzso associated with BC through a large-scale zzso association scan zzso zzso We used zzso zzso to zzso summary results across 14 zzso discovery and 4 replication zzso zzso overall zzso individuals zzso women and zzso zzso of European zzso Individual analyses were carried out for men, women, and combined across sexes using linear zzso and an additive genetic model: adjusted for age and adjusted for age and zzso We zzso signals for follow-up in zzso We did not detect any signals reaching zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed nominal evidence for association zzso in the zzso strata for men and across both zzso In this first zzso zzso for BC to date, we have not identified any zzso significant signals and do not observe robust association of previously established obesity zzso with zzso zzso zzso will be necessary to achieve higher power to detect zzso underlying zzso
