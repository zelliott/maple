zzso cuff tears are common orthopedic injuries and their zzso treatment can be technically zzso This study evaluated the outcomes of zzso rotator cuff repairs in obese zzso We hypothesized that there would be a direct correlation between worse outcomes of zzso rotator cuff repairs and increasing body mass index zzso 

A retrospective review of patients undergoing zzso rotator cuff repair by one orthopedic surgeon between 2005 and 2008 was zzso The study included 149 rotator cuff zzso Recorded data included age, sex, zzso size of rotator cuff tear on magnetic resonance imaging and zzso number of anchors used for repair, functional outcomes (American zzso and zzso Surgeons and University of Pennsylvania zzso surgery time, total time for zzso zzso and hospital zzso Tears were classified by zzso zzso inclusion and exclusion criteria were zzso zzso procedures were performed with general zzso zzso block, beach chair zzso and a standardized operative zzso Patients followed a standard zzso rehabilitation zzso 

Mean patient age was 66 zzso Mean follow-up was zzso zzso Tears were classified as high grade partial zzso small zzso medium zzso large zzso and massive zzso Patients were classified as normal weight zzso overweight zzso obese zzso and zzso obese zzso A statistically significant correlation was found between obesity and worse functional zzso longer operative times, and longer length of hospital zzso 

This study reports new data concerning the association of zzso and early clinical outcome after zzso rotator cuff repair zzso Even though the obese group had greater limitations and lower rates of satisfaction at final follow-up than their non-obese counterparts, they still reported significant improvements from the zzso 

zzso has a negative impact on the operative time of zzso rotator cuff zzso length of zzso and functional zzso
