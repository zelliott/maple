To compare trends in breast cancer mortality within three pairs of zzso European countries in relation to zzso of zzso 

zzso trend zzso 

Three country pairs zzso Ireland zzso zzso v Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands v Belgium and zzso zzso region south of the zzso and Sweden v zzso 

WHO mortality database on cause of death and data sources on zzso zzso cancer treatment, and risk factors for breast cancer zzso 

Changes in breast cancer mortality calculated from linear zzso of log transformed, age adjusted death zzso zzso analysis was used to identify the year when trends in mortality for all ages began to zzso 

From 1989 to 2006, deaths from breast cancer decreased by zzso in Northern Ireland and by zzso in the Republic of zzso by zzso in the Netherlands and by zzso in Belgium and zzso in zzso and by zzso in Sweden and by zzso in zzso The time trend and year of downward zzso were similar between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and between the Netherlands and zzso In Sweden, mortality rates have steadily decreased since 1972, with no downward zzso until zzso Countries of each pair had similar zzso services and prevalence of risk factors for breast cancer mortality but differing zzso of zzso zzso with a gap of about zzso zzso 

The contrast between the time differences in zzso of zzso screening and the similarity in reductions in mortality between the country pairs suggest that screening did not play a direct part in the reductions in breast cancer zzso
