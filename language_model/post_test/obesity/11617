Although the overall mortality in sterile pancreatic necrosis is low, patients who experience systemic complications may have a higher zzso To study the impact of systemic complications and other factors on survival, possible zzso factors were evaluated among 26 patients who experienced at least one systemic zzso zzso was zzso zzso that correlated with a fatal outcome were high zzso scores during the first 48 hours zzso zzso zzso high zzso scores at admission zzso zzso zzso and at 48 hours zzso zzso zzso shock zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso multiple systemic complications zzso zzso and high body mass index zzso zzso zzso Most systemic complications occurred during the first 2 weeks of zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that shock was the best predictor of a fatal zzso Patients with favorable zzso factors survived whether treated medically or zzso whereas those with zzso factors had a fatal outcome whether treated medically or zzso It is concluded that patients with severe sterile necrosis have a high mortality rate and that shock and other zzso factors identify which patients are most likely to have a fatal zzso
