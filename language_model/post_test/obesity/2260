We evaluated the association of central versus overall zzso on levels of zzso stimulating hormone zzso free zzso zzso and free zzso zzso among zzso subjects taken from a zzso representative sample of the adult zzso zzso zzso 

The National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso zzso included zzso men and zzso women who were 20 years and older, with no history of zzso or liver disease, kidney failure, diabetes, or zzso zzso prescription medication use (based on zzso and having zzso zzso and zzso levels between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso between body mass index zzso and waist circumference zzso of overall and central zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso levels were estimated using multivariable linear zzso models zzso by sex and adjusted for age, race, smoking status, and alcohol zzso 

An increase in serum zzso levels was observed for every zzso increase in zzso in zzso men zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso albeit slightly weaker, associations were observed with waist zzso We also found increases in zzso levels with every zzso increase in zzso zzso in men and zzso in zzso and waist circumference zzso in men and zzso in zzso No associations were observed with zzso 

Our results provide support that zzso and waist circumference are positively associated with levels of serum zzso and f zzso but not zzso among zzso zzso zzso studies are needed to define the zzso of these associations and their potential health zzso
