Current treatments have largely failed to slow the rapidly increasing zzso prevalence of obesity and its zzso Despite a strong genetic contribution to obesity zzso only a small percentage of zzso is explained with current knowledge of zzso zzso common sequence zzso and conventional modes of zzso zzso effects are rarely tested in humans because of difficulties arranging studies that distinguish conventional and zzso inheritance while simultaneously controlling environmental factors and learned zzso However, growing evidence from model organisms implicates genetic and environmental factors in one generation that affect zzso in subsequent zzso In this report, we provide the first evidence for paternal zzso genetic effects on body weight and food zzso This test focused on the zzso zzso zzso strain, which carries the zzso zzso on an otherwise zzso zzso Various crosses between zzso and the control zzso strain showed that the zzso zzso in the paternal or zzso generation was sufficient to inhibit zzso obesity and reduce food intake in the normally zzso high food intake zzso zzso These zzso and reduced food intake zzso were transmitted through the paternal lineage but not the maternal lineage with equal strength for at least two zzso zzso social interaction between the father and both his offspring and the pregnant dam did not significantly affect food intake levels, demonstrating that the zzso is transmitted through the male zzso rather than through social zzso zzso of these zzso across multiple generations raises the possibility that zzso genetic effects contribute to current zzso zzso
