zzso evidence suggests that general obesity zzso by body mass index zzso is positively associated with risk of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, previous studies have shown inverse relations with zzso zzso cell zzso zzso However, it is still unclear whether body fat distribution, particularly abdominal zzso is associated with each type of zzso zzso 

We applied multivariable adjusted Cox zzso hazards zzso to investigate the association between zzso measures and risk of zzso and zzso among zzso men and women participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and zzso All statistical tests were two zzso 

During zzso years of zzso we documented 88 incident cases of zzso and 110 cases of zzso zzso waist zzso and zzso ratio zzso were positively associated with zzso risk zzso versus lowest zzso relative risk zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso and waist circumference were zzso related to zzso risk, whereas zzso showed no association with zzso In zzso zzso zzso and waist circumference were significantly zzso related to zzso only among smokers but not among zzso However, when controlled for zzso we found positive associations for waist circumference and zzso with zzso and these associations were observed among smokers and zzso 

General and abdominal obesity were associated with higher zzso zzso Further, our study suggests that particularly an abdominal body fat distribution might also be a risk factor for zzso
