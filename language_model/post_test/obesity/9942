The zzso kinetic changes have been studied only from zzso years, despite the frequency of such a pathological state; thus many work need to be done in this zzso The zzso distribution of drugs may depend on the zzso changes in the body composition taking into account the degree of drug zzso Some other factors such as protein binding and regional blood flow may also be involved in zzso diffusion of drugs in zzso Drug binding to zzso does not seem to be modified in zzso On the contrary, the protein binding of some basic drugs is increased because of the rise of the plasma alpha 1 zzso acid levels in zzso Although the cardiac output and the total blood volume are increased in obese patients, the blood flow zzso according to the zzso tissue weight, is less than in non obese zzso this point could reduce the diffusion of some zzso zzso More complex are the obesity induced changes in the zzso clearance of drugs: some reactions such as zzso and zzso do not vary, some others such as zzso or zzso are zzso The zzso clearance is increased for drugs totally eliminated by zzso zzso and for drugs which are both zzso and zzso According to the zzso characteristic of a drug and its zzso one can calculate the loading dose and the maintenance zzso
