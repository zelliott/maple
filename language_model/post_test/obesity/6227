Plasma zzso zzso and insulin responses to an oral zzso challenge, plasma zzso and zzso zzso and the ability of insulin to stimulate zzso disposal were measured in 35 zzso sedentary and overweight zzso The subjects were divided into 2 groups on the basis of the presence zzso zzso zzso or absence zzso zzso zzso of a history of a first degree relative with zzso zzso The 2 groups were similar in age, body mass index, waist to hip ratio, and zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrated that the ability of insulin to stimulate disposal of a zzso load was significantly reduced in the subjects with a positive family history of zzso zzso In addition, these individuals had significantly higher plasma zzso and very low density zzso cholesterol zzso Since all environmental factors known to modify insulin action and very low density zzso metabolism were equal in the 2 groups, these data suggest that the zzso differences noted are likely to be genetic in zzso
