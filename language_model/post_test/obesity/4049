Not many studies have been done on protein turnover during recovery from zzso Some relevant information can, however, be obtained from zzso on normal growing animals, since rehabilitation and normal growth have in common a rapid rate of net protein zzso The key question is the extent to which net gain in protein results from an increase in synthesis or a decrease in breakdown or zzso Different studies have used different methods, and all methods for measuring protein turnover have some disadvantages and sources of zzso It is important to bear this in mind in evaluating the zzso zzso part of this paper will be devoted to questions of zzso Whole body protein turnover has been measured in children recovering from severe zzso During the phase of rapid catch-up growth the rate of protein synthesis is zzso As might be expected, it increases zzso with the rate of weight zzso At the same time there is a smaller increase in the rate of protein zzso The zzso of these two processes is that, over and above the zzso rate of protein zzso zzso grams of protein have to be zzso for 1 gram to be laid zzso Very similar results have been obtained in rapidly growing young zzso Experimental studies on muscle growth in general confirm the conclusion that, at least in muscle, rapid growth is associated with rapid rates of protein breakdown as well as of zzso This has been shown in muscles of young growing rats, as well as in muscles in which zzso has been induced by stretch or other zzso In contrast, the evidence suggests that rapid growth involves a fall in the rate of protein zzso The magnitude of the nitrogen balance under any conditions is determined by the difference between synthesis and zzso In the absence of any storage of zzso zzso this must be the same as the difference between intake and zzso zzso - B zzso I - zzso A question of great interest is whether, at a given zzso the extent of N balance is determined primarily by regulation of synthesis and breakdown or by regulation of zzso acid zzso Clearly, a reduction in zzso acid degradation is equivalent to an increase in zzso acid zzso An interesting subject for future research is the extent to which the zzso acid degrading zzso adapt to the requirements imposed by growth and zzso
