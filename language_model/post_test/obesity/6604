The prevalence of childhood overweight is rising worldwide, but in children on zzso replacement therapy zzso a poor nutritional status is still the primary zzso We aimed to study the prevalence of, and factors associated with, zzso and zzso in the European zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we assessed the evolution of body mass index zzso after the start of zzso 

We included zzso patients younger than 16 years from 25 countries of whom zzso data, obtained between 1995 and 2010, were available within the European Society for zzso zzso Renal zzso zzso and zzso Association zzso zzso estimates for zzso and zzso were calculated using age and zzso criteria of the World Health Organization zzso zzso year zzso and the International zzso Task Force zzso zzso year zzso 

The prevalence of zzso was zzso whereas zzso of the patients were overweight and zzso zzso zzso associated with being zzso were receiving dialysis treatment and infant zzso Among transplanted recipients, a very short stature zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were associated with a higher risk of being zzso zzso increased zzso and a lower zzso and a higher age at the start of zzso were associated with greater zzso changes during zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso rather than zzso are highly prevalent in European children on zzso Short stature among graft recipients had a strong association with overweight, while zzso appears to be only a problem in zzso Our findings suggest that nutritional management in children receiving zzso should focus as much on the prevention and treatment of overweight as on preventing zzso
