zzso resistance is clearly associated with zzso However, the role of excess energy intake per zzso as opposed to increased fat mass in the development of insulin resistance has not been clearly zzso It may be that the zzso load provided by short-term zzso is sufficient to induce measurable changes in insulin action in skeletal muscle and the zzso We examined the effects of 3 days of zzso on insulin action and zzso zzso in 13 lean zzso mass index, zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 men, 7 zzso and 9 zzso zzso zzso mass index, zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 men, 5 zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso clamp study (5 and 40 zzso zzso zzso with a zzso constant infusion of zzso was performed after 3 days of a zzso diet and again after 3 days of zzso by 50% zzso zzso zzso fat, zzso zzso At zzso lean individuals were more insulin sensitive, as measured by zzso infusion rate, than zzso individuals zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso with lean women being more insulin sensitive than lean men zzso zzso zzso resulted in a reduction in zzso infusion rate in lean women zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso but no change was noted in lean men or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso disposal remained unchanged with zzso in all zzso zzso insulin suppression of zzso zzso production was impaired after zzso in lean women zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but remained unchanged in the other zzso These findings demonstrate that insulin action is reduced in lean, zzso women after short-term zzso primarily because of an zzso of zzso suppression of zzso zzso production, whereas short-term zzso does not appear to effect insulin action in lean men and zzso zzso This response may be indirectly involved in the ability of lean women to maintain weight in the face of an zzso zzso
