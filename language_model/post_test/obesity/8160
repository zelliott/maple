zzso is associated with high insulin and zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso function and zzso expansion are responsible for insulin zzso It is unknown whether zzso is due to zzso zzso or to an increase in zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the dynamics of the zzso and zzso function and mass in zzso of obese zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso volumes were measured in 51 zzso zzso divided into six groups according to overweight severity or zzso zzso zzso parameters were correlated to overweight and to diverse zzso and laboratory zzso 

Relative zzso volume zzso and relative zzso zzso volume zzso increased significantly with both overweight duration and zzso zzso in spite of the induction of insulin resistance, overweight produced only modest effects on relative zzso volume zzso and relative zzso zzso volume zzso Of note, zzso did not increase neither with overweight duration nor with overweight severity, supposedly because of the zzso greater increase in zzso zzso body weights correlated with serum levels of zzso and tumor necrosis zzso soluble zzso demonstrating that overweight zzso abnormal zzso of the signaling of two zzso known to impact differently zzso and zzso viability and zzso 

In conclusion, overweight and insulin resistance induce in zzso a significant increase in zzso volumes zzso zzso whereas have minimal effects on the zzso zzso This study suggests that an increase in the zzso mass may zzso the loss of zzso cells and the transition to overt zzso and zzso
