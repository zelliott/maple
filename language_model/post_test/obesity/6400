To study cardiovascular function at rest and during exercise by spectral analysis of heart rhythm in patients with spinal zzso and zzso in patients with excessive body weight, and with zzso type zzso zzso zzso 

A total of 223 patients were zzso Spinal zzso with zzso was diagnosed in 80, excessive body weight in 78, and zzso type zzso in zzso Heart rhythm wave structure was evaluated using zzso zzso complex before and after bicycle zzso 

zzso exercise did not induce changes in the heart rhythm wave structure of normal zzso In zzso type zzso the intensity of first order slow waves increased during the recovery period, while in patients with spinal zzso and zzso and in those with excessive body weight, heart rhythm zzso index zzso
