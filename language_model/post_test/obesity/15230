zzso of bone zzso in the zzso from red to yellow is a normal maturation zzso zzso zzso is present when expected yellow zzso is replaced with active red zzso and it tends to occur at times of zzso zzso The significance of this finding on MR imaging is not always zzso zzso we studied the prevalence of bone zzso zzso in adults undergoing MR imaging of the knee for reasons other than zzso zzso zzso relationships between zzso zzso and age, sex, weight, and smoking were zzso 

zzso zzso over 24 years of age who had no evidence of zzso disorders and for whom MR images of the knee were available for review were selected for zzso Patients younger than 25 years old were eliminated to ensure that all patients in the study were old enough to have achieved normal adult zzso zzso The 59 subjects were classified according to their smoking zzso zzso were nonsmokers, 10 were intermediate smokers, and 21 were heavy zzso The MR images were classified as showing either red zzso zzso from yellow to zzso or yellow zzso zzso by two independent observers who had no knowledge of the patients' smoking zzso
