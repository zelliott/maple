zzso zzso syndrome zzso is a zzso zzso disorder frequently accompanied by obesity and by insulin resistance, and patients with this syndrome suffer from zzso and poor pregnancy zzso zzso in plasma zzso acid zzso metabolism have been implicated in women with zzso However, direct evidence on zzso AA zzso profiles in zzso patients and their relationship with pregnancy outcome is zzso 

We conducted a prospective study in 63 zzso patients and 48 controls in the Division of zzso Center, zzso University Third zzso zzso AA levels were measured by the liquid zzso mass zzso method, and the results were analyzed based on different grouping zzso 

The levels of aromatic zzso acid zzso increased in zzso patients independent of obesity zzso zzso whereas the levels of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso and zzso increased with body mass index irrespective of the zzso status (all P zzso In addition, compared with non insulin zzso patients and controls, insulin zzso group had higher levels of zzso zzso and zzso acid (all P zzso In zzso group, zzso acid and zzso levels were elevated in pregnant patients compared with the zzso subjects (both P zzso Moreover, the levels of zzso and zzso were higher in the zzso group than in the pregnant group (both P zzso The pregnancy rate zzso of subjects with elevated zzso level was significantly lower than that zzso in control subjects zzso zzso zzso at a zzso zzso value of zzso zzso while the abortion rate was much higher zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso 

Both zzso and obesity were accompanied by zzso AA zzso zzso with obesity exerting a more pronounced effect on AA zzso zzso The disruptions in specific zzso in the zzso fluid might account for the inferior pregnancy outcome in obese patients and increased risk of abortion in zzso zzso
