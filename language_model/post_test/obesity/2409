Feeding zzso zzso in a diet to zzso mice zzso for the zzso obesity gene zzso zzso permitted zzso of the primary consequences of obesity gene expression from the secondary consequences of diabetes zzso through interaction between the zzso gene and other zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso mice were similar to zzso zzso in exhibiting zzso and marked zzso However, zzso zzso did not develop the zzso zzso and zzso zzso characteristic of zzso zzso zzso Thus, expression of the primary zzso could be studied in the absence of the myriad secondary zzso zzso by chronic zzso and zzso zzso numbers of zzso plasma membrane insulin receptors zzso of zzso persisted in the zzso mice in the absence of zzso indicating that this zzso was a consequence of the primary genetic zzso and not merely a zzso phenomenon secondary to zzso zzso of insulin zzso from comparably sized zzso zzso versus zzso from zzso zzso mice showed no intrinsic defects in zzso sensitivity to zzso In conclusion, zzso obesity can be zzso from zzso zzso zzso dysfunction, and zzso but is associated with a generalized membrane zzso reflected in part by the persistent zzso of plasma membrane insulin zzso
