The zzso zzso of the G protein zzso gene zzso is a thrifty zzso associated with an increased risk for zzso We aimed to determine whether the zzso zzso is zzso the zzso response to extended zzso 

We zzso 108 subjects who underwent an zzso modified medical zzso treatment zzso energy intake zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso hunger and mood were recorded daily by zzso visual analogue zzso 

Whereas weight loss was not dependent on zzso both mood and hunger were significantly associated with zzso with zzso zzso zzso carriers having best mood zzso zzso zzso and least hunger zzso zzso zzso during zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso 

zzso mental discomfort during zzso in zzso zzso carriers might partly explain their increased risk for zzso The strong association between the zzso response to zzso with zzso zzso indicates a role of the gene in the zzso regulation of food zzso which should be further considered in nutritional intervention zzso
