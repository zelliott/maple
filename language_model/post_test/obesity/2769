In zzso sleep zzso zzso zzso patients, an increase of upper airway zzso zzso has been described together with a reduced zzso caliber due to zzso zzso and fat zzso in zzso zzso zzso is the main treatment of zzso and acts mechanically by increasing pressure inside zzso The aim of this study was to assess the zzso and long-term effects of zzso on zzso caliber and zzso in severe zzso zzso 

Ten obese patients zzso male, age zzso 9 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scale zzso zzso zzso point, zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso of zzso junction area zzso mean zzso area zzso zzso zzso area zzso by acoustic zzso and determination of expired volume in the first zzso s after the application at the mouth of -5 zzso negative zzso pressure zzso during zzso in the zzso position under zzso conditions zzso and after 1 week and 6 months of zzso zzso 

zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after 1 week and zzso zzso zzso zzso after 6 months (1 week and 6 months vs baseline p zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after 1 week and zzso zzso zzso zzso after 6 months (1 week and 6 months vs baseline p zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after 1 week and zzso zzso zzso zzso after 6 months (1 week vs baseline p zzso 6 months vs zzso p zzso zzso was 290 zzso 73 zzso at zzso zzso zzso 65 zzso after 1 week and 338 zzso 67 zzso after 6 months (6 months vs baseline p zzso 1 week vs 6 months p zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso treatment might be effective in zzso patients not only by causing a mechanical zzso of zzso but also by inducing an improvement on anatomical zzso and functional (later on) aspects of zzso that can be observed during zzso
