zzso sensitive zzso zzso channels reside in the plasma membrane of many excitable cells such as pancreatic zzso heart, skeletal muscle and brain, where they link cellular zzso energy to membrane electrical zzso They are composed of two zzso zzso zzso selective pore zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition to the central role of pancreatic zzso zzso channels in zzso insulin zzso several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that zzso channels zzso zzso transport in the insulin target zzso zzso of zzso channels by zzso or zzso or an increase in zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso or exercise zzso zzso zzso while zzso of the channels by zzso channel openers, zzso zzso zzso or zzso damage zzso and brain zzso reduces zzso zzso induced by insulin or zzso Because insulin action has been known to depend on the energy level of the target cells, zzso channel may function as an zzso in this zzso It is now evident that long chain zzso zzso metabolically active forms of fatty zzso are the most potent and zzso important zzso of zzso zzso Thus, I suppose that the sustained zzso of zzso channels by long chain fatty zzso seems to be a missing link between zzso and insulin resistance in obesity and type 2 diabetes zzso
