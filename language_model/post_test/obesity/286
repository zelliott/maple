To determine plasma levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in Type 2 diabetic patients and to examine the clinical and biological factors that are associated with elevated zzso zzso 

We measured zzso and zzso in total plasma and in zzso zzso zzso by an zzso zzso in 88 Caucasian Type 2 diabetic patients and in 138 healthy control zzso 

Plasma levels of both zzso and zzso were increased in Type 2 diabetic zzso The clinical conditions associated with an increase of plasma zzso and zzso were abdominal zzso body mass index, poor zzso control and lack of insulin zzso However, when zzso analysis was used, plasma zzso levels correlated with zzso levels zzso The zzso ratio was similar in the Type 2 diabetic and control zzso 

Our study shows the parallel increase of zzso and zzso in Type 2 diabetic zzso This parallel increase is related to zzso zzso
