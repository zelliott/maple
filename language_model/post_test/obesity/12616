zzso zzso responses to paired intravenous and oral zzso loads were determined in 38 zzso individuals classified as normal zzso subjects, zzso diabetics zzso blood zzso below 105 zzso per 100 zzso or zzso diabetics zzso zzso below 192 zzso per 100 zzso Studies were also performed in 29 obese persons who were similarly zzso The intravenous load was given to assess the alacrity of hormonal release after zzso zzso and the oral zzso to determine how the speed of initial zzso zzso the disposition of zzso zzso In the zzso group, normal subjects responded to massive zzso after rapid injection of zzso with immediate and zzso outpouring of insulin, in contrast to a zzso zzso response in patients with mild diabetes, and no initial response at all in moderate zzso During oral zzso tolerance tests, the much faster clearance of blood sugar in zzso subjects was actually associated with lower absolute insulin output than was found in mildly diabetic patients, since the latter exhibited delayed zzso in concert with prolonged zzso zzso diabetics never showed excessive insulin release despite even greater zzso An empirical zzso zzso the ratio relating enhancement of circulating insulin to magnitude of corresponding zzso zzso was used to compare the zzso capacities of respective zzso Despite the higher absolute hormonal output after oral zzso in mild zzso the index revealed that insulin release in normal subjects was zzso more than twice as zzso This relatively greater normal zzso response declared itself shortly after the administration of zzso by either route, and was maintained throughout both zzso In the 29 obese individuals, differences among groups were essentially the same as in persons of normal zzso zzso zzso did show much larger absolute zzso responses during both tests than did zzso zzso Since corresponding zzso tolerance zzso were also higher, the mean zzso indexes for obese subjects were not statistically zzso Moreover, when comparable zzso zzso of obese and zzso controls
