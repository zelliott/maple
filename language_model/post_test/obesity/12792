The purpose of the study was to examine the distribution of zzso density patterns in relation to zzso This was done in a sample of 323 Danish men and women aged zzso years, selected randomly from a larger population sample of adult zzso zzso reporting bias of energy and protein zzso in relation to body fat percentage, was assessed by comparing intake data from a diet history interview with data estimated from zzso 24-hour nitrogen zzso and estimated 24-hour energy zzso The results of the study showed that degree of obesity was positively associated with protein zzso of total energy and zzso whereas compared with total energy reported, protein was zzso by the obese zzso These associations were evident despite control for zzso age and smoking zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, errors in dietary reporting of protein seem to occur disproportionately with respect to total energy, suggesting a differential reporting pattern of different zzso zzso on average, all subjects zzso energy percent from zzso zzso was most common in zzso It may therefore be speculated that snack type foods are zzso forgotten when dietary omission occurs in obese zzso The results of the present study seem in agreement with the general assumption that obese subjects tend to specifically zzso fat and zzso foods, rather than generally zzso their total zzso These results may have wide implications for the interpretation of studies of diet and zzso to zzso
