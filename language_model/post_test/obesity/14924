Recent evidence indicates that zzso tissue zzso and zzso have a major role in the zzso of zzso The zzso zzso difference technique has been used very effectively to understand zzso tissue metabolism in humans in zzso and we set out to investigate whether it is possible to apply and use this technique to determine zzso differences for peripheral blood zzso cells zzso across human zzso zzso We used zzso analysis of zzso blood and zzso blood draining zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso in middle-aged volunteers (age zzso years, zzso zzso We determined zzso differences for various zzso In zzso conditions, there was evidence of modest retention of some zzso in zzso zzso whereas the infusion of zzso zzso adrenaline led to a marked release of many zzso (with little evidence of zzso zzso In addition to the demonstration that this approach is technically zzso these results also indicate that zzso stimuli that change adrenaline zzso and/or zzso tissue blood flow (such as physical zzso provoke the release of zzso from zzso and abdominal zzso zzso
