zzso restriction zzso is accepted as an experimental zzso zzso Several important signal zzso pathways including zzso and zzso are implicated in the regulation of zzso processes of zzso However, the mechanisms responsible for adaptations remain unclear in zzso 

Four overweight male participants were enrolled and treated with zzso zzso of their baseline energy requirements for zzso zzso including body weight zzso body mass index zzso zzso visceral fat area zzso mean blood pressure zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso such as insulin, zzso profiles and inflammatory makers and the expression of zzso zzso and zzso in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso were determined at baseline and then after zzso In addition, we assessed the effects of the serum collected from the participants on zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso in cultured human skeletal muscle zzso 

After zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all significantly zzso while zzso max increased, compared to those at zzso The levels of zzso insulin, free fatty acid, and inflammatory makers, such as zzso and zzso were significantly reduced, whereas the expression of zzso zzso and zzso was significantly increased in zzso collected after zzso compared to those at zzso The skeletal muscle cells that were cultured in serum collected after zzso showed an increase in zzso and zzso activity as well as zzso zzso 

zzso is beneficial for zzso zzso zzso and zzso cellular adaptations against aging, possibly through zzso and zzso zzso via circulating zzso
