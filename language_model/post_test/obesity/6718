As most obese adults were not overweight as children, the prediction of adult obesity from childhood body size alone is zzso We constructed a zzso zzso risk assessment framework for predicting adult obesity during childhood using the zzso zzso System zzso and tested it against zzso data from the 1958 National Child Development zzso 

The framework divided study participants according to two categories of risk: zzso zzso zzso events and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso At the age of 11 years, conditioning factors were zzso birth zzso and zzso of zzso and intervention factors were zzso childhood activity zzso and zzso at least one obese zzso From a composite score of all four zzso study participants were assigned to one of the four risk groups: low risk, past zzso risk only, present zzso risk only and high combined zzso zzso and relative risks for the development of future zzso at ages 23, 33 and 42 years were calculated for each risk zzso 

Those identified in the highest risk category at the age of 11 were around twice as likely to become overweight zzso mass index zzso zzso by the age of 23 years, and obese zzso zzso by ages 33 and 42 years, in comparison to their low-risk peers zzso sample, zzso zzso Increased prevalence of future obesity was also observed for high-risk children who were not already overweight at the age of 11 zzso sample, zzso 

This framework identifies a greater proportion of the population that is at risk for future obesity than does childhood weight assessment zzso
