The onset and progression of zzso fatty liver disease zzso seem to be affected by zzso zzso however, detailed examinations have not been performed in non-obese zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to identify potential zzso factors that affect zzso and its related nutritional zzso 

We investigated the distribution of abdominal fat, dietary zzso and zzso data in patients with zzso and compared non-obese with obese zzso 

There was no significant difference in the percentage of patients with diabetes or zzso between the obese and non-obese zzso zzso zzso total abdominal fat levels, and subcutaneous fat levels were significantly higher in the obese group, while visceral fat levels were not significantly different between the two zzso zzso insulin zzso and zzso model zzso resistance zzso were significantly lower in the non-obese group, suggesting that the non-obese patients were not overtly insulin zzso Although serum zzso and zzso levels were similar in both groups, zzso levels were significantly higher in the obese zzso Total energy and zzso intake tended to be higher in the obese zzso A characteristic feature was that dietary cholesterol intake was significantly higher, while the intake of zzso fatty acids zzso was significantly lower in the non-obese zzso 

In non-obese zzso zzso 1) although visceral fat was increased, insulin resistance and/or zzso zzso of zzso was not necessarily zzso 2) zzso of total energy and carbohydrates were not zzso although dietary cholesterol was zzso and dietary zzso were significantly lower compared with those in obese zzso and 3) characteristic fat intake may be associated with the formation of zzso
