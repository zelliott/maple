zzso restrictive procedures are considered effective weight loss treatment for severe zzso The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a zzso implant that renders a partial restriction of stomach in a canine zzso 

The device was comprised of two zzso parallel zzso plates with two zzso to create a small gastric zzso that opposed gastric zzso Three groups of non-obese zzso dogs were zzso group I zzso underwent surgical implant for 6 weeks, group II zzso underwent surgical implant for 6 weeks, followed by surgical removal of the implant and additional monitoring for 5 weeks, and group III zzso served as zzso controls for groups I and zzso Food intake and body weight were zzso and the zzso were examined zzso zzso 

The average food intake was significantly decreased by zzso in group I as compared to group III throughout the 6 weeks of surgical implant zzso The implanted dogs showed a progressive weight loss as compared to sham, which reached zzso by the end of 6 zzso In group II, after 5 weeks of implant zzso the body weights recovered to approximately zzso of zzso zzso evidence of the implant site at the gastric walls revealed no significant structural changes, tissue zzso zzso or zzso 

Our results validate the feasibility of a zzso gastric restriction implant in a non-obese canine model, with the potential for achieving significant weight loss within 6 weeks and with no injury to the gastric zzso
