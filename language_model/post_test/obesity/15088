zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene have been studied in relation to risk of type 2 diabetes and zzso risk factors that have received increased attention in relation to breast zzso We evaluated the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso zzso are associated with breast cancer risk in zzso white zzso and Hispanic zzso women using data from a zzso zzso study conducted in the southwestern United zzso

Two copies compared to one or zero copies of the zzso zzso zzso were associated with increased breast cancer risk for zzso women zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso but with reduced risk for H women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Effect estimates were strengthened for women with a body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and for H women with a history of diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These data suggest that ethnicity zzso the association between the zzso zzso zzso and breast cancer risk, and being overweight or obese enhances the divergence of risk between H and zzso zzso
