To test the effect of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso in zzso obese zzso zzso 

Ten male zzso rats were divided into 2 groups: the rats in the control group zzso were fed with normal zzso The rats in the experimental group were fed with high fat zzso zzso At the end of the sixth week, all rats were killed and the zzso zzso were zzso The vessel rings obtained from the obese rats were zzso for 2 hours with zzso or zzso plus zzso or none of them, then zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the vessel rings were induced by zzso followed by relaxations with increasing doses of zzso (for zzso dependent zzso zzso or sodium zzso (for zzso independent zzso zzso zzso was expressed as percentage of residual of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso caused a zzso relaxation in all zzso zzso zzso Compared with the control group, the zzso zzso dependent relaxation of the zzso rings in the obese rats was impaired zzso With zzso the relaxation response of zzso rings to zzso improved zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced relaxation zzso independent zzso did not differ statistically between the two zzso 

zzso zzso zzso has been observed in zzso obese rats and zzso can improve the zzso dysfunction in obese zzso
