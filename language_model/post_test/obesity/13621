A zzso association study conducted by the zzso Trust Case Control zzso recently associated single zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso mass and obesity zzso gene with type 2 zzso These associations were shown to be zzso by zzso Other research groups found similar results in Europeans and Hispanics but not African zzso The mechanism by which zzso influences obesity and type 2 diabetes is currently zzso The present study investigated the role of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso insulin sensitivity, and body weight regulation, including energy intake and zzso 

We zzso zzso individuals from the Quebec City metropolitan area that participated in the Quebec Family zzso a long-term study of extensively zzso individuals designed to investigate factors involved in zzso 

We found significant associations for both zzso with several zzso zzso In particular, zzso was associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso weight zzso zzso zzso and waist circumference zzso zzso zzso under an additive zzso In addition, this zzso zzso influenced zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso model assessment of insulin resistance zzso zzso zzso and an insulin sensitivity index derived from an oral zzso tolerance test zzso zzso zzso zzso were also found with resting zzso rate zzso zzso zzso zzso and plasma zzso levels zzso zzso zzso Adjustment for zzso abolished the associations with insulin sensitivity, zzso and plasma zzso zzso 

These results confirm that genetic variation at the zzso locus contributes to the zzso of zzso insulin resistance, and increased plasma zzso zzso
