To investigate the construct zzso of the Short zzso zzso Health zzso questionnaire in obese zzso 

Our series consisted of zzso obese patients zzso zzso zzso zzso years; zzso zzso zzso enrolled in the zzso study, an zzso zzso study of obese zzso zzso The construct zzso of the zzso was assessed by main component zzso zzso zzso and zzso general linear models were used to investigate the relationship between zzso and zzso zzso or factors identified by main component zzso 

zzso was significantly associated with poor zzso quality of life in all eight zzso zzso and the strongest association was observed with physical zzso Main components analysis generated a zzso solution explaining 59% of the observed zzso zzso was strongly associated with factors based on the loading of items regarding the physical activity domain and factors based on zzso and zzso items or general health and bodily pain zzso In contrast, mental zzso zzso and social zzso factors were not related to zzso 

In obese zzso zzso the zzso of zzso items in main components is not significantly different from the zzso approach generally used, thus confirming the zzso of such a generic questionnaire in this specific zzso However, the peculiar zzso of some zzso items and their relationship with zzso suggest that the zzso quality of life profile of subjects belonging to that population may be better described with alternative zzso of the zzso items or with zzso zzso
