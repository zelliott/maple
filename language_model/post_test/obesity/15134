To assess the effects of weight loss on serum zzso levels in zzso zzso syndrome zzso 

We determined serum zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels in 60 zzso women with zzso and 48 zzso female zzso zzso were repeated after 24 weeks of treatment with zzso 120 zzso 3 times per day along with an zzso zzso 

At zzso serum zzso concentration was higher in patients with zzso than in controls zzso zzso zzso serum levels of zzso zzso and zzso did not differ between the two zzso After 24 weeks, a significant reduction in zzso and waist circumference was observed in both patients with zzso and controls zzso zzso zzso baseline in both zzso Also serum zzso levels decreased in both patients with zzso and controls zzso zzso zzso baseline in both zzso The reduction in serum zzso levels did not differ between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels did not change in either zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso do not appear to play major zzso roles in zzso patients with zzso In contrast, zzso emerges as a potentially important zzso of the zzso abnormalities of these zzso However, serum zzso levels are not substantially affected by weight zzso
