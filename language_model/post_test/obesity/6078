zzso zzso is defined as a greater than predicted change in energy expenditure in response to changes in energy zzso This issue is particularly relevant in the context of a zzso zzso in which diminished zzso can be sufficient to compensate for a prescribed decrease in daily energy zzso In the present pilot study, we investigated the zzso reduction in zzso in resting state that appears to zzso resistance to further weight zzso Eight obese men zzso zzso zzso zzso mean age: 38 zzso participated in this zzso zzso clinical zzso They were subjected to a weight-loss zzso that consisted of a supervised diet zzso zzso and exercise clinical zzso The zzso investigated were as zzso zzso zzso zzso after 5 zzso 1) zzso loss of body weight zzso 1), zzso after 10 zzso 1) zzso weight loss zzso 2) and zzso at resistance to further weight loss zzso At each phase of the zzso zzso body weight and composition as well as zzso were zzso A zzso equation was established in a control population of the same age to predict zzso in obese men at each phase of the weight-loss zzso We observed that body weight and fat mass zzso were significantly reduced zzso zzso while zzso mass remained unchanged throughout the zzso In phase 1, measured zzso had fallen by zzso zzso more than predicted zzso zzso and this difference reached zzso zzso at plateau zzso zzso zzso phase zzso A positive association zzso zzso P zzso was observed between the reduction in zzso and the degree of zzso depletion at zzso The zzso reduction in zzso at plateau was substantial and represented zzso of the compensation in energy balance that led to resistance to further lose body zzso In conclusion, these results show that zzso reduction in zzso may contribute to the occurrence of resistance to lose fat in obese men subjected to a zzso zzso
