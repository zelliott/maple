The purpose of this study was to evaluate zzso zzso in zzso zzso level of serum zzso and zzso response after zzso releasing hormone zzso were investigated in 20 obese patients and 20 healthy subjects well matched for age and zzso zzso patients had higher zzso levels of serum zzso than those of healthy zzso zzso no significant difference in serum zzso concentration was found at any time during zzso stimulating zzso However obese patients showed incremental areas of serum zzso slightly, but not significantly, lower compared to healthy subjects, probably because their zzso levels were zzso In conclusion, the present study confirms that zzso zzso is altered in obese zzso The zzso between zzso levels and zzso response during zzso stimulating test seems to indicate a zzso in the zzso inhibitor zzso
