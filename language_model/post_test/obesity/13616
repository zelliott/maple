Integrated zzso zzso signal obtained by zzso ultrasound examination of the carotid artery can be used to evaluate the tissue characteristics of zzso zzso To examine whether zzso of several cardiovascular risk factors, zzso syndrome zzso affects the tissue characteristics of the carotid artery, we measured zzso values of the zzso complex in the carotid artery for 142 patients zzso years old) with at least one component of zzso zzso values were zzso correlated with the number of zzso components zzso zzso Furthermore, the number of zzso components was an independent risk factor for a low zzso The subjects with coronary heart disease zzso zzso showed significantly lower zzso than those without it zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso analysis showed that the presence of zzso was associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso of the cardiovascular risk factors affects the zzso an acoustic zzso of tissue characteristics of the zzso complex in the carotid zzso
