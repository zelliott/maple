The association of obesity and zzso does not mean that zzso per zzso is the primary zzso of the zzso zzso To evaluate the contribution of zzso to zzso levels of serum zzso zzso LDL cholesterol zzso and HDL cholesterol zzso we analyzed data on 368 zzso adults zzso women, 82 zzso zzso entering a weight control zzso Although most subjects were overweight, the population represented a wide spectrum of body weights and zzso zzso Study variables included body fat mass (by total body zzso fat free mass zzso body build zzso to height zzso fat cell size and number (from bilateral zzso biopsy zzso zzso body fat pattern by arm to thigh circumference ratio, zzso fat pattern by zzso to zzso zzso ratio, waist to hip ratio, and the presence or absence of zzso Our results concurred with previously noted correlations of body weight with zzso zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso and with zzso zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso at least in the larger sample of women, but there was no significant correlation with zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to evaluate the relative contribution of the various components of body composition and fat distribution to zzso levels, zzso zzso analyses were performed on the zzso of women and zzso Among zzso zzso level was predicted best by zzso upper body fat pattern, age, and diabetes zzso 30 percent of zzso zzso zzso level was predicted by age only zzso 12 percent of zzso and zzso level was predicted by body build only (8 zzso Among zzso zzso level was predicted best by central and upper body fat patterns and diabetes zzso percent of zzso zzso and zzso levels were not significantly predicted by any of the 11 study zzso These results, obtained from zzso analysis of a predominantly obese sample, suggest that zzso levels may be more directly related to body fat pattern, fat free mass and body build than to body zzso zzso
