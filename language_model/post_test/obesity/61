zzso in insulin zzso and reduced peripheral sensitivity to the hormone have been reported in type II zzso In this paper, a comparison is made of zzso zzso production zzso zzso insulin zzso and insulin sensitivity in zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso to circulating zzso in 24 patients with recently diagnosed type II diabetes, matched for age and zzso zzso and divided into non-obese zzso subjects) and moderately obese (10 zzso and in 9 non-obese zzso The non-obese diabetics were slightly zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso in controls, p less than zzso with a significant reduction in early and late insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso and zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso The insulin sensitivity index zzso was significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso zzso zzso production was significantly increased zzso zzso zzso vs 84 zzso zzso zzso per zzso p less than zzso and displayed a positive correlation with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso zzso binding to zzso was significantly lower than in controls zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso zzso obese diabetics also were significantly zzso in the zzso state zzso zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso vs zzso but, typically, lacked the early zzso phase zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso A similar increase of zzso zzso production zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso p less than zzso vs controls, zzso vs non-obese zzso and decrease of peripheral sensitivity to insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso vs controls, zzso vs non-obese zzso was found in moderately obese zzso as well as a significant reduction of insulin binding to insulated zzso zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso vs controls, zzso vs non-obese zzso These results confirm that common defects of both non-obese and moderately obese type II diabetics are: lack of early phase of zzso induced insulin zzso increase in zzso zzso production and decrease of peripheral insulin sensitivity together with reduction of insulin binding to circulating zzso The hypothesis of a unique zzso as a cause of zzso in type II diabetes in early clinical phase is not borne out by the results of this zzso zzso zzso even if able to reduce insulin sensitivity, seems to be less important in determining zzso
