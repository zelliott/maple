Slow eating may be associated with reduced energy zzso A device that counts bites can provide zzso feedback to the zzso The purpose of this study was to explore the bite zzso utility for slowing zzso and reducing energy zzso The study was a zzso design with three zzso From February to April 2009, university students zzso ate three meals in the zzso a baseline meal without feedback zzso a meal during which participants received zzso feedback zzso and a meal during which participants followed a 50% slower zzso target zzso zzso zzso of food zzso ratings of zzso and zzso and zzso of water consumed were statistically compared across conditions using zzso analyses of zzso Overall, participants ate 70 zzso fewer during the Slow zzso condition compared with the Feedback zzso In addition, when baseline energy consumption was added post hoc as a grouping zzso participants who ate more than 400 zzso at baseline zzso ate zzso zzso fewer during the Slow zzso condition compared to zzso and 142 zzso fewer in the Feedback condition compared with zzso However, the Slow zzso condition did not significantly affect participants who ate fewer than 400 zzso at baseline zzso zzso it seems that slowing zzso with the bite counter may be most effective for individuals who consume larger amounts of zzso Future research should explore more foods and drinks, more diverse groups of individuals, potential zzso zzso and additional applications of the bite zzso
