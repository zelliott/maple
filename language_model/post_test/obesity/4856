zzso evidence links overweight and obesity with impaired zzso However, controversies persist as to whether overweight and obesity have additional impact on cardiovascular outcomes independent of their strong associations with established coronary risk factors, zzso high blood pressure and high cholesterol zzso 

To assess the relation of zzso body mass index with morbidity and mortality outcomes in older age among individuals without and with other major risk factors at zzso 

Chicago Heart Association zzso Project in Industry study, a prospective study with baseline zzso cardiovascular risk classified as low risk zzso pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso serum total cholesterol level zzso zzso zzso zzso and not currently zzso moderate risk zzso and zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso and/or total cholesterol level zzso zzso zzso zzso or having any 1, any 2, or all 3 of the following risk factors: blood zzso or zzso zzso zzso total cholesterol zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and current cigarette zzso Body mass index was classified as normal weight zzso overweight zzso or obese zzso or zzso Mean follow-up was 32 zzso 

Participants were zzso men and women aged 31 through 64 years, recruited from zzso companies or organizations and free of coronary heart disease zzso diabetes, or major zzso abnormalities at zzso 

zzso and mortality from zzso cardiovascular disease, or diabetes, beginning at age 65 zzso 

In multivariable analyses that included adjustment for zzso blood pressure and total cholesterol level, the odds ratio zzso confidence zzso for zzso death for obese participants compared with those of normal weight in the same risk category was zzso zzso for low risk and zzso zzso for moderate zzso for zzso zzso the corresponding results were zzso zzso for low risk and zzso zzso for moderate zzso zzso were similar for other risk groups and for cardiovascular disease, but stronger for diabetes zzso low risk: zzso zzso for mortality and zzso zzso for zzso 

For individuals with no cardiovascular risk factors as well as for those with 1 or more risk factors, those who are obese in middle age have a higher risk of hospitalization and mortality from zzso cardiovascular disease, and diabetes in older age than those who are normal zzso
