Acute kidney injury zzso is a common source of morbidity after zzso We sought to determine novel risk factors for zzso by Acute zzso zzso Network zzso criteria, in critically ill trauma zzso 

A prospective cohort of 400 patients admitted to the intensive care unit of a level 1 trauma center was followed for the development of zzso over 5 zzso 

Acute kidney injury developed in 147 zzso of 400 zzso In multivariable zzso analysis, independent risk factors for zzso included African American race zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso body mass index of 30 zzso or greater zzso zzso versus normal body mass zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso abdominal zzso zzso zzso score of 4 or more zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso packed red blood cells administered during resuscitation zzso zzso per unit; zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Acute zzso zzso Network stages 1, 2, and 3 were associated with hospital mortality rates of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, compared with zzso for those without zzso zzso zzso 

Acute kidney injury in critically ill trauma patients is associated with substantial zzso The findings of African American race, zzso and blood product administration as independent risk factors for zzso deserve further study to zzso underlying zzso
