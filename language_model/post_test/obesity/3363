Considering pancreatic reserve recognition a more rational basis for starting insulin therapy in zzso during 1988 we studied zzso and zzso plasma zzso levels in 31 patients (21 zzso 10 zzso mean age zzso zzso zzso zzso referred to our department for insulin therapy evaluation because of primary or secondary failure to other zzso Major features were obesity and chronically uncontrolled zzso Our patients were zzso as zzso group A, considered non zzso which included four zzso group B, taken as zzso consisting in zzso and a remaining of 20 zzso patients which formed group zzso these with patients of group B, embodied an zzso of zzso Among zzso there was no any case of total B cell loss of function, and plasma zzso activity surpassed through those limits considered for zzso We believe that these patients should be eligible candidates for insulin zzso We failed to found out correlation of plasma zzso activity with either age or duration of zzso Our observation supports that zzso plasma zzso evaluation would suffice for pancreatic reserve zzso We conclude that our patients mainly presented an insulin resistant state associated with obesity thus enhancing the commonplace call for reinforcing zzso treatment zzso such as caloric zzso weight loss and exertion to achieve a better control in zzso zzso
