zzso zzso has been associated with chronic zzso C zzso but its zzso risk factors, and clinical significance remain to be zzso 

The present study determined the frequency of, and risk factors for zzso zzso and its association with activity and progression of zzso in a large cohort of zzso zzso 

This is a retrospective study that zzso systematic chart review and statistical analyzes to investigate 324 zzso patients with zzso from a university medical center and a regional VA medical zzso 

The frequency of zzso zzso was zzso We demonstrated that not only being obese, but also overweight zzso body mass zzso or zzso zzso was independently associated with zzso zzso In our cohort of patients with zzso zzso zzso especially grade zzso zzso was significantly associated with elevated zzso zzso at entry, persistently elevated zzso zzso and stage zzso zzso Grade zzso zzso was significantly associated with a higher zzso activity index as zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso especially grade zzso zzso was independently associated with stage zzso zzso 

Being zzso serves as an independent risk factor for zzso zzso in zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso activity and progression of zzso and is independently associated with stage zzso zzso zzso in these zzso
