In the present study we measured the activity of some zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso metabolism in zzso zzso from 77 obese subjects of which 39 were zzso and 38 had zzso zzso type II diabetes zzso 28 subjects (19 zzso and 18 zzso had also a study of insulin binding to zzso 35 subjects zzso zzso 21 zzso underwent an insulin tolerance test for the evaluation of in zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso from diabetic obese patients showed significantly lower activities of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activities were similar in the two zzso In the whole population zzso and zzso activities zzso correlated with zzso and zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso Neither plasma insulin levels nor zzso specific insulin binding to zzso were significantly correlated with any of the zzso activities zzso zzso the zzso of insulin action generated by insulin tolerance test significantly correlated with zzso zzso and zzso These results indicate that in obese subjects the presence of diabetes is associated with a reduced activity of some zzso of zzso metabolism in zzso zzso This multiple zzso zzso is correlated with the impairment of in zzso insulin zzso
