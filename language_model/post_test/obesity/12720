To determine whether moderately obese, zzso sleep zzso patients are distinguished from normal obese individuals by differences in waking pulmonary function and respiratory zzso we compared the waking pulmonary function, zzso and hypoxic zzso responses of 35 zzso sleep zzso patients (32 men and 3 zzso with those of 17 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso control subjects (16 men and 1 zzso The waking zzso response to zzso was lower among sleep zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso Patients with sleep zzso demonstrated a higher waking zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso and a lower waking zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso The waking hypoxic zzso response, however, was not significantly different between the zzso Moreover, control subjects had a higher total lung capacity than sleep zzso patients zzso zzso zzso L and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, p zzso The lower zzso zzso response, higher waking zzso and lower total lung capacity in the sleep zzso patients resemble the pattern observed in patients with zzso zzso This suggests that disturbances in pulmonary function and zzso control in moderately obese sleep zzso patients are intermediate along a zzso from normal obesity to the zzso zzso
