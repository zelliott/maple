To compare the degree of zzso between plasma and zzso zzso for screening of diabetes zzso in zzso 

The plasma and zzso zzso of 119 adolescents aged zzso zzso zzso males and 83 zzso from public schools in zzso Rio de zzso State, Brazil, were verified after a zzso zzso zzso was assessed through zzso statistics zzso zzso zzso test, and the zzso correlation zzso zzso The paired zzso zzso for comparison of means, the approaches by Altman and zzso and the zzso plot were also zzso 

Mean values of plasma zzso were zzso points higher than the zzso values zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso A regular agreement between the methods zzso zzso zzso p zzso for assessing proportions of adolescents with zzso or zzso zzso is zzso Using the strategy of adding 8 zzso to the zzso levels, the agreement improved zzso zzso zzso p zzso and a significant difference was not observed between the estimated zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The results suggest a satisfactory agreement between the two methods when zzso zzso is corrected, and this may be a useful and low-cost tool for the zzso investigation of diabetes zzso prevalence in zzso
