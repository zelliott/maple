zzso patients with zzso sleep zzso zzso are improved by weight reduction, although the underlying mechanisms are not zzso We tested the hypothesis that improvement in zzso after weight loss is associated with improvement in zzso zzso zzso we measured zzso area at functional residual capacity zzso and at residual volume zzso the percent change in zzso area between zzso and RV zzso zzso defined as zzso - zzso zzso 100, and lung volume dependence of zzso area zzso defined as the difference between zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso reserve volume zzso 12 overweight zzso patients before and after weight zzso We found that after a 26 zzso 18 zzso weight loss, there was a significant reduction in the zzso index from 57 zzso 29 to 14 zzso 10 zzso less than zzso and increase in the lowest nocturnal oxygen zzso from 54 zzso zzso to 80 zzso zzso zzso less than zzso This improvement was associated with a significant reduction in delta zzso from 25 zzso zzso to 9 zzso zzso zzso less than zzso and a significant decrease in zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso less than zzso There were four patients in whom baseline zzso was low and relatively unchanged after weight zzso Three of these patients exhibited paradoxical zzso narrowing of the zzso which reversed after weight zzso these zzso abnormalities were not present in the rest of the patients with zzso We conclude that improvement in zzso sleep zzso after weight loss may be related to improvement in zzso and zzso zzso
