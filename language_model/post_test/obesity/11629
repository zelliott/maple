The activities of two distinct zzso zzso zzso were measured in zzso hearts and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso rat which is zzso zzso and insulin zzso The specific activity of zzso which requires zzso was similar in the zzso of lean and zzso female rats and in male zzso rats, but these activities were about zzso higher than in lean zzso There was a correlation between the specific activity of zzso and the zzso of zzso and serum zzso in the zzso but not in the zzso zzso treatment of the zzso rats with ethanol did not significantly alter the zzso activity of zzso or the zzso of zzso or serum zzso zzso activities of zzso in the heart were higher in the lean compared to the zzso zzso There was no significant difference for the zzso zzso activities of zzso were over zzso higher in the subcutaneous zzso tissue of the zzso males and females compared to the lean zzso The differences were smaller zzso in the zzso zzso tissue of both sexes and in the zzso depot for the zzso zzso activity in the zzso zzso of zzso females was zzso lower than in lean zzso zzso activity was insensitive to zzso and did not require zzso for zzso Its activity was zzso higher in the zzso and hearts of the lean male and female rats than in the zzso zzso zzso treatment with ethanol increased the activity of zzso in the hearts of the zzso zzso but had no effect in the zzso zzso The specific activity of zzso was higher in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the females and in the zzso depot of the zzso males compared with the lean zzso zzso males had higher specific activities in all three zzso compared to lean zzso The tissue specificity and the sex differences in the specific activities of zzso and zzso are discussed in terms of their proposed functions in zzso zzso and signal zzso It is proposed that a decreased activity of zzso could be involved in the insulin zzso in the zzso zzso
