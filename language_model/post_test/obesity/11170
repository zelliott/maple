zzso and zzso have been proposed as playing a role in the zzso of insulin zzso We assessed the relationship between their serum zzso and insulin resistance in lean, obese diabetic and obese zzso We explore their relationship with inflammatory markers and zzso parameters in obese zzso We measured serum zzso zzso levels in obese zzso obese zzso patients and in lean zzso The zzso of serum zzso showed significant differences among the three zzso Higher levels of zzso occurred in obese diabetic and non diabetic compared to lean zzso Higher levels for zzso occurred in obese diabetic and non diabetic compared to lean zzso zzso correlated positively with insulin, zzso and with zzso in obese diabetic zzso zzso correlated positively with insulin and zzso in obese diabetic and zzso zzso zzso might be involved in the zzso of zzso Additionally, zzso might be a predictor of insulin zzso
