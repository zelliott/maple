zzso is a common problem among Type 2 diabetic zzso To investigate the role of energy expenditure in the maintenance of obesity in diabetic subjects, total energy output was measured during weight stability in 23 diabetic zzso 8 lean, 5 overweight, and 10 zzso Free living total energy expenditure was measured over 14 days using doubly zzso water method, resting zzso rate by indirect zzso and urinary energy losses were zzso Total energy output was higher in the obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 24 zzso than normal weight patients zzso zzso zzso zzso 24 zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 24 zzso in the zzso None of the lean but four of the obese had total energy zzso 16 zzso 24 zzso zzso energy losses accounted for only zzso of total energy output in lean, zzso in overweight, and zzso in zzso zzso zzso rate was significantly higher in obese zzso zzso zzso zzso 24 zzso compared to lean zzso zzso zzso p zzso and resting zzso rate correlated with lean body mass zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso plus physical activity was substantial and not lower in the obese zzso versus lean zzso zzso 24 zzso The mean ratio of total energy expenditure to resting zzso rate was in the moderate exercise category and similar in lean zzso and obese zzso zzso zzso rate, total energy zzso and zzso and physical activity were similar in all three groups when corrected for differences in lean body zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
