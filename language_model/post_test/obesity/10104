Little is known about the effects of intentional weight loss on the function of the zzso zzso axis of obese zzso We studied the zzso axis of 34 healthy obese women zzso mass index, zzso zzso zzso zzso before and after a zzso zzso zzso weight loss induced by a zzso weight loss program that included 12 weeks of a zzso zzso zzso zzso liquid formula diet, 6 weeks of gradual zzso and 6 weeks of caloric stabilization at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso subjects were evaluated twice: before caloric restriction and during the last 3 weeks of caloric stabilization with a zzso evening 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation zzso zzso zzso and cortisol values were compared to those of a control group of 12 normal weight zzso Before caloric zzso both zzso and cortisol responses to zzso were similar in obese women and normal weight zzso Weight loss did not significantly alter the zzso response to zzso however, the total plasma cortisol response to zzso decreased significantly with weight loss zzso under the curve, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso before weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after weight zzso P zzso zzso zzso also decreased significantly after weight loss zzso zzso 1,050 zzso compared either to values obtained before weight loss zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso or to those of normal weight controls zzso zzso 1,400 zzso P zzso zzso for plasma free zzso either before or 180 zzso after zzso treatment, showed no significant changes in cortisol responses resulting from weight zzso As plasma free cortisol was not altered by weight reduction, the decrease in the total cortisol response to zzso after weight loss appears to be secondary to significant decreases in zzso zzso We conclude that when obese women lose large amounts of weight with a zzso zzso very low energy diet, such weight reduction does not significantly affect the zzso zzso
