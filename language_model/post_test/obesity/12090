The purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of obesity on cardiac zzso 

zzso is associated with an increased zzso of left zzso zzso zzso dysfunction, heart failure, and zzso 

Sixty male cardiac surgery patients were included in the study according to body mass index zzso to 25 zzso normal zzso 30 to 35 zzso zzso and age zzso years: zzso years: old) and divided into 4 groups of 15 patients zzso Right zzso zzso were analyzed for zzso function, markers of zzso cardiac load or zzso and zzso stress zzso The zzso state was further characterized in zzso blood zzso 

zzso resulted in disturbed zzso zzso and function zzso chain complex I) in the zzso of young and old zzso zzso zzso function was associated with signs of increased zzso stress zzso zzso content, zzso as well as zzso zzso by up to zzso zzso from older zzso and zzso and young obese patients demonstrated higher levels of zzso markers zzso zzso zzso and brain zzso zzso and zzso zzso with increased zzso and zzso zzso zzso C release, and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso metabolism and zzso release were zzso in old zzso and zzso and young obese zzso However, only minor zzso in most parameters were observed in obese subjects older than 70 years of age compared with zzso zzso zzso 

These data indicate that obesity results in premature cardiac aging in younger patients, which may contribute to an increased risk for heart zzso
