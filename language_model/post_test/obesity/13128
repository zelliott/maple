zzso weight loss is recommended for overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes, and zzso use of weight loss medication has been zzso The current study examined weight zzso and zzso effects of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso at 6 months of treatment, using behavioral intervention zzso combined with randomized, zzso zzso zzso treatment with zzso zzso 

zzso control, insulin sensitivity zzso regional fat distribution, and fat content in liver and muscle were measured in 39 volunteers with type 2 diabetes in whom all zzso medication was withdrawn 1 month preceding zzso Weight loss was equivalent in the zzso and zzso groups, respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and there were identical decreases in visceral zzso tissue zzso fat mass zzso thigh zzso and zzso zzso 

Weight loss resulted in substantial improvement zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso IS improved significantly more with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso P zzso and plasma free fatty acid zzso levels were strongly correlated with IS zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso caused greater reductions in zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso 22 zzso zzso zzso 33 zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 23 zzso zzso zzso 34 zzso zzso P zzso and zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso P zzso zzso Changes in zzso were correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso but not with weight loss per zzso 

At equivalent weight loss, zzso use of zzso resulted in greater improvement in zzso levels and zzso
