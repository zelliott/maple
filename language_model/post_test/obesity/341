We sought to derive zzso reference values for the zzso great vessels using zzso zzso zzso zzso in a healthy zzso non-obese population free of cardiovascular zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the chest has traditionally been used to evaluate normal great vessel anatomy for prognosis and zzso However, zzso zzso chest CT cannot account for the zzso zzso expansion, and zzso motion of the great vessels during the cardiac cycle and may zzso patients as normal or abnormal for zzso and management zzso To date, zzso reference values for zzso zzso great vessel diameters have not been established using current generation zzso zzso zzso row zzso A total of 103 zzso women, age 51 zzso 14 zzso consecutive zzso non-obese adults free of zzso or great vessel structural disease, zzso or significant coronary artery disease were studied by zzso zzso underwent examination for determination of zzso zzso pulmonary artery zzso and superior zzso zzso zzso dimensions in zzso short axes for comparison with the ascending zzso and the zzso cardiac zzso 

For right sided great vessels, the 5th to 95th zzso was zzso zzso for zzso PA diameter and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso The pulmonary artery to ascending zzso zzso ratio was zzso In zzso analysis, the PA was significantly associated with weight, whereas the zzso ratio was zzso associated with zzso zzso PA zzso were significantly higher and zzso zzso significantly lower than corresponding short axis zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso 

This study establishes zzso zzso reference values for zzso great vessel dimensions derived from a healthy population of individuals free of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and zzso The traditional zzso zzso zzso value of 1 for pulmonary hypertension is a poor diagnostic tool because it encompasses normal patients and is zzso affected by zzso zzso great vessels should be measured by CT in zzso zzso zzso for accurate zzso These data may serve as a reference to identify zzso great vessel pathology in individuals being referred for zzso zzso zzso
