We measured plasma zzso of zzso zzso and the other large neutral zzso acids zzso in 6 control and 7 obese subjects before and after they consumed a zzso zzso modified zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in control subjects were also assessed after supplemental oral zzso zzso of the zzso diet by non-obese subjects, or obesity per se, caused major reductions in the ratio of the plasma zzso concentration to the summed plasma zzso of the other zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and may thus have diminished brain zzso zzso Administration of even 2 g of supplemental zzso did not elevate the plasma zzso ratio beyond the normal range observed previously in subjects consuming zzso zzso
