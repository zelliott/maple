zzso with the zzso regimen zzso zzso markedly reduces risk of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with risk of zzso zzso and zzso zzso This study investigates how obesity influences risk of zzso zzso after prolonged treatment with zzso versus zzso 

Our analysis included subjects enrolled in the phase III zzso zzso prevention clinical trial investigating zzso versus zzso Patients were classified by obesity zzso mass index, zzso status at zzso zzso zzso statistic and zzso U test were used to compare baseline zzso including zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to determine the risk ratio zzso of zzso zzso adjusted for zzso and an interaction term for obesity and zzso 

The final zzso cohort was comprised of 267 zzso In separate zzso models, the risk of zzso recurrence after treatment compared to zzso was similar for obese zzso zzso zzso zzso and non-obese patients zzso zzso zzso zzso No significant interaction was detected between zzso treatment, and risk of zzso zzso in the full zzso model zzso zzso 

zzso does not substantially modify the zzso zzso risk reduction ascribed to zzso versus zzso
