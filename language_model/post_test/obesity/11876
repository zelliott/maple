Despite adolescent black females experiencing the highest rates of zzso the effect of excess fat mass on bone structure and strength in this population is zzso Our findings in zzso black females suggest that excess weight in the form of fat mass may adversely influence cortical bone structure and zzso 

Although adolescent obesity has been associated with reduced bone structure and strength in white zzso this relationship has not been studied in adolescent black zzso a population experiencing the highest rates of zzso Our objective was to compare bone structure and strength between zzso black females with normal and high levels of zzso 

Black females with zzso zzso body fat were classified as normal body fat zzso zzso zzso 33, aged zzso zzso zzso zzso females exceeding this zzso were classified as high body fat zzso zzso zzso 15, aged zzso zzso zzso zzso Using peripheral quantitative zzso zzso zzso and zzso bones were scanned at the zzso zzso and zzso zzso sites from the zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso and zzso fat were assessed by zzso X-ray zzso 

After controlling for either zzso or body weight, the zzso zzso zzso group had lower total zzso area zzso zzso cortical zzso zzso and zzso index zzso zzso at the cortical site of the zzso (all p zzso At the cortical site of the zzso the zzso zzso zzso group had lower total zzso zzso p zzso zzso cortical zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso p zzso zzso after control for body zzso There were no group differences in either the zzso cortical bone values at the radius or in the zzso bone parameters zzso zzso or zzso at the zzso and zzso 

zzso with our zzso and bone data in zzso white zzso our findings in black females entering adulthood also suggest that obesity may adversely influence cortical bone zzso
