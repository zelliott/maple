To determine the effect of maternal zzso zzso diabetes zzso zzso and zzso on the expression of genes involved in fatty acid zzso zzso synthesis and zzso 

Human subcutaneous and zzso zzso zzso were obtained from lean, overweight and obese normal zzso tolerant zzso women and women with zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed to determine the level of zzso zzso tissue zzso were performed to determine the effect of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso tissue gene zzso 

zzso maternal obesity and zzso are associated with decreased expression in genes involved in fatty acid zzso and zzso transport zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene expression was also observed for the zzso factors involved in zzso metabolism zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso On the other hand, the gene expression of the zzso zzso zzso and or zzso was increased in zzso tissue from obese and zzso zzso zzso in zzso studies revealed that these zzso decreased the gene expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso complicated by pre-existing maternal obesity and zzso are associated with abnormal zzso tissue zzso zzso which may play a role in the zzso of these zzso
