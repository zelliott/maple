zzso was identified as an zzso with zzso effects, which is predominantly zzso from visceral zzso tissue in a rat model of type 2 zzso We have recently shown that zzso zzso expression in zzso tissue is related to parameters of obesity and zzso zzso However, the regulation of zzso serum zzso in human obesity and type 2 diabetes is zzso 

For the measurement of zzso serum zzso we developed an zzso zzso zzso zzso Using this zzso we assessed circulating zzso in a zzso study of zzso subjects with a wide range of zzso body fat distribution, insulin sensitivity, and zzso tolerance and in 60 individuals with normal zzso tolerance zzso impaired zzso tolerance zzso or type 2 diabetes before and after a zzso physical training zzso 

zzso serum zzso were significantly higher in female compared with male zzso There was no difference in circulating zzso between individuals with zzso and type 2 zzso In the normal zzso group, circulating zzso significantly correlated with zzso and insulin zzso Moreover, physical training for 4 weeks resulted in significantly increased circulating zzso zzso 

We found a sexual zzso in circulating zzso zzso zzso serum zzso are associated with obesity and impaired insulin sensitivity, whereas type 2 diabetes seems to abrogate the correlation between increased circulating zzso higher body weight, and decreased insulin zzso Low circulating zzso zzso with a high fitness level, whereas physical training in untrained individuals causes increased zzso serum zzso
