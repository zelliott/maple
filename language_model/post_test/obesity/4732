To evaluate the zzso zzso zzso and zzso oxide zzso levels in obese and lean patients with zzso zzso syndrome zzso and find out their relation with hormonal and zzso zzso 

Twenty-two obese, 18 lean patients with zzso and 11 obese, 24 lean healthy control patients were enrolled zzso Plasma zzso and NO levels and zzso ratio were evaluated on 3rd day of zzso cycle after at least 10 h overnight zzso 

Plasma zzso NO levels and zzso ratio were similar in the zzso zzso level did not correlate with the hormonal and zzso parameters in patients with zzso However, NO correlated zzso with zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso model of insulin resistance zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso ratio also correlated zzso with zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis the risk of low NO was associated independently with high zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and high zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso resistance may be the underlying mechanism of zzso dysfunction through NO zzso in zzso
