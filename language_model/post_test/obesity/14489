To establish whether the frequent finding of a zzso increase in plasma total homocysteine zzso causes coronary artery disease zzso the authors evaluated the number of zzso major traditional risk factors, as well as the major zzso zzso in patients with the same degree of zzso but different zzso zzso 

The authors studied 180 patients with zzso who were divided into three groups according to zzso zzso 60 patients with normal zzso 60 patients with moderate zzso zzso zzso and 60 patients with intermediate zzso zzso zzso zzso The patient groups were matched for zzso age and number of affected coronary zzso All patients were checked for the presence of traditional risk factors for zzso zzso hypertension, diabetes, zzso smoking zzso familial history, zzso as well as zzso of zzso zzso The population was subdivided into those having, or not, a substantial burden of traditional risk factors zzso zzso zzso or zzso 4, zzso 

There was a significant trend towards a reduced number of subjects within the group zzso or zzso 4 risk factors across increasing zzso levels zzso zzso zzso for normal, moderate, intermediate zzso respectively, zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and vitamin B12 zzso estimated zzso zzso rate zzso zzso zzso T zzso were the major zzso of zzso in this zzso 

In patients with the same degree of zzso those with zzso had a reduced burden of traditional risk factors as compared with those with normal zzso zzso zzso was significantly associated with an emerging zzso risk factor such as lower zzso
