The zzso of zzso zzso zzso was studied in seven zzso obese patients to determine the fraction of fat weight zzso that, when added to ideal body weight zzso will zzso the volume of zzso Seven patients zzso total body weight of zzso zzso were each given a zzso intravenous injection of zzso zzso serum levels over eight hours were measured by zzso A correction factor zzso of zzso was found to zzso the patients' volume of distribution zzso to zzso zzso when added to the patients' zzso There was no significant difference between peak zzso levels predicted using the actual zzso and using the zzso plus the zzso zzso using the actual zzso and those using zzso estimated by ideal body weight were significantly zzso In zzso obese patients, peak zzso serum levels can be predicted best when a volume of distribution based on zzso plus a correction factor of 38% of zzso is zzso
