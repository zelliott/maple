To describe three cases of zzso disease in children with multiple zzso zzso type 1 zzso as clinical manifestations of zzso are very rare in zzso 

A retrospective review of three cases of zzso disease diagnosed between 1997 and zzso zzso screening for zzso gene zzso was performed in each zzso 

An zzso zzso was diagnosed in three children, aged zzso years, presenting with growth zzso and weight gain over a period of zzso zzso All patients had successful zzso zzso zzso zzso was subsequently diagnosed in two of the patients, and in the zzso twin of one of the zzso A new zzso in the zzso gene zzso was identified in two of the patients and the affected members of their zzso In the third patient a de zzso zzso gene zzso zzso was zzso 

zzso has to be considered in all children with zzso of the zzso zzso and in those presenting with primary zzso The children and their families should be advised to seek genetic zzso We suggest that careful growth records be kept for children at risk of developing inherited zzso and, in the event of a decelerating growth rate, further diagnostic evaluation be undertaken with regards to zzso zzso zzso
