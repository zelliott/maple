To assess changes in body composition with weight loss in obese subjects zzso to a zzso adjustable gastric band surgical program or a medical program using a zzso diet and zzso 

Using body composition zzso by zzso zzso zzso for total body zzso and whole body gamma counting for total body zzso we studied changes in fat mass, fat distribution, zzso mass, total bone mineral content, total body zzso and body cell mass at 6 zzso zzso 61 zzso and 24 months zzso zzso 53 zzso after zzso 

At 24 months, the surgical group had lost significantly more weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was favorable zzso mass to fat mass loss ratios for both groups zzso zzso zzso zzso Changes in total body nitrogen or zzso were favorable in each zzso A small reduction in mean bone mineral content occurred throughout the study but was not associated with extent of weight loss or treatment zzso At 6 months, weight loss for both groups was similar zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The medical program subjects lost less zzso mass and skeletal muscle and had increased total body zzso The proportion of body fat to limb fat remained remarkably constant throughout the zzso 

Weight loss programs used in this study induced fat loss without significant deleterious effects on the components of zzso zzso
