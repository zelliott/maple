There is a lack of long-term studies for zzso syndrome after zzso zzso Our aim is to show the evolution of the parameters that define the zzso syndrome after zzso surgery, up to 10 years of zzso in order to clarify what technique gets better results with fewer zzso 

The zzso definition of the zzso syndrome was used for this zzso One hundred zzso zzso obese and zzso patients underwent vertical banded zzso Two hundred zzso zzso obese and zzso patients had zzso diversion zzso and modified zzso zzso and 152 zzso obese patients underwent zzso gastric zzso A mean follow-up of up to 7 years was done in all zzso 

Prior to surgery, zzso syndrome was diagnosed in 114 patients of zzso group zzso in 85 patients of modified zzso diversion group zzso in 81 patients of zzso gastric bypass zzso and in 98 patients of vertical banded zzso zzso When zzso syndrome parameters were evaluated at 7 years of zzso zzso to weight gain, these results changed nearby to zzso values in both zzso gastric bypass and vertical banded zzso zzso 

According to our results, the best technique to resolve zzso syndrome is the modified zzso zzso Due to its high zzso it only must be considered in zzso zzso In obese patients, the zzso gastric bypass may be a less zzso choice, but it should be coupled with lifestyle changes to keep away from the weight gain in the long zzso zzso procedures may be indicated only in a few zzso zzso
