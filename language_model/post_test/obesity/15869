The aim of the present study was to examine the extent to which food temptation influences zzso the zzso of food, and zzso the motivation to eat, and whether this effect differed between zzso and overweight zzso 

zzso zzso and overweight women participated in a zzso experiment, which used a zzso design with food temptation and body weight as independent zzso zzso tested the effect of these factors on wanting and zzso 

The most important finding of this study was that food temptation had a significant effect on zzso but not on zzso zzso was mainly influenced by zzso however, this effect was moderated by zzso Interestingly, temptation caused a decrease in zzso but only in zzso zzso This effect of temptation could not be explained by a change in affect after manipulation or a difference in hunger before the start of the zzso 

A possible explanation for the finding that zzso women showed a decline in wanting after the confrontation with highly palatable food may be that zzso women are protected by a higher zzso zzso Moreover, it is possible that in these women goals zzso for example, weight maintenance are more easily zzso which may remind them of the positive consequences of not yielding into zzso
