In zzso zzso in 26 female patients with zzso and zzso parameters were carried out before and after therapy by means of complex physical zzso therapy zzso including manual zzso drainage and zzso as main components and/or shock wave therapy zzso zzso stress parameters of blood serum and zzso skin zzso of zzso and zzso surface were zzso zzso stress in zzso and zzso was demonstrated by increased serum zzso of zzso zzso and plasma protein zzso compared with healthy control zzso Both zzso and protein zzso in blood plasma decreased after serial shock wave application and zzso The zzso itself and zzso itself lead to zzso release from zzso tissue into the zzso Obviously both therapy types, zzso and zzso mitigate zzso stress in zzso and zzso In parallel zzso improved significantly the zzso skin properties leading to zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso correlation between zzso depletion of zzso and zzso enriched zzso and improvement of mechanic skin properties was zzso From these findings it is concluded, that a release of zzso zzso zzso products from zzso zzso is an important zzso effect of zzso and/or zzso in zzso and zzso zzso of factors stimulating zzso and zzso such as zzso was not induced by zzso and/or zzso and, therefore, not involved in beneficial effects by zzso and/or zzso
