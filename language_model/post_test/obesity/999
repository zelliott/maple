zzso behaviors have been correlated with zzso We investigated whether changes in sedentary behaviors relate to changes in energy intake and/or physical zzso 

Experimental zzso crossover design in which children participated in three zzso zzso baseline and increased and decreased targeted sedentary zzso 

Thirteen 8- to zzso zzso zzso 

zzso behaviors were measured through the use of daily activity logs, physical activity measured with zzso and energy intake measured by means of repeated 24-hour recalls collected during each zzso Energy zzso energy zzso and energy balance per day were zzso 

Children showed significant zzso zzso increases of 50% and decreases of zzso in targeted sedentary behaviors from baseline during the increase and decrease zzso zzso There was a significant zzso zzso increase in energy balance per day zzso zzso when sedentary behaviors were increased, as the result of an increase in energy intake per day zzso zzso and a decrease in energy expenditure zzso zzso No significant changes in energy balance were observed when sedentary behaviors were zzso 

zzso sedentary behaviors had a greater influence on physical activity and energy intake than reducing sedentary behavior in zzso zzso In some children, changes in sedentary behaviors may be important to modify energy balance and prevent zzso
