In previous work it has been shown that adult male, but not female, offspring of rats that have either been injected with zzso zzso zzso on days zzso zzso or undernourished during the first 2 weeks of zzso develop significant obesity zzso at about 50 days of zzso The present experiment examines the question of whether rats with these two forms of obesity display zzso abnormalities in areas of the brain known to influence food intake and body zzso zzso gauge stainless steel guide shafts were surgically implanted using standard zzso zzso One week later 26 zzso zzso zzso were lowered into the zzso zzso zzso collected from male offspring in the two experimental conditions contain significantly higher zzso zzso levels than did zzso It would appear that in addition to sharing a similar time course of onset and a sex dependent expression of zzso both of these models are also characterized by elevated zzso zzso zzso Since this obesity appears only in zzso and at a time when testosterone levels are rapidly rising in zzso and since testosterone has been shown to elevate food intake and body weights in rats, we also investigated whether zzso weights or circulating testosterone levels were zzso elevated by our zzso
