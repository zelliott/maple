We studied the associations of zzso of zzso risk factors with plasma levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in healthy zzso zzso 

The subjects were a representative population sample of zzso children zzso years of zzso We assessed body fat percentage zzso X-ray zzso body mass index, waist zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure, zzso insulin, zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso and calculated a continuous zzso syndrome score zzso We also used factor analysis to examine whether zzso liver zzso are a feature of zzso syndrome among zzso 

Children with overweight or zzso defined by International zzso Task Force zzso criteria, had a zzso higher risk of having zzso and a zzso higher risk of having zzso in the highest fifth of its distribution than normal weight zzso Children in the highest zzso third of zzso syndrome score, body fat percentage, waist zzso and insulin had a two to three times higher risk of being in the highest fifth of zzso and zzso Moreover, children in the highest third of zzso and zzso had a zzso risk of being in the highest fifth of zzso zzso factor analysis yielded three zzso the first included insulin, zzso and zzso the second waist zzso insulin, zzso and zzso and the third zzso zzso waist zzso and zzso zzso factor analysis yielded a single zzso syndrome factor, explaining zzso of the zzso 

zzso of zzso risk factors, particularly excess body fat, is associated with zzso levels of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso levels of liver zzso especially zzso and systemic zzso inflammation could be considered features of zzso syndrome among zzso zzso changes in liver function may play an important role in the zzso of zzso syndrome beginning in zzso
