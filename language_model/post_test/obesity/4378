Low levels of serum zzso have been reported to be associated with zzso diabetes, and zzso zzso zzso as well as several zzso zzso knockout zzso mice have been reported to cause insulin resistance and zzso formation of the zzso We used zzso zzso mice fed a high fat zzso diet, and investigated the effect of zzso on the progression of zzso and zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso mice and wild type zzso mice were fed a zzso diet or normal zzso for the periods of 24 and 48 zzso The zzso diet contained zzso of calories from zzso 

The zzso zzso mice on the zzso diet showed zzso marked zzso of serum zzso levels, and zzso At 24 weeks, zzso expression of tumor necrosis zzso and zzso alpha zzso was higher in zzso mice as compared with zzso zzso At 48 weeks, liver zzso contents in zzso mice on normal zzso were significantly higher than those in zzso zzso zzso zzso spotty zzso and zzso zzso around central veins were observed in zzso mice on the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was more severe in zzso mice on the zzso diet than that in zzso mice zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso Liver zzso and zzso zzso developed in a zzso mouse on the zzso diet at 48 weeks zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas no tumor was detected in zzso mice zzso zzso zzso 

zzso may play a protective role in the progression of NASH in the early stages by suppressing tumor necrosis zzso expression and liver zzso
