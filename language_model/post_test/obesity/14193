A comparison of the plasma zzso and insulin day profiles between two zzso zzso insulin zzso insulin zzso zzso and insulin zzso zzso in 18 obese subjects with Type 2 zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso received subcutaneous zzso or zzso zzso zzso at zzso intervals immediately zzso 2 zzso before three standard test meals during each of two zzso zzso zzso crossover studies zzso zzso between zzso Overall, zzso zzso zzso zzso under the zzso were similar on the zzso and zzso study zzso However, the mean of the three zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso were lower with zzso versus zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso of insulin analogue were significantly higher zzso with zzso zzso for zzso Post hoc analysis showed a significantly faster zzso rate for zzso versus zzso in the first 30 zzso zzso zzso difference zzso zzso zzso Only two cases of zzso were zzso both from one subject during the zzso zzso When zzso is injected immediately before a meal in obese patients with Type 2 diabetes, zzso achieves significantly lower zzso excursions over zzso zzso faster zzso with higher and sustained zzso levels of insulin analogue was achieved at every meal with zzso versus zzso
