Worldwide breast cancer zzso constitutes a significant public health zzso Excess body weight is associated with zzso BC zzso zzso Recent studies have shown that the constellation of zzso insulin resistance and serum zzso levels are associated with the risk and prognosis of zzso zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso and zzso factor, found in the visceral fat, represents a novel zzso zzso acting as a zzso a growth factor and an zzso It plays an important role in a variety of zzso and stress responses as well as in the cellular energy zzso particularly zzso zzso zzso exhibits zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso function remains a controversial zzso zzso zzso levels are increased in obese zzso Also, zzso levels are significantly elevated in women suffering from zzso than in healthy controls independently from known risk factors of zzso zzso and zzso parameters as well as serum zzso of well known zzso High expression of zzso in BC zzso was reported to be associated with more zzso cancer behavior as well as adverse zzso Taking into account the zzso of zzso as well as its zzso zzso and zzso properties, a novel hypothesis is proposed whereas zzso may be involved in the zzso of zzso and may represent a missing link between zzso and zzso zzso could exert its effects on the normal and zzso zzso tissue by zzso and zzso zzso zzso could also be zzso by tumor zzso cells in an zzso zzso It could stimulate zzso zzso cell zzso invasion, zzso and zzso which is essential for BC development and zzso zzso zzso might be a novel risk factor as well as a potential diagnostic and zzso zzso in zzso In addition, zzso agents that neutralize zzso zzso or medications that decrease zzso levels or zzso signaling pathways downstream of zzso may prove to be useful zzso zzso The potential harmful effect on zzso risk due to vitamin B3 zzso acid, a natural zzso precursor in the zzso route leading to zzso intake is speculated for the first zzso In this hypothesis, the role of zzso in BC zzso and progression is explored as well as the zzso mechanisms that zzso the association between zzso and zzso in the context of a dysfunctional zzso tissue in zzso zzso of these mechanisms may be important for the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies against zzso
