zzso zzso fatty acids zzso have been zzso associated with impairment of zzso zzso although their effect on the zzso zzso either in obesity or health, is zzso 

zzso insulin, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso responses to 100 g of zzso in 400 zzso water were evaluated during simultaneous zzso of circulating zzso fatty acids zzso A total of 10,000 units of zzso (to increase serum zzso and 500 zzso of zzso (2 h before oral zzso zzso to reduce serum zzso were administered to seven obese zzso zzso zzso age 40 zzso zzso years; body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and seven lean (age zzso zzso zzso years; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Higher zzso levels and zzso total integrated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso responses were seen in the obese than in the lean zzso zzso integrated zzso responses to oral zzso zzso in lean zzso zzso and obese zzso zzso subjects were significantly lower than after zzso Total integrated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso responses were higher post zzso than after zzso in obese subjects zzso 

The inverse relationship in zzso and zzso responses in the obese group after zzso of zzso indicates that zzso changes between these two hormones may exist to ensure constancy of zzso zzso Our results suggest that in obese subjects zzso zzso of zzso was incomplete and could not prevent impairment in zzso tolerance after zzso rise in zzso These results may be important in understanding the role of the zzso hormones in zzso metabolism characterized by high zzso levels such as obesity and diabetes zzso
