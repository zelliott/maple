To evaluate the frequency of zzso fatty liver disease, the zzso serum levels, zzso profile, and insulin resistance in zzso zzso To relate these zzso variables with the risk of this disease in the population zzso 

The study was zzso and zzso with 46 zzso school children zzso female, 18 zzso mean age zzso zzso The control group consisted of 45 children, paired by age and zzso zzso zzso evaluated by zzso was classified as normal, mild, moderate, or zzso Also evaluated were serum zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and serum insulin levels, used for the calculation of the zzso Model zzso 

zzso ultrasound zzso were found in zzso and zzso of the zzso and control group children, zzso zzso of obesity was associated with high levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In the studied children, the risk of zzso was related to a trend to a higher percentage of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso there was no association with zzso acid zzso zzso zzso profile, or insulin zzso 

The high frequency of zzso fatty liver disease in both groups, evaluated by zzso zzso in zzso level children, independent of nutritional condition and without significant association with insulin resistance, emphasizes that especially in developing countries, other risk factors such as zzso deficiencies zzso vitamin zzso are zzso
