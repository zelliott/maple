In humans and most animal models, the development of obesity leads not only to increased fat zzso in classical zzso tissue locations but also to significant zzso deposits within and around other zzso and zzso a phenomenon known as zzso fat zzso The purpose of this review is to explore the possible locations of zzso fat in key zzso of cardiovascular control zzso blood vessels and zzso and to propose how zzso fat storage can play a role in the zzso of cardiovascular diseases associated with zzso In animals fed a high-fat diet, cardiac fat zzso within and around the heart impair both zzso and zzso functions, and may in the long-term promote heart zzso zzso of fat around blood vessels zzso zzso may affect vascular function in a zzso manner, as zzso fat cells zzso vascular relaxing factors, zzso zzso and smooth muscle cell growth zzso Furthermore, high amounts of zzso fat could mechanically contribute to the increased vascular zzso seen in zzso Finally, zzso of fat in the zzso zzso may limit the zzso of blood and zzso from the zzso which would alter zzso physical forces and promote sodium zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, zzso fat storage in key zzso of cardiovascular control may impair their functions, contributing to the increased prevalence of cardiovascular diseases in obese zzso
