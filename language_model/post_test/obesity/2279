The zzso zzso is not well zzso The aim of this study was to examine both mechanical and inflammatory zzso by comparing lung function with body composition and airway inflammation in overweight and obese zzso 

zzso and obese zzso zzso zzso adults with asthma zzso zzso zzso completed lung function assessment and underwent full-body dual energy zzso zzso zzso blood samples and induced zzso were zzso for inflammatory zzso 

In zzso zzso and zzso fat tissue and total body lean tissue were zzso correlated with zzso reserve volume zzso zzso in zzso fat tissue was not correlated with lung function, however there was a positive association between zzso and zzso lean tissue and zzso Lower body zzso and zzso lean tissue was positively associated with zzso zzso in zzso while zzso was positively associated with zzso and zzso fat tissue in zzso 

This study suggests that both body composition and inflammation independently affect lung function, with distinct differences between males and zzso zzso tissue zzso the zzso zzso in females and the mechanism responsible for this finding warrants further zzso
