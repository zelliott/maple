zzso overweight and obesity are growing problems worldwide, with increasing prevalence among even infants and young zzso The zzso nature of early overweight zzso identifying the factors contributing to early excess weight gain for successful zzso Early feeding practices may be particularly important in shaping long-term vulnerability to zzso How and what infants are fed can influence weight gain, zzso and energy metabolism during infancy and across the life course through a number of interacting zzso and behavioral zzso This article argues that these biological mechanisms interact with the social and behavioral context of infant feeding to create differential vulnerability to later zzso 

This article reviews recent research on the potential mechanisms linking infant feeding and risk of later zzso focusing on the emerging role of zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso components of zzso formula and solid foods and the practices surrounding feeding shape the infant zzso programming growth rates and body zzso altering metabolism and zzso promoting differential zzso zzso and shaping behavioral responses to foods and zzso 

The occurrence of chronic disease precursors at increasingly younger ages and the tendency of overweight young children to become overweight adolescents and adults underscore the importance of understanding this complex early exposure and intervening early to prevent the development of obesity in increasingly zzso zzso
