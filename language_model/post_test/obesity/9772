zzso in obesity increases the levels of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso but the zzso importance of this protein in regulating zzso insulin sensitivity in obesity is not zzso 

We generated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (also known as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mice were maintained on either a regular zzso or a high-fat diet zzso for 16 weeks during which time body mass, zzso zzso zzso and insulin sensitivity were zzso 

The zzso increased zzso levels in zzso tissue of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice had similar body mass and zzso assessed using zzso zzso zzso imaging, irrespective of diet or zzso On a control zzso diet there were no differences in insulin sensitivity or zzso zzso When fed a zzso female but not male zzso zzso mice had improved zzso tolerance as well as lower zzso zzso and insulin levels compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging demonstrated that improved insulin sensitivity was due to elevated zzso tissue zzso zzso Increased zzso zzso zzso in zzso tissue was associated with enhanced levels and zzso zzso of insulin zzso zzso zzso 

These data demonstrate that zzso zzso production in zzso tissue of female mice is effective for improving zzso insulin sensitivity in zzso
