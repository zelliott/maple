There is an assumption that people in developing countries have a higher total energy expenditure zzso and physical activity level zzso than do people in developed nations, but few objective data for this assertion zzso 

We conducted a zzso of zzso and PAL by using data from countries that have a low or middle human development index zzso compared with those with a high zzso to better understand how zzso variables are associated with development status and population differences in body zzso 

We performed a literature search for studies in which energy expenditure was measured by using doubly labeled zzso Mean data on age, weight, body mass index zzso in zzso zzso and PAL were zzso and zzso status was zzso zzso estimates of the mean effect by sex were zzso and the extent to which age, weight, zzso status, and year of publication explained zzso was zzso 

A total of 98 studies zzso studies from low- or zzso zzso that represented 183 zzso and zzso individuals were zzso Mean zzso zzso was lower in countries with a low or middle zzso than in those with a high zzso for both men and women zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso respectively, in men and zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso respectively, in zzso In zzso models, there was an inverse association of age zzso zzso and a positive association of weight zzso zzso with zzso for both zzso there was an association of age only in men with PAL zzso zzso There was no association of zzso status with either zzso or zzso 

zzso adjusted for weight and age or PAL did not differ significantly between developing and zzso countries, which calls into question the role of energy expenditure in the cause of obesity at the population zzso
