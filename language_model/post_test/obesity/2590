We attempted to determine sex differences in zzso zzso abnormalities in a relatively large middle-aged Japanese zzso The study population consisted of zzso men and zzso women who were 35 to 59 years zzso zzso abnormalities were determined using the Japanese criteria for zzso syndrome, and we evaluated the number of zzso abnormalities zzso by waist zzso In men, the mean number of zzso abnormalities increased as the waist circumference zzso In women, although the mean number of zzso abnormalities increased as the waist circumference increased, the mean number was less than 1 even in those with a waist circumference of at least 95 zzso According to the receiver operating characteristic curve, the zzso levels yielding the zzso sensitivity plus specificity for predicting the prevalence of one or more zzso zzso abnormalities were 80 zzso in men and 73 zzso in zzso However, the positive zzso value was as low as zzso in men and zzso in women, which may not be suitable for a screening test, especially in zzso zzso Japanese women seem to be resistant to zzso zzso zzso and waist circumference would not effectively predict the existence of zzso zzso In setting the zzso points in guidelines, a greater emphasis should be placed on the absolute risk of having abnormalities or zzso
