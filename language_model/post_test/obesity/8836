The relationship between zzso zzso and risk of zzso cell zzso zzso is largely zzso We aimed to examine the association between zzso measures and development of zzso and to demonstrate whether adherence to World Health zzso guidelines for body mass index, waist zzso and zzso ratio was associated with risk of zzso independent of sun zzso 

Study participants were participants in a community-based skin cancer prevention trial in zzso a town in southeast zzso zzso 26 degrees zzso In 1992, zzso weight, and waist and hip zzso were measured for all zzso participants and weight was zzso at the end of the trial in zzso zzso proportion ratios were calculated using a zzso model to estimate the risk of zzso prior to or prevalent in 1992, while zzso zzso with robust error zzso was used to estimate the relative risk of zzso during the follow-up zzso 

At zzso 94 participants had a current zzso and 202 had a history of zzso During the zzso follow-up period, 179 participants developed one or more new zzso We found no significant association between any of the zzso measures or zzso and risk of zzso after controlling for potential zzso factors including sun zzso There was a suggestion that short-term weight gain may increase the risk of developing zzso for women zzso 

zzso to World Health zzso guidelines for body mass index, waist circumference and zzso ratio is not significantly associated with occurrence of zzso cell zzso of the zzso
