Recent studies questioning the benefit of zzso zzso zzso screening have increased the need for evaluating factors contributing to zzso in levels and their clinical zzso An inverse relationship between body mass index zzso and zzso has been zzso however the clinical implications have not been zzso We performed a retrospective review of patients screened through our free screening clinic to delineate any relationship between zzso and zzso in an attempt to understand its possible clinical zzso 

The authors zzso reviewed data collected in relation to zzso values and patient characteristics from a community outreach program zzso information and screening for prostate cancer between June of 2003 and August of zzso 

Mean zzso of our patient population was zzso zzso zzso zzso and our mean zzso value was zzso zzso zzso Our data indicate a small, but statistically significant decrease in zzso for an increasing zzso with a zzso decrease in zzso for every unit increase in zzso 

Our study confirms the previously reported inverse relationship between zzso value and zzso The significance of this finding and its impact on the value do not seem to indicate a rationale to change the accepted abnormal value in obese patients and should be used in the context of the clinical scenario and other zzso altering zzso
