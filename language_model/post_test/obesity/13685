zzso zzso zzso which is a common liver disease in zzso countries, is associated with zzso hypertension, and zzso diabetes zzso zzso Since zzso II zzso zzso has been suggested to play an important role in liver inflammation and fibrosis, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether therapy against zzso system zzso may provide some beneficial effect in liver of an animal model of zzso zzso 

For 6 months, obese zzso rats zzso were treated as zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso group, zzso + zzso zzso group, zzso + zzso zzso group, and lean zzso rats zzso group as a zzso zzso were evaluated by zzso techniques using corresponding zzso 

All treated groups showed a similar reduction in blood pressure compared to zzso zzso zzso either with zzso or P improves insulin sensitivity and reduces zzso zzso level with respect to zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to modify both zzso zzso zzso displayed higher zzso zzso II levels and zzso together with a marked increase in tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso and transforming growth zzso zzso level compared to zzso Following zzso zzso either by P or zzso a significant reduction zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso compared to zzso zzso was zzso 

These results indicate that zzso II expression is increased in the liver of these animals with zzso Furthermore, zzso control by either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso blockade seems to provide a beneficial zzso concerning the inflammatory response to liver injury in this zzso zzso blockade of zzso could be a new approach to prevent or to treat patients with zzso
