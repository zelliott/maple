Changes in plasma zzso responses to zzso (1 zzso zzso were assessed after dietary zzso in obese and zzso subjects to determine whether the impaired zzso responsiveness to zzso in obesity is the consequence of obesity per zzso or of altered food zzso The mean plasma zzso response to zzso in 10 obese subjects was significantly zzso less than zzso higher after a zzso fast than when they were eating their usual zzso zzso increases were found when 6 of the subjects were studied after eating an 800 zzso diet for 6 weeks zzso less than zzso Plasma zzso and insulin levels were lower and zzso levels higher after zzso but not after the diet, compared to values on the usual zzso The mean plasma zzso zzso level was similar to that in zzso subjects and was unaffected by dietary zzso The peak zzso responses to zzso before zzso were zzso correlated with plasma zzso levels zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso Plasma zzso responses to zzso in normal weight subjects were also higher after zzso for 24 h zzso less than zzso and 72 h zzso less than zzso than after an overnight zzso Plasma zzso insulin, and zzso changes were similar in the obese and normal weight zzso Plasma zzso levels in the zzso subjects were slightly lower after 72 h of zzso We conclude that the increased plasma zzso responsiveness to zzso after zzso is not unique to obesity and is unlikely to reflect a reversal of the zzso impairment of zzso zzso The increased plasma zzso responsiveness to zzso after as little as 24 h of zzso suggests that it is a consequence of acute zzso deprivation rather than weight zzso The enhanced responses in obese subjects after 6 weeks of food zzso in contrast, are probably a consequence of weight zzso
