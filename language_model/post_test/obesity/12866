zzso from obese and lean zzso rats adapted to a control zzso or a high-fat zzso diet were prepared for the study of fatty acid zzso zzso partition between zzso and zzso and very low density zzso zzso zzso A first zzso kinetic study showed higher zzso zzso on a C diet by obese rat cells and an almost exclusive zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso being zzso higher in obese rat cells and enhanced zzso in both zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or no zzso Fat feeding 1) decreased zzso zzso zzso incorporation into zzso and mass zzso zzso and 2) abolished the zzso increase by zzso zzso zzso Similar but more pronounced effects were obtained in zzso lean zzso A second kinetic study using very short incubation times up to 1 h confirmed that fat feeding decreased zzso zzso and zzso greatly stimulating its zzso and production of zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso greatly decreased under zzso zzso remaining higher in obese rat zzso The drastic zzso of labeled and total zzso zzso zzso in obese and lean zzso rats by the zzso diet could be partly explained by decreased zzso zzso availability for zzso synthesis through its greater channeling toward zzso and, zzso by the altered zzso zzso zzso
