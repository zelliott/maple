zzso zzso in sympathetic zzso zzso is similar to zzso of the zzso area zzso in that its expression involves similar changes in signaling zzso We have shown previously that the zzso zzso obese zzso rats zzso expressed zzso in sympathetic zzso and that high blood pressure was reduced by treatment with zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we present additional zzso evidence for the zzso of zzso in sympathetic zzso from zzso indicated by failure of repetitive stimulation to express zzso in isolated superior cervical zzso zzso and zzso of baseline zzso transmission by a zzso zzso zzso We have also investigated the role of key signaling molecules in the expression of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso analysis showed a significant increase in the levels of zzso zzso and protein zzso C gamma zzso in zzso from zzso The ratio of zzso to the total zzso was markedly increased in zzso zzso suggesting increased zzso of this zzso Additionally, there was a significant decrease in the levels of zzso in zzso Furthermore, the neural zzso oxide zzso and zzso II, which are essential for the expression of zzso were significantly elevated in zzso zzso The present findings confirm that zzso from zzso have expressed zzso and that synaptic plasticity in sympathetic zzso may involve a molecular cascade similar to that of zzso of the brain zzso area zzso
