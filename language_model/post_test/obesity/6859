zzso calcium and vitamin D zzso are critical during all life cycle zzso This study aimed to characterize usual zzso of calcium and vitamin D from food and dietary supplements in specific zzso of Americans so that zzso and supplementation efforts may be targeted toward populations who are truly in zzso 

The National Cancer Institute method was used to estimate usual zzso of calcium and vitamin D by source and compared usual zzso to the established zzso zzso zzso for zzso residents aged zzso years using National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso data zzso 

These results showed for the first time that low-income, overweight, and/or obese minority populations may be at greater risk of calcium and vitamin D zzso Children aged zzso years were more likely to obtain recommended dairy zzso compared with older children and adults of all zzso Food zzso of calcium decreased with age in zzso Adults who used supplemental calcium showed a lower prevalence of zzso zzso and vitamin D zzso from food and dietary supplements were not related to vegetarian zzso zzso zzso of calcium and vitamin D above the tolerable upper intake level were low among all studied populations and zzso was not widely present across these zzso 

zzso and zzso supplementation and modest use of zzso with calcium and vitamin D may be warranted for targeting certain zzso particularly older adults, teenagers, minorities, and those who are low income and overweight and/or zzso 

This study aimed to characterize usual zzso of calcium and vitamin D from food and dietary supplements in specific zzso of Americans so that zzso and supplementation efforts may be better zzso zzso overweight, and/or obese minority populations may be at a greater risk of calcium and vitamin D zzso
