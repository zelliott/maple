zzso unstable shoes, which are widely available to the general population, could increase daily zzso activity zzso as the result of increased muscular zzso We compared the energy expenditure of obese patients during standing and walking with conventional zzso shoes versus unstable zzso 

zzso obese patients were asked to stand quietly and to walk at their preferred walking speed while wearing unstable or conventional zzso The main outcome measures were zzso rate of standing and gross and net energy cost of walking, as assessed with indirect zzso 

zzso rate of standing was higher while wearing unstable shoes compared with conventional shoes zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Gross and net energy cost of walking were higher while wearing unstable shoes compared with conventional shoes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In obese patients, it is possible to increase energy expenditure of standing and walking by means of zzso unstable zzso zzso use of unstable shoes may eventually prevent a positive energy zzso
