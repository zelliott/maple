To investigate zzso pressure differences between obese and non-obese adults during standing and walking protocols using a pressure distribution zzso 

Thirty-five males (age zzso zzso zzso zzso and 35 females (age zzso zzso zzso zzso divided into obese zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso and non-obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Data collection was performed with a zzso pressure distribution platform with a resolution of 2 zzso zzso zzso Novel zzso zzso The measurement protocol included half and full body weight standing on the left, right and both feet, respectively, and walking across the platform, striking with the right zzso zzso were evaluated for eight anatomical sites under the zzso 

For both men and women, the mean pressure values of the obese were higher under all anatomical landmarks during half body weight zzso zzso increases in pressure were found under the zzso zzso and zzso heads II and IV for men and III and IV for zzso Foot zzso during standing was also significantly increased in obese zzso For walking, significantly higher peak pressures were also found in both obese males and zzso 

Compared to a non-obese group, obese subjects showed increased zzso zzso and higher zzso pressures during standing and zzso The greatest effect of body weight on higher peak pressures in the obese was found under the zzso arch of the foot and under the zzso zzso The higher pressures for obese women compared to obese men during zzso weight bearing zzso may be the result of reduced strength of the ligaments of the zzso
