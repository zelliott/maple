The zzso A5 gene zzso is a major gene that regulates zzso metabolism and is modulated by dietary zzso A novel zzso zzso in zzso was identified to be associated with lipids in zzso association zzso 

We examined whether this zzso modified changes in zzso zzso in response to a zzso weight-loss diet intervention in a zzso zzso 

The current analyses were secondary analyses of a data set from the Pounds Lost zzso We zzso zzso zzso in zzso overweight or obese adults who were randomly assigned to one of 4 diets that differed in percentages of energy derived from fat, zzso and zzso for 2 zzso We evaluated changes in zzso serum zzso of total cholesterol zzso LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and zzso from baseline to 2 y of zzso 

After a zzso dietary intervention, we showed significant interactions between the zzso zzso zzso and dietary fat intake zzso compared with zzso in the determination of changes in zzso LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the low-fat intake group zzso of energy derived from zzso carriers of the risk zzso zzso zzso exhibited greater reductions in zzso and LDL cholesterol than did zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively), whereas in the high-fat diet group zzso of energy derived from zzso participants with the G zzso had a greater increase in HDL cholesterol than did participants without this zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our data showed better improvement in zzso profiles from long-term low-fat diet intake in the zzso zzso risk zzso
