Growth and nutrition during infancy are being viewed with renewed interest because of the possibility that they may be linked to cardiovascular and zzso health in later zzso Of particular interest are differences between zzso and zzso infants with regard to zzso intake and growth because zzso has been shown to be associated with a reduced risk of obesity in later zzso During the first zzso weeks of life there is little difference in growth zzso in weight and zzso between zzso and zzso zzso However, from about 2 months of age to the end of the first year of life zzso infants gain weight and length more rapidly than zzso zzso There are no consistent differences in zzso during the first 4-5 months of life, but during the later part of the first year of life the preponderance of the evidence suggests that zzso infants are zzso than zzso zzso zzso infants at 4-5 months of age show higher plasma levels of zzso growth zzso zzso insulin and certain zzso acids than zzso zzso Whereas the protein intake of zzso infants decreases with age and closely matches the requirements for protein during the early months of life, the protein intake of zzso infants exceeds requirements after the first 1-2 months of zzso The data are consistent with the hypothesis that differences in protein intake are mainly responsible for differences in growth between zzso and zzso zzso zzso in energy intake probably are responsible for differences in zzso observed in older zzso
