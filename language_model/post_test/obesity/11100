The zzso zzso of zzso in zzso tissue contributes to zzso zzso How zzso between immune cells zzso and sustains zzso tissue inflammation remains an unresolved zzso We have examined the hypothesis that zzso tissue zzso zzso interact with and regulate the function of T zzso zzso obesity was shown to activate the proliferation of zzso memory zzso T cells in zzso zzso Our studies further demonstrate that zzso are functional zzso cells that promote the proliferation of zzso zzso T cells in zzso zzso zzso from lean and obese visceral fat process and present major zzso complex zzso class zzso zzso zzso were sufficient to promote proliferation and zzso production from zzso zzso T cells in zzso and in zzso zzso obesity increased the expression of zzso II and zzso zzso molecules on zzso in visceral fat, which correlated with an induction of zzso proliferation in that zzso zzso these data indicate that zzso provide a functional link between the innate and zzso immune systems within visceral fat in zzso
