The aging process in higher zzso is increasingly being shown to feature a potentially substantial contribution from the zzso deterioration of zzso stem cell dynamics seen with the passage of zzso The precise zzso sequence producing this phenomenon is not entirely zzso but recent evidence has strongly implicated zzso downstream zzso of zzso pathways thought to be engaged by the obese state, specifically the insulin, IGF-1, and zzso signaling zzso Among the zzso zzso of these signals, a uniquely potent influence on stem cell dynamics may be attributable to zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso In particular, it has already been shown that specific zzso zzso activities, such as that seen with zzso zzso are presently thought to be associated with adverse health outcomes in numerous clinical zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso is thought to be contributing to zzso zzso zzso However, in addition to its contribution to organ system dysfunction, the zzso zzso has recently been shown to be activated by insulin and IGF-1, providing a tantalizing connection to nutrition and aging zzso The zzso pathway, in contrast, has long been associated with zzso zzso but has recently been implicated in zzso signaling as zzso zzso zzso signaling has, similarly to zzso zzso been implicated as capable of accelerating stem cell zzso The implications of these recent zzso in light of the recent finding of zzso attrition in humans associated with zzso are that the zzso zzso of aging may already be known, and the known common influence of these signaling elements on zzso stem cell dynamics is a pronounced induction of zzso an zzso that has been linked to the zzso evolution of zzso zzso dysfunction and the zzso zzso decline seen with the zzso passage of zzso Besides the obvious utility for the management for human age-related dysfunction that investigation of zzso zzso of these proteins would zzso interventions such as caloric restriction and possibly intermittent zzso may zzso influence stem cell proliferation dynamics and reduce zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the findings present in the present body of research may reveal zzso states that are compatible with zzso and will also provide novel insight into the specific zzso zzso of age-related zzso decline, ushering in a new zzso of medicine that fosters the management of the zzso of chronic disease and disability of aging, therefore zzso the suffering widely thought to be inherent in the latter stages of zzso
