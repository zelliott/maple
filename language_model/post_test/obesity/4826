zzso acid zzso is an zzso with therapeutic properties on several diseases like diabetes and zzso zzso is a novel zzso with potential beneficial actions on zzso metabolism and insulin zzso The aim of this study was to examine in zzso zzso the effects of LA on zzso gene expression and zzso as well as zzso the signaling pathways zzso We also tested the regulation of zzso zzso gene expression by LA supplementation in a model of high-fat zzso zzso LA increased zzso zzso but not zzso gene expression in zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso C induced an increase in zzso zzso production, and, on the contrary, the zzso zzso zzso completely reversed the LA zzso effects on zzso zzso also inducing a significant reduction in zzso zzso levels in this in zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were increased in those animals fed with the high-fat diet, while the caloric restriction decreased zzso zzso to control zzso However, zzso gene expression was not significantly modified in rats treated with LA compared with the obese zzso The current data suggest the ability of LA to zzso zzso zzso by zzso However the zzso effect of LA in zzso is not related to changes in zzso gene expression in our model of zzso zzso
