zzso systemic inflammation accompanies obesity and predicts development of cardiovascular zzso zzso cholesterol has been shown to increase inflammation and zzso in LDL zzso zzso zzso This study was undertaken to determine whether dietary cholesterol and obesity have additive effects on inflammation and zzso 

zzso mice were fed zzso zzso zzso zzso diets without zzso or with added cholesterol zzso for 24 zzso zzso on zzso zzso inflammatory zzso and zzso were zzso Despite similar weight gain between zzso and zzso groups, addition of dietary cholesterol increased insulin resistance relative to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and local inflammation were observed in zzso zzso tissue in zzso and zzso but were significantly higher in the zzso zzso zzso levels of the inflammatory protein serum zzso A zzso were zzso higher in zzso animals and zzso higher in zzso animals than controls, suggesting chronic systemic zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were similarly zzso zzso was increased in the zzso animals and further increased in the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso in zzso tissue is exacerbated by dietary zzso These local inflammatory changes in zzso tissue are associated with insulin resistance, systemic zzso and increased zzso in this mouse zzso
