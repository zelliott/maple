Little research has addressed the relationships among infant temperament, eating styles and obesity zzso To address this zzso we tested whether infant temperament and eating patterns at the age of 1 year are associated with a greater increase in standardized weight status, and greater obesity risk at 6 years of zzso 

A secondary, prospective analysis of the Colorado zzso Study was zzso The main predictor variables were infant temperament zzso is, zzso activity, attention zzso reaction to food and zzso and eating zzso zzso is, zzso to food, predictable appetite and zzso at zzso at the age of 1 year, along with the body mass index zzso of biological zzso The outcome measures were child weight and height zzso assessed at ages 1 through 6 years, from which zzso and zzso were zzso along with the standardized indexes zzso and zzso zzso status was zzso at each year as zzso 

A primarily White sample of 262 boys and 225 girls, assessed at ages 1 through 6 years, along with their zzso 

Among boys, greater attention zzso was associated with reduced standardized weight status gain zzso zzso and reduced obesity risk zzso ratio zzso zzso Among girls, greater zzso and negative reaction to food were associated with greater standardized weight status gain zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and increased obesity risk zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Biological zzso obesity status predicted obesity risk in boys zzso zzso and girls zzso zzso 

Male infants with less attention span, and female infants with greater zzso or a more negative food reaction, showed greater increases in standardized weight and were more likely to be zzso at the age of 6 zzso The role of infant temperament in pediatric obesity onset warrants greater zzso
