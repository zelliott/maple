We tested the hypothesis that muscle sympathetic nerve activity zzso would not differ in zzso obese zzso and zzso zzso men with similar levels of abdominal visceral fat despite higher plasma zzso zzso in the zzso We further hypothesized that abdominal visceral fat would be the strongest body zzso or regional fat zzso correlate of zzso among these zzso To accomplish this, we measured zzso (via zzso body composition (via zzso X-ray zzso and abdominal fat distribution (via zzso zzso in 15 NO zzso mass index zzso 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 9 zzso zzso zzso body mass index zzso 35 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sedentary zzso As expected, body mass zzso zzso 4 zzso 71 zzso 2 zzso total fat mass zzso zzso 2 zzso 12 zzso 1 zzso and abdominal subcutaneous fat zzso zzso 36 zzso 132 zzso 12 zzso were significantly higher in the zzso group compared with NO zzso However, the level of abdominal visceral fat did not differ significantly in the two groups zzso zzso 7 zzso 55 zzso 5 zzso zzso was not different between zzso and NO men zzso zzso 3 zzso 24 zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso despite approximately zzso higher zzso zzso plasma zzso concentration in the zzso zzso Furthermore, abdominal visceral fat was the only body zzso or regional fat zzso correlate zzso zzso zzso P zzso of zzso in the pooled zzso In addition, abdominal visceral fat was related to zzso in NO zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso Taken together with our previous zzso our findings suggest that the relation between obesity and zzso is zzso zzso The relation between abdominal visceral fat and zzso was evident in NO but not in zzso men and at levels of abdominal visceral fat below the level typically associated with elevated cardiovascular and zzso disease zzso Our observations do not support an obvious role for zzso in contributing to sympathetic neural zzso in human obesity and, in turn, are inconsistent with the concept of selective zzso zzso
