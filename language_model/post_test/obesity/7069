Previously, we demonstrated that soy protein ameliorates the diabetic zzso in several zzso models of obesity and zzso syndrome zzso This study was designed to further zzso factors related to zzso zzso control, and zzso function in male zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Animals were randomly assigned to one of four zzso control, zzso zzso low zzso zzso soy zzso high zzso zzso soy zzso or zzso + zzso zzso for 11 zzso At zzso zzso zzso and molecular parameters were zzso 

Body weight and total zzso were higher in zzso and zzso diet groups despite lower food zzso Additionally, these animals exhibited differential regulation of zzso proteins zzso and zzso and zzso activity zzso and zzso zzso animals had reduced total and liver zzso zzso control was prolonged in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Renal dysfunction was significantly reduced in zzso and zzso zzso as demonstrated by lower levels of zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso 

zzso these data provide evidence that soy protein with low or high zzso content may have therapeutic significance in reducing severity of diabetes, zzso and zzso disease as demonstrated in this zzso zzso
