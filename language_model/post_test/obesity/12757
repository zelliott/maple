The insulin zzso is expressed as two zzso that differ by a zzso acid region at the zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso These zzso are produced by zzso alternate zzso of the insulin zzso zzso To determine whether the relative expression of the zzso is altered in skeletal muscle in two zzso states, zzso and zzso relative zzso levels were measured using a zzso chain reaction zzso There were no differences in the relative amounts of skeletal muscle zzso zzso the zzso zzso form compared to the zzso zzso form of the insulin zzso among lean normal (30 zzso zzso zzso obese zzso (32 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that altered expression of insulin zzso zzso zzso does not account for skeletal muscle insulin resistance in zzso and zzso
