zzso mouse prone 6 zzso is a model of senile zzso From 10 to 22 zzso of age, zzso mice were heavier than zzso zzso and zzso zzso Body mass zzso of zzso and zzso zzso mice were higher than those of zzso zzso and zzso mice, indicating obesity in the zzso zzso We compared the blood zzso values among zzso zzso and zzso mice to assess whether the zzso strain has abnormal zzso zzso Plasma zzso zzso insulin, and zzso levels were higher in zzso zzso mice than in zzso zzso and zzso mice, whereas plasma zzso and zzso levels in zzso zzso were lower compared with those in zzso zzso and zzso Total cholesterol levels in zzso and zzso mice at 10 and 25 zzso of age were higher than those in zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were higher in zzso and zzso zzso mice compared with zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso mice exhibit obesity and zzso suggesting that the zzso strain is a potential tool for the study of zzso
