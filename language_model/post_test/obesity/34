To assess whether zzso or sympathetic nervous system zzso function might differ between lean and obese human subjects, studies of zzso and sympathetic responses to standard stimuli were undertaken in zzso Indians, an ethnic group with a high prevalence of zzso Plasma levels of zzso zzso and energy expenditure at rest and in response to zzso exercise, and graded infusions of zzso were compared in five lean and five obese Indians during a period of weight maintenance zzso after 3 weeks of zzso zzso and, in the obese, also after 6 weeks of zzso zzso zzso energy zzso when adjusted for fat free mass, was equivalent during zzso and increased zzso with OF zzso less than zzso in both zzso zzso responses to exercise or a test meal did not differ in lean and obese and did not change with zzso while zzso responses to zzso infusion fell during OF to a greater degree in obese than lean zzso less than zzso A similar pattern zzso effect in obese with zzso was also noted in the zzso response to infused zzso zzso less than zzso Although not zzso different in lean and obese, the plasma zzso concentration appeared to vary more in response to feeding or dietary zzso in the obese than lean, a finding that may reflect lower plasma clearance of zzso in the zzso These studies, therefore, raise the possibility that zzso in obese zzso Indians may limit the contribution of zzso zzso zzso to energy zzso though the implications of this for body weight regulation are zzso
