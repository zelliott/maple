To examine the relationships among zzso zzso breathing zzso defined as intermittent nocturnal zzso and habitual zzso and asthma severity in zzso We hypothesized that obesity and zzso are associated with severe asthma at a zzso year zzso 

Children aged zzso years were recruited zzso from a specialty asthma clinic and underwent zzso zzso and zzso assessment at zzso zzso severity was determined after 1 year of follow-up and zzso treatment, using a composite measure of level of controller medication, symptom burden, and health care zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to examine adjusted associations of zzso and obesity with asthma severity at 12-month zzso 

Among 108 subjects zzso age, zzso years; zzso zzso zzso zzso obesity and zzso were common, affecting zzso and zzso of subjects, zzso After adjusting for zzso race, and sex, children with zzso had a zzso increased odds of having severe asthma at follow-up zzso zzso zzso zzso was not associated with asthma zzso 

zzso is a modifiable risk factor for severe asthma after 1 year of specialty asthma zzso Further studies are needed to determine whether treating zzso improves asthma zzso
