In 59 treated or zzso zzso subjects and 52 obese subjects zzso or zzso zzso blood pressure zzso was compared to simultaneous zzso zzso In the zzso group, arm circumference was less than 35 zzso compared to over 35 zzso in the obese zzso The zzso cuffs were 12 zzso 35 zzso and 15 zzso 43 zzso zzso Mean difference between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was among the zzso -- zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso range + zzso - zzso and among the obese - zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso range + zzso - zzso Mean difference zzso zzso zzso zzso Phase V was among the zzso patients + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso range + zzso - zzso and among the obese + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso range + zzso - zzso Thus, a 15 zzso 43 zzso cuff used in obese subjects with an arm circumference exceeding 35 zzso gave quite as reliable zzso as a 12 zzso 35 zzso cuff used in zzso subjects with zzso dimension of the upper arm (less than 35 zzso It is emphasized that there is a wide scatter in the zzso differences, and it is argued that a comparison between zzso and zzso zzso should be performed in patients with poorly controlled zzso
