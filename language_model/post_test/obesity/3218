In animal models of zzso zzso of zzso within zzso is associated with zzso zzso However, whether zzso zzso deposition is a feature of human heart failure remains to be zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso zzso is a common feature of zzso heart failure and is associated with changes in gene expression similar to those found in an animal model of zzso zzso zzso zzso with oil red O and gene expression analysis was performed on heart tissue from 27 patients (9 zzso with zzso heart zzso We determined zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso function in hearts from 6 zzso diabetic fatty zzso and 6 zzso lean zzso zzso zzso zzso overload was present in zzso of zzso failing zzso The highest levels of zzso zzso were observed in patients with diabetes and obesity zzso zzso zzso deposition was associated with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso heavy chain beta zzso and tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso zzso overload in the hearts of zzso rats was associated with zzso dysfunction and changes in gene expression similar to changes found in failing human hearts with zzso zzso Our findings identify a zzso of patients with heart failure and severe zzso zzso characterized by zzso zzso overload and changes in gene expression that are associated with zzso zzso
