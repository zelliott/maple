7 zzso of cholesterol is a zzso reaction consisting of the replacement of the 7 zzso with a zzso zzso When cholesterol labeled with zzso at the 7 alpha position is zzso the zzso of the zzso will result in the loss of zzso which in turn will label the body zzso The rate of zzso enrichment of the body water could thus give a quantitative estimate of the zzso zzso This study describes the validation of the procedure with some 21 studies performed on 15 subjects in different zzso zzso zzso was administered zzso in 50 zzso of plasma and thereafter blood was sampled at timed intervals for 4 to 5 zzso The rate of the zzso of cholesterol was calculated from the time course of the specific activities of plasma cholesterol and body water after zzso administration and was expressed as 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso values of zzso in three control subjects zzso zzso zzso five patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso and seven zzso patients zzso zzso zzso are in good agreement with figures reported for zzso acid synthesis determined with other zzso zzso 7 zzso rate is reduced in patients with zzso the impairment being related to the severity of the zzso zzso administered to one subject for 4 weeks produced a zzso increase of the zzso Administration of zzso acid resulted in a 50% decrease, whereas that of zzso did not produce consistent changes of the zzso zzso The results support the current view that 7 zzso of cholesterol is zzso in the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
