zzso A zzso zzso zzso in the beta zzso zzso zzso gene has been associated with weight gain, insulin resistance and zzso zzso diabetes zzso zzso but the strength of these associations varies considerably between populations and the functional significance of zzso remains zzso zzso The zzso zzso was investigated in obese zzso zzso zzso 50) and obese zzso zzso zzso zzso subjects by zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of zzso DNA and zzso of the 210 zzso product by zzso The zzso zzso was found in zzso of all subjects, but there were no zzso for the zzso zzso subjects zzso for the zzso were more obese and zzso diabetics had a slightly younger age of onset of zzso zzso vs 51 years, respectively), but there were no significant differences in zzso frequency between the two zzso zzso parameters zzso zzso lipids and zzso zzso were similar among diabetic subjects with and without the zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the frequency of the zzso zzso of the beta zzso was higher in this obese population compared with some previous studies, but there was no evidence that zzso zzso an increased zzso to zzso among obese zzso subjects or that diabetics with the zzso fare worse in terms of zzso or zzso zzso
