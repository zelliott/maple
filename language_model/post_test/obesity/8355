zzso zzso of environmental pollutants have been positively correlated with diabetes and zzso syndrome in zzso zzso In turn, abnormal zzso function has been associated with the zzso The relationships between these zzso however, have not been zzso We developed novel zzso zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso zzso system without zzso extraction process and analyzed whether zzso circulating zzso zzso in human serum are associated with parameters of zzso syndrome and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activities were measured as serum zzso equivalent zzso in zzso using 10 zzso human zzso from 97 Korean participants zzso with zzso intolerance and 50 matched controls, average age of zzso zzso zzso years, 53 male and 45 zzso zzso were higher in participants with zzso intolerance than normal controls and were positively associated zzso zzso with zzso blood pressure, serum zzso and zzso zzso but not with zzso Body mass index was in a positive linear relationship with serum zzso zzso in healthy zzso When zzso cells were incubated with human zzso zzso generating power of zzso became impaired in an zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results support that circulating zzso zzso may directly reduce zzso function in zzso leading to weight gain, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our rapid zzso zzso using minute volume of human serum may provide one of the best monitoring systems for circulating zzso zzso good clinical zzso for the progress of disease and therapeutic zzso
