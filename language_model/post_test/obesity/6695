Recent zzso association studies have identified multiple zzso associated with zzso or the zzso ratio zzso However, evidence on zzso interactions is still scarce, and investigation of the effects of well-documented dietary and other lifestyle data is warranted to assess whether genetic risk can be modified by zzso We assessed whether previously established zzso and zzso genetic zzso associate with obesity and weight change in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention zzso and whether the associations are modified by dietary factors or physical zzso zzso zzso zzso completed a 3 d food record and were zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The effects of the zzso individually and in combination were investigated in relation to obesity and to zzso and zzso weight change by calculating genetic risk scores zzso The zzso were separately calculated for zzso and the zzso by summing the increasing zzso weighted by their published effect zzso At zzso the zzso were not associated with total zzso of energy, zzso or zzso The mean zzso and zzso weight changes were not affected by the zzso or zzso zzso During the zzso zzso a trend for higher zzso by the zzso was detected especially in those who reported a diet low in zzso zzso for zzso Based on the present findings, it appears unlikely that zzso zzso substantially modify the effect of lifestyle modification on the success of weight reduction in the long zzso In addition, these findings suggest that the association between the zzso genetic zzso and obesity could be modulated by the zzso
