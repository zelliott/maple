The role of the zzso 54 zzso of the fatty zzso protein 2 zzso gene on fat metabolism has been zzso Assuming that the effects of the zzso were modulated by gender and obesity which were related to zzso and zzso zzso we investigated this zzso and its effect on fat metabolism according to such zzso 

zzso were zzso zzso men and 126 zzso who were diagnosed as zzso by a 75 g oral zzso tolerance test at the zzso 

During approximately zzso years, 49 (24 men and 25 zzso were diagnosed with type 2 zzso In a Cox zzso hazards model, this zzso was not a significant variable in the zzso of diabetes in either zzso zzso non-obese men with the zzso zzso there was a significant zzso of zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso Women with the zzso zzso had significantly elevated total cholesterol zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso 

These results therefore suggested that the effects of the zzso zzso on zzso zzso and body mass index were associated with gender difference and obesity amongst zzso zzso zzso
