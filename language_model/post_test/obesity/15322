To examine association of different measures of serum zzso concentration and obesity with mortality in zzso 

Prospective zzso study initiated in zzso follow up examination after 12 years, and follow up study based on death certificates after 20 zzso 

zzso zzso 

zzso randomly selected women aged zzso at start of zzso 

Total mortality and death from zzso zzso as predicted by serum cholesterol and zzso zzso body mass index, and ratio of circumference of waist to circumference of zzso 

170 women died during follow up, 26 from zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration and zzso ratio were significantly associated with both end points zzso risk of total mortality for highest quarter of zzso concentration v lower three quarters zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso relative risk for zzso ratio zzso zzso to zzso These associations remained after adjustment for background zzso zzso cholesterol concentration and body mass index were initially associated with death from zzso zzso but association was lost after adjustment for background zzso zzso zzso concentration and zzso ratio were independently zzso of both end points zzso zzso zzso for total mortality for zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso for zzso ratio zzso zzso p zzso zzso whereas the other two risk factors were not zzso for total mortality for cholesterol concentration zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso for body mass index zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso risk profile appears to be different in men and women given that serum zzso concentration was an independent risk factor for mortality while serum cholesterol concentration was zzso zzso with previous observations in men, zzso of zzso tissue was more important than obesity per zzso as risk factor in zzso
