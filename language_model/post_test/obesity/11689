zzso zzso zzso were used to characterize zzso function in 12 zzso subjects with severe obesity zzso mass zzso Nine healthy subjects served as the control zzso In the obese group, zzso zzso rate zzso and zzso plasma flow zzso exceeded the control value by 51 and zzso zzso zzso zzso fraction zzso The zzso zzso suggested a state of zzso zzso zzso mainly or zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso rate and fractional zzso clearance increased by 89 and zzso zzso zzso zzso tolerance tests were suggestive of insulin zzso zzso resistance was positively correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso Mean zzso pressure was higher than in the control zzso zzso zzso of zzso of broad size distribution tended to be zzso The zzso of the zzso were estimated zzso by using a theoretical model of zzso transport through a zzso zzso This analysis suggests that the high zzso in very obese subjects may be the result of an increase in zzso zzso pressure difference zzso An abnormal transmission of increased zzso pressure to the zzso zzso through a zzso zzso zzso could account for the zzso in zzso
