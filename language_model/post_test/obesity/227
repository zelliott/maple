We investigated the effect of zzso acid zzso on the prevention of obesity in zzso zzso The mice were zzso zzso with water or zzso or zzso zzso for 6 zzso zzso administration inhibited the zzso of body fat and zzso lipids without changing food consumption or skeletal muscle zzso zzso increases were observed in the expressions of genes for zzso zzso alpha zzso and for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the liver of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene expressions were increased in zzso by zzso addition to zzso zzso However, the effects were not observed in cells depleted of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso by zzso In conclusion, zzso suppresses zzso of body fat and liver lipids by zzso of genes for zzso and zzso proteins by zzso zzso mediation in the zzso
