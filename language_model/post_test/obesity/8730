We determined differences in the rates of recall, zzso and cancer detection for screening zzso as a function of zzso 

zzso thousand three hundred zzso consecutive screening zzso examinations were performed from April 1985 to August zzso Patient weights were zzso to ideal weight correcting for height and were subdivided into zzso zzso including zzso by greater than zzso ideal weight zzso zzso overweight by zzso overweight by zzso and overweight by greater than zzso The rates of recall, zzso cancer zzso and cancer stage were calculated and were analyzed using the zzso test for zzso Cancer size was analyzed using linear zzso zzso 

Reliable zzso zzso and meaningful differences were seen between zzso of increasing zzso for rates of recall, zzso and cancer zzso An increase in recall rate occurred with progressively increasing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The rate of biopsy also increased with increasing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as did the rate of zzso cancer zzso of cases of cancer per 1000 women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, increased zzso also correlated with increased median cancer size zzso zzso and with more advanced stage at diagnosis zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso with progressive increases in the rates of recall, zzso and cancer detection for women undergoing screening zzso zzso zzso also zzso with increased cancer size and stage, providing further support for obesity as a risk factor for breast zzso
