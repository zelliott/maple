To estimate whether maternal obesity was associated with an increased risk for zzso zzso more than 1,000 zzso and whether there was an association between maternal obesity and causes of zzso zzso and mode of zzso 

A zzso cohort study including zzso women with singleton zzso who gave birth in Sweden from January 1, 1997 through December 31, 2008, who were divided into six body mass index zzso zzso zzso women zzso zzso were compared with zzso women concerning the risk for zzso zzso after suitable zzso The use of zzso drugs over the zzso strata was analyzed in a zzso 

There was an increased prevalence of zzso zzso over the study period associated primarily with changes in maternal zzso The risk of zzso zzso zzso increased rapidly with increasing zzso There was a twofold increased risk in obesity class III zzso No association was found between zzso zzso with retained zzso and maternal zzso There was an increased risk for zzso zzso for women with a zzso of 40 or higher zzso after normal delivery zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso women zzso and even more pronounced zzso after instrumental delivery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso women zzso zzso obesity was a risk factor for the use of zzso drugs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The increased risk for zzso zzso zzso in the obese group has important clinical zzso such as considering administration of zzso zzso zzso drugs to this zzso
