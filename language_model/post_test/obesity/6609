This study aimed to investigate the association of both body mass index zzso and waist circumference zzso with left zzso mass zzso in zzso zzso chronic kidney disease zzso zzso 

From 2004 to 2005, 206 consecutive incident adult patients from the zzso zzso clinics of two hospitals in Greece were zzso zzso criteria were the presence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were assessed annually for 3 zzso 

The mean age was zzso years, mean zzso zzso zzso and mean zzso was zzso zzso The median zzso was zzso g zzso zzso zzso In the zzso data, linear zzso models showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso and not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly associated with zzso After adjustment for age, sex, primary zzso disease, smoking and history of cardiovascular disease, both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly associated with zzso These associations were pronounced in zzso stage zzso but not in zzso stage zzso In the zzso analysis, linear mixed models adjusting for zzso showed that both an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly associated with an increase in zzso 

In zzso zzso zzso patients, both zzso and zzso were associated with zzso in zzso stage zzso but not in zzso stage zzso In the zzso analysis, both an increase in zzso and zzso were associated with an increase in zzso Future studies should focus on mechanisms responsible for the associations between zzso variables and zzso
