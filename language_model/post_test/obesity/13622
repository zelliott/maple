zzso is elevated in obesity and type 2 diabetes and is thought to be an inflammatory zzso within zzso zzso and to induce zzso zzso We investigated the zzso of nuclear zzso zzso a well-known zzso zzso factor, by zzso in zzso zzso 

Human zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso Using quantitative zzso Western zzso analysis, and gelatin zzso we studied zzso signaling in zzso vascular inflammation by zzso using the zzso inhibitor BAY zzso 

zzso significantly increased zzso zzso activity zzso zzso We also found a significant zzso of tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso inhibitor significantly negated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein levels, and zzso activity zzso zzso 

zzso zzso signaling in human zzso cells affects the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso suggesting an important role of zzso in the zzso of vascular inflammation in obesity and type 2 zzso
