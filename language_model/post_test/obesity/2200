To study the specific impact of diabetes on long-term mortality in very old subjects with multiple zzso and functional zzso 

The prevalence of vascular disorders, global zzso load zzso illness rating scale zzso and functional disabilities zzso of daily living zzso and zzso instrumental zzso zzso zzso were determined according to diabetes status in a cohort of zzso patients zzso age zzso years; zzso zzso admitted to our geriatric zzso Also, the specific impact of diabetes on zzso mortality was analyzed using Cox zzso zzso 

zzso patients had higher zzso scores zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and higher zzso of hypertension zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso heart disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not of stroke and zzso zzso They also had more zzso zzso score excluding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and functional zzso Diabetes was associated with mortality zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after adjusting for age, gender and zzso and this persisted after adjusting for individual vascular zzso but disappeared after adjusting for zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

Diabetes was associated with zzso mortality after adjusting for the inverse relationship between mortality and zzso This association was better accounted for by the global zzso load and functional disabilities than by the individual vascular zzso These findings suggest that the active management of zzso than zzso is the key to improving the prognosis for older diabetic zzso
