The zzso zzso is known to regulate host energy zzso and can be influenced by zzso zzso However, changes affecting the zzso at the functional level are still not well zzso We measured shifts in zzso bacterial communities in mice fed a zzso or high-fat zzso diet for 12 weeks at the level of the zzso zzso diversity and zzso distribution by zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso bulk and zzso chemical composition by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso via high-resolution mass zzso zzso diet caused shifts in the diversity of dominant gut bacteria and altered the proportion of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the impact of the diet on zzso chemical fingerprints is greater than the impact of zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso fingerprints of members of the zzso and zzso were also observed at the level of single cells, indicating that there were distinct differences in cellular composition of dominant zzso under different zzso zzso and zzso analyses based on the occurrence of zzso bacterial proteins and 86 zzso zzso revealed distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso of hormonal and zzso networks, zzso acid and zzso metabolism and shifts towards zzso acid and simple zzso metabolism were zzso We conclude that a zzso diet markedly affects the gut bacterial zzso at the functional zzso
