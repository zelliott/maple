To determine how zzso zzso and zzso zzso are regulated in a model of dietary obesity in relation to relative growth zzso and relative food consumption zzso 

zzso rats were fed a moderately high-fat diet for 14 weeks over which time animals zzso into zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso rates and zzso were calculated zzso Following the study, an zzso index was calculated and zzso nucleus zzso zzso expression was determined by in zzso zzso zzso or zzso protection zzso zzso 

Body weights were greater in zzso rats after 2 weeks on the diet compared to OR rats and remained different throughout the zzso zzso and zzso were greater in zzso rats compared to OR rats only during the first 2 weeks of the zzso zzso zzso rose in both groups during the experiment, but the increase was greater in zzso rats than in OR zzso zzso changes paralleled those for zzso ARC zzso zzso expression was not different between zzso and OR rats as measured by zzso and zzso 

Although zzso expression has been reported to be different initially in zzso and OR rats, this difference zzso following divergence of body zzso zzso and zzso data suggest the initial zzso zzso may contribute to increased weight gain of zzso rats during the first 2 weeks of the zzso Higher relative zzso zzso in zzso rats may be necessary to zzso differences in zzso and apparent zzso and insulin resistance of zzso zzso
