Body weight is tightly regulated zzso The recent discovery of the zzso hormone zzso has permitted more detailed evaluation of the mechanisms responsible for control of body zzso zzso is almost exclusively produced by zzso tissue and acts in the zzso through a specific zzso and multiple zzso pathways to decrease appetite and increase energy zzso zzso thus functions as the zzso component of a negative feedback mechanism to control zzso tissue zzso zzso evidence suggests that zzso may have wider actions influencing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso increases zzso turnover and sympathetic nerve activity to zzso brown zzso zzso Studies from our laboratory suggest that zzso also increases sympathetic nerve activity to zzso zzso and adrenal zzso However, systemic administration of zzso does not acutely increase zzso pressure or heart rate in zzso zzso Thus, longer-term exposure to zzso may be necessary for full expression of the expected zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso may have additional cardiovascular actions to oppose zzso zzso zzso zzso in high doses increases zzso sodium and water zzso apparently through a direct zzso zzso In addition, zzso appears to increase systemic insulin sensitivity, even in the absence of weight zzso Although we are at an early stage of understanding, we speculate that abnormalities in the actions of zzso may have implications for the sympathetic, zzso and zzso changes associated with zzso
