Weight reduction and exercise have been shown to help with zzso zzso and zzso in obese women with zzso zzso zzso We studied the relationship between insulin sensitivity and zzso patterns in 18 zzso zzso obese zzso zzso syndrome zzso women zzso with normal zzso zzso aged between zzso zzso with a body mass index of zzso zzso before and after a zzso diet and exercise zzso This program promotes healthy lifestyle factors, but does not lead to rapid weight zzso The zzso zzso and zzso factors of these subjects were compared to those of 10 zzso and zzso zzso women with regular monthly zzso zzso Before lifestyle zzso the zzso subjects had greater central obesity than regular zzso as assessed by percent central fat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso higher zzso zzso after zzso challenge zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso lower insulin sensitivity index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso higher plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and lower plasma sex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso subjects were classified as zzso zzso to the intervention if they regained zzso during the zzso As a result of intervention, R showed an zzso reduction in central fat, a zzso improvement in insulin sensitivity index, a zzso fall in zzso insulin levels, and a zzso reduction in zzso zzso None of these parameters changed significantly in zzso zzso At the end of the study, R had lower zzso insulin (R, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels (R, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but similar zzso levels compared to zzso We conclude that lifestyle modification without rapid weight loss leads to a reduction of central fat and improved insulin sensitivity, which restores zzso in overweight zzso women with zzso zzso modification is the best initial management for obese women seeking to improve their zzso zzso
