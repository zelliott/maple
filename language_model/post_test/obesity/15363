In rat zzso culture, the zzso gene is necessary for induction of zzso by zzso metabolism and zzso zzso To determine if this gene plays a role in regulation of zzso storage in humans we compared the response to zzso of the human zzso gene between obese and zzso zzso We measured the relative content of human zzso zzso in abdominal subcutaneous fat before and after a zzso zzso We found that zzso is strongly zzso in zzso subjects in response to the fast, but only minimally zzso in obese zzso There is an excellent correlation between the body mass index, and the zzso induced fall in zzso zzso There was no difference in the zzso zzso insulin, and zzso levels between the 2 groups of zzso zzso the zzso gene is zzso zzso during zzso in zzso tissue of obese zzso Further study of this gene could provide important information on the mechanism of the acquisition or maintenance of obesity in zzso
