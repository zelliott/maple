To investigate potential zzso mechanisms underlying the association between obesity and risk for zzso zzso zzso we studied the frequency of a common zzso of the zzso growth factor I zzso zzso gene in patients with either zzso zzso disease zzso zzso Barrett esophagus zzso and or invasive zzso 

Using a well characterized series of 431 individuals enrolled in a zzso study, we studied the frequency of the zzso gene zzso zzso 

On zzso analysis controlling for age and zzso in comparison to zzso controls, obese individuals with the zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to have significantly increased risk for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas obese individuals with the zzso zzso were not at statistically significant increased risk zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, compared to zzso controls, only obese individuals with the zzso zzso zzso were at increased risk for BE zzso zzso zzso zzso while obese individuals with the zzso zzso were not at increased risk for BE zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We conclude that the common zzso gene zzso zzso zzso the risk of obesity for zzso an effect most likely zzso by altered the zzso function by influencing gene zzso or zzso zzso These findings further zzso the zzso growth factor axis in the molecular zzso of zzso and represent a plausible zzso link underlying the association between obesity and zzso
