We examine the association between prior zzso and subsequent zzso and describe the effect of zzso age at prior zzso and obesity status on this zzso 

The study population included women with two subsequent singleton zzso in Missouri between 1998 and zzso The risk for zzso was assessed among women with and without prior zzso zzso The two groups were followed to their second pregnancy and the occurrence of zzso was zzso Additionally, the history of zzso prior zzso at zzso and obesity status were examined for their differential effects on the risk of zzso 

Women with prior zzso were zzso more likely to have zzso in their subsequent pregnancy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, this result was not significant when women with zzso in their first pregnancy were zzso After this zzso a more than zzso increased risk for subsequent zzso was observed in women with prior early zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while the level of risk did not change in the prior late zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that obesity status modified the risk of prior early zzso but did not affect the risk for prior late zzso 

zzso zzso in the first pregnancy may be associated with subsequent zzso regardless of prior zzso zzso
