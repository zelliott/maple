Weight gain is associated with a decline in insulin sensitivity and a zzso increase in insulin zzso IGF-1 is a plausible candidate to explain these divergent zzso In this zzso study, we analyzed the relationship between IGF-1 levels, insulin sensitivity and zzso in 110 zzso subjects with a wide range of zzso to verify this zzso 

zzso underwent zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso indexes for zzso and zzso insulin zzso were higher in obese as compared with overweight and zzso groups, while zzso disposal was zzso IGF-1 levels were zzso correlated with zzso and zzso indexes zzso and zzso insulin zzso and positively correlated with zzso zzso These correlations were no longer significant after adjustment for zzso In a zzso analysis, the variables associated with zzso disposal were IGF-1, age, zzso and zzso zzso zzso accounting for zzso of its zzso When zzso was entered into the model, the variables associated with zzso disposal were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso accounting for zzso of zzso In a zzso analysis, the only variable associated with zzso zzso and zzso insulin zzso was IGF-1 accounting for zzso and zzso of variation, zzso When zzso was entered into the model, it became the only variable associated with both zzso and zzso insulin zzso accounting for zzso and zzso of variation, zzso 

These data suggest that progressive reduction in IGF-1 levels may be involved in zzso changes in both insulin sensitivity and zzso
