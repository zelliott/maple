The objectives of this study were to test whether elevated free fatty acids zzso from visceral fat zzso is related to increased urinary zzso zzso and whether zzso has zzso protective effects by regulating vascular zzso growth zzso oxide zzso axis in rats with zzso zzso 

zzso rats were randomly divided into groups fed a normal diet, a high-fat diet, and a high-fat diet plus zzso Blood and urine samples were zzso zzso function was determined by measuring zzso zzso zzso of the zzso Renal zzso were collected for zzso zzso zzso NO and zzso expression were measured by zzso reaction and Western zzso zzso 

At the end of 24 weeks, plasma zzso and zzso levels significantly increased in the obese zzso zzso intervention decreased serum zzso and zzso levels by zzso and 48 zzso respectively, accompanied by a reduced visceral fat zzso zzso zzso ratio increased in obese rats, which decreased zzso % after zzso zzso Severe zzso impairment was observed in obese zzso this was partially improved by zzso zzso expression in zzso increased in obese rats, indicating increased zzso cell zzso zzso rats showed increased zzso zzso expression and reduced NO zzso This zzso of zzso axis was partially improved by zzso 

zzso circulating zzso level may cause increased zzso in obese rats due to impairment of zzso increased zzso can be improved by zzso zzso The mechanism may be related to zzso zzso of zzso axis and zzso zzso
