The present study tested the hypothesis that a saturated fatty acid zzso diet is more zzso than diets with lower zzso zzso In 8 female zzso rats fed a zzso canola or a zzso zzso diets at zzso of energy for 26 days, body weight gain, final body weight, obesity index, and food and energy intake were zzso zzso rats were fed canola or zzso zzso diets zzso of zzso or zzso for 50 zzso then high-fat feeding was followed by ad zzso low-fat feeding zzso of zzso for 28 days and by a zzso low-fat diet for 32 zzso zzso feeding resulted in a greater body weight gain zzso zzso final body weight zzso zzso and energy intake zzso zzso in zzso rats than in zzso and zzso controls, after 26 or 50 zzso Ad zzso canola and butter low-fat diets or zzso feeding resulted in similar weight change, whereas zzso low-fat diets led to comparable weight loss and final zzso zzso animals adjusted their intake based on diet energy density, whereas zzso and zzso animals failed to do zzso zzso fat zzso zzso zzso and plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso were higher in zzso controls than in zzso rats, but comparable with those of zzso zzso zzso and resistant zzso were detected with high-fat zzso In conclusion, only feeding the zzso zzso diet led to obesity development and failure to adjust intake based on the energy density and preserving body fat even after weight zzso The high availability of zzso foods in today's zzso environment could contribute to develop and maintain zzso
