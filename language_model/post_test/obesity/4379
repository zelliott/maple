Single zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso located within zzso gene have been identified as the strongest common genetic risk factors for development of type 2 diabetes zzso We hypothesized that these genetic zzso might increase the risk of zzso through regulation of alternative zzso or expression level of zzso in human zzso zzso 

zzso of 13 zzso detecting alternatively spliced forms of zzso was measured by quantitative zzso zzso zzso in paired zzso of zzso and subcutaneous zzso tissue from 159 obese individuals zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in both types of zzso tissue was not associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso status and blood levels of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso detecting zzso alternative zzso of zzso was higher in subcutaneous compared to zzso zzso tissue by zzso fold zzso zzso zzso zzso fold zzso zzso zzso and zzso fold zzso zzso zzso in the control group and by zzso fold zzso zzso zzso zzso fold zzso zzso zzso and zzso fold zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso A zzso enrichment analysis on transcripts significantly zzso with zzso in a zzso set combined with individual expression zzso suggested zzso roles of zzso zzso forms in regulation of transcription, signal zzso and cell zzso 

zzso of zzso alternatively spliced forms may have different functional roles in zzso and subcutaneous zzso tissue but is not associated with zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso
