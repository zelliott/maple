Although obese patients represent a high risk group and reports document the occurrence of sudden unexplained deaths in the early zzso period, no data exist to delineate the existence, extent or duration of zzso in obese zzso Twenty adults undergoing zzso bypass for zzso zzso zzso with a mean weight of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a mean age of zzso zzso zzso years, were zzso While breathing room air, zzso blood was collected from each patient, placed in ice and analyzed within ten zzso A zzso sample was zzso then samples were analyzed two hours zzso and on zzso days one through zzso zzso in the obese patients there was a significant reduction in zzso oxygen tension, mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in control patients matched for zzso There was also a difference in the slope of the zzso equation of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso being significantly greater in the obese group zzso zzso zzso zzso there was a further fall in zzso zzso in mean zzso in the obese group in zzso zzso averaged zzso two hours zzso zzso zzso zzso on day one zzso zzso zzso on day two zzso zzso zzso on day three zzso zzso and zzso on day four zzso zzso zzso was not significantly different from the zzso zzso Base excess was elevated on days two, three and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Our findings indicate that in obese zzso 1) zzso the fall in zzso with increasing age is greater than in control zzso 2) Starting with a low zzso zzso during zzso days one through four, the fall in zzso often reaches dangerous zzso and 3) zzso of blood buffer on days two, three and four can further zzso zzso at a time when the zzso has been shown to be at its lowest zzso This zzso due to zzso zzso can further accentuate the already zzso zzso Because of these findings, we suggest careful monitoring of zzso blood gases in obese patients and the administration of oxygen and appropriate zzso solutions zzso to reduce the increased morbidity and zzso
