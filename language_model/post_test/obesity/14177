Prior reports suggest that obesity is zzso associated with screening zzso zzso zzso levels and may reduce screening zzso 

We evaluated data on zzso men screened for prostate cancer during an annual physical examination program administered by zzso International, zzso between zzso and zzso Of these, zzso men returned for additional physical exams during this zzso We used zzso linear zzso analyses to determine whether higher zzso was zzso associated with zzso and whether zzso or change in zzso was associated with change in zzso levels over zzso We also developed a theoretical model for the effect of obesity on zzso levels in which increased plasma volume in the obese zzso zzso zzso 

After control for age and zzso higher zzso was associated with lower zzso zzso men with a zzso or zzso had a geometric mean zzso level zzso zzso lower than men with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at initial screening and change in zzso over 2 years were not associated with change in zzso or zzso zzso Our theoretical model accurately predicted observed zzso levels and suggests that a screening zzso of zzso zzso in normal weight and overweight men zzso to zzso zzso in obese men and zzso zzso in zzso obese zzso 

Across the study population, increased zzso was significantly zzso associated with lower zzso Based on a theoretical model in which increased plasma volume in the obese zzso zzso levels we propose new zzso for a positive screening zzso
