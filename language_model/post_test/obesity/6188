Are obese subjects characterized by a reduction of zzso cortical responses to the enlargement of food or body zzso 

zzso data were recorded in 19 obese and 15 zzso adults during an zzso zzso The subjects were given frequent zzso and rare zzso stimuli depicting faces zzso food zzso and landscapes zzso and clicked the mouse after the rare zzso These stimuli depicted the same frequent stimuli zzso zzso by zzso along the horizontal zzso zzso zzso zzso subjects' body fat zzso zzso zzso responses were zzso by the difference between positive zzso zzso zzso around zzso zzso for the rare minus frequent stimuli zzso Low resolution electromagnetic source zzso zzso estimated zzso zzso 

In the FOOD condition, the zzso of zzso prefrontal zzso sources zzso area 9) was lower in the obese than zzso subjects, and there was a negative correlation between the body fat percentage and the zzso of these sources in all subjects as a single zzso 

These results disclose that prefrontal zzso processes to food size are abnormal in obese zzso 

The present study motivates future research evaluating the effects of cognitive rehabilitation in obese zzso
