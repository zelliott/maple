This experiment examined zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso density in mice fed a high-fat or low-fat diet for zzso days as well as fed zzso days of high-fat diet then changed to low-fat diet for one and seven zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso days of high-fat diet consumption significantly increased zzso zzso and decreased zzso density in the zzso and zzso parts of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared with low-fat zzso zzso feeding also increased zzso binding in the nucleus zzso shell zzso zzso zzso and zzso density remained unchanged following reversal of the diets from high-fat to low-fat zzso The high-fat diet induced increase of zzso zzso and decrease of zzso binding may have occurred due to defensive control over zzso activity in response to a positive energy zzso
