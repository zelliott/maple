zzso dietary risk factors for excess zzso in young people are poorly zzso However, studies in adults suggest dietary energy density, fat and zzso are critical dietary zzso 

To examine zzso relationships between a dietary pattern zzso zzso by dietary energy density, % total energy from fat and zzso density and fat mass zzso in children from 7 to 15 years of zzso 

zzso were zzso children from the UK Avon zzso Study of Parents and zzso zzso intake was assessed using a zzso food diary at 7, 10 and 13 years of zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified using reduced rank zzso and subjects scored for the zzso at each zzso zzso was measured at 11, 13 and 15 years and zzso index zzso calculated as zzso zzso models were adjusted for dietary zzso physical activity and maternal zzso 

zzso zzso at all ages were positively associated with later zzso A 1 zzso unit increase in zzso zzso was zzso associated with an average increase in zzso zzso of zzso zzso units zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso For each 1 zzso unit increase in zzso zzso the odds of being in the highest zzso for zzso (as a marker of excess zzso increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso habits during childhood are associated with increased zzso in adolescence, with specific implications for dietary energy density, fat and zzso zzso zzso diet quality may reduce the risk of obesity in young zzso
