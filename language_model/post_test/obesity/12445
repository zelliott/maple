zzso zzso zzso zzso are now used to improve zzso zzso control in type 2 zzso However, their effects on zzso zzso production zzso in obesity are not zzso This study was designed to test the hypothesis that zzso and zzso can be modulated by zzso zzso in zzso 

Sprague zzso male rats were divided into four groups, each on a different zzso general rat zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso G + zzso zzso zzso 10; high fat zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso fat zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso After 10 weeks, the rats were zzso overnight and zzso metabolism was determined using zzso and zzso as zzso 

zzso rate of appearance zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso and free fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were decreased in zzso + zzso group compared with zzso group, but there was no significant difference between G and G + zzso groups zzso zzso zzso in zzso group was five times of that in G rats zzso zzso but was significantly declined in zzso + zzso group zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso were inhibited by zzso in high zzso obese rats due to decreased zzso zzso which was a result of reduced zzso release from zzso zzso The finding suggests that zzso is potentially useful for controlling zzso zzso in zzso thereby delaying or preventing the development of zzso
