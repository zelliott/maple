The prevalence of obesity is increasing in the population of zzso countries and this condition is today considered a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases because, at least partly, it represents a zzso zzso 

For this reason we have studied plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and some parameters of zzso zzso zzso zzso in 41 non diabetic obese patients zzso females and 3 zzso and in 36 healthy normal weight zzso 

zzso pattern has resulted in overlapping both in the two studied populations and in the two zzso of zzso and zzso women, while greater zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been found in obese populations vs controls, but not different between the two zzso in particular, zzso has zzso 30 zzso in zzso of obese patients and in no case in the control zzso Finally, zzso zzso have been found for the first time to be positively related to C and zzso to zzso in the obese zzso 

As zzso is believed to be a zzso linkage between zzso and zzso and can be affected by weight loss, the efficacy of the reduction of high plasma levels of zzso needs to be considered with zzso zzso
