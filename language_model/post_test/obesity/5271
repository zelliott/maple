The daily flux of zzso acids in the body is zzso zzso synthesis is estimated to be 300 g daily in an adult zzso This requires zzso and release of 150 g essential zzso zzso yet the dietary requirement for essential zzso acids in only 6 zzso This indicates extensive and efficient recycling of essential zzso acids released by protein zzso The zzso of essential zzso acids by the liver is sensitively regulated in relation to zzso A study of availability of zzso to rats receiving various levels of zzso in the diet shows that plasma zzso increases only when intake exceeds requirements and at these higher levels of intake zzso zzso activity in the liver becomes increased shortly after zzso In addition, the zzso content of the diet causes zzso to become deposited in the free zzso acid pool of muscle through an zzso zzso zzso zzso also effects plasma zzso due to a fall in the plasma level of zzso fatty acids which compete with zzso for binding sites on serum zzso zzso after zzso the proportion of plasma zzso bound to serum zzso increases, so that there is less zzso zzso in the zzso The zzso significance of this has yet to be zzso Finally, protein metabolism in skeletal muscle exhibits considerable efficiency of zzso of essential zzso zzso since the main products passing into the blood are zzso and zzso It has been shown that zzso present in muscle protein in not zzso for synthesis of protein and that its zzso in the urine can provide a useful index of muscle zzso In prolonged zzso of adults or protein zzso in children, output of zzso is much reduced, suggesting an zzso reduction in muscle protein zzso It is emphasized that, because of its function in monitoring dietary zzso acid zzso liver protein metabolism responds rapidly to changes in protein intake and in consequence protein zzso causes early zzso whereas muscle protein zzso depletion later and is subject to zzso processes that restrict the zzso
