We studied the zzso of carotid zzso in zzso Australian zzso at high risk of zzso mortality and zzso 

zzso study of self-selected adult Australian zzso Participants zzso aged zzso years had risk factor assessment and carotid ultrasound to determine carotid zzso thickness zzso and the presence of zzso The upper zzso zzso zzso in males zzso zzso in zzso was used as a measure of increased carotid zzso 

Over zzso of participants were overweight or zzso the prevalence of diabetes was zzso Age was the major predictor of thick zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso per decade for males and OR zzso zzso for zzso zzso circumference and blood zzso were independent zzso of zzso for men, with hypertension, zzso of smoking, diabetes, and cholesterol ratio additional zzso for zzso zzso was highly prevalent zzso in this relatively young population and was predicted by increasing age, a history of smoking and total zzso ratio, but not zzso 

zzso zzso Australians are at increased risk for early zzso In this study an excess of zzso cardiovascular risk factors were the important contributors to increased zzso carotid zzso but not inflammatory markers or other novel risk zzso
