The purpose of this study was to determine if zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alters animal body weight and plasma zzso levels in a zzso obese mouse zzso 

zzso zzso mice zzso days old) were housed individually and fed a standard mouse diet for 2 weeks upon zzso After 2 weeks the animals were weighed and divided in 4 groups of similar average weight, and the groups received a low fat zzso zzso from zzso and high fat zzso zzso from zzso diet with or without zzso zzso zzso for 12 continuous zzso zzso water and caloric intake and body weight were recorded on a daily basis throughout the duration of the zzso Following the 12th week of the study all animals were humanely sacrificed and blood and abdominal fat pads were harvested for further zzso Plasma cholesterol, zzso zzso and zzso levels were measured using zzso zzso 

There is a significant difference in weight gain between the low-fat diet and the low-fat diet + zzso zzso zzso treatment groups zzso as well as between the high-fat diet and the high-fat diet + zzso zzso zzso treatment groups zzso However, the reduction of weight gain of the high-fat diet + zzso zzso treatment group compared to the high-fat group was zzso while the reduction in weight gain between the low-fat diet + zzso zzso zzso treatment group and the low-fat diet group was zzso over the duration of the zzso No significant differences in food and water zzso serum zzso and zzso levels were observed between the four zzso No significant differences in caloric intake between the low-fat diet and the low-fat diet + zzso zzso zzso However, a significant difference in caloric intake between high-fat diet and the high-fat diet + zzso zzso zzso treatment groups was zzso In addition, significant reductions in plasma cholesterol levels and abdominal fat pad weight between diet alone and diet + zzso treatment groups were zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso may have potential weight-loss and cholesterol lowering activity in both High Fat and Low Fat zzso treated zzso
