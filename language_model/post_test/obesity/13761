The long-term effects of zzso as a natural zzso in the zzso meals of ambulatory obese patients with type II diabetes remain zzso An zzso zzso study was therefore conducted to evaluate the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso supplementation of the diet of nine patients with type II diabetes zzso A, mean age 57 zzso 2 years, seven women and two zzso Their results were compared with zzso zzso and zzso patients with type II diabetes who were similarly studied but without zzso supplementation of their usual meals zzso zzso The mean zzso zzso zzso serum zzso zzso zzso 24 versus 204 zzso 14 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso percent) values progressively decreased zzso less than zzso week 12 versus week zzso in Group zzso In contrast, both parameters increased in Group B when compared with the week 0 values, but differences were not statistically zzso zzso of zzso serum zzso total cholesterol, zzso zzso cholesterol, and zzso zzso cholesterol remained unchanged at week 12 compared with week 0 in Group zzso However, the mean zzso A1 zzso increased significantly at weeks 4 and 12 in Group A, whereas only transient changes occurred in zzso zzso zzso zzso of mean zzso serum zzso increased at weeks 4 (15 percent) and 12 zzso percent) in Group zzso however, no significant changes occurred in the rest of the zzso zzso and zzso A1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso such as serum zzso acid and zzso acid levels remained essentially unchanged in both groups at the end of the zzso In addition, no significant weight changes were observed in either zzso The zzso supplementation was well tolerated without significant adverse zzso Thus, this study demonstrates that addition of moderate amounts of zzso as a natural zzso in the zzso mixed meal does not appear to have deleterious effects on zzso control and zzso and zzso metabolism in ambulatory obese patients with type II diabetes and poor zzso zzso Rather, a slight improvement in zzso control and zzso in the zzso compositions in favor of decreased risk for coronary artery disease may zzso
