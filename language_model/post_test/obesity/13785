The masses of fat, water, protein and minerals in ten obese patients zzso women and three zzso have been measured, by in zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso before and after four weeks of zzso Mass of skeletal muscle was estimated from measured total body zzso zzso and nitrogen zzso Before zzso the patients zzso on average, zzso zzso more than predicted from sex, age and zzso The composition of their excess tissue was consistent with that of zzso zzso During zzso the patients lost, on average, zzso zzso of tissue containing more water and zzso than zzso zzso zzso analysis of the measured changes in zzso and protein suggested that approximately 230 zzso of zzso was lost independently of zzso the remainder being lost with zzso zzso zzso Because some zzso was lost without zzso the change in muscle mass calculated from the changes in zzso and zzso overestimated the true mass of muscle zzso After zzso the patients still had zzso zzso of excess zzso Their composition was consistent with an excess of zzso tissue and a deficit of zzso
