zzso is considered to be a zzso for zzso knee replacement zzso The aim was to study the impact of zzso on failure rate and clinical outcome of the Oxford mobile bearing zzso 

Two thousand four hundred and zzso zzso Oxford zzso were studied zzso and divided into groups: zzso zzso zzso 25 to zzso zzso zzso 30 to zzso zzso zzso 35 to zzso zzso and zzso 40 to zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

There was no significant difference in survival rate between zzso At a mean follow-up of zzso zzso zzso there was no significant difference in the zzso American zzso Society zzso between zzso There was a significant zzso trend with the Oxford zzso zzso zzso and zzso American zzso Society Scores decreasing with increasing zzso As there was an opposite trend zzso in zzso zzso the change in zzso increased with increasing zzso zzso The mean age at surgery was significantly zzso lower in patients with higher zzso 

zzso zzso was not associated with an increasing failure zzso It was also not associated with a decreasing benefit from the zzso zzso a high zzso should not be considered a zzso to mobile bearing zzso
