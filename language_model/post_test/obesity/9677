In this paper, we propose a zzso method for group zzso trials with multiple observation times and multiple outcomes of different zzso We jointly model these outcomes using zzso zzso normal linear regression, which allows treatment effects to change with time and accounts for zzso zzso correlation within zzso zzso the correlation between different outcomes measured on the same zzso and zzso the zzso correlation of each zzso Moreover, we develop a set of innovative zzso for the zzso zzso which yield direct zzso on the zzso avoid zzso constraints, and allow zzso of information from previous zzso We illustrate through simulations that our model can improve zzso efficiency zzso zzso standard zzso of zzso correlations and treatment effects relative to single outcome models and models with diffuse zzso on the zzso zzso We also demonstrate the methodology using body composition data collected in the Trial of zzso in Adolescent zzso
