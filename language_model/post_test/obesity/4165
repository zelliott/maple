To investigate the effects of zzso zzso a traditional Chinese medicine, on zzso and zzso zzso in zzso obese zzso zzso 

Fifteen male zzso rats were divided into 3 zzso The control group zzso was fed with normal zzso The obese group zzso was fed with high fat zzso The zzso group zzso was fed with high fat zzso and zzso in drinking zzso At the end of six weeks, all rats were killed and heart blood samples were taken to assess serum zzso total cholesterol, and free fat zzso The zzso zzso rings were harvested and zzso in zzso zzso To measure the zzso relaxation, the zzso rings were zzso in response to zzso After a stable contraction plateau was reached, cumulative zzso for relaxation to zzso zzso zzso were obtained in each zzso zzso experiments were conducted with zzso zzso sodium zzso as the zzso independent zzso zzso zzso to zzso were expressed as percentage relaxation in all zzso zzso 

The ratio of zzso fat and body weight in the obese rats was higher than in the zzso The levels of serum zzso total cholesterol, and free fat acid were elevated in the zzso Group compared with the Control zzso The zzso Group had lower zzso and free fat acid levels than the zzso zzso Compared with the rats with high-fat diet, the rats fed with zzso lost about zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused a zzso relaxation in all zzso zzso zzso Compared to the control group, zzso zzso dependent relaxation in the obese group was impaired zzso In the zzso group, the relaxation to zzso was intermediate between control and obese group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced potent relaxation zzso independent zzso in all rat zzso rings that did not differ statistically between zzso 

zzso has zzso effects on impaired zzso dysfunction in the context of zzso
