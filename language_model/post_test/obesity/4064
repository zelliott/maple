After informed consent we studied effect of pharmacological suppression of insulin zzso on tissue sensitivity to insulin in eight subjects with moderate obesity zzso body weight 133 zzso 6 per zzso zzso tolerance zzso g zzso and insulin sensitivity were studied on two separate days before and after treatment with 500 zzso zzso for a period of 4 zzso zzso sensitivity was determined by means of a zzso zzso zzso insulin infusion technique zzso zzso periods of 8 and 16 zzso insulin zzso initiated by a start injection of 1 and 2 zzso zzso The relative decrease of plasma zzso and zzso fatty acid concentration at comparable zzso insulin levels has been taken as an estimate of body sensitivity to zzso zzso treatment resulted in a significant suppression of zzso early zzso area zzso zzso zzso less than zzso late zzso area zzso zzso zzso less than zzso and total insulin response zzso area zzso zzso zzso less than zzso as well as a mild deterioration of zzso zzso zzso sensitivity increased by about 50 per cent in comparison to the zzso zzso Similarly, there was a marked increase of the zzso effect of insulin after short-term treatment with zzso zzso less than zzso The results support the concept that decreased sensitivity to insulin in obesity may be secondary due to zzso
