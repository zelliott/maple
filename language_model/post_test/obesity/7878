To our knowledge no data have been reported on the contribution to acute increase in zzso by the respiratory muscles in obese zzso zzso To better focus on this topic, we studied seven obese subjects and an zzso normal control group, assessing baseline pulmonary function, breathing pattern, zzso pressure zzso and gastric zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was also recorded during a sniff maneuver zzso During a zzso zzso test we recorded zzso swing in zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso and zzso swings in zzso zzso Change in zzso capacity was considered the mirror image of zzso lung volume zzso zzso was assessed by a modified zzso zzso Under control conditions, patients exhibited a reduced zzso reserve volume and intrinsic positive zzso pressure zzso At the end of zzso zzso compared with controls our obese subjects exhibited greater respiratory frequency zzso shorter zzso time, greater zzso and lower zzso zzso in zzso and zzso were found in the obese subjects but not in zzso Changes in zzso correlated with changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to a greater extent in patients than in zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated the amount of zzso in zzso that was predicted by both zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso in controls, and by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso in obese zzso We conclude that the rib cage muscles contributed to zzso to a greater extent in this subset of obese zzso
