zzso is associated with a higher risk of developing cancer and zzso that are part of the zzso zzso zzso tissue is recognized as an zzso organ, as it affects a number of zzso functions, and contains zzso zzso stem cells zzso zzso can differentiate into cells of multiple zzso and as such are zzso to tissue engineering and zzso zzso Yet the question of whether zzso functionality is affected by the donor's body mass index zzso still zzso 

zzso were isolated from patients having different zzso zzso within the ranges of zzso It was hypothesized that overweight zzso would be more compromised in early zzso and zzso potential, and ability to form colonies in zzso zzso was zzso correlated with zzso proliferation and colony forming potential as assessed by zzso proliferation zzso zzso based measurement of cellular DNA zzso and colony forming zzso zzso was positively correlated with early time point zzso 7) but not later time point zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as assessed by zzso zzso zzso red zzso and zzso for alkaline zzso demonstrated that elevated zzso resulted in compromised zzso zzso of zzso zzso and decreased alkaline zzso zzso zzso 

These data demonstrate that elevated zzso resulted in reduced zzso zzso and potentially compromised zzso capacity in zzso thus zzso is an important criterion to consider in selecting zzso donors for clinical zzso
