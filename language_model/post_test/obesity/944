The effect of feeding a zzso diet and of feeding a restricted amount of zzso on brown zzso tissue zzso of lean and gold zzso zzso mice was studied at various times of the day and zzso zzso were to find out 1) whether our previous finding of zzso growth of BAT of the zzso mouse without zzso zzso could be explained by a transient stimulation at a time of day not studied and 2) whether lack of stimulation of BAT zzso zzso zzso by diet seen previously in lean mice and rats could be explained by a transient increase at times of day not zzso A transient zzso of BAT zzso indicated by an increase in zzso zzso zzso occurs immediately after cafeteria food is presented to the zzso zzso but the effect of diet is absent at other zzso This transient stimulation of BAT in the zzso mouse may be sufficient to produce the tissue growth zzso A zzso rhythm in zzso binding occurred in both lean and obese mice, whether they were eating zzso or the cafeteria zzso zzso feeding suppressed BAT zzso zzso binding in lean mice but did not suppress any further the low level in zzso zzso A zzso rhythm in TD activity in BAT also occurred in lean and obese mice, but no effect of cafeteria diet or of restricted feeding on this zzso was detected at any time of day, except for a brief increase in obese mice at zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
