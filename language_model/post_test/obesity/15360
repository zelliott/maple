To test the hypothesis that zzso zzso during one lung ventilation zzso is impaired more in obese patients than in non-obese control patients, we performed consecutive zzso of zzso oxygen tension zzso during zzso in 48 patients scheduled for pulmonary zzso Minimum value of zzso during zzso was significantly less in 16 obese patients zzso mass index zzso zzso compared to 32 control patients zzso zzso Moreover, zzso value of left lung ventilation was significantly less than the value of right lung ventilation in obese patients while the difference was not statistically significant in the control zzso
