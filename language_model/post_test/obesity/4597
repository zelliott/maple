To clarify the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso we previously isolated a novel zzso factor for zzso differentiation zzso zzso whose expression was induced during the earliest stages of zzso and its product was localized to the zzso zzso We found that the zzso of zzso expression prevented the differentiation of zzso cells into zzso In addition, zzso of zzso promoted the differentiation of zzso cells, which do not usually differentiate into zzso Although these findings strongly suggest that zzso has a crucial role in regulating zzso zzso the zzso role of the gene is still zzso In this study, we generated mice in which zzso expression was zzso The zzso mice did not show remarkable changes in body weight or the weight of white zzso tissue on a zzso diet, but had significantly lower body weights and fat mass than zzso mice when fed a high-fat zzso Furthermore, although the disruption of zzso did not influence insulin sensitivity on the zzso diet, it improved insulin resistance induced by the high-fat zzso These results indicate that zzso is a key factor in the development of obesity and insulin resistance caused by a high-fat zzso
