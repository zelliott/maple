We sought to examine the effect of body mass index zzso on 30-day morbidity and mortality in a large cohort of patients undergoing zzso general zzso 

zzso has long been considered a risk factor for poor outcomes from a variety of surgical procedures, yet recent studies of critically and chronically ill patients suggest that overweight and obese patients may paradoxically have better outcomes than zzso weight zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso cohort study of zzso patients undergoing zzso general surgery who were included in the National zzso Quality Improvement Program zzso Use database in 2005 and 2006 was zzso Outcomes and risk variables were compared across zzso zzso class using analysis of zzso zzso multiple comparisons of means tests, and multivariable zzso zzso 

After adjusting for all significant zzso risk factors, the risk of death according to zzso exhibited a reverse zzso relationship, with the highest rates in the zzso and zzso obese extremes and the lowest rates in the overweight and moderately zzso zzso zzso ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso and moderately obese zzso ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso patients had a significantly lower risk of death than normal weight zzso There was a progressive increase in the likelihood of a complication with increasing zzso class, almost entirely due to increasing rates of wound zzso 

zzso and moderately obese patients undergoing zzso general surgery have paradoxically zzso crude and adjusted risks of mortality compared with patients at a zzso zzso This finding is in contrast to observations from the general population, confirming the existence of an zzso zzso in this patient zzso
