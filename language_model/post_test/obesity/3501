zzso is a world problem that requires a better understanding of its zzso and genetic basis, as well as the mechanisms by which the zzso controls feeding zzso The zzso mouse zzso zzso develops obesity in captivity when fed with regular zzso diet, providing a novel model for the study of zzso zzso develop obesity more often than zzso therefore, in this study, we zzso in zzso in zzso lean and obese, the differences in zzso expression of receptors for zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso for plasma levels of total zzso The main comparisons are between mice fed ad zzso and mice after 24 hours of zzso Mice above zzso body weight were considered obese, based on behavioral and zzso parameters such as food zzso plasma free fatty zzso and zzso zzso zzso tissue from obese and lean mice was zzso by western zzso Our results indicate that after ad zzso food access, obese mice show no significant differences in zzso zzso zzso but a significant increase of zzso in the zzso and a nearly zzso decrease in zzso was zzso After a 24-hour fast, plasma zzso increased nearly two fold in both lean and obese zzso increases of zzso zzso receptors and zzso were also noted, while zzso did not change zzso levels of plasma free fatty acids were 50% less after zzso in obese than in lean zzso Our results indicate that in obese zzso zzso mice, the levels of zzso receptors in the zzso correlate with zzso and the fact that lean and obese females respond in different ways to a zzso demand such as a 24-hour zzso
