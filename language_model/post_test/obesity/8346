zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso is the preferred technique for zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso Domestic cats are subject to liver zzso zzso but MRS has not been investigated for zzso of liver fat in zzso The purpose of this project was to explore a technique for zzso MRS measurement of zzso zzso in lean and obese zzso zzso zzso MRS was performed, using a zzso imaging unit and a zzso zzso zzso zzso on 6 lean zzso zzso and 12 obese cats zzso zzso Median liver fat percentages in lean and obese cats were zzso and zzso zzso zzso are biologically zzso based on chemical zzso in a separate group of zzso however, full validation of the method is necessary before other conclusions can be zzso This report should provide a foundation for the further development of zzso techniques for studying zzso zzso zzso in zzso
