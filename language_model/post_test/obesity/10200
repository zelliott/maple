zzso is considered a precursor of stage 1 hypertension and a predictor of excessive cardiovascular zzso We investigated whether zzso treatment of zzso prevents or postpones stage 1 zzso 

Participants with repeated zzso of zzso pressure of 130 to 139 zzso zzso and zzso pressure of 89 zzso zzso or lower, or zzso pressure of 139 zzso zzso or lower and zzso pressure of 85 to 89 zzso zzso were randomly assigned to receive two years of zzso zzso zzso or zzso followed by two years of zzso for zzso When a participant reached the study end point of stage 1 hypertension, treatment with zzso agents was zzso Both the zzso group and the zzso group were instructed to make changes in lifestyle to reduce blood pressure throughout the zzso 

A total of 409 participants were randomly assigned to zzso and 400 to zzso Data on zzso participants zzso in the zzso group and zzso in the zzso zzso mean age, zzso years; zzso percent zzso were available for zzso During the first two years, hypertension developed in 154 participants in the zzso group and 53 of those in the zzso group zzso risk reduction, zzso percent; zzso After four years, hypertension had developed in 240 participants in the zzso group and 208 of those in the zzso group zzso risk reduction, zzso percent; zzso Serious adverse events occurred in zzso percent of the participants assigned to zzso and zzso percent of those receiving zzso 

Over a period of four years, stage 1 hypertension developed in nearly two thirds of patients with zzso zzso (the zzso zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso appeared to be well tolerated and reduced the risk of incident hypertension during the study zzso Thus, treatment of zzso appears to be zzso zzso number, zzso
