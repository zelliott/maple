zzso resistance in skeletal muscle is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes in women with zzso zzso syndrome zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle insulin resistance and the zzso effect of zzso in zzso in zzso are less well zzso 

We determined molecular zzso of insulin signaling to zzso transport in skeletal muscle zzso of 24 zzso patients and 14 matched control subjects metabolically characterized by zzso zzso and indirect zzso and we examined the effect of 16 weeks of treatment with zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso total zzso zzso and zzso zzso disposal zzso was paralleled by reduced zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso and zzso zzso in muscle of zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso correlated positively with zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso free testosterone was zzso related to zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso the zzso improvement in zzso zzso zzso which did not fully reach normal levels, was accompanied by zzso of zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso were similar in the two groups and did not respond to zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso insulin signaling through zzso and zzso in part explains insulin resistance at the molecular level in skeletal muscle in zzso and the ability of zzso to enhance insulin sensitivity involves improved signaling through zzso and zzso Moreover, our data provide zzso evidence that zzso in zzso may contribute to insulin zzso
