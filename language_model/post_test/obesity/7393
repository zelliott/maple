Across multiple studies, obesity has been associated with an increased risk of higher grade disease and zzso zzso zzso recurrence after radical zzso zzso Whether these associations vary by race is zzso In the current study, the authors examined the association between obesity and outcome after zzso zzso by zzso 

A retrospective analysis was performed on zzso men in the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital zzso database who underwent zzso between 1989 and zzso The association between increased body mass index zzso and adverse pathology and zzso recurrence was examined using zzso zzso zzso and Cox models, zzso Data were examined zzso by zzso 

After adjusting for zzso clinical zzso higher zzso was associated with higher tumor grade zzso zzso zzso and positive surgical margins zzso zzso in white men, and similar but statistically zzso trends were observed in black zzso No significant interaction was noted between race and zzso for associations with adverse pathology zzso or zzso After adjusting for zzso clinical zzso higher zzso was associated with an increased risk of recurrence in both white men zzso zzso zzso and black men zzso zzso zzso After further adjusting for zzso zzso higher zzso was associated with significantly increased risk of recurrence in white men zzso zzso zzso and black men zzso zzso zzso No significant interactions were observed between race and zzso for predicting zzso progression adjusting either for zzso factors zzso zzso zzso or for zzso and zzso features zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was associated with a greater risk of recurrence among both black men and white zzso zzso did not appear to be more or less influential in 1 race than another but, rather, was identified as a risk factor for aggressive cancer regardless of zzso
