zzso is associated with high levels zzso zzso like zzso necrosis factor alpha zzso which may play an important role in the genesis of insulin zzso We evaluated the relationship of zzso zzso of zzso gene with obesity and insulin resistance in Asian Indians in north zzso 

This zzso study included 151 apparently healthy individuals (79 zzso 72 zzso zzso zzso of age from New Delhi, zzso Body composition by zzso zzso zzso zzso and abdominal fat by magnetic resonance imaging zzso were zzso zzso zzso included zzso zzso zzso insulin, zzso and zzso zzso We zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene and studied its association with obesity and zzso zzso 

At comparable zzso abdominal obesity was more prevalent in females zzso as compared to males zzso The wild zzso zzso was present in zzso zzso in zzso and AA in zzso zzso zzso of body zzso abdominal fat distribution, zzso insulin, zzso and zzso levels were not influenced by the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso levels correlated significantly with zzso insulin in both zzso 

zzso levels correlate with zzso insulin but not with indicators of body composition in Asian zzso The zzso zzso of zzso gene is not associated with differences in the serum levels of zzso in Asian zzso
