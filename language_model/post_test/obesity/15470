To evaluate whether a zzso zzso zzso and its zzso in obese patients, if any, may be improved by therapeutic weight reduction, 36 obese patients admitted to our university hospital were examined over a zzso period from April 1, 1992 to March 31, zzso Participants included 18 males and 18 females whose mean age zzso zzso was 28 zzso 9 and 33 zzso 14 years, respectively, and whose mean body mass index zzso zzso was 35 zzso 5 and 38 zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso control patients were matched in age and gender with the obese zzso All the obese patients were treated with behavioral therapy together with zzso conventional Japanese diet zzso 370 zzso A standard zzso zzso zzso revealed longer maximum zzso zzso 32 zzso mean zzso zzso and minimum zzso zzso 29 zzso heart rate corrected zzso intervals zzso zzso in the obese group than in the control group zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso defined as the difference between maximum and minimum zzso intervals derived from zzso zzso was greater in the obese group zzso zzso 19 zzso than in the control group (32 zzso 13 zzso zzso zzso Both the maximum and minimum zzso intervals in the obese patients were zzso respectively, to 434 zzso 28 zzso and 377 zzso 29 zzso zzso zzso for each) with no significant change in either zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso duration following weight zzso The zzso value from the linear zzso line between zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the obese group was less than in the control zzso Together, the results show that obesity per zzso causes both a zzso of zzso zzso and an increase in zzso zzso and that weight reduction improves the prolonged zzso zzso observed in obese zzso
