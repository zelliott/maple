We evaluated systemic and central zzso in 10 lean zzso and in 10 obese zzso zzso stage zzso after 8 weeks treatment regimen with a zzso zzso such as zzso At the beginning and the end of the study, body weight, zzso blood pressure and heart rate were measured and a first pass zzso zzso was performed to determine cardiac zzso cardiac index and ejection fraction of left zzso Total peripheral zzso were also zzso In both zzso groups zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso less than zzso and mean zzso less than zzso blood zzso No significant change in zzso blood pressure, cardiac zzso cardiac index and ejection fraction was observed in lean or obese zzso Total peripheral resistance values significantly zzso less than zzso decreased in lean zzso in obese zzso total peripheral resistance was moderately zzso Our results indicate that zzso with zzso is effective in treating mild to moderate hypertension in both lean and obese zzso and does not interfere with left zzso zzso In conclusion the effectiveness of zzso treatment appears moderately higher in lean than in obese zzso
