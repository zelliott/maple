zzso zzso zzso is responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso The aims of the present study were zzso to test for potential linkages zzso zzso between zzso plasma zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities, body zzso plasma zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso and zzso markers zzso the zzso locus zzso and zzso and zzso to investigate associations between the zzso zzso zzso zzso and these zzso Data on 190 parents and 312 adult offspring from 99 Caucasian families participating in the zzso Family Study were available for this zzso Data were adjusted for the effects of age within sex, and zzso zzso zzso and abdominal visceral fat were further adjusted for fat zzso A suggestive linkage was observed only between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso zzso was not associated with body fat zzso or zzso plasma zzso zzso activity zzso P zzso zzso women, P zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso carriers had lower plasma zzso zzso and women, P zzso zzso zzso zzso and women, P zzso zzso and zzso B zzso and women, P zzso zzso The relationships between the zzso zzso and plasma zzso zzso and zzso B in both genders were observed in obese zzso mass index zzso or zzso 30 zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso of the zzso gene is not associated with body zzso and zzso plasma zzso zzso However, the obese carriers of the zzso zzso have plasma zzso zzso and plasma zzso zzso cholesterol zzso levels equivalent to those of zzso sedentary zzso
