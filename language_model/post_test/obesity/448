zzso and diabetic mice display enhanced zzso zzso and zzso zzso that participate in the occurrence of zzso zzso Our recent data support the idea that a selective increase of zzso zzso reduces the impact of high-fat zzso zzso zzso and inflammatory zzso Here, we zzso that zzso zzso of gut zzso lowers zzso zzso by a mechanism involving zzso zzso zzso thereby improving inflammation and zzso disorders during obesity and zzso 

Study 1: zzso mice zzso were treated with either zzso zzso or zzso carbohydrates as control zzso Study zzso zzso and zzso mice were treated with zzso zzso or zzso Study zzso zzso mice were treated with a zzso zzso or zzso We assessed changes in the gut zzso zzso zzso gut zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and systemic zzso 

zzso mice exhibited a lower plasma zzso zzso and zzso and a decreased zzso expression of inflammatory and zzso stress zzso This decreased inflammatory tone was associated with a lower zzso zzso and improved zzso integrity compared to zzso zzso increased the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production whereas the zzso zzso abolished most of the zzso zzso Finally, pharmacological zzso treatment decreased gut zzso systemic and zzso inflammatory zzso associated with obesity to a similar extent as that observed following zzso changes in gut zzso 

We found that a selective gut zzso change controls and increases zzso zzso production, and consequently improves gut barrier functions by a zzso zzso contributing to the improvement of gut barrier functions during obesity and zzso
