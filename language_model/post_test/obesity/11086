zzso and zzso zzso infection zzso are both related to an increased zzso ratio in the zzso zzso However, an association between obesity and zzso is zzso We aimed to assess the association between obesity and zzso in hospitalized zzso 

We conducted a retrospective zzso zzso From January to December 2011, all consecutive patients hospitalized with zzso in 2 internal medical departments in 2 hospitals, were zzso Patients with zzso were compared to hospitalized patients without zzso during the same period and in the same departments, and matched by age, sex, zzso score, length of zzso and zzso use during the last 3 zzso 

Of the zzso patients hospitalized, 178 were diagnosed with zzso zzso prevalence was zzso zzso Thirty patients were excluded from the zzso The 148 cases with zzso were compared to 148 hospitalized zzso Mean body mass index zzso in the zzso group was zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso in the control group zzso zzso zzso The multivariable model of conditional zzso zzso for matched pairs showed that a history of zzso surgery zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and a high zzso value zzso zzso zzso per zzso increase in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were the only variables found to be significantly associated with zzso 

Our findings suggest that obesity is associated with the risk of zzso Further studies are needed to reveal the exact mechanisms underlying this zzso
