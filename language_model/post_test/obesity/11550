zzso To determine the zzso pulmonary function zzso in our population of obese children; and zzso to assess the correlation between the severity of lung function impairment and the degree of obesity as assessed by dual energy zzso ray zzso zzso 

Sixty four obese patients underwent physical examination, zzso pulmonary function tests zzso lung volumes, and single breath diffusion capacity for carbon zzso and zzso scan zzso The trunk and zzso zzso - zzso body fat mass were used as surrogate index of body zzso 

Sixteen girls and 48 boys with median age and body mass index zzso of 12 years zzso range zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively were zzso None of the patients had clinical evidence of zzso zzso Reduction in functional residual capacity zzso zzso zzso predicted, zzso zzso and impairment of diffusion capacity zzso zzso zzso predicted, zzso zzso were the most common abnormalities in our zzso being observed in 30 zzso and 21 zzso patients zzso zzso zzso impairment was found in three zzso There was significant negative correlation between the degree of reduction of zzso but not zzso with zzso scan zzso but such a relation was not found when zzso was used as the indicator of zzso 

Reduction in zzso and diffusion impairment were the zzso abnormalities found in our cohort of obese zzso Reduction in zzso lung volume was correlated with the degree of zzso
