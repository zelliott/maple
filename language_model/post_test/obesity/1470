To examine the distribution of patterns of zzso density in relation to zzso 

Cross zzso 

zzso 

323 men and women aged zzso years, selected randomly from a larger population sample of Danish zzso 

zzso in dietary reporting of energy and protein intake in relation to percentage body fat, assessed by comparison of data from an interview on dietary intake with data estimated from 24 hour nitrogen zzso validated by administering zzso acid, and estimated 24 hour energy zzso 

Degree of obesity was positively associated with zzso of total energy and zzso whereas compared with total energy reported, protein was zzso by the obese zzso 

Errors in dietary reporting of protein seem to occur disproportionately with respect to total energy, suggesting a differential reporting pattern of different zzso zzso on average, all subjects showed a greater zzso of energy than of zzso this was most common in the obese zzso zzso foods may be zzso forgotten when obese people omit food items in dietary zzso These results seem to agree with the general assumption that obese people tend to underreport fatty foods and foods rich in carbohydrates rather than underreport their total dietary zzso These results may have implications for the interpretation of studies of diet and zzso related to zzso
