zzso is characterized by elevated levels of zzso zzso including zzso zzso that contribute to the development of insulin zzso In this study, we set out to investigate whether zzso drives zzso production and zzso zzso in zzso and human zzso zzso thus inducing insulin zzso 

zzso animals were used as a model to study obesity and zzso Human zzso tissue fragments or zzso were cultured in medium containing normal or high zzso zzso Additionally, the role of zzso interacting protein zzso in zzso zzso production was zzso 

zzso and zzso protein levels were more abundantly expressed in zzso tissue of zzso zzso animals as compared with zzso zzso In human zzso zzso high zzso resulted in a zzso zzso of zzso gene expression levels zzso zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso activity zzso zzso together with induction of zzso zzso zzso P zzso and a significant increase in zzso zzso zzso suppression in human zzso either by a small interfering zzso approach or a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the effects of high zzso on zzso zzso production zzso zzso mainly through a decrease in zzso levels paralleled by reduced zzso zzso zzso 

High zzso activates zzso in human and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso mediates zzso zzso expression levels and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The concerted actions lead to enhanced zzso of zzso in zzso tissue that may contribute to the development of insulin zzso
