An important task of the zzso during the last century, it has been the search of elements and means that allow us, with the adequate precision, to correlate the functional deterioration of the zzso and the patient's clinical zzso And the continuous searching of factors and markers that injure them, the zzso and early diagnosis, to be able to predict the degree of the zzso and patient's zzso Almost parallel survival zzso in the natural history of the illness, almost one century zzso In the second half of the zzso century, in the developed countries, appear modifications of the social, cultural, and zzso conditions, that make appear some very different zzso and epidemic circumstances, and take place like they are, among others: zzso An increase of per zzso private rents, what takes place to increase of the level of social life and the population's zzso With zzso of the zzso and smaller zzso and prevalence of classic process, as zzso infections, infantile zzso so increasing the weight of the cardiovascular diseases and zzso This is zzso for the zzso and the zzso of environmental cardiovascular zzso factors (like high caloric and zzso zzso smoke, alcohol, disappearance of the physical work, zzso zzso And that situations are also product of the change of the outline of human and social values and zzso zzso Access of the whole population to a zzso attention of more quality and zzso It allows the biggest survival of patients that suffer vascular crisis, (as zzso zzso zzso or cerebrovascular zzso that few years ago they have had a higher zzso and an inferior survival zzso zzso The execution of big epidemic studies has been able to, not only characterize and test with scientific evidence to numerous factors and zzso that induce zzso and cardiovascular zzso changes, but risk and death probability zzso And also, its possible association zzso its injuring mechanisms, and the characterization of the new zzso zzso and cardiovascular zzso markers and zzso zzso The impact on the possibility to treat the end stage zzso disease with effective and prolonged procedures, by zzso or kidney zzso has been zzso The affected population's survival with the zzso zzso treatment, and the possibility of indefinite duration of its treatment, has also impacted on the public health, and its resources, in an evident zzso zzso to increase of the zzso in the population, the zzso for the treatment has been enlarged and extended increasing it zzso These facts are documented here, and are defined the characteristics of the factors and markers of risk, of zzso and cardiovascular zzso The defined factors are valued to mark, so far as with the well-known evidence is possible, the prediction and the progression of the zzso and cardiovascular functional zzso The hypertension, cardiovascular zzso the zzso zzso the heart rate, the sympathetic zzso the modification of the zzso response of the target organ to the zzso the zzso syndrome, the zzso the insulin resistance, the altered zzso profile, and metabolism of the fatty zzso the zzso the decrease of the zzso functional reserve, the zzso zzso the absence of the zzso pressure nocturnal zzso the abnormal zzso of proteins for the zzso the phenomenon induced by zzso of the zzso zzso production, growth factors, the production of chronic inflammation and its zzso the factors of the zzso zzso the zzso status, the zzso dysfunction and others, are zzso As well as their association among them and with other factors of risk not zzso like the age, and in turn, with other acquired voluntarily factors of risk, as the smoking habit and the zzso These facts are now zzso on the population's zzso And also in the professional zzso exercise, so much for the cardiovascular and zzso zzso increased, as for the increase of the zzso of zzso zzso disease susceptible to treat with of zzso zzso They try to justify the sentence of Alan zzso of the heading, and other concepts like zzso factors of the zzso zzso and intuitive expressions like zzso zzso disruption or zzso
