The ability of near zzso zzso zzso to predict body zzso as measured by zzso zzso was assessed in a group of 29 healthy zzso 15 zzso 14 zzso aged zzso years, body mass index zzso zzso zzso The results were compared with those obtained by five other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and methods based on weight and height or zzso The correlation between zzso and the alternative methods, including zzso were found to be remarkably similar, both with respect to fat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Percentage body fat zzso correlated better with the near infrared zzso made in the biceps area than with those made in the zzso or thigh areas, or with a combination of zzso made at two or three zzso The 95 per cent limits of agreement between zzso and zzso for the zzso of body constituents were slightly greater than those between zzso and the other zzso zzso was also found to underestimate body fat increasingly as the degree of zzso zzso This zzso was found to be particularly marked (16 per cent body zzso in a small and separate group of zzso obese women, zzso greater than 50 zzso whose body composition was assessed by total body zzso as well as by zzso This study suggests that, in the healthy group of subjects zzso zzso has little or no advantage over other simple methods in predicting body composition measured by classical zzso zzso
