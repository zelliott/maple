Daily human energy requirements calculated from separate components of energy expenditure are inaccurate and usually in poor agreement with measured energy zzso zzso of energy expenditure over periods of 24 h or longer is needed to determine more accurately rates of daily energy expenditure in zzso We provide a detailed description of a human respiratory chamber and methods used to determine rates of energy expenditure over zzso periods in 177 zzso The results show that: zzso mass zzso as estimated by zzso is the best available zzso of zzso energy expenditures zzso and explains zzso of the zzso observed between individuals zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso in an individual is very zzso zzso of variation zzso zzso and even when adjusted for differences in zzso there is still considerable zzso zzso of the daily energy zzso A large portion of the zzso of zzso among individuals, independent of differences in body size, was due to zzso in the degree of spontaneous physical activity, zzso zzso which accounted for zzso zzso in these zzso
