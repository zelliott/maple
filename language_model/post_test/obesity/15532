zzso II zzso zzso is one of numerous hormones recently shown to be zzso and zzso by zzso zzso Although the function of zzso II in zzso tissue is unknown, several studies indirectly suggest that it may be involved in control of zzso Little is known, however, about direct actions of zzso II in zzso zzso To further investigate this issue, we first characterized the type of zzso II receptors in zzso zzso We then tested the hypothesis that zzso II exerted direct actions on zzso metabolism using both zzso and human zzso zzso We report here that zzso II significantly increased zzso content and the activities of two key zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and that these effects were zzso through the zzso zzso II zzso We also report that zzso II exerted similar effects in human zzso cells maintained in primary zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso II increased the zzso rate of the zzso and zzso genes in zzso and human zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso II may be involved in control of zzso through regulation of zzso synthesis and storage in zzso
