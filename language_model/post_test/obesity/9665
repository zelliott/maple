Our goal was to determine the impact of lean mass index zzso and body fat zzso on survival in patients with coronary heart disease zzso 

An inverse relationship between obesity and prognosis has been demonstrated (the zzso zzso in zzso which has been explained by limitations in the use of body mass index in defining body zzso 

We studied zzso consecutive patients with zzso who were referred to cardiac rehabilitation, zzso as Low zzso in men and zzso in zzso and High zzso in men zzso in zzso zzso and as Low zzso zzso in men and zzso zzso in zzso and High zzso and followed for 3 years for zzso 

zzso is zzso related to zzso zzso zzso was highest in the Low zzso zzso group zzso which was significantly higher than in the other 3 groups, and lowest in the High zzso zzso group zzso which was significantly lower than in the other 3 zzso In Cox zzso analysis as zzso zzso low zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso and low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso predicted higher zzso and as continuous zzso high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso predicted lower zzso 

In patients with stable zzso both zzso and zzso predict zzso with mortality particularly high in those with Low zzso zzso and lowest in those with High zzso zzso zzso of optimal body composition in primary and secondary zzso prevention is zzso
