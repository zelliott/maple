Diet compounds may influence zzso cardiac zzso stress and zzso zzso zzso diet may be zzso from zzso diet to cardiac tissue and zzso index rather than zzso profile may predict the zzso cardiac zzso 

Male zzso rats were divided into three groups zzso zzso receiving standard zzso zzso zzso zzso receiving zzso diet zzso zzso and zzso receiving zzso diet zzso zzso zzso were sacrificed after the oral zzso tolerance test zzso at 60 days of dietary zzso zzso profile and zzso stress parameters were determined in zzso zzso samples were used to determine zzso stress, zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso rats showed higher final body weight and body mass index than zzso and zzso zzso cholesterol and zzso zzso were higher in zzso than in zzso while zzso and oxidized zzso zzso cholesterol were higher in zzso than in zzso zzso rats had the highest zzso zzso zzso and diminished zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was lower and zzso was higher in zzso than in C and zzso zzso Although zzso rats had depressed zzso power, no significant changes were observed in zzso energy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as the enhanced zzso zzso zzso ratio indicated that fatty acid degradation was decreased in zzso zzso zzso index was positively correlated with zzso cardiac zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso diets induced different degree of obesity and differently affected zzso zzso zzso diet was deleterious relative to zzso diet in the heart enhancing zzso and shifting the zzso zzso for energy zzso zzso index rather than zzso profile may predict the obesity effects on cardiac zzso
