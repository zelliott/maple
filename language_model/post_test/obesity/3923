We recently showed that long-term weight reduction changes the gene expression profile of zzso tissue in overweight individuals with impaired zzso tolerance zzso One of the responding genes was zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso Our aim was to study the associations of individual single zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso and the risk of type 2 diabetes zzso Seven single zzso zzso from two different zzso were zzso from zzso participants of the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study zzso zzso zzso effects were zzso Three markers of zzso 1 were associated with features of zzso in women zzso zzso and men zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso 2 were associated with zzso plasma zzso levels in men during the zzso zzso The same two markers together with zzso associated with the conversion of zzso to zzso in zzso The risk of developing zzso was approximately zzso in individuals with zzso associated with higher zzso plasma zzso zzso the hazard ratios were zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso are associated with zzso and also with zzso metabolism and conversion from zzso to zzso in zzso
