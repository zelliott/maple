Physical activity enhances insulin action in zzso zzso However, the exercise prescription required for the optimal enhancement is not zzso The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that exercise training consisting of zzso activity would enhance insulin sensitivity more substantially than zzso zzso zzso zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso were randomly assigned to either control or an exercise group for 6 zzso 1) zzso group zzso approximately 12 miles zzso at zzso peak zzso consumption zzso zzso 2) zzso group ( approximately 12 miles zzso at zzso zzso zzso and 3) zzso group ( approximately 20 miles zzso at zzso zzso zzso Training volume zzso was achieved by exercising approximately 115 zzso zzso zzso or approximately 170 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso action was measured with an insulin sensitivity index zzso from an intravenous zzso tolerance zzso In the control group, there was a zzso zzso zzso in zzso In contrast, all the exercise groups significantly zzso zzso increased zzso the relative zzso in the zzso and zzso groups ( approximately zzso were greater than in the zzso group ( approximately zzso In conclusion, physical activity encompassing a wide range of intensity and volume zzso the insulin resistance that develops with a sedentary zzso However, an exercise prescription that incorporated approximately 170 zzso of zzso improved insulin sensitivity more substantially than a program utilizing approximately 115 zzso of zzso regardless of exercise intensity and zzso Total exercise duration should thus be considered when designing training programs with the intent of improving insulin zzso
