Scientific research is constantly looking for new molecules to be used as functional ingredients to combat zzso The aim of the present study was to zzso whether zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso together could reduce body fat more efficiently than their separate zzso zzso male zzso rats were randomly divided into four groups: controls rats zzso rats treated with zzso zzso rats treated with zzso zzso and rats treated with a combination of zzso and zzso zzso All rats were fed on an zzso zzso In zzso and zzso groups, the rats received zzso zzso body zzso In zzso and zzso groups, an zzso mixture of zzso and zzso was added to the diet to reach zzso of the active zzso zzso After zzso of treatment, white zzso tissue from different anatomical locations was dissected and zzso zzso zzso total and HDL zzso zzso insulin, zzso and zzso were zzso A zzso tolerance test was also zzso Separately, zzso and zzso significantly reduced body fat but did not do so when zzso zzso in the zzso group and zzso in zzso group but zzso in the zzso zzso zzso reduced serum zzso No differences were found among groups in serum zzso zzso as well as the combination zzso improved zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the combination zzso reduces the effectiveness of each compound on body zzso action, but it maintains the positive effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso this combination has no usefulness in obesity zzso
