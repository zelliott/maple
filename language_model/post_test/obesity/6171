We investigate the effects of a zzso weight-loss zzso on plasma levels of zzso zzso and zzso in obese adolescent zzso 

zzso obese adolescent boys zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso completed the weight-loss zzso zzso zzso either energy restriction zzso zzso or individualized exercise training at the point of maximum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or energy restriction and training zzso Body zzso zzso zzso and plasma levels of zzso zzso and zzso were measured before and after zzso 

Following the weight-loss zzso adolescents of the zzso group showed an improvement of their body composition zzso zzso an increase in plasma zzso zzso p zzso and a decrease in plasma zzso zzso p zzso leading to an increase in zzso ratio zzso zzso p zzso higher than the R or E zzso E and zzso groups only showed a similar significant increase in plasma zzso zzso zzso and a significant improvement of zzso zzso rate at zzso zzso zzso and p zzso In addition, in zzso group, zzso is correlated with zzso and zzso ratios, zzso level, zzso mode assessment zzso index and zzso 

In obese adolescents boys, moderate exercise training completed at zzso and combined with energy restriction improves their ability to zzso zzso which is associated with a zzso of their zzso zzso and zzso levels resulting in an improved insulin sensitivity, as zzso by a higher zzso and a lower zzso
