Currently, a number of zzso methods are available to generate appropriate lists of genes from a zzso zzso While these lists represent an accurate primary analysis of the data, fewer options exist to zzso those zzso The development and validation of such methods is crucial to the wider application of zzso technology in the clinical zzso Two key challenges in clinical zzso involve appropriate statistical zzso of dynamic zzso changes, and extraction of clinically relevant meaning from very large zzso 

Here, we apply an approach to gene set enrichment analysis that allows for detection of zzso enrichment within a gene zzso Furthermore, we apply zzso correlation analysis and zzso exact test, using plasma marker data with known clinical relevance to aid identification of the most important gene and zzso changes in our zzso zzso After a zzso dietary intervention with zzso beef, a range of plasma markers indicated a marked improvement in the zzso health of genetically obese zzso zzso zzso profiles indicated that the effects were most dramatic in liver zzso genes significantly changed; p zzso followed by muscle zzso zzso and zzso (16 zzso zzso from modified zzso showed that the zzso beef diet affected diverse biological processes across the three zzso and that the majority of zzso changes reached significance only with the zzso zzso Combining the liver tissue zzso results with plasma marker data revealed 110 zzso genes showing strong zzso correlation with one or more plasma markers of zzso health, and 9 significantly overrepresented pathways among this set; each of these pathways was also significantly changed by the zzso zzso Closer inspection of two of these zzso acid metabolism and steroid zzso clear zzso changes in constituent zzso as well as strong correlations between gene expression and plasma markers of zzso syndrome independent of the dietary zzso 

zzso gene set enrichment analysis more accurately reflects dynamic regulatory zzso in zzso zzso and as such highlighted biologically relevant changes that were not detected using a traditional zzso In such cases where zzso response to treatment is exceptionally large, zzso correlation analysis in conjunction with zzso exact test highlights the subset of pathways showing strongest correlation with the clinical markers of zzso In this case, we have identified zzso acid metabolism and steroid zzso as key pathways zzso the observed relationship between zzso health and zzso zzso These results indicate that this type of analysis has the potential to generate novel zzso zzso of zzso
