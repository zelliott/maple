Certain zzso zzso and their regulators, the tissue zzso of zzso zzso are involved in development and zzso of zzso zzso In studying zzso mice, which have a zzso zzso in zzso zzso we observed that females exhibit increased body weight by 3 months of age due to increased total body zzso and zzso zzso Whereas zzso mice have increased size and number of zzso they also display increased food intake despite zzso suggesting that zzso in zzso zzso action or responsiveness may zzso their weight zzso Indeed, zzso promotes the expression of zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso signaling via signal zzso and zzso of zzso mediates the expression of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso mice demonstrate increased food intake and altered expression of certain zzso zzso genes prior to elevated weight zzso Thus, whereas previous data suggested roles for zzso zzso and zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso these data reveal that zzso zzso is induced by zzso in the zzso and that expression and action of zzso contributes to the regulation of feeding and energy zzso
