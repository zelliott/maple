zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso ratio was determined in 136 subjects without zzso zzso and zzso disorders, at zzso and during the initial period of 75 zzso zzso tolerance zzso The subjects were divided into 4 groups based on their body weight and zzso Group A, young zzso zzso and normal body weight zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso 25) zzso Group B, young and overweight zzso 25) zzso Group C, aged zzso or zzso 55 zzso and normal body weight zzso zzso zzso 25) zzso Group D, aged and overweight zzso zzso zzso ratio and absolute zzso level zzso correlated in Groups B and D but not in A and zzso After oral zzso load with zzso of insulin, zzso ratio invariably declined in all groups and significant negative correlation between zzso and zzso was found in Groups A, B and D but not in zzso Slope of the zzso lines obtained for correlation between zzso ratio and zzso were significantly steeper at zzso compared to the zzso zzso zzso ratio is affected by zzso and oral zzso load but not by obesity zzso Assuming that zzso ratio reflects zzso extraction of insulin, the insulin clearance at zzso is progressively reduced with increasing insulin zzso in overweight zzso failure to detect such phenomenon in normal body weight subjects may be due to a zzso zzso range in this zzso zzso metabolism at zzso and during zzso stimulation is likely to be regulated by distinct zzso
