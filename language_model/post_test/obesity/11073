What's known on the zzso and what does the study zzso As most zzso known, obesity significantly lowers serum zzso zzso So there is some concern about delayed diagnosis of prostate cancer in obese zzso In the present study, we found that the accuracy level of zzso for detecting prostate cancer was not significantly different between different obesity zzso A zzso study adjusting for several factors, zzso diet, exercise, medication and zzso which may possibly compensate for the associated effects on zzso levels, is needed for confirmation of the present zzso 

To investigate zzso zzso zzso accuracy in detecting prostate cancer according to body mass index zzso in Asian men with a zzso level of zzso zzso using contemporary zzso zzso zzso prostate zzso 

We reviewed the records of zzso patients, whose initial zzso levels were zzso zzso who underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prostate biopsy between January 2004 and May zzso zzso was zzso as performed previously for the Asian population: zzso zzso zzso and zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso accuracy for detecting prostate cancer in each zzso group was assessed based on the receiver operating zzso area under the zzso 

The mean age and median zzso level were zzso associated with zzso the median zzso level in each zzso category was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso In all, prostate cancer was detected from biopsy in zzso zzso zzso The zzso accuracy for predicting prostate cancer in all patients was estimated to be zzso and zzso zzso in each zzso category were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso there was no significant difference among the groups in terms of zzso zzso 

The accuracy of zzso in predicting prostate cancer did not change regardless of zzso category in Asian zzso However, as patients with higher zzso had lower zzso levels than those with lower zzso it can therefore be suggested that the zzso threshold should be lower in obese men to discriminate between prostate cancer and benign conditions in the real clinical zzso
