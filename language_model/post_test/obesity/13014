To assess the relationship of percentage of indigenous ancestry with body mass index zzso and waist to hip ratio zzso among Native zzso 

A zzso zzso study among zzso rural native Hawaiian men and women, aged 30 or older, enrolled between zzso 

zzso was assessed by zzso and was verified with a brief zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as dietary and physical activity histories were also zzso 

Percentage Hawaiian ancestry was significantly associated with increased body mass index zzso waist to hip ratio zzso and zzso The association between percentage Hawaiian ancestry and both zzso measures persisted after adjusting for age, leisure time physical activity and total dietary energy zzso 

zzso and central zzso were highly prevalent among zzso participating in this zzso The association between zzso and zzso with percentage Hawaiian zzso unexplained by differences in diet and physical activity, suggests genetic factors play an important role in the high prevalence of obesity observed among Native zzso
