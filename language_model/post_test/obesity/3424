zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been demonstrated to result in chronic weight loss in several zzso models of zzso However, the specific contribution of the HO zzso carbon monoxide zzso to this response remains zzso In this study, we determined the effect of chronic low level administration of a specific CO donor on the progression of obesity and its effects on metabolism and zzso biology in mice fed a high-fat zzso 

zzso were performed on zzso mice fed a high-fat diet zzso from 4 weeks until 30 weeks of zzso Mice were administered either the CO zzso carbon monoxide releasing molecules zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso every other day) or the inactive form of the drug zzso Body weights were measured weekly and zzso blood zzso insulin as well as body composition were measured every 6 zzso Food zzso zzso consumption, CO2 production, activity and body heat production were measured at 28 weeks after start of the experimental zzso 

zzso zzso attenuated the development of high fat induced obesity from 18 weeks until the end of the zzso zzso zzso treatment in mice fed a high-fat diet resulted in significant decreases in zzso blood zzso insulin and body fat and increased zzso consumption and heat production as compared with mice treated with zzso zzso zzso treatment also resulted in a significant decrease in zzso size and an increase in zzso number and in zzso zzso and zzso protein levels in zzso zzso 

Our results demonstrate that chronic CO treatment prevents the development of high-fat diet induced obesity via stimulation of metabolism and zzso of zzso
