A series of zzso studies have found a relationship between zzso and obesity in zzso Because height appears in both the zzso of zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso of zzso random errors made by zzso measuring heights can produce negative bias in estimates of this zzso 

With zzso data, height can be zzso with its lagged value in a zzso zzso zzso model, zzso the estimated association between the probability of being obese or zzso and the zzso zzso of this zzso zzso Such a model is fitted to a cohort of zzso zzso children measured in zzso in a panel study in zzso South zzso The study also collected detailed data on zzso demographic and zzso zzso 

zzso factors for zzso wasting and obesity differed in this zzso zzso was not associated with childhood obesity in either the zzso or zzso zzso In the zzso analysis, however, random measurement errors masked a negative association between children's zzso and their probability of being zzso or wasted that emerged in the zzso instrumental variable zzso This association was further zzso rather than zzso by controlling for children's household income, racial group, residence and mother's zzso 

The zzso of the findings of earlier zzso studies of the association between zzso and obesity in childhood is dependent on the precision with which they measured zzso Random measurement error can also mask an association between being stunted and zzso in zzso zzso
