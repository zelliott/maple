zzso diabetes zzso leads to increased zzso zzso of fatty acids zzso resulting in a form of cardiac dysfunction referred to as zzso zzso We have shown previously that chronic zzso of the zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso is sufficient to drive the zzso and functional abnormalities of the diabetic zzso Mice with zzso zzso of zzso zzso heavy chain zzso exhibit zzso zzso zzso and cardiac zzso We sought to define the role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso forms of zzso zzso mice were crossed with zzso mice zzso zzso The absence of zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso and cardiac dysfunction in the zzso mice under zzso conditions and following administration of high-fat zzso Surprisingly, the rescue of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso was associated with increased zzso zzso and zzso rather than changes in zzso zzso As predicted by the zzso changes, the zzso of zzso target genes involved in zzso zzso pathways in the hearts of the zzso mice was unchanged in the zzso zzso However, zzso suppression of genes involved in zzso zzso and zzso was reversed in the zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is necessary for the development of zzso zzso in zzso mice and that novel therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing zzso zzso zzso show promise for the prevention or treatment of cardiac dysfunction related to obesity and zzso
