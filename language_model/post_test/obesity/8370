zzso is associated with an increased risk of infectious zzso It has been shown to have deleterious effects on zzso zzso including reducing zzso numbers and altering responses of zzso to zzso In the current study, we examined the efficacy of the zzso zzso zzso in preventing the deleterious effects of a high-fat diet on zzso anatomy and zzso Compared to zzso male mice fed a low-fat diet, mice on a high-fat diet had a significant increase in zzso weight and zzso content, and a disrupted zzso including a reduction of the zzso compartment and absence of a zzso zzso There were a decrease in zzso zzso and mature zzso zzso and a disrupted zzso zzso as evidenced by increased zzso and decreased zzso and zzso zzso Mice that had been fed zzso along with a high-fat diet had a zzso reversal in all these zzso Western blots from zzso showed that obese mice had lower levels of the key zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and its downstream target, zzso zzso zzso this was restored to normal levels in zzso zzso zzso also reversed an increase in zzso zzso the zzso that zzso the first step in zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso is a potent inhibitor of the deleterious effects of zzso obesity on zzso anatomy and function, and this may hold promise in preventing zzso deficits in zzso zzso
