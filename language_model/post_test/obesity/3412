zzso is associated with increased risk for zzso The zzso index zzso is a measure of zzso zzso of the brain which can be measured with the zzso zzso zzso We aim to evaluate obesity as an independent factor for altered cerebrovascular zzso 

zzso zzso zzso flow zzso zzso zzso index, zzso resistance index, zzso and zzso was determined in 85 non-obese zzso Mass Index, zzso zzso and 85 obese subjects zzso zzso without diabetes zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and scores to detect risk for zzso sleep zzso zzso were analyzed for their association with the cerebrovascular zzso 

The zzso was significantly lower in subjects with obesity according to zzso and in subjects with abdominal zzso but the zzso and zzso were not different between zzso There was a linear association between the zzso the zzso the zzso index, the waist zzso and the neck zzso with the cerebrovascular zzso After adjusting for insulin resistance, neck zzso and abdominal zzso obesity according to zzso was zzso correlated with the cerebrovascular zzso 

We found a diminished zzso zzso in individuals with obesity which was not explained by the presence of insulin zzso
