Male obesity is associated with reduced zzso zzso and zzso and increased zzso DNA damage and zzso zzso however, the zzso of these zzso has never been zzso zzso the aim of this study was to assess the zzso of obesity and its associated zzso physiology and function in mice in response to weight loss through diet and zzso zzso male mice zzso zzso 40) were fed either a control diet zzso zzso zzso or a high-fat diet zzso zzso zzso for 10 zzso before allocation to either diet and/or swimming exercise interventions for 8 zzso Diet alone reduced zzso zzso and serum cholesterol levels zzso P zzso while exercise alone did not alter these, but exercise plus diet also improved zzso tolerance zzso P zzso Diet and/or exercise improved zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso and reduced zzso DNA damage zzso zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso membrane potential zzso P zzso and increased zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso parameters were highly correlated with measures of zzso insulin action, and serum cholesterol (all P zzso regardless of zzso or intervention, suggesting a link between systemic zzso status and zzso zzso This is the first study to show that the abnormal zzso physiology resulting from obesity can be reversed through diet and exercise, even in the presence of ongoing zzso suggesting that diet and lifestyle interventions could be a combined approach to target zzso in overweight and obese zzso
