We performed a zzso study comparing zzso stress and zzso in 103 children zzso into 6 groups according to zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso and 16 zzso zzso zzso and obesity (15 zzso 15 zzso and 16 zzso obese zzso Indexes of zzso zzso zzso and the marker of zzso stress zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso Model Assessment was higher in both zzso zzso and zzso children than in zzso zzso children (all P zzso zzso Furthermore, a difference was detected between obese zzso and obese zzso subjects compared with zzso zzso (all P zzso zzso and zzso (all P zzso zzso children, zzso The zzso ratio was lower in the 3 obese groups than zzso zzso (all P zzso zzso and zzso zzso children (all P zzso zzso Furthermore, a difference was detected between obese zzso and obese zzso children compared with zzso zzso children (all P zzso zzso zzso levels were higher in both zzso zzso and zzso children than in zzso zzso children (all P zzso zzso Moreover, both obese zzso and zzso children showed higher levels than obese zzso children (all P zzso zzso and in comparison to the 3 zzso groups (all P zzso zzso 

Increased zzso and zzso stress are already present in zzso zzso zzso and zzso children with a continuous zzso in relation to zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso represent 2 independent risk factors for degenerative zzso
