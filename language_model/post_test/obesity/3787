It is well recognized that there is a close relationship between zzso and zzso zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of insulin sensitivity on the association between zzso and zzso in zzso obese zzso 

zzso zzso analysis was carried out on 165 zzso obese or overweight female zzso zzso zzso free zzso zzso free zzso zzso zzso plasma levels of insulin and zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso model assessment zzso for insulin resistance zzso and insulin zzso zzso zzso body weight, zzso body mass index zzso and waist circumference were zzso zzso tests used were zzso zzso zzso adjusted by zzso method and zzso correlations with zzso zzso 

There was no significant difference in zzso levels between insulin sensitive and resistant zzso Compared to insulin sensitive subjects, zzso levels were higher in insulin resistant subjects but it was not statistically zzso We observed significant positive correlation between zzso and zzso in insulin sensitive and zzso subjects zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but this correlation was lost in insulin resistant subjects and subjects who had zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The findings of this study provide some clues about the relationship between zzso and zzso in insulin sensitive obese zzso The insulin sensitivity and zzso zzso seem to be involved in relationship with zzso and zzso by the brain via zzso and zzso zzso
