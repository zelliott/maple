Whether zzso factors and their change over time influence development of zzso hypertension in adults with initially optimal blood pressure zzso is zzso We analyzed associations of zzso in the optimal range zzso zzso zzso zzso risk factors, and their changes over zzso zzso with zzso incident hypertension, in a cohort of American Indians with a high prevalence of zzso At zzso 967 participants with optimal zzso and no prevalent cardiovascular disease zzso zzso mean age, zzso zzso were evaluated and zzso after 4 zzso zzso and 8 years to evaluate zzso of zzso incident zzso zzso In participants with normal zzso zzso baseline zzso and decrease in zzso zzso cholesterol from baseline to the second examination were the most potent zzso of zzso zzso hypertension (both zzso with additional effects of baseline waist circumference and its increase, increase in zzso and presence of diabetes at the second examination (all zzso In participants with impaired zzso tolerance or diabetes, the most potent predictor of zzso incident hypertension was diabetes at the second examination zzso followed by a increase in zzso and LDL cholesterol over the first 4 years (both zzso Thus, incident zzso hypertension can be predicted by initial zzso profile and zzso zzso variations over time, in addition to initial zzso At optimal levels of initial zzso increasing abdominal zzso and abnormal zzso profile are major zzso of development of zzso zzso zzso implications of these findings for primary cardiovascular prevention should be tested in prospective zzso
