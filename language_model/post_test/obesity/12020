zzso diabetes zzso in pregnancy results in greater offspring zzso at zzso It is unclear whether it is associated with greater zzso into adulthood, and if so, whether this is via zzso mechanisms or shared familial zzso 

A zzso prospective cohort study of zzso zzso Swedish men from zzso families was used to explore the zzso effect of maternal diabetes zzso on offspring body mass index zzso in early zzso zzso diabetes zzso during pregnancy was associated with greater mean zzso at age 18 in their zzso The difference in zzso was similar within brothers and between zzso zzso of men whose mothers had diabetes zzso during their pregnancy was on average zzso zzso greater zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso than in their brothers born before their mother was diagnosed with diabetes, after adjustment for birth year, maternal age, parity and education, birth weight, zzso age, and age at assessment of zzso zzso zzso was positively associated with son's zzso between zzso but there was no association within zzso Adjustment of the maternal zzso zzso association for maternal zzso did not alter the association either within brothers or between zzso zzso were also robust to sensitivity analyses restricting the zzso analyses to siblings born within 3 years of each zzso 

zzso diabetes zzso has long-term consequences for greater zzso in zzso this association is likely to be via zzso mechanisms, and is independent of maternal zzso in early zzso
