zzso is an independent risk factor for severe acute zzso though the mechanisms underlying this association are zzso The powerful zzso zzso zzso is decreased in zzso We recently showed that the severity of zzso in obese mice is zzso related to circulating zzso levels, and therefore hypothesized that zzso zzso would zzso the severity of zzso in obese zzso 

Forty zzso obese mice were zzso Seven days prior to study, 20 mice received a single tail vein injection of zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plaque forming unit zzso and the remainder received a control zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso Half of the mice in each group had zzso induced by zzso injection zzso zzso zzso hourly for 6 zzso The other half received saline on the same zzso zzso zzso concentration and pancreatic tissue zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured by zzso zzso zzso score was calculated based on the degree of inflammation zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Data were analyzed by zzso and zzso tests; zzso was considered zzso 

No difference in body weight was observed between zzso zzso zzso was significantly zzso in the zzso group compared with the zzso zzso zzso tissue concentration of zzso was significantly decreased in the zzso group compared with the zzso zzso No change either in pancreatic tissue concentration of zzso and zzso or in the severity of zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso zzso the pancreatic zzso milieu but does not zzso zzso in this model of mild acute zzso
