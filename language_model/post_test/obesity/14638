Weight loss reduces the risk of several zzso zzso of plasma zzso and zzso compounds, however, have been observed with weight loss induced by a dietary intervention and by a zzso This increased concentration of toxic pollutants could be a zzso of weight loss and a risk for health zzso The aim of this study was: 1) to observe if there is a relationship between the plasma concentration of zzso and zzso at steady state weight, and 2) to zzso after a zzso surgical intervention, if the magnitude of the weight loss has a direct effect on this zzso 

Weight loss was obtained in obese individuals by a zzso diet program until resistance and in zzso obese individuals by a zzso operation zzso diversion - zzso switch zzso zzso individuals were tested to serve as zzso Blood samples were analyzed for zzso and zzso compounds at baseline in all groups, after resistance to weight loss in obese individuals, and at 3 months and 1 year after surgery in zzso obese zzso 

At steady state weight, zzso and zzso compounds were found in all groups, and the sum of all zzso compounds correlated with age and not zzso Weight loss averaged zzso of the initial body weight after dieting and zzso at 3 months after surgery, zzso This weight loss yielded significant increases in total plasma zzso concentration zzso of zzso for obese and zzso for zzso obese zzso For zzso obese individuals, the weight loss at 1 year after surgery zzso yielded a zzso increase in total plasma zzso zzso 

Plasma zzso concentration increases with weight loss and is related to the zzso Future research will have to determine zzso 1) this zzso concentration remains elevated over time and 2) there are long-term effects of this high concentration on zzso
