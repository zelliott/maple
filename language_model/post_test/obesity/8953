zzso is an zzso hormone involved in body weight regulation that acts through the zzso zzso Previous studies exploring potential association between the zzso zzso zzso zzso and obesity have reported conflicting zzso The objectives of the present study are to evaluate zzso whether the zzso zzso contributes to type 2 diabetes and its related disorders such as obesity and zzso whether the gene interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes is recognized using genetically homogeneous type 2 diabetic zzso zzso 

The levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and brain were measured by relative quantitative zzso The levels of zzso protein in zzso were measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso mice was performed using a mismatch zzso 

zzso protein and its zzso levels were increased in zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso mice did not differ from those of zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the coding region of zzso in zzso mice was identical to that in zzso zzso Six zzso zzso were observed in the coding region of zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso F1 zzso mice, the zzso zzso of zzso mice failed to alter any of the variables of obesity except for body weight at 20 weeks of zzso However, it enhanced the effect of zzso on body zzso 

It is concluded that the zzso zzso contributes to obesity to some degree in zzso zzso
