In a zzso zzso study, we investigate the change in indicators of zzso zzso weight gain and gain of total fat, zzso fat and mean zzso zzso from early pregnancy to 28 weeks of gestation overall and across ethnic groups, and explore the association between the change in indicators of zzso and zzso diabetes zzso 

zzso zzso thickness and zzso zzso analysis were performed twice in zzso pregnant women in zzso week 15 zzso 1) and week 28 zzso zzso zzso was defined by the modified International Association of Diabetes in zzso Study Group zzso criteria zzso zzso not zzso 

An increase in all indicators of zzso gave increased odds ratios zzso for zzso After adjusting for zzso body mass index, a zzso zzso per week (one standard zzso zzso increase in zzso fat gave an OR of zzso zzso zzso zzso while a zzso zzso per week (one zzso weight gain gave an OR of zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso The zzso for the indicators of zzso remained after additional adjustments for insulin resistance in early zzso When combining the effects of an ethnic origin, zzso zzso per week (one zzso zzso fat gain and zzso zzso zzso (one zzso increased zzso zzso the OR for South Asians was zzso zzso versus zzso zzso for zzso 

Weight gain and gain of total fat mass, mean zzso thickness and especially zzso fat were all positively associated with zzso South zzso in particular, should be encouraged to avoid an excessive weight gain during pregnancy to reduce risk of zzso
