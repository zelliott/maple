We studied the relationships of subcutaneous zzso tissue layers zzso body fat mass zzso and zzso ratio zzso with zzso in obese children and zzso zzso obese children and adolescents (12 boys: age: zzso zzso zzso zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso 4) and 17 girls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso was estimated by zzso zzso zzso were determined at 15 different body sites from zzso to zzso by the zzso optical zzso zzso and insulin were determined by zzso zzso was associated with a greater thickness of certain zzso from the upper body and with a lower thickness of zzso from the abdominal region and lower zzso zzso correlations were found for all estimates of zzso and zzso (all zzso zzso and hip zzso were not correlated to zzso after adjustment for zzso zzso from the upper body were significantly and positively correlated to zzso Multiple zzso analysis revealed zzso as a main contributor to the variation in zzso zzso zzso zzso together with zzso zzso chest and zzso thigh explained zzso of the variation in zzso zzso In a body fat distribution model, hip circumference together with zzso zzso back and zzso explained zzso of the variation in zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso and their topography are main zzso for zzso in obese children and zzso zzso in obese children is associated with higher values of upper body zzso and lower values of abdominal and lower zzso zzso Whether zzso is under the control of certain subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso from the upper body remains to be zzso by zzso zzso
