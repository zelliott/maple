The authors zzso and zzso analyzed their clinical experience with the use of internal zzso low-level zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was generated through a zzso machine and delivered into the subcutaneous zzso through zzso solid optical zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were performed on one or more comparable zzso areas of the body in the same zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sides of 25 patients were compared with zzso and zzso photographs at 3 to 5 days, 12 to 15 days, and 6 to 11 zzso zzso analysis considered surgeon and patient satisfaction, time used in the procedures, learning curves, zzso operative technique, zzso pain, zzso zzso time of recovery, body mass index, DNA zzso free fatty zzso and zzso patterns of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Photographs were sent to the patients zzso to the operated zzso and two plastic surgeons unfamiliar with the cases for evaluation of zzso 

All patients completed the zzso zzso No complications were zzso Less pain, lower zzso higher zzso and DNA cellular membrane traces were detected in the zzso zzso zzso All other considerations studied showed no differences with either technique in the three periods of the follow-up zzso zzso studies showed more damage of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso 

No major clinical differences for zzso zzso versus zzso zzso were zzso Higher zzso of zzso acids after zzso zzso must alert us to possible zzso and zzso zzso
