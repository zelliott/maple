The objective of this study was to determine the effect of zzso on blood pressure zzso and zzso balance in obese, zzso zzso rats and to identify some of the molecular mechanisms zzso After 12 weeks of a moderately high-fat diet, rats zzso into zzso zzso and zzso zzso groups zzso per zzso At the end of the diet, zzso zzso activated zzso zzso zzso expression and activity in the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso rats were significantly lower compared with that in OR zzso zzso treatment increased zzso expression and activity in zzso rats, suggesting a possible direct zzso effect of zzso As opposed to the zzso zzso group, which showed moderate hypertension zzso zzso zzso zzso after 12 weeks, zzso rats were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production was reduced by zzso in the zzso group treated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were also reduced in zzso rats treated with zzso compared with zzso zzso Also, expression of zzso and zzso both increased in zzso versus OR rats, was reduced in the former by zzso zzso In addition, zzso treatment increased zzso zzso and expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso the results show that zzso treatment prevented hypertension and zzso zzso stress both by reducing zzso production and by increasing zzso oxide zzso
