zzso the product of the zzso zzso is present in higher zzso in blood of obese subjects than of lean zzso There is scarce information on the role of zzso in the zzso of human obesity and little is known about zzso serum levels in obese zzso 

To evaluate the influences of age, sex, zzso development and weight excess on serum zzso levels, we have studied 390 obese subjects zzso and 320 normal weight subjects zzso aged zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso were zzso in zzso and an oral zzso tolerance test was carried out in zzso and total insulin area under the curve zzso was zzso 

zzso values of zzso serum zzso appeared to be distributed according to an acceptable zzso zzso As observed in adults, serum zzso zzso in children and adolescents were also increased zzso zzso in zzso as compared to zzso In both males and zzso subdivided according to zzso zzso serum zzso varied significantly in stage zzso as compared to the lower zzso with a reduction in males and an increase in zzso On comparing the two zzso greater serum zzso zzso were observed in females of both zzso and zzso A significant linear correlation was found in both groups, subdivided according to sex and zzso stage, between log values of serum zzso and standard zzso scores zzso of body mass index zzso and zzso relative body weight zzso Using partial correlation analysis in subjects subdivided according to sex and zzso zzso log values of serum zzso and zzso insulin values, adjusted by age and zzso of zzso correlated significantly with a weaker correlation in males than in zzso In zzso the zzso zzso correlated better with zzso than with zzso zzso A weight reduction program zzso was carried out in 141 zzso and significant reductions of serum zzso and zzso insulin were observed, showing a reduction of zzso There was a correlation between the reduction of zzso and of serum zzso but not of zzso zzso No variation was found in zzso zzso zzso reduction correlated with zzso but not with insulin zzso and zzso evaluated before the therapeutic program zzso 

As observed in adults, obese children and adolescents have higher serum zzso zzso However, several conditions should be taken into account when evaluating zzso zzso in zzso There are differences, independent of zzso relative to zzso stage and sex, females having greater zzso zzso than zzso There is evidence of a possible role for zzso in the effectiveness of a weight reduction program in zzso
