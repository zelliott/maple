Several zzso have been implicated in the zzso zzso fatty liver disease zzso 

To assess zzso in zzso patients and zzso 

A total of 95 patients zzso zzso zzso zzso 19 simple zzso zzso 38 obese controls and 12 non-obese zzso were zzso zzso serum insulin, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso analyses were used to compare groups and determine zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso were higher in zzso patients when compared with both obese and non-obese zzso Analysis involving all patients revealed a significant correlation between serum zzso and zzso zzso zzso and between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso model assessment scores zzso correlated with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was higher in all three obese groups than in non-obese controls zzso zzso P zzso and P zzso zzso in NASH patients was lower than SS and obese zzso Although zzso was associated with zzso zzso zzso it was zzso on zzso In comparison to zzso four factors were independently associated with zzso age, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso was the only independent predictor of zzso in NASH zzso zzso 

These findings support a complex interaction between zzso and the zzso of zzso
