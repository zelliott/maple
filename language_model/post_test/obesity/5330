zzso sensitivity is impaired among some obese children, reflecting an zzso risk factor profile for the affected zzso This study was performed to examine the amount of weight reduction required to improve insulin zzso 

We studied changes in insulin sensitivity zzso zzso for zzso metabolism zzso model assessment and quantitative insulin sensitivity check zzso and fat metabolism zzso fatty zzso during a zzso period among obese children who attended an obesity intervention zzso The children were divided into 4 groups according to their changes in body mass index zzso zzso score zzso as zzso group I, decrease in zzso zzso or zzso group II, decrease in zzso zzso or zzso to zzso group III, decrease in zzso of zzso group IV, increase in zzso 

zzso obese children (age zzso zzso years; median age: 10 years; zzso zzso were included in the zzso The 4 groups did not differ with respect to age, zzso degree of overweight zzso or zzso values at zzso An increase in zzso zzso IV, zzso zzso zzso was followed by a significant decrease in zzso zzso The zzso improved for group I zzso zzso zzso whereas there were no significant changes in these parameters for group II zzso zzso zzso and group III zzso zzso zzso 

During a zzso period, an increase in weight among obese children was associated with a decrease in insulin zzso Weight loss was followed by significant improvement in insulin sensitivity for zzso and fat metabolism but only if the zzso decreased zzso or zzso during the zzso zzso
