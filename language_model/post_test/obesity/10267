We investigated the relationship between insulin sensitivity and the graded increase in the number of features of the zzso syndrome in a zzso sample of obese zzso zzso We hypothesized that insulin sensitivity would deteriorate with an increased number of zzso syndrome zzso 

zzso sensitivity was measured in 75 obese zzso women zzso zzso zzso zzso years; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by using both the zzso clamp and the zzso model assessment zzso Features of the zzso syndrome included visceral fat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso blood pressure zzso or zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Participants were classified into three categories based on the presence of zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso or zzso features of the zzso zzso 

We found that insulin sensitivity decreased in a graded fashion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased in a similar manner zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the number of features of the zzso syndrome increased from zzso zzso or zzso When insulin sensitivity was statistically adjusted for visceral fat (as measured by zzso zzso and plasma zzso the differences among groups were zzso 

These findings suggest that a decreased insulin sensitivity is associated with increased features of the zzso syndrome in obese zzso women and that visceral fat as well as plasma zzso zzso might be potential zzso of this zzso
