A total of 151 youths zzso zzso participated in two zzso lunch buffet meals on separate zzso They ate ad zzso after being instructed to zzso as much as you would at a normal zzso or to zzso yourself go and eat as much as you zzso State negative affect was assessed immediately before each zzso The zzso was completed 3 months, on average, before the first test zzso 

Among youths with high zzso total scores, but not low zzso scores, higher zzso state negative affect was related to greater total energy intake at both meals, with and without the inclusion of age, race, sex and body mass index zzso standard zzso as zzso zzso 

The zzso demonstrates good construct zzso for children and adolescents' observed energy intake across laboratory test meals designed to capture both normal and zzso zzso Future research is required to evaluate the construct zzso of the zzso in the natural environment and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
