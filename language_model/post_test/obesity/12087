zzso zzso tissue zzso a regional fat depot adjacent to the zzso may mediate the complex relation between obesity and cardiac left zzso zzso zzso We sought to evaluate the association of zzso with zzso measures of zzso abnormalities in the Jackson Heart Study zzso 

A total of zzso African Americans zzso zzso mean age 58 zzso from the zzso underwent zzso zzso assessment of zzso and abdominal visceral zzso tissue zzso from 2007 to 2009 and zzso examination between 2000 and zzso zzso measures of left zzso zzso internal diameter, zzso mass, zzso ejection fraction zzso and zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso were examined in relation to zzso zzso zzso and waist circumference zzso 

All zzso measures were positively correlated with LA diameter and zzso mass and zzso correlated with zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso to zzso and were not with zzso zzso zzso zzso In women, per zzso zzso of zzso we observed association with higher zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and LA diameter zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso However, the magnitude of the association between zzso and cardiac measures was similar compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso and was zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is correlated with zzso measures of cardiac zzso zzso but the association is not stronger than other zzso zzso
