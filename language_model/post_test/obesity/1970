To examine the relationship between zzso levels and visceral obesity or plasma insulin levels, we studied serum zzso levels, fat distribution assessed by CT zzso and plasma insulin levels during 75 g oral zzso load in 100 Japanese zzso zzso analysis adjusted by age and body mass index zzso showed zzso levels to be associated with visceral fat zzso zzso zzso subcutaneous fat zzso zzso and V + zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso zzso zzso By zzso analysis adjusted by age, zzso and V + zzso serum zzso levels were still highly and positively correlated with plasma insulin levels during 75 g oral zzso load zzso zzso insulin resistance zzso zzso and beta cell function zzso zzso zzso in zzso model zzso These data suggest that zzso but not visceral zzso may be regulators of serum zzso levels independent of zzso
