In zzso an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure can explain approximately zzso of the zzso in body weight gain in this dietary model of zzso Several zzso variables appear to contribute to differences in energy zzso A high zzso and an inappropriate suppression of zzso production by insulin appear to be linked to the increase in energy intake that occurs when zzso rats are provided with the high-fat zzso In addition, early tissue zzso differences in zzso versus zzso rats may contribute to differences in energy expenditure and/or to differences in zzso zzso In this dietary model, zzso to dietary obesity involves a zzso environment that includes a high zzso and a reduced ability of insulin to suppress zzso appearance zzso zzso However, this environment does not lead to obesity nor to a measurable difference in body weight gain when the susceptible rats are eating a low-fat zzso The high-fat diet is a necessary catalyst for the observed zzso in body weight gain and the development of zzso As a zzso the high-fat diet results in an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure in some, but not all, zzso This imbalance interacts with the zzso zzso environment zzso zzso profile favoring zzso zzso and zzso zzso to produce obesity on the high-fat zzso Later, in the zzso feeding period, the rate of weight gain is not significantly different between zzso and OR rats, although net fat zzso remains greater in the former zzso It is interesting that this later period is characterized by a reduction in the difference in both zzso and energy intake between zzso and OR zzso Thus, during the later stages of zzso zzso the zzso in both energy balance and zzso balance between zzso and OR rats is zzso This dietary model of obesity is relevant to human zzso While the prevalence of obesity is high, the majority of people are not zzso The high prevalence of obesity may be due to environmental zzso that interact with inherent behavioral and zzso characteristics that favor zzso zzso Resistance to obesity can be achieved by avoiding these environmental zzso by having inherent characteristics that prevent zzso zzso or zzso Our work suggests that the complete understanding of obesity will require not only the identification and functional significance of the genes that determine the inherent capacity of the behavioral and zzso systems, but also the role of environmental zzso in determining where and how these systems zzso
