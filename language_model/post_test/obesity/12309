zzso a novel zzso zzso has been shown to act as a molecular zzso for the zzso complex I and to regulate zzso zzso During Type 1 diabetes development, zzso zzso induce zzso damage in pancreatic zzso inhibit zzso synthesis and reduce zzso insulin zzso zzso was expressed in rat pancreatic zzso including zzso and decreased by zzso In the zzso zzso a model of insulin resistance and zzso zzso expression was zzso in liver and brain, zzso in heart and zzso but not affected in zzso To further zzso the impact of zzso on zzso function, two zzso lines, one with a low zzso and another with a higher zzso zzso expression were zzso zzso zzso protected zzso cells against zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso membrane potential reduction and zzso production zzso independently from the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso NO zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso and zzso insulin zzso and prevented zzso suppression of insulin zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells had opposite effects to those observed after zzso Thus zzso has the capacity to zzso pancreatic zzso function and to reduce zzso zzso
