The aim of the present study was to test whether the zzso system may be involved in the well known reduced growth hormone zzso response to zzso zzso zzso in obese zzso Ten obese women and 10 zzso control women underwent three zzso tests, at zzso zzso the first in zzso conditions, the other two after zzso administration of a zzso drug, zzso zzso 120 zzso for 7 zzso and zzso plus zzso zzso 30 zzso for the first 2 days and 20 zzso on the following zzso zzso is a new selective zzso blocker zzso zzso Both controls and obese patients showed similar normal zzso zzso levels before each test and insulin administration always effectively reduced zzso levels to values lower than zzso zzso In the controls, the expected zzso increase to zzso zzso value 56 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 55 zzso was unaffected by zzso administration zzso value 43 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In response to the first zzso the obese patients showed a significantly lower zzso increase than in the case of the controls zzso value zzso zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso However, in comparison with the zzso test, zzso administration significantly zzso less than zzso enhanced zzso response to insulin zzso zzso value zzso zzso 4; zzso 150 zzso zzso reaching values not significantly different from those of the zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
