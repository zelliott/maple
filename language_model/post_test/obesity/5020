Renal zzso II zzso is suggested to play a role in the enhanced sodium zzso that causes a shift in pressure zzso in obesity related zzso however, the mechanism is not zzso zzso to assess the influence of zzso on zzso sodium zzso we determined the effect of zzso on the zzso zzso activity zzso an active zzso regulated by the zzso zzso activity, in the isolated zzso zzso of lean and obese zzso zzso Also, we determined the levels of the zzso zzso zzso and associated signal zzso G zzso as the initial signaling components that mediate the effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso In the isolated zzso zzso zzso produced greater stimulation of the zzso activity in obese compared with lean zzso zzso of the zzso receptors by zzso analysis of the zzso zzso II binding and Western zzso analysis in the zzso zzso and brush border membrane zzso revealed a modest but significant increase zzso in the zzso zzso number mainly in the zzso of obese compared with lean zzso The zzso affinity for zzso zzso as determined by zzso values of zzso to zzso zzso zzso II binding in zzso and zzso were similar in lean and obese zzso Western zzso analysis revealed significant increases in zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in zzso of obese as compared with lean zzso The increase in the levels of the zzso zzso and G zzso mainly in the zzso may be contributing to the enhanced zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso of obese zzso This phenomenon, in part, may be responsible for the increased sodium zzso and the development of hypertension in obese zzso zzso
