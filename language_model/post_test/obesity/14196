The association between obesity and zzso disease is zzso We examined whether common carotid zzso thickness zzso a precursor to zzso zzso was associated with total body zzso or the zzso of fat mass in the abdominal region in middle-aged and older zzso 

Participants were zzso enrolled from patients zzso years, and were zzso men aged zzso zzso zzso years and zzso women aged zzso zzso zzso data were collected and zzso zzso fat thickness zzso and carotid zzso thickness zzso were evaluated on zzso zzso zzso were divided into 3 groups on the basis of body mass index zzso a marker of general zzso 

It was shown by multiple zzso analysis for zzso that age, smoking status, hypertension and zzso acid were significantly associated with zzso in subjects in the lowest zzso group zzso zzso and age, hypertension, zzso and zzso acid in middle zzso group zzso zzso Moreover, man sex, age, zzso zzso smoking status, hypertension and zzso acid were significantly associated with zzso in subjects with highest zzso group zzso zzso Analysis of zzso showed that interaction between zzso and visceral obesity zzso zzso was significantly associated with zzso in addition to age, visceral zzso smoking status, hypertension, zzso and zzso zzso 

The present study indicates a graded and independent association between general and visceral obesity and zzso carotid artery changes in patients zzso years with a zzso zzso
