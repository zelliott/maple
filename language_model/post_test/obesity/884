To test the hypotheses that obese adolescents have a lower resting zzso rate and less zzso endurance than their zzso zzso 

zzso study of obese and zzso siblings from the same zzso 

zzso referral zzso 

zzso screening of community volunteers resulted in a consecutive sample of 16 zzso zzso and zzso siblings were similar in age, zzso and zzso zzso zzso more female subjects were in the obese group zzso less than zzso 

Body composition studies revealed that the obese siblings had higher body fat zzso less than zzso but that zzso mass was similar to that of the lean zzso zzso zzso rates determined by indirect zzso for the obese and zzso pairs did not zzso Although the obese siblings appeared less fit when zzso oxygen consumption was measured in relation to total weight, zzso oxygen consumption did not differ when values were standardized for zzso zzso 

The obese adolescents did not have a reduced resting zzso zzso As in adults, the relationship between resting zzso rate and zzso mass was similar for obese and zzso children and zzso Any decreased sport participation by the obese siblings was not due to inherent reductions in zzso zzso
