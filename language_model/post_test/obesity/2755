The zzso zzso of patients with syndromes presenting with zzso makes clinical diagnosis difficult, leading to an exhaustive genetic study to determine the underlying mechanism so that a proper diagnosis could be zzso 

To genetically characterize siblings, the older sister diagnosed with zzso zzso zzso and the younger one with CHARGE zzso 

Clinical case zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso studies were performed on the zzso In addition, molecular genetic studies including sequencing of zzso typing of zzso on zzso and zzso and multiplex zzso probe amplification of zzso regions were performed, as well as zzso fluorescent in zzso zzso zzso 

The genetic analysis revealed that both sisters presented a zzso deletion due to the maternal unbalanced segregation of a zzso zzso 

This is the first report of a zzso deletion where differential diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome is needed due to the appearance of zzso zzso
