We zzso studied 26 (10 zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with different types of zzso focal zzso who received zzso as zzso zzso 

Body mass zzso zzso zzso and serum zzso levels zzso were investigated at baseline zzso zzso 26) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso weeks after initiation of zzso 

We found significant reductions in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso although a tendency for reduced zzso was observed for zzso zzso zzso level changes were mostly within the range between fifth and 95th zzso zzso reference zzso zzso inverse correlations were found between baseline values and changes in both zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso Patients with zzso of zzso zzso or greater showed the highest weight loss at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings do not provide evidence for a direct zzso involvement of zzso in zzso weight zzso
