Previous studies showed that zzso zzso mice develop obesity and impaired zzso responses to zzso zzso - zzso In this study, we examined if zzso replacement improves zzso responses to zzso (7 % zzso in zzso mice and if these effects were due to changes in body weight or to the direct effects of zzso in the central nervous system zzso zzso - zzso was measured via zzso in obese zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice before and after zzso (10 zzso zzso day) or vehicle zzso buffer zzso were zzso into the fourth zzso for four consecutive zzso Although baseline zzso was similar between groups, obese zzso mice exhibited attenuated zzso - zzso compared to zzso mice zzso versus zzso zzso zzso Fourth zzso zzso treatment in obese zzso mice significantly improved zzso - zzso (from 131 zzso 15 to 197 zzso 10 zzso zzso by increasing tidal volume (from zzso to zzso zzso vehicle and zzso zzso zzso zzso administration at the same dose administered centrally did not change zzso - zzso in zzso zzso Central zzso treatment in zzso had no effect on zzso - zzso Since the fourth zzso zzso treatment decreased body weight in zzso mice, we also examined zzso - zzso in lean zzso zzso mice and found it to be impaired compared to zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso rather than zzso is the main cause of impaired zzso - zzso in zzso mice and zzso appears to play an important role in regulating zzso response by its direct actions on the zzso
