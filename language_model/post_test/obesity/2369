zzso has generally been associated with higher bone density and lower fracture zzso However, zzso zzso of obesity may be related differently to health zzso compared with zzso zzso (such as body fat distribution and fat zzso as they may capture different dimensions of obesity and the associated biological zzso The aim of this study was to examine the association between percentage body fat zzso and prospective risk of zzso 

The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer zzso in Norfolk was a zzso prospective zzso A total of 14 zzso participants zzso men, aged zzso years at zzso were zzso The main outcome measures were quantitative ultrasound of the heel and incident hip and any zzso zzso 

A total of 556 participants suffered a fracture zzso hip zzso during zzso zzso zzso years of zzso zzso of hip fracture decreased zzso with increasing zzso amongst women but not zzso After adjustment for age, history of zzso zzso smoking, alcohol intake and heel broadband ultrasound zzso zzso the hazard ratio zzso zzso for a zzso higher zzso on risk of hip fracture was zzso zzso in women and zzso zzso in zzso The effect size in women was approximately equivalent to a difference of 5 years in age or 1 standard zzso (17 zzso zzso ) increased zzso A zzso negative association was also observed between zzso and risk of zzso type of zzso amongst women but not zzso 

The zzso appears to predict hip fracture risk in women with an effect size comparable to that of bone density as measured by heel zzso This effect was not observed in zzso zzso the differences in relationships between different zzso of obesity as well as sex differences may help to zzso the zzso and other underlying mechanisms involved in bone health and fracture zzso
