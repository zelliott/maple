zzso and zzso diabetes zzso zzso have increased in prevalence in zzso Western zzso over the zzso period zzso as the population zzso an zzso zzso 

We therefore investigated changes in the frequency of zzso over the same period in adults aged zzso years, and examined factors associated with zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso were drawn from three geographically defined locations representing different degrees of zzso 

The zzso prevalence of zzso increased in each location between 1978 zzso zzso zzso and 1991 zzso zzso zzso with the prevalence of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso increasing from zzso to zzso zzso zzso and that of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso increasing from zzso to zzso zzso zzso in the capital city, zzso In 1991 the highest serum zzso of total, high density zzso zzso and calculated low density zzso zzso cholesterol were found in zzso zzso level of zzso and the highest zzso levels in zzso zzso Higher levels of body mass index zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso physical zzso educational level, and occupational status were all associated with adverse zzso levels in zzso zzso zzso zzso in women, zzso in zzso and survey location were the most important zzso of abnormal zzso levels in zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin was also independently associated with high zzso levels in men, while in women the increasing levels of zzso insulin were associated with adverse levels of total, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and zzso In zzso data zzso zzso zzso lower baseline levels of cholesterol and zzso were associated with greater increases in either zzso at zzso zzso zzso insulin and female gender also predicted increasing cholesterol zzso and urban residence predicted an increase in zzso zzso 

Current levels of zzso in Western Samoa are similar to those observed in developed Western zzso and are increasing zzso These findings, considered along with the high prevalence of other cardiovascular disease risk factors in zzso including smoking, obesity and zzso suggest that cardiovascular disease will be a major health concern in the zzso
