The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship of homocysteine zzso plasma levels to insulin resistance zzso 

A zzso study in a primary care zzso 

zzso zzso levels were measured in the plasma of 44 zzso women zzso normal weight zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso 7 overweight zzso zzso zzso 20 obese zzso or zzso zzso aged zzso zzso Other zzso zzso central fat zzso as evaluated by waist zzso zzso as calculated by zzso model assessment zzso zzso and zzso blood zzso and zzso zzso of zzso insulin and lipids zzso cholesterol, zzso zzso 

zzso was positively correlated with insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso blood pressure zzso and zzso zzso After zzso analysis, only zzso maintained an independent association with zzso zzso irrespective of age and other zzso and zzso zzso Lastly, we observed a gradual increase in zzso plasma levels across the zzso and zzso zzso in which the whole population was divided according to zzso levels zzso zzso zzso for linear zzso 

Our study shows that zzso plasma levels are independently associated with zzso in apparently healthy normal weight, overweight and obese zzso women, thus suggesting a possible role of zzso and/or zzso in increasing zzso plasma zzso Since zzso is a well-known cardiovascular risk factor, higher zzso plasma levels may well be a further mechanism explaining the higher risk of coronary heart disease in patients affected by zzso
