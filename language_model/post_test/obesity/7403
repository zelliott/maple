High zzso and late-life zzso may increase risk for zzso zzso decrease in body mass index zzso or body weight within several years of a zzso diagnosis has also been zzso zzso in study designs and analyses may provide different pictures of this zzso 

zzso years of zzso body weight, zzso waist zzso and zzso ratio zzso data, from the Prospective zzso Study of Women in Sweden, were related to zzso A representative sample of zzso zzso women was followed from 1968 at ages zzso years, and subsequently in 1974, 1980, 1992, and 2000, using zzso zzso clinical, and other zzso Cox zzso hazards zzso models estimated incident zzso risk by baseline zzso zzso zzso models including measures at each examination were related to zzso among surviving participants 32 years zzso 

While Cox models showed no association between baseline zzso factors and zzso risk, zzso models showed that a zzso zzso greater than zzso increased risk for zzso approximately twofold zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso p zzso zzso among surviving zzso Evidence for reverse causality was observed for body weight, zzso and waist circumference in years preceding zzso zzso 

Among survivors to age 70, high zzso zzso ratio may increase odds of zzso Traditional Cox models do not evidence this zzso zzso zzso parameters in years preceding zzso onset indicate the dynamic nature of this seemingly simple zzso There are zzso and late-life implications for zzso zzso and zzso considerations related to identifying risk factors for zzso
