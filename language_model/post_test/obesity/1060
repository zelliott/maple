Acute suppression of zzso zzso IV zzso activity improves zzso tolerance in the zzso fatty zzso a zzso model of impaired zzso zzso through stabilization of zzso zzso zzso This study describes the effects of a new and potent zzso zzso zzso zzso which is able to suppress plasma zzso activity for 12 h after a single oral zzso In the zzso fatty zzso zzso zzso zzso attenuated zzso excursion during an oral zzso tolerance test and increased zzso zzso release in response to zzso zzso zzso treatment with zzso zzso (10 zzso twice a day for 7 zzso improved zzso zzso as suggested by a decrease in the zzso zzso In the zzso diabetic fatty zzso zzso a zzso model of type 2 diabetes, chronic treatment with zzso zzso (10 zzso per zzso once or twice a day) postponed the development of diabetes, with the zzso treatment delaying the onset of zzso by 21 zzso In addition, treatment with zzso zzso stabilized food and water intake to zzso levels and reduced zzso while preventing the rise in circulating free fatty zzso At the end of treatment, zzso plasma zzso levels were increased, and pancreatic gene expression for zzso zzso was significantly zzso This study demonstrates that zzso zzso such as zzso zzso could be of clinical value to delay the progression from impaired zzso tolerance to type 2 zzso
