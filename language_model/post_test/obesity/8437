Recent work to zzso the cause of zzso hypertension has focused on insulin resistance and zzso A significant amount of zzso and zzso evidence suggests a link between these factors and zzso hypertension, and acute insulin infusion studies have revealed zzso zzso and cardiovascular effects of this hormone that, if maintained zzso could cause zzso However, correlations and acute effects may not reliably predict a chronic zzso relationship, and the fundamental question of whether chronic increases in plasma insulin concentration per zzso can produce a sustained increase in zzso pressure has not been completely zzso Recent studies designed to address this question directly have found no evidence of a zzso effect of insulin in normal dogs, or in dogs with a zzso reduction in kidney mass and given a high sodium zzso zzso zzso also did not zzso the zzso effects of zzso II or zzso In fact, zzso caused significant reductions in total peripheral vascular resistance in dogs and a decrease in zzso zzso Furthermore, induction of insulin resistance in dogs made obese by being fed a high-fat diet eliminated the decrease in peripheral vascular resistance during chronic insulin infusion but did not uncover a zzso effect of zzso In contrast, insulin infusion for up to 7 days produced a sustained increase in zzso pressure in zzso Although the mechanism for this zzso response is unknown, these data indicate either that there are major species differences in the chronic blood pressure response to insulin or that specific, presently unknown, conditions must exist in order for insulin to raise blood zzso Also, it is not clear whether humans respond more like rats or dogs with respect to blood pressure changes during chronic zzso However, it is apparent that obesity hypertension is probably much too complex to be ascribed to insulin resistance and zzso zzso
