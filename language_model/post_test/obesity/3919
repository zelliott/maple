The aims of this study are zzso to describe the early time course of zzso and tissue zzso patterns in the elderly and in obese patients who survive and those who die after zzso and zzso to evaluate zzso zzso patterns for use as guides for resuscitation and subsequent zzso 

We zzso monitored 625 trauma patients upon arrival in the emergency department to assess the zzso zzso patterns associated with age and zzso zzso index zzso mean zzso pressure, and heart rate were monitored to assess cardiac function, pulse zzso zzso to reflect changes in pulmonary function and zzso oxygen zzso carbon dioxide zzso and oxygen delivery zzso to reflect tissue zzso We evaluated these zzso data after they were zzso by the patient age and body mass zzso 

When all trauma patients were considered together, the zzso findings were high zzso transient zzso zzso normal pulmonary function, and reduced tissue zzso The elderly and, to a lesser extent the obese, had lower flow and tissue zzso The survivors had higher zzso and better tissue zzso than did the zzso of each zzso 

zzso and obese zzso of severe injury had low zzso with reduced tissue zzso associated with organ failures and zzso The study suggests that zzso zzso and tissue zzso may be used as markers of circulatory deterioration and shock as well as zzso
