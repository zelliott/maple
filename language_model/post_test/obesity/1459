To investigate the effect of weight reduction induced by gastric bypass operation zzso on the peripheral resistance to insulin in extremely obese zzso 

A zzso zzso clamp was applied to assess the zzso clearance rate of zzso zzso in lean controls and in obese subjects, prior to and zzso months post zzso 

Six obese subjects (four obese zzso and two obese zzso dependent zzso before and after zzso and six healthy, lean controls zzso were zzso 

Body mass index after zzso zzso clearance rate of zzso under increasing insulin zzso 

zzso resulted in a significant change in body mass index from a zzso value zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and remained significantly greater than controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased from a mean baseline value of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at post zzso zzso zzso zzso Similar effects were obtained under the two higher insulin zzso 

zzso resulted in a massive reduction in zzso that still remained above normal zzso This could explain the effect of weight reduction to decrease, but not completely reverse, peripheral resistance to insulin associated with zzso
