To determine possible genetic influences on the zzso zzso of several key zzso factor transcripts and the transcript zzso for zzso zzso young, genetically obese and lean pigs were given ad zzso access or feed or were zzso fed at 50% of ad zzso intake for 5 zzso zzso pigs were smaller and zzso than lean zzso whether intake was ad zzso or zzso Plasma zzso zzso and cholesterol zzso were greater in obese than in lean zzso Plasma zzso blood zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and insulin zzso were less zzso zzso in pigs fed zzso than in pigs with ad zzso access to feed, regardless of genetic zzso The zzso tissue zzso zzso 4, fatty acid zzso and zzso transcript zzso were greater zzso zzso in obese than in lean zzso The zzso binding proteins beta and zzso zzso fatty acid binding zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso transcript zzso tended zzso zzso 10) to be greater in zzso tissue from obese than in that from lean zzso Several other transcripts were zzso greater in obese than in lean zzso The data collectively suggest that zzso zzso concentration for several zzso tissue proteins is a contributing factor to the excess fat deposition in these obese zzso zzso feeding did not change the concentration of any transcript except that for zzso fatty acid binding zzso which was zzso The zzso of fat was markedly reduced in the zzso fed zzso but this diminution does not seem to be regulated by zzso of zzso zzso zzso
