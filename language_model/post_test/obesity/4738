zzso body radiation therapy zzso is increasingly being used to treat zzso zzso We attempted here to identify zzso parameters that predict chest wall toxicity zzso and skin zzso in patients receiving zzso zzso 

We screened a database of patients treated with zzso between August 2004 and August 2008 to find patients with pulmonary tumors within zzso zzso of the chest zzso All patients received a total dose of 50 zzso in four daily zzso zzso zzso was scored according to the zzso zzso 

Of 360 patients in the database, 265 zzso zzso had tumors within zzso zzso of the chest wall; 104 zzso developed skin toxicity zzso zzso 14 zzso developed acute pain zzso zzso and 45 zzso developed chronic pain zzso 1 in 22 cases zzso and Grade 2 or 3 in 23 cases zzso Both skin toxicity and chest wall pain were associated with the zzso or volume of the chest wall receiving 30 zzso Body mass index zzso was also strongly associated with the development of chest zzso patients with zzso had almost twice the risk of chronic pain zzso Among patients with zzso diabetes zzso was a significant contributing factor to the development of chest zzso 

Safe use of zzso with 50 zzso in four zzso for zzso close to the chest wall requires consideration of the chest wall volume receiving 30 zzso and the patient's zzso and diabetic zzso
