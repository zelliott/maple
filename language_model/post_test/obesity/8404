zzso is caused by a selective loss of zzso zzso and is associated with zzso zzso and zzso interact with zzso zzso to influence energy zzso Here, we evaluated whether human zzso zzso or the zzso therapeutic agent sodium zzso alter the levels of these zzso 

Eight male, medication free, zzso zzso zzso with zzso patients, and 8 healthy controls matched for age, sex, body mass index zzso zzso ratio, and body fat percentage were zzso Blood samples of total zzso and zzso were collected over 24 hours at 60 and zzso zzso respectively, during 2 study zzso zzso and during the last night of 5 consecutive nights of sodium zzso administration (2 zzso zzso zzso 

At zzso mean zzso total zzso zzso zzso 142 zzso zzso zzso 175 zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 32 zzso p zzso zzso levels were not different between zzso deficient zzso patients and zzso Furthermore, sodium zzso did not significantly affect the plasma concentration of either one of these zzso 

The increased zzso of zzso patients is unlikely to be zzso by zzso zzso zzso in total zzso or zzso zzso Thus, the effects of these hormones on zzso zzso may be mainly zzso Although sodium zzso may influence body weight, the underlying mechanism is unlikely to involve changes in total zzso or zzso zzso
