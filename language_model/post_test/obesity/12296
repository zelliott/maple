The zzso of asthma and obesity is increasing worldwide, and reports suggest that obese patients have more severe zzso We investigated whether obese asthma patients have more severe airway obstruction and airway zzso and a different type of airway inflammation than lean zzso Furthermore, we assessed the effect of obesity on zzso treatment zzso 

Patient data from four well-documented asthma zzso were pooled zzso zzso zzso We evaluated zzso , zzso zzso zzso ) to either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso cell counts in induced zzso and blood and zzso treatment response in 118 zzso 

At zzso zzso , zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso values were comparable in 63 obese zzso zzso 30 zzso ) and zzso lean patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients had significantly higher blood zzso These higher blood zzso were only seen in obese women and not in obese zzso After a two-week treatment with zzso we observed less zzso improvement in zzso zzso in obese patients than in lean patients zzso zzso vs zzso respectively, P zzso zzso The percentage of zzso zzso improved significantly less with higher zzso zzso zzso zzso and the number of blood zzso increased less in obese than in lean patients zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

We found no differences in asthma severity between obese and zzso zzso Interestingly, obese patients demonstrated more zzso in zzso and blood than zzso zzso The smaller improvement in zzso and zzso zzso suggests a worse zzso treatment response in obese zzso
