The onset of type 2 diabetes zzso is preceded by zzso insulin resistance, and impaired zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a widely expressed inner zzso membrane zzso Common zzso of the zzso gene have been implicated in diabetes, in zzso and with changes in zzso zzso zzso We tested the hypothesis that common zzso zzso influence zzso zzso in four parallel studies of separate zzso We typed the zzso promoter zzso zzso a zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in zzso 4, and a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Study populations included a zzso population study, a zzso association study, and a zzso study of individuals who had been characterized for insulin sensitivity and zzso To evaluate zzso zzso levels, we examined a fourth population of subjects, who had undergone subcutaneous fat zzso All three zzso showed a trend to an association with zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso in the population but not the zzso association zzso The 3' zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with body mass index zzso P zzso zzso among zzso family zzso zzso combinations were significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels zzso zzso zzso and zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso highest values for the three traits were observed in individuals with the zzso combination zzso In the zzso study, all three zzso were associated with an index of zzso compensation for insulin sensitivity zzso zzso particularly in interaction with family membership zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso A zzso had decreased zzso zzso levels relative to zzso zzso individuals zzso zzso zzso but the zzso zzso zzso had no impact on zzso zzso We confirm modest effects of zzso zzso on zzso and zzso and show significant effects on insulin zzso in interaction with zzso zzso However, the associated zzso and the effects on gene expression are opposite to those reported zzso
