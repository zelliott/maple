In this study we examined the effect of age and various age-related environmental factors on zzso zzso insulin release by the intact zzso zzso Male zzso rats were maintained from 40 d to 12 zzso of age on standard zzso or on a zzso or zzso zzso At 12 zzso studies were carried out on the isolated zzso of each animal to determine zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso After these studies were completed, each zzso was zzso with zzso zzso and processed for zzso zzso of the mass of the zzso zzso Data from these older animals were compared with data from zzso control zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso insulin zzso per unit zzso zzso was markedly reduced in all three groups of zzso rats, and was only zzso of that of zzso zzso Thus, aging led to a decline in insulin zzso per beta cell that was not modifiable by environmental zzso On the other hand, environmental factors can influence the development of zzso tissue within the zzso and in so doing, modify total pancreatic insulin zzso The mass of the zzso zzso of zzso rats fed either zzso or zzso was between three and four times that of zzso control rats, and these older rats were able to zzso zzso as much insulin per total zzso as the young zzso In contrast, the zzso cell mass of the zzso rats had not enlarged to this extent, and the zzso zzso zzso zzso from these rats zzso less zzso These data suggest that the aging animal, challenged in zzso to zzso insulin, can overcome the loss of the beta cell response by expanding its pancreatic pool of beta zzso Although this compensation is successful in the zzso obese, middle-aged zzso it is not yet clear what effect further aging would have on these zzso
