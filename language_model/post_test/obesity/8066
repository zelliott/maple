To determine whether zzso zzso resistance index zzso value is related to increased urinary zzso zzso and whether zzso value is an independent good indicator to evaluate early zzso damage in zzso zzso obese zzso 

zzso zzso zzso obese patients zzso and 35 zzso and zzso normal healthy subjects were involved in this zzso Clinical characteristics and blood zzso of all the subjects were zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso and zzso evaluation of zzso blood flow were zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso zzso were significantly higher in obese patients than those of normal healthy zzso zzso zzso zzso value was higher in patients with zzso than those with zzso zzso analysis showed zzso artery zzso value had a positive correlation with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso and plasma free fatty acids zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso had a positive correlation with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso waist circumference zzso zzso zzso p zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso was best predicted by zzso artery zzso value even when body mass index, waist zzso zzso and zzso C reaction protein were added in the statistical zzso 

zzso zzso zzso may be an independent predictor of zzso in zzso zzso obese patients, and zzso zzso zzso could be a useful tool for assessment early zzso damage in obese zzso
