To evaluate pregnancy outcome and rates of anemia in patients following zzso operation in comparison with obese pregnant zzso 

A retrospective zzso study comparing pregnancy outcome of patients following zzso with the obese population was zzso zzso zzso zzso models were constructed to control for zzso To evaluate the change in zzso levels, we included women who had one pregnancy before the zzso surgery and one following the surgery or two zzso for women with zzso 

This study included zzso women who had one pregnancy before and after a zzso surgery and zzso obese women who had at least two consecutive zzso Using a multivariable zzso zzso model, controlling for zzso such as maternal age, patients following zzso surgery had lower rates of zzso diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared with obese zzso Women post zzso surgery were more likely to be anemic zzso as compared to obese zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A significant decline in zzso level was noted in patients following zzso surgery (a decline of zzso versus zzso between two consecutive zzso of obese zzso Using another multivariable model with anemia as the outcome zzso zzso was noted as a risk factor for anemia zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Women following zzso surgery have lower risk for zzso diabetes zzso and fetal zzso as compared with obese zzso Nevertheless, zzso surgery is a risk factor for zzso
