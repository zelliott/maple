zzso zzso formation and function depends on the action of various growth factors operating in zzso and zzso zzso however, the specific zzso function of each factor is largely zzso zzso analyses in mice have provided little information so far, perhaps due to functional redundancies of the growth factors acting on the zzso The present study focuses on the role of the zzso factor zzso in zzso zzso zzso is one of the potential downstream zzso for multiple growth factors acting on the pancreatic zzso including zzso zzso growth factor, growth hormone, and zzso zzso growth zzso To zzso its role in the zzso the zzso gene was disrupted in zzso cells in mice zzso using a zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso mice exhibited an increase in appetite and obesity at 8 weeks of age or zzso The mice showed partial zzso resistance, suggesting that expression of the zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso in zzso partially inhibited the zzso zzso zzso zzso tolerance tests, performed in non-obese 5-week-old mice, showed that the zzso mice were zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments further revealed a zzso in zzso insulin zzso Whereas zzso insulin content or zzso mass was not affected, expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso were significantly reduced in zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso mice displayed impaired zzso zzso zzso were frequently seen in central regions of zzso Our present observations demonstrate a unique role of zzso in maintaining zzso zzso insulin zzso and normal zzso zzso
