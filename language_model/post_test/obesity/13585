In this study we investigated zzso the prevalence of white coat hypertension zzso and masked hypertension zzso in patients who had never been treated earlier with zzso medication, and zzso the association of these conditions with target organ zzso 

A total of zzso consecutive patients underwent office blood pressure zzso zzso zzso ambulatory zzso monitoring zzso zzso and zzso of the carotid zzso zzso who showed zzso or hypertension on the basis of both office and ambulatory zzso zzso measurement were characterized as having confirmed zzso or confirmed hypertension, zzso zzso was defined as office hypertension with ambulatory zzso and zzso as office zzso with ambulatory zzso 

zzso was found in zzso and zzso in zzso of the zzso The prevalence of zzso was significantly higher in subjects with zzso while the prevalence of zzso was significantly higher in zzso zzso The confirmed zzso subjects as well as the masked zzso subjects had significantly higher left zzso mass zzso zzso for body surface zzso and carotid zzso media thickness zzso than the confirmed zzso subjects did zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, P zzso White coat zzso subjects did not have a significantly higher zzso index than confirmed zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso they tended to have higher zzso than the confirmed zzso subjects, but the difference was not statistically significant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso are common conditions in patients who visit hypertension zzso zzso zzso hypertension and zzso are accompanied by increased zzso index and zzso even after adjusting for other risk zzso
