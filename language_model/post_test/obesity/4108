To describe the associations between physical disability measures and knee cartilage defects in obese zzso 

One hundred and zzso obese subjects were recruited from zzso adjustable gastric zzso or zzso weight loss zzso All subjects completed zzso zzso and general health status zzso zzso and were assessed for range of knee motion, zzso alignment and zzso zzso zzso cartilage defects were graded on zzso according to established zzso zzso analysis was adjusted for age, zzso zzso and presence of clinical knee zzso 

The association between higher whole compartment cartilage zzso scores and increasing zzso age and clinical knee zzso was confirmed in this obese cohort zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso P zzso respectively), whereas new associations were found with reduced knee range of motion zzso zzso zzso P zzso No associations were found between zzso scores and zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with higher zzso cartilage zzso scores zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Higher levels of pain, zzso and physical disability zzso zzso were associated with higher zzso compartment and zzso cartilage zzso zzso 

zzso cartilage defects increase with increasing obesity and are associated with both objective and zzso measures of physical zzso zzso studies are required to assess the potential for change or improvement in cartilage defects with weight zzso
