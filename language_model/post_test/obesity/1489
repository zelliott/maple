The hypothesis that offspring growing up zzso during their fetal period have a high risk of lifestyle diseases in later life has been attracting great zzso Although animal experiments and zzso studies have been reported, most of them focused on the zzso of maternal zzso elements or zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso decreased maternal plasma zzso levels, which is a significant source of nutrients for zzso in zzso zzso we analyzed how offspring exposed to zzso status during their fetal period develop potential adverse effects in later zzso Male and female zzso zzso zzso and zzso mice were treated with diets containing 0 or zzso zzso After 4 weeks, males and females in the same zzso and dose group were zzso After continued exposure until zzso each group was divided into two groups, and one of them was zzso The remaining was further divided into two zzso one was fed normal feed zzso group), while the other was fed a high-fat diet zzso zzso After zzso zzso all the mice were zzso In the zzso group, zzso exposure at the fetal and pup stages increased food consumption in zzso and zzso mice, but not in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso exposure decreased plasma zzso levels in zzso and zzso mice at the weaning zzso In the zzso group, zzso exposure at the fetal and pup stages influenced neither food consumption nor zzso zzso These findings suggest that maternal zzso may be caused by not only nutritional zzso but also exposure to some chemicals such as zzso and the latter case may also influence feeding behavior in zzso These effects may be related to zzso zzso and diminished by zzso zzso Further study is warranted as to whether such feeding behavior influences the risk of lifestyle diseases such as zzso
