The density and affinity states of zzso zzso binding sites as well as the density of alpha zzso were zzso in the brain of lean and obese zzso zzso No significant differences were obtained between zzso zzso for these receptors in the cerebral zzso and zzso Moreover, chronic treatment with the zzso zzso zzso zzso did not alter the density of brain zzso zzso binding zzso It is concluded that this genetic model of obesity is not associated with abnormal zzso zzso binding zzso
