The authors investigate the impact of overweight in patients with chronic zzso disease and determine if the eventual effect can be explained by increased zzso zzso zzso Patients with chronic zzso disease who underwent zzso scanning at the zzso Center, zzso Clinic and Hospital during 1999 were classified according to the clinical, zzso zzso and zzso zzso system and body mass index zzso was zzso zzso duration was measured in seconds and peak reverse flow zzso in zzso zzso zzso score zzso zzso was calculated for both zzso duration and peak reverse flow zzso The zzso pattern and body mass index were correlated to the clinical zzso Four hundred and one lower zzso zzso right, 197 left) in 272 patients (173 zzso with a mean age of 60 years zzso zzso were zzso The mean body mass index was zzso zzso One hundred zzso patients zzso were overweight zzso mass index 25 zzso or zzso There was a significant association between body mass index and the clinical severity zzso This association persisted after adjustments for total peak reverse flow zzso and total zzso score were made zzso zzso patients were more likely to have skin changes and zzso zzso than patients with a body mass index less than 25 zzso despite similar values for total zzso time zzso and total peak reverse flow zzso zzso There was an ethnic difference, with Pacific Islanders being significantly heavier and younger compared to patients of white, Asian and Filipino zzso The variations in the frequency of skin changes were consistent with ethnic differences in body mass zzso The correlation of body mass index with clinical severity independent of zzso zzso indicates that the effect of overweight may involve a mechanism separate from local effects on zzso zzso zzso appears to be a separate risk factor for increased severity of skin changes in patients with chronic zzso zzso
