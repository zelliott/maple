zzso effects of dietary fat quality in people with type 2 diabetes are not zzso The study objective was to evaluate effects of zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso oils on zzso blood zzso and zzso The hypothesis we tested is that dietary oils improve zzso zzso and inflammatory markers in a zzso way that follows zzso of zzso acid and zzso zzso in serum of subjects supplemented with dietary zzso 

Fifty-five zzso obese women with type 2 diabetes zzso and 35 completed this randomized, zzso crossover zzso zzso were zzso daily of zzso and zzso for 16 weeks zzso We used a multiple testing procedure with zzso steps analysis to determine the earliest time that a significant effect was zzso 

zzso did not alter measured zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso with a minimum time to effect observed 16 weeks after zzso zzso increased HDL cholesterol zzso zzso with the minimum time to detect an effect of zzso at 12 zzso The minimum time to detect an increase of zzso zzso and zzso acid in serum of women supplemented zzso or zzso respectively, was four zzso 

We conclude that zzso of zzso daily improved zzso zzso and blood zzso indicating that small changes in dietary fat quality may augment diabetes treatments to improve risk factors for zzso zzso
