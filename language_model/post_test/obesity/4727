The construction of the Disease zzso zzso has helped promote the investigation of diseases and disease risk zzso DO enables researchers to zzso disease similarity by adopting semantic similarity measures, and has expanded our understanding of the relationships between different diseases and to zzso zzso zzso similarities between genes can also be zzso by their associations with similar zzso As a result, disease zzso is better understood and insights into the molecular zzso of similar diseases have been zzso However, zzso tools that provide easy and straight forward ways to use DO to study disease and gene similarity simultaneously are zzso 

We have developed an zzso software package zzso to zzso the similarity between diseases and to measure the similarity between human genes in terms of zzso zzso incorporates a zzso enrichment analysis function that can be used to explore the disease feature of an independent gene zzso A multilayered enrichment analysis zzso and zzso zzso zzso function that helps users explore the biological meaning implied in a newly detected gene module is also part of the zzso zzso We used the disease similarity application to demonstrate the relationship between 128 different DO cancer zzso The zzso zzso of these 128 different zzso showed modular zzso In another case study, we used the gene similarity application on zzso zzso zzso The results revealed the complex zzso of zzso In addition, the gene module detection and gene module multilayered zzso functions in zzso when applied on these zzso zzso genes helped extend our understanding of the complex zzso of obesity risk zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso can be used to detect zzso gene zzso and to zzso the zzso for functions and zzso The zzso package can also be used to zzso DO zzso zzso can reflect the modular characteristic of disease related genes and promote our understanding of the complex zzso of zzso zzso is available on the Comprehensive R zzso Network zzso or zzso
