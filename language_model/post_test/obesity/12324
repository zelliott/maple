Given the increased prevalence of obesity and pelvic floor disorders zzso we estimated changes in zzso zzso and quality of life zzso for zzso in obese women undergoing zzso zzso We hypothesized zzso would improve after surgical weight zzso 

The zzso zzso and zzso impact of zzso were estimated using validated zzso zzso and paired zzso tests were used to compare zzso and zzso zzso Power calculations deemed that 90 individuals would achieve at least 80 % power to detect a decrease in prevalence of 12 zzso 

The baseline mean zzso standard zzso age and body mass index zzso of the 98 women were zzso zzso zzso years and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased to zzso zzso zzso at 6 months and zzso zzso zzso at 12 zzso Whereas the overall prevalence of stress urinary zzso zzso decreased from zzso (32 zzso at baseline to zzso (15 zzso at 6 months zzso zzso zzso and zzso (20 zzso at 12 months zzso zzso zzso there were no significant decreases in overall prevalence of other zzso However, for women with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (20 zzso resolved at 12 months, zzso zzso Floor Impact zzso scores decreased from baseline to 12 months zzso zzso Mean visual analog scores for women with zzso zzso and zzso zzso decreased at 12 zzso 

zzso weight loss resulted in resolution of symptoms in nearly half of women with zzso and three quarters of women with zzso and was associated with significant improvement in zzso
