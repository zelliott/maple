zzso zzso inflammation is an independent predictor of several chronic diseases and zzso zzso 

The intention of this study was to determine the independent and combined effects of zzso weight loss and exercise on markers of chronic zzso 

Three hundred zzso zzso older zzso or zzso 60 zzso overweight or obese zzso mass index (in zzso or zzso zzso sedentary men and women with zzso evidence of knee zzso were randomly assigned to four zzso zzso healthy lifestyle control, zzso weight loss, exercise, and diet plus zzso The exercise intervention consisted of combined weight training and walking for 1 h 3 zzso The weight-loss intervention consisted of a weekly session with a registered zzso to provide education and support for lowering energy zzso 

The zzso weight-loss intervention resulted in significantly greater reductions in zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso and soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso than did no weight-loss zzso Changes in soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso 1 but not in zzso protein or zzso 6 correlated with changes in body zzso Exercise training did not have a significant effect on these inflammatory zzso and there was no significant interaction between weight loss and exercise zzso 

These findings provide evidence from a zzso controlled trial that a dietary intervention designed to elicit weight loss reduces overall inflammation in older, obese zzso Additional studies are needed to assess the effects of different modes and zzso of exercise on zzso
