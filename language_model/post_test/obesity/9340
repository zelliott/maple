Compared with zzso sleep zzso and sleep deprivation appear more prevalent in African Americans zzso zzso sleep deprivation may increase the risk of obesity through multiple zzso and zzso zzso Previous studies have reported contradictory results on the association between habitual sleep duration and zzso zzso we aimed to assess whether sleep quality and duration are zzso associated with body mass index zzso and obesity and test whether these associations are modified by zzso stress, known to influence sleep zzso 

A sample of zzso AA residents of metropolitan Atlanta, aged zzso years, was recruited by a zzso method in zzso The outcome obesity was defined by zzso zzso continuously and zzso zzso zzso 30 versus zzso zzso Global sleep quality zzso score was zzso as the sum of response values for the seven components of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index zzso zzso zzso score was defined as a continuous variable zzso zzso and as zzso The general perceived stress zzso derived from the validated Cohen scale, was zzso into zzso to test the zzso zzso tests, correlation zzso and weighted multiple linear and zzso zzso were used to assess the associations of zzso zzso and zzso 

The mean zzso zzso age was zzso zzso years, and zzso zzso were zzso zzso score zzso into zzso was associated with zzso Among women, after multivariable adjustment that included age, zzso physical activity, smoking status, education, total family income, financial stress and history of hypertension, zzso diabetes and zzso zzso obesity was associated with sleep quality as assessed by zzso continuous score, zzso ratio, OR zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso and with a worse sleep zzso zzso score zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso Among all participants, stress modified the association between obesity and sleep zzso there was an increased likelihood of obesity in the medium stress category, OR zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso 

Sleep quality was associated with obesity in zzso The association of sleep quality with obesity was modified by perceived zzso Our results indicate the need for simultaneous assessment of sleep and zzso
