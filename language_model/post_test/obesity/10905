To investigate the relationship between zzso in the zzso and zzso genes and zzso markers for obesity and zzso intolerance in a population of zzso zzso In addition, we examined the effect of the simultaneous presence of the three zzso on the zzso of individuals in this zzso 

This study was conducted in a population from the Pacific Island of zzso zzso in this region have some of the highest recorded rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes and are therefore of great interest in the genetic analysis of these zzso Two hundred and zzso male subjects were examined in this zzso zzso All subjects were zzso and the group had a mean age of 31 y and a mean body weight of 104 zzso 

Several zzso measures of body zzso and fat distribution zzso zzso plasma insulin, zzso and zzso zzso blood pressure and 2 h plasma zzso zzso zzso of subjects for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso 

zzso the zzso gene and zzso zzso zzso were not associated with the obese or zzso zzso in this zzso zzso with the zzso zzso were found to have elevated insulin zzso and zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso In addition, individuals found to simultaneously exhibit zzso of the common zzso of all three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited significantly elevated zzso insulin levels zzso zzso zzso 

Pacific Island populations exhibit a remarkably high prevalence rate of obesity and type 2 diabetes and represent a unique population for genetic studies of zzso In the present study we have revealed that a specific combination of zzso in zzso and zzso two candidate genes for zzso may zzso an increased risk for the development of insulin resistance in zzso zzso
