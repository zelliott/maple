The aim of this study was to assess the effects of zzso and zzso on insulin resistance and serum zzso levels in both obese and lean patients with zzso zzso syndrome zzso 

Forty lean zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso and 40 overweight and obese zzso 25 zzso patients were included in the zzso zzso and hip zzso serum sex steroid levels, insulin response to zzso oral zzso tolerance test, zzso insulin, zzso zzso levels and zzso model assessment of insulin resistance zzso were determined in all zzso The degree of zzso was determined by the zzso scoring zzso Patients were divided into two groups, with 40 (20 overweight and zzso 20 zzso patients zzso One group was treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bid while the other received zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso for 12 zzso All zzso were repeated at the end of this zzso 

After the zzso treatment period, zzso area under the curve of insulin, zzso insulin and zzso levels were observed to have be decreased significantly in all zzso The decrease in the parameters mentioned above was similar in the four zzso The serum levels of free testosterone, zzso and zzso decreased in all groups, but the decrease was statistically significant only in the zzso zzso Within the lean zzso group one patient became pregnant and was hence excluded from the final data zzso zzso became regular after zzso therapy in zzso of lean and zzso of obese patients who had zzso zzso prior to the zzso zzso therapy improved zzso zzso in zzso % of lean and zzso of obese zzso 

Our data showed that both zzso and zzso increased insulin sensitivity in obese patients with zzso as expected, and in lean patients as zzso zzso seemed to be more effective in decreasing the zzso levels and in achieving slightly greater improvement in zzso zzso than zzso
