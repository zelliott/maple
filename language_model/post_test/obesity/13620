In obesity and type 2 diabetes, exercise combined with weight loss increases skeletal muscle zzso zzso It remains unclear whether zzso capacity increases because of weight loss, improvements in insulin resistance, or physical zzso In this study, we examined the effects of an intervention of weight loss induced by diet and compared these with those of a similar intervention of weight loss by diet with zzso Both are known to improve insulin resistance, and we tested the hypothesis that physical activity, rather than improved insulin resistance, is required to increase zzso capacity of zzso 

Sixteen sedentary zzso volunteers were zzso to a zzso intervention of diet zzso zzso 7) or diet plus exercise zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity was measured using zzso zzso zzso were examined in muscle zzso before and after zzso We measured zzso content and size by electron zzso electron transport chain zzso activity, zzso content, and zzso DNA zzso zzso content of zzso zzso and zzso distribution were determined by zzso 

The zzso and diet plus exercise groups achieved similar weight loss zzso and zzso zzso only the diet plus exercise group improved zzso zzso zzso sensitivity improved similarly in both zzso zzso content and zzso activity increased following the diet plus exercise intervention but remained unchanged following the zzso intervention, and zzso size decreased with weight loss despite improvement in insulin zzso zzso decreased in the zzso but not in the diet plus exercise zzso 

Despite similar effects to improve insulin resistance, these interventions had differential effects on zzso zzso significant weight loss in the absence of increased physical activity ameliorates insulin resistance and zzso but does not increase muscle zzso capacity in zzso
