Exercise training decreases insulin resistance and increases zzso tolerance in conditions of zzso and overt Type 2 zzso However, the zzso responses in skeletal muscle at the molecular and genetic level for these effects of exercise training have not been clearly established in an animal model of zzso The present study identifies zzso in muscle gene expression that occur with exercise training in zzso zzso obese zzso rats and zzso lean zzso rats and are associated with a zzso zzso zzso zzso running for up to 4 zzso caused significant enhancements of zzso tolerance as assessed by the integrated area under the curve for zzso zzso during an oral zzso tolerance zzso Using zzso analysis, we identified a set of only 12 genes as both significantly altered by exercise training zzso change; P zzso and significantly correlated zzso zzso with the zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso are involved in the regulation of muscle zzso zzso and we provide the first evidence that zzso gene expression is enhanced by exercise training in zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso were positively correlated with the zzso expression for these two zzso Overall, we have identified a limited number of genes in zzso muscle of lean and obese zzso rats that are associated with both decreased insulin resistance and increased zzso tolerance following endurance exercise zzso These findings could guide the development of pharmaceutical zzso zzso in the treatment of zzso zzso or Type 2 diabetic zzso
