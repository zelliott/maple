zzso is associated with both insulin resistance and zzso zzso zzso compensates for the insulin resistance and thereby maintains normal zzso zzso zzso is also associated with increased tissue zzso zzso zzso To determine whether both insulin resistance and zzso might be secondary to increased tissue zzso we studied correlations between zzso content of skeletal muscle, liver, and zzso and plasma insulin, plasma zzso zzso zzso and zzso function in four rat models with widely varying fat zzso obese zzso diabetic fatty rats, zzso lean zzso rats, zzso zzso rats with profound tissue zzso and rats pair fed to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained among zzso of skeletal muscle, liver, and zzso and among plasma insulin, zzso zzso zzso product, and zzso function as zzso by zzso zzso and zzso insulin zzso by the isolated zzso zzso Although these correlations cannot prove cause and effect, they are consistent with the hypothesis that the zzso content of zzso sets the level of both insulin resistance and insulin zzso
