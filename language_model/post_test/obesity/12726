zzso patterns of three body composition measures which were derived from underwater weighing were evaluated in a random sample of 176 zzso zzso Two of the variables can be considered as primary partitions of weight zzso mass zzso and zzso mass zzso while the remaining variable zzso body fat zzso is a derived index combining the measures of both fat and zzso zzso This study represents the first report investigating major gene effects for these zzso zzso analyses revealed that a major locus hypothesis could not be rejected for two of the three zzso The single exception was zzso for which nearly zzso of the zzso was accounted for by a zzso major effect, which may reflect environmentally based zzso or may be in part a function of zzso interactions or zzso In contrast to the results for zzso the results for each of zzso and zzso were similar and suggested a major locus which accounted for zzso of the zzso with an additional zzso due to a zzso zzso Given the similarity of the major gene characteristics for these two zzso the possibility that the same gene zzso both measures warrants zzso A reasonable hypothesis is to consider genes that may influence zzso zzso as the family of candidate genes to receive the major zzso
