zzso resistant zzso zzso zzso and its control zzso zzso zzso zzso rats were used to generate a model for acute zzso Upon the onset of insulin resistance zzso rats were feed with zzso diet, and the development of acute zzso zzso injury and zzso zzso was zzso zzso was also administered to demonstrate whether improved insulin sensitivity would prevent zzso diet induced zzso injury and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso rats showed significant higher zzso of zzso as compared to the control zzso rats zzso zzso zzso P zzso indicating that insulin resistance zzso the development of zzso following zzso zzso zzso with this zzso improvement of insulin sensitivity by administration of zzso significantly reduced zzso diet induced zzso injury and zzso zzso It was found that insulin resistance is associated with impaired capability for maintaining the zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso Upon zzso load, insulin resistance enhances zzso zzso as zzso by zzso zzso expression and reduces zzso zzso as characterized by zzso zzso zzso 

Our data demonstrated strong evidence indicating that insulin resistance acts as an independent risk factor zzso zzso rats more susceptible to the development of zzso and zzso arthritis following zzso zzso
