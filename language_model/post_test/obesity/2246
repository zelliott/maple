zzso and zzso syndrome zzso are considered chronic inflammatory zzso zzso a novel zzso may play an important role in linking zzso and zzso We investigated the association of zzso with inflammatory markers and with characteristics of zzso in apparently healthy overweight and obese zzso We studied 92 adults; 59 men and 33 women whose average body mass index zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin resistance zzso zzso profiles, and inflammatory markers including high sensitivity zzso protein zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Controlling for age, zzso and zzso serum zzso level was positively correlated with body fat and serum zzso and zzso correlated with zzso and high density zzso cholesterol zzso zzso and was not correlated with altered zzso or zzso zzso Among the low, moderate and high zzso groups, high zzso individuals are more likely to have lower zzso zzso individuals in the low zzso group are more likely to have lower zzso and show more zzso zzso traits than moderate and high zzso zzso To determine the relationships of zzso and zzso to zzso and its zzso participants were zzso into four groups based on their zzso and zzso levels zzso zzso zzso high zzso zzso low zzso zzso or low zzso zzso Participants who were in the high zzso zzso group more likely to have zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to the other three zzso Our findings suggest that zzso and zzso may zzso participate in the development of zzso
