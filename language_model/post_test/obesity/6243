The purpose of this study was to validate the use of zzso zzso in assessing human body composition and to explore the use of this technique in zzso zzso adults varying widely in body composition zzso zzso body zzso underwent measurement of zzso zzso and underwater weighing zzso zzso mass determined from density zzso was compared with zzso estimated from zzso zzso according to previously published zzso zzso zzso zzso were high at all levels of body fat zzso but zzso equations overestimated zzso compared with zzso in subjects greater than zzso body zzso This effect was greatest in subjects greater than zzso body fat and a zzso equation was derived for determination of zzso for these zzso These data confirm the excellent agreement between body composition determined from zzso zzso and density but suggest that caution should be used in applying existing zzso equations to very obese zzso
