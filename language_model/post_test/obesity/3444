One hundred ten patients underwent a first zzso zzso zzso months after zzso The mean zzso index zzso significantly decreased from zzso to zzso In zzso zzso the zzso was reduced to below 10 and in zzso % to below zzso Fifty patients underwent a first zzso zzso months and a second zzso zzso months after zzso The mean zzso decreased from zzso to zzso to zzso following zzso 

zzso zzso dramatic improvement and even zzso of clinical and sleep parameters during the first 7 months, which continues at a slower rate over the next 10 zzso We recommend a follow-up zzso after surgery to check for residual disease and if necessary zzso of continuous positive airway pressure, which may lead to higher treatment zzso
