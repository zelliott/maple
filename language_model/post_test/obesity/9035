Many studies have emphasized the high frequency of obesity in schizophrenic zzso However, the characteristics of the Body Mass Index zzso distribution in Japanese schizophrenic patients remain unknown, and the aim of this study was to clarify these characteristics in a Japanese schizophrenic zzso zzso 

The subjects were 273 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso The patient zzso distribution was compared with normal control data obtained from the 2003 Japanese National Health and Nutrition zzso 

The mean patient zzso was zzso zzso zzso and the zzso showed a normal zzso The proportion of patients who were obese, of normal weight and zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso No statistical evidence of a higher frequency of obesity was found in male patients, compared to normal controls, but a higher frequency of zzso patients and a lower frequency of zzso patients were apparent in most decades of zzso In female schizophrenia patients, a higher prevalence of obesity occurred in patients aged zzso years old, compared to zzso A higher rate of zzso elderly patients and a lower rate of zzso patients aged 40 to more than 70 years old were also zzso 

The results suggest that not only obesity but also weight problems related to an zzso condition occur more frequently in Japanese schizophrenic zzso than in normal zzso The zzso of the zzso distribution in Japanese schizophrenic zzso may have a relationship with higher mortality and sudden death in zzso
