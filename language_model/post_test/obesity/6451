Previous investigations have shown that alpha zzso zzso zzso stimulation zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso of the sympathetic nervous system promoted by exercise in zzso abdominal zzso tissue zzso in obese zzso To investigate the effect of a low calorie diet zzso on the alpha zzso responsiveness and on the expression of alpha zzso and beta zzso zzso zzso in zzso 11 obese women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso body mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso received a zzso diet providing 500 zzso less than their usual zzso The zzso alpha zzso zzso effect was investigated in zzso before and at the end of zzso Changes in zzso zzso concentration and local blood flow were measured in zzso during a zzso exercise bout zzso of heart rate zzso using a control zzso probe and a probe supplemented with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed for determination of zzso levels using zzso zzso Plasma zzso responses to exercise bout were not different before and at the end of zzso Before zzso the zzso increase in zzso zzso concentration was zzso by zzso zzso while this zzso effect of the zzso was not observed at the end of zzso No changes were observed for beta zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels, while alpha zzso zzso level was significantly decreased in zzso tissue during zzso These findings show that alpha zzso zzso action is reduced by a moderate zzso diet and that zzso of alpha zzso zzso levels may participate in the decrease of the alpha zzso effect revealed by zzso
