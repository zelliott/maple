zzso zzso or zzso is frequently used for zzso zzso However, little information has been available regarding outcome following immediate and delayed zzso 

Patients were divided into Group I zzso zzso and Group II zzso zzso zzso review was performed to compare zzso length of hospital stay, revision zzso and zzso The associations between the complications with potential risk factors zzso age, body mass index, smoking, and zzso medical zzso were zzso 

There were a total of 144 patients with a mean follow-up of 47 zzso Of the 106 patients in Group I, complications occurred in 24 zzso skin necrosis was observed in zzso fat necrosis in zzso and zzso patients developed local zzso Mean period of hospitalization was zzso zzso Of the 38 patients of the Group II, complications occurred in 12 zzso skin necrosis was observed in 7 zzso fat necrosis in 4 zzso and zzso patients developed local zzso Mean period of hospitalization was zzso zzso Increased length of hospital stay greater than 1 day zzso zzso and the number of revision surgeries zzso zzso zzso were associated with the timing of the zzso In zzso analysis, no difference between groups was found with respect to complication zzso zzso zzso zzso however, after adjusting for other risk factors, the probability of complications tend to be higher for Group II zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

On the basis of the results of our study, the probability of complications tends to be higher for delayed zzso and it is demonstrated that obesity and smoking are risk factors for zzso Ultimately, these data may facilitate the provision of individualized risk information for shared medical zzso
