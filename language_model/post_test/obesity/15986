The aim of this study was to determine whether the increase in zzso zzso activity displayed by the zzso tissue of obese zzso rats as compared with that of lean zzso rats could be ascribed to a change in the content or in the zzso properties of the zzso The question was addressed in rats of two zzso in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were removed surgically (7 days of zzso or after killing (30 days of age), and zzso zzso were zzso The relative quantity of zzso was assessed by zzso using an zzso raised in goat against zzso zzso zzso from rat zzso zzso The results indicate that increases in zzso activity in obese animals were strictly paralleled by increases in the amount of zzso in zzso as well as in zzso zzso Moreover, the apparent zzso values of zzso zzso for its zzso zzso were identical in the two zzso In conclusion, the zzso increase in zzso zzso activity in zzso tissue of obese zzso rats was fully accounted for by an increase in the content of the zzso In addition, this work documents the mechanism of the increase in zzso zzso activity during zzso which is zzso mainly through changes in the zzso zzso zzso
