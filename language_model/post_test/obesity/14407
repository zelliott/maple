The effect of a zzso caloric restriction period and of subsequent zzso on zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso activity was studied in 14 moderately obese zzso The zzso zzso were made from subcutaneous fat taken from three separate regions zzso zzso and zzso after overnight zzso and from one region also after a standard zzso There was a close correlation between the activities measured from the different subcutaneous zzso The caloric restriction was followed by a decrease of the zzso zzso activity to one fifth of the value recorded during the zzso zzso However, the relative zzso increase of zzso activity was greater during the low-calorie diet than during the zzso zzso During zzso the zzso zzso activity rose but remained at a lower level than before the caloric zzso The zzso zzso response was markedly exaggerated after ten days of zzso zzso increase before dieting and zzso after zzso The changes of zzso during caloric restriction and subsequent zzso were not correlated to plasma insulin zzso The mechanism of the exaggerated zzso response to meal during zzso remains zzso
