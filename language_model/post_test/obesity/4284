The size of zzso influences their function suggesting a differential responsiveness to zzso We hypothesized that weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes zzso zzso predominantly decreases the size of large and zzso zzso zzso in parallel with beneficial changes in serum zzso and improved insulin zzso A total of 44 volunteers from the Look Action for Health in Diabetes trial, who lost weight after zzso of intense lifestyle intervention, were zzso zzso sensitivity zzso zzso size of subcutaneous abdominal zzso zzso zzso and selected serum zzso were zzso A zzso weight loss was accompanied by zzso improvement in insulin sensitivity zzso zzso disposal rate from zzso to zzso zzso zzso mass, zzso in parallel with a zzso increase in plasma zzso concentration zzso to zzso zzso zzso but no changes in the zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso Change in zzso correlated with changes in zzso disposal rate zzso zzso Mean zzso size decreased zzso to zzso zzso zzso mainly due to changes in the large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso relative number zzso zzso Our data suggest that change in the large zzso zzso may contribute to the improvement in insulin sensitivity via an increase in serum zzso Such a relationship, which does not imply cause and effect, could not be obtained by measuring only mean zzso zzso These data provide support for the measures of zzso size distribution in concert with in zzso zzso zzso and zzso in future zzso
