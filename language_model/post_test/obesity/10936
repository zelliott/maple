zzso index (the weight in zzso divided by the square of the height in zzso is known to be associated with overall zzso We investigated the effects of age, race, sex, smoking status, and history of disease on the relation between zzso index and zzso 

In a prospective study of more than 1 million adults in the United States zzso men and zzso zzso zzso deaths occurred during 14 years of zzso We examined the relation between zzso index and the risk of death from all causes in four zzso zzso according to smoking status and history of zzso In healthy people who had never smoked, we further examined whether the relation varied according to race, cause of death, or zzso The relative risk was used to assess the relation between mortality and zzso zzso 

The association between zzso index and the risk of death was substantially modified by smoking status and the presence of zzso In healthy people who had never smoked, the zzso of the curve for zzso index and mortality was found at a zzso index of zzso to zzso in men and zzso to zzso in zzso Among subjects with the highest zzso indexes, white men and women had a relative risk of death of zzso and zzso respectively, as compared with those with a zzso index of zzso to zzso Black men and women with the highest zzso indexes had much lower risks of death zzso and zzso which did not differ significantly from zzso A high zzso index was most zzso of death from cardiovascular disease, especially in men zzso risk, zzso 95 percent confidence zzso zzso to zzso zzso men and women in all age groups had an increased risk of zzso 

The risk of death from all causes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, or other diseases increases throughout the range of moderate and severe overweight for both men and women in all age zzso The risk associated with a high zzso index is greater for whites than for zzso
