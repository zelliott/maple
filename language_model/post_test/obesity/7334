The aim of this study was to establish whether short-term zzso treatment causes zzso zzso in patients with zzso syndrome and normal upper airway zzso 

We performed an zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment zzso Thirty-four zzso obese zzso syndrome patients (20 boys, age range zzso zzso median zzso zzso entered an zzso zzso zzso zzso Sixteen boys received zzso human zzso zzso zzso the remaining 18 represented the control group and received no zzso zzso monitoring and zzso video zzso were performed one night before and after 6 weeks of zzso treatment zzso zzso body zzso All patients underwent zzso assessment, zzso blood zzso insulin and zzso zzso The main zzso zzso considered was total zzso zzso index, consisting of two zzso central zzso zzso index and zzso zzso zzso zzso All patients were free of severe or moderate upper airway obstruction when zzso treatment zzso 

After 6 weeks of zzso therapy, zzso zzso zzso index increased in zzso zzso decreased in zzso zzso and did not change in zzso zzso zzso The changes were not statistically zzso The zzso group did not differ from the control group for the zzso zzso index both before and after 6 weeks of zzso zzso and zzso showed a slight increase in 1 and 2 patients on zzso treatment, respectively, and did not change in the zzso zzso
