zzso of cardiac zzso activity have been suggested in zzso We have previously shown that the skin zzso response to sympathetic zzso is reduced in zzso diabetic zzso The present study investigates the skin zzso response to sympathetic zzso in zzso obese patients and the influence of clinical and zzso zzso zzso obese and 18 healthy women were zzso The resting zzso blood flow zzso and zzso response to three tests that activate the sympathetic nervous system zzso breathing, zzso zzso and sitting to zzso were measured by a laser zzso zzso The red blood cell zzso zzso index zzso and zzso zzso were measured using a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not significantly different in obese and control zzso The zzso response to the zzso and zzso tests expressed as the decrease in zzso was significantly lower in obese patients versus controls zzso zzso zzso v zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso v zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso The spontaneous zzso zzso variations and the downward slope of the zzso reduction during the zzso and zzso tests correlated zzso with age in obese patients zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso During the zzso test, the percent change in zzso correlated positively with zzso zzso at a zzso rate of 0 and 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso assessment by laser zzso zzso is an effective zzso method to investigate sympathetic nervous function in obese zzso zzso obesity is associated with a significant reduction in the zzso response to two tests for sympathetic zzso the zzso and zzso tests; zzso the severity of this reduction increases with zzso and zzso zzso zzso may contribute to the increase in the zzso response and may thus increase the risk of widespread cardiovascular zzso
