Age adjusted zzso of zzso zzso has been found to vary substantially between the residential areas of the city of zzso The objective of this study was to assess the extent to which major biological risk factors and zzso circumstances account for the differences in zzso of and mortality from zzso zzso 

zzso study of risk factor prevalence and zzso and mortality from zzso zzso 

zzso administrative areas in zzso zzso 

Assessment of risk factor prevalence was based on 28 zzso men and women, ranging from 45 to 73 years old, who were recruited as participants in the zzso Diet and Cancer zzso Information on serum lipids was available in a random zzso of zzso zzso Information about zzso level of the residential area was based on statistics from the zzso City Council and Statistics zzso 

zzso least square zzso between prevalence of risk factors zzso smoking, hypertension, zzso diabetes, zzso and zzso a zzso zzso risk score, a zzso score and zzso and mortality from zzso zzso 

The risk factor prevalence and zzso zzso zzso was highest in areas with low zzso zzso zzso of smoking, obesity and hypertension was significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso and mortality rates amongst men (all zzso zzso zzso of smoking was significantly associated with zzso and mortality from zzso zzso amongst women zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso risk score based on four biological risk factors explained zzso of the zzso geographical variation in zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso score added a further zzso to the explained zzso 

In an urban population with similar access to medical care, well-known biological cardiovascular risk factors account for a substantial proportion of the zzso geographical variation of zzso of and mortality from zzso zzso The zzso circumstances further contribute to the zzso variation in zzso
