zzso zzso are often increased in patients with zzso syndrome and type 2 diabetes zzso but few reports have examined the associations between zzso and zzso We investigated whether any relationship between zzso and coronary artery calcium score zzso (as a marker of zzso was independent of potential zzso such as zzso capacity zzso zzso zzso and cardiovascular risk zzso 

Data were analyzed from a South Korean occupational cohort of 12 zzso men who underwent a cardiac zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of multiple cardiovascular risk zzso zzso three- zzso of 12 zzso zzso subjects had a zzso For people with a zzso median zzso zzso zzso concentration was zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso in people with a zzso zzso In the highest zzso zzso zzso zzso of subjects had a zzso compared with zzso zzso in the lowest zzso zzso With increasing zzso zzso there were also higher proportions of people with diabetes zzso zzso hypertension zzso coronary heart disease zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso modeling with zzso as the outcome, zzso but not zzso was independently associated with zzso zzso ratio for highest zzso versus lowest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Increased zzso zzso are associated with the presence of a marker of early coronary artery zzso independently of traditional cardiovascular risk factors including zzso risk score, zzso zzso vascular disease, diabetes zzso zzso syndrome factors, and zzso zzso
