our weeks after bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso in the female rat reared at 23 degrees C, the weight of the zzso brown zzso tissue zzso was doubled as compared to appropriate zzso Tested in zzso the tissue of the zzso animals zzso per unit weight, a zzso and a zzso zzso heat output about half of that of the tissue from the zzso However, zzso and zzso heat zzso as well as zzso capacity of zzso from zzso animals and their appropriate controls were the same when calculated per whole fat zzso The zzso animals were zzso with a gross energy intake zzso larger than that of the zzso Cold zzso at 5 degrees C for 3 weeks was found to restore the zzso and zzso heat zzso per unit weight of zzso of the zzso animals to the level of that of their cold zzso zzso The weight of the tissue did not change significantly in zzso animals upon cold exposure whereas controls exhibited the expected zzso zzso per whole fat pad, the zzso heat output became zzso larger in zzso animals than in appropriate zzso The total zzso capacity increased by 3 fold in controls and zzso fold in zzso zzso Cold exposure was followed by a mean increase of gross energy intake of zzso in the controls and zzso in the zzso animals as compared to their gross energy intake at 23 degrees zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
