When tested in zzso animal models of diabetes, zzso zzso protein zzso has been shown to increase the zzso of insulin and to improve zzso zzso The genetically obese zzso rat is an animal model of impaired oral zzso tolerance that does not have reduced insulin zzso In this model zzso treatment increases zzso insulin levels, resulting in lower zzso zzso However, zzso tolerance following an oral zzso load was worsened by zzso This was found to be due to an exaggerated stimulation of zzso zzso production zzso following zzso a zzso that is already present in the absence of zzso zzso has been reported to inhibit (by zzso zzso the zzso regulatory protein zzso of zzso zzso It is therefore suggested that the increased zzso following oral zzso in zzso rats either in the absence or in the presence of zzso treatment may result from a zzso zzso A beta zzso zzso or a stimulation of zzso output could therefore be potential candidates responsible for zzso intolerance in obese zzso zzso
