In zzso zzso zzso zzso in skeletal muscle is zzso We investigated whether the zzso effect of acute exercise on zzso zzso and subsequent zzso synthesis was zzso The study was performed on 18 healthy volunteers, 9 obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso and 9 lean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso matched for age and zzso All participants underwent a zzso zzso zzso showing reduced zzso zzso in the obese group zzso zzso zzso during which they performed a short intense local exercise zzso toe zzso Dynamic zzso incorporation into zzso in the zzso muscle before and after exercise was assessed by zzso magnetic resonance zzso combined with infusion of zzso Blood flow was measured to investigate its potential contribution to zzso zzso Before exercise, zzso synthesis rate tended to be lower in obese subjects compared with lean (78 zzso 14 zzso 132 zzso 24 zzso zzso P zzso zzso Exercise induced highly significant rises in zzso synthesis rates in both groups, but the increase in obese subjects was reduced compared with lean zzso zzso 15 zzso 186 zzso 27 zzso zzso P zzso zzso although the relative increase was similar zzso zzso 35 zzso 202 zzso zzso P zzso zzso After exercise, blood flow increased equally in both groups, without a zzso relationship with the rate of zzso zzso In conclusion, this study shows a zzso effect of a short bout of acute exercise on zzso zzso synthesis rate that is reduced in absolute values but similar in percentages in obese zzso These results suggest a shared zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso
