Body fat distribution has been reported to zzso contribute to the development of cardiovascular zzso We report the relative associations between general and central obesity and risk factors in zzso Chinese subjects recruited from the Hong Kong zzso 

zzso parameters zzso circumference zzso and zzso surrogate measures of insulin resistance zzso plasma zzso and insulin, oral zzso tolerance test, 2 hours zzso and zzso zzso lipids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso blood pressure were zzso General obesity was classified as zzso or zzso zzso and central obesity as a zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso in women and men, zzso 

A total of zzso of the population was found to be zzso zzso per zzso increased the levels of the risk factors, but central zzso contributed to a greater extent to adverse zzso zzso zzso and insulin resistance zzso There was a continuous relationship between increasing zzso both general and central, and cardiovascular risk, with lowest risk associated with the lowest zzso of zzso In the zzso zzso subjects divided into zzso of zzso or zzso the levels of the cardiovascular risk factors still significantly increased with increasing zzso of zzso 

Central zzso appears to contribute to a greater extent than general zzso to the development of cardiovascular risk in this zzso The relationship between obesity parameters and risk is a zzso with risk factors significantly increasing even at levels usually considered zzso These observations support the proposed zzso of overweight and obesity in Asian populations using lower zzso zzso
