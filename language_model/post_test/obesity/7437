We reviewed the zzso literature on the association of obesity and urinary zzso and summarized clinical trial data on the effect of weight loss on urinary zzso 

We systematically searched for published community based prevalence studies with zzso or zzso analysis of the association of urinary zzso and zzso in zzso Case series and zzso controlled trials of the effect of zzso behavioral and pharmacological weight loss on urinary zzso are zzso 

zzso studies showed that obesity is a strong independent risk factor for prevalent and incident urinary zzso There was a clear zzso effect of weight on urinary zzso with each zzso increase in body mass index associated with about a zzso to zzso increase in the urinary zzso risk, and the maximum effect of weight rarely exceeded an OR of greater than 4 to 5 on well controlled zzso The odds of incident urinary zzso during 5 to 10 years increased by approximately zzso to zzso for each zzso increase in body mass zzso There may be a stronger association of increasing weight with prevalent and incident stress zzso including mixed zzso than with urge zzso and zzso zzso zzso Weight loss studies indicated that surgical and zzso weight loss led to significant improvements in urinary zzso zzso 

zzso studies document overweight and obesity as important risk factors for urinary zzso Weight loss by surgical and more conservative approaches is effective to decrease urinary zzso symptoms and should be strongly considered a first line treatment in this patient zzso
