Previous studies have shown that saturated fatty acids cause insulin resistance zzso that is prevented by zzso fatty zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso is a putative zzso inhibitor of insulin zzso but its role in insulin zzso is zzso This study aimed to determine whether fatty acids regulate zzso via zzso 

We treated zzso cells with saturated and zzso fatty acids and evaluated zzso zzso We then tested whether regulation of zzso occurred through zzso zzso zzso stress, and whether modulating zzso and zzso stress marker genes was necessary and/or sufficient for regulation of insulin zzso To test the in zzso significance of this zzso we fed mice zzso diets with different fatty acid profiles and assessed zzso variables of diabetes, zzso stress markers and zzso expression in the zzso 

Our data show that fatty acids zzso regulate zzso through zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso a standard and widely used zzso diet high in zzso fats failed to induce zzso stress, zzso or zzso However, an alternative zzso diet with lower zzso fat zzso the cell studies by causing zzso stress, zzso induction and zzso 

This study revealed a novel mechanism linking dietary fat composition to zzso Given the emerging roles for zzso stress in zzso liver disease, we conclude that dietary fat composition rather than total amount may mediate zzso pathology associated with zzso
