After zzso radical zzso zzso dissection zzso the therapy for zzso zzso constitutes a zzso zzso factors for the genesis of zzso zzso have not been sufficiently zzso We investigated possible factors that could influence the development of zzso zzso in patients suffering from zzso melanoma after zzso zzso 

The analysis was related to patients with zzso and zzso zzso zzso melanoma of the lower zzso who underwent zzso and isolated limb zzso zzso Prospective data acquisition from patients undergoing zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso approach was zzso The association of zzso zzso to risk factors was calculated using zzso zzso test and zzso zzso As possible risk factors we investigated the presence of prior surgery and diabetes zzso type II in the medical history, zzso patient age and the body mass index zzso 

zzso zzso zzso occurred in 11 of 108 patients zzso A significant association to zzso zzso was found in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Other zzso such as prior surgery zzso zzso zzso diabetes zzso type II zzso zzso zzso zzso and patient age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed no zzso 

Our results indicate that the zzso of zzso zzso after zzso and zzso of zzso melanoma of the lower limb was associated with an increased zzso Thus, for the prevention of zzso zzso an initially alternative zzso dressing like vacuum assisted closure zzso dressing could be of clinical relevance for obese zzso
