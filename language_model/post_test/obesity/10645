Increased dietary sodium has been reported to increase cardiovascular disease zzso risk, perhaps through blood pressure zzso vascular zzso zzso zzso thickness zzso is an accepted measure of structural vascular zzso and a strong predictor of zzso This study aimed to determine whether urinary sodium is positively associated with carotid zzso in zzso overweight and obese zzso 

We evaluated baseline data from 258 participants in the Slow zzso zzso zzso zzso clinical zzso zzso sodium was measured from one zzso urine collection from each zzso zzso zzso was measured using high-resolution zzso zzso Participants were zzso into zzso of urinary zzso 

There was a significant positive trend with greater zzso associated with increasing urinary sodium zzso in zzso linear zzso zzso zzso zzso This trend was significant when adjusting for age, sex, race, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as in a fully adjusted model zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso the highest urinary sodium zzso had a significantly greater mean zzso zzso zzso than the lowest urinary sodium zzso zzso zzso after adjustment for age, sex, race, and zzso zzso zzso zzso This comparison lost significance after the addition of zzso 

In our community-based sample of zzso overweight and obese adults, we observed a significant positive trend in carotid zzso with increasing zzso of urinary zzso If the ongoing clinical trial confirms this relationship between sodium and carotid zzso it would lend support to efforts to decrease sodium intake in overweight and obese zzso
