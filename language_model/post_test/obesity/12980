zzso is observed in obese animals and humans, suggesting that zzso resistance rather than zzso zzso is a characteristic feature of zzso This study was designed to determine whether peripherally or centrally administered zzso is effective on the short-term food intake and expression of zzso protein in the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso The zzso rat exhibits a zzso syndrome of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Male zzso rats of 5, 8, and 14 weeks of age became heavier than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were not significantly different between zzso and zzso rats at the age of 5 weeks, but in 8- and zzso zzso rats were increased to zzso and zzso times those of zzso rats, zzso The zzso zzso and zzso rats were given zzso zzso injections with zzso mouse zzso to measure the zzso There was a dramatic increase in plasma zzso concentration at 1 zzso a decline by 3 zzso and the zzso 6 h after injection were similar to the zzso zzso There were no significant difference between zzso and zzso zzso In zzso rats at 5, 8 and 14 weeks of age, zzso injection of zzso significantly decreased food zzso Whereas 5-week-old zzso rats responded to zzso with a decrease in food zzso 8- and zzso zzso rats became resistant to peripherally administered zzso In contrast, zzso zzso injections of zzso were very effective in zzso food intake in both zzso and zzso rats at 14 weeks of zzso zzso injection of zzso in the zzso rats at each age increased the number of zzso zzso detected in the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas there was no significant increase in the number of cells expressing zzso protein in the zzso of the 8- and 14 zzso zzso rats with zzso On the other hand, increased expression of zzso protein in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso following zzso injection of zzso was observed in both zzso and zzso rats at 5, 8 and 14 weeks of zzso These data demonstrated that obese zzso rats are peripherally zzso zzso while they retain sensitivity to centrally administered zzso
