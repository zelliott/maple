zzso an zzso hormone, has emerged as a potential candidate for the link between obesity and the zzso zzso Specifically, zzso zzso zzso zzso cells toward a zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso balance in obese children and its relation with hormonal and zzso zzso 

In 50 obese children and 20 control children, we measured the zzso zzso cells that zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso as an index of zzso zzso and zzso zzso as an index of zzso zzso as well as serum zzso insulin, insulin resistance zzso index (as zzso model assessment model zzso zzso profile, zzso zzso and zzso zzso children also underwent dual energy X-ray zzso scan zzso and liver ultrasound zzso 

Geometric mean percentages of zzso and zzso zzso cells in obese children were not significantly different from those found in control zzso However, the geometric mean percentage of zzso T cells zzso zzso was significantly higher in the obese than in the control zzso zzso zzso zzso Within the entire group of study children, the percentage of zzso cells was positively associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso values zzso zzso zzso However, when these associations were restricted to the group of obese subjects, insulin and zzso values, but not zzso retained statistical zzso Yet, in the obese group, the percentage of zzso cells was associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not with body mass zzso zzso score and total body fat zzso 

In obese children, a shift to zzso profile dominated by the production of zzso is related to insulin resistance as well as to NASH independently of zzso features and other zzso zzso The prevalent zzso pattern of zzso zzso may be regarded as a mechanism contributing to inflammation in zzso
