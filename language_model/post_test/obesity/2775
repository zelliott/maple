zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso play a crucial role in cellular energy zzso and a zzso zzso ratio is implicated in zzso zzso However, it is still unknown whether a modulating zzso zzso ratio is beneficial in treating zzso zzso We tried to determine whether pharmacological stimulation of zzso zzso provides therapeutic effects in zzso models of zzso zzso 

We used zzso zzso a natural zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso to stimulate zzso zzso The zzso pharmacological effect on cellular energy metabolism was evaluated in cells derived from zzso zzso In zzso therapeutic effects of zzso on zzso syndrome were examined in zzso obesity zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso by zzso strongly provoked zzso fatty acid zzso in zzso and in zzso These effects were accompanied by zzso of zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso and suppression of zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso systemic zzso administration in zzso models of zzso syndrome dramatically ameliorated their key symptoms such as increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and fatty zzso The treated mice also showed higher expressions of the genes related to zzso energy metabolism zzso zzso nuclear respiratory zzso and caloric restriction zzso consistent with the increased zzso zzso and energy zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso resolves obesity and related zzso in mice, opening the possibility that it may provide the basis for a new therapy for the treatment of zzso zzso
