In population surveys, blood pressure and plasma insulin concentration are related zzso but the association is zzso by age and zzso Whether insulin resistance is independently associated with higher blood pressure in normal subjects is zzso We analyzed the database of the European Group for the Study of zzso zzso made up of zzso men and women from 20 centers, in whom insulin sensitivity was measured by the zzso insulin zzso After excluding subjects zzso or zzso years, those with severe obesity zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso and those with abnormal blood pressure values zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso cases zzso 18 to 70 years; zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso were available for zzso In zzso analysis, both zzso and zzso blood pressures were zzso related to insulin sensitivity, with r values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In a zzso model simultaneously accounting for sex, age, zzso and zzso insulin, zzso and zzso blood pressures were still zzso related to insulin sensitivity zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso In this model, age was positively related to blood pressure levels independently of insulin sensitivity, whereas zzso was zzso The predicted impact on blood pressure of a decrease in insulin sensitivity of 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso similar to that associated with a 10-year difference in zzso Although insulin levels and insulin action were zzso zzso zzso blood pressure varied as a simultaneous function of zzso In zzso zzso Europeans, insulin sensitivity and age are zzso mutually independent zzso of blood pressure, whereas body mass is zzso The relation of blood pressure to both insulin action and circulating insulin levels is compatible with distinct influences on blood pressure by insulin resistance and zzso zzso
