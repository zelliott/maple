The number of genetic features potentially contributing to the development of obesity and of zzso continues to expand, even while evidence from zzso studies and prospective zzso evaluations of risk factors continue to argue strongly for zzso factors in the expression of these zzso Even as the intensive search goes on for the zzso zzso it is zzso clear that treatment initiatives can and must be oriented to reducing the well-established risk factors, most likely through multiple simultaneous interventions and zzso Clearly restriction of calories is the most immediately effective of the various tools currently zzso The recent results of long-term minimal restriction suggest extraordinary benefits to health can result for those predisposed to the zzso or insulin resistance zzso Changes in diet composition may facilitate maintenance of a lower calorie zzso but in themselves they are not likely to significantly alter the risks of the syndrome, with the exception of lower cholesterol diets for reducing elevated cholesterol zzso Exercise and increased general physical activity must be seen as potentially zzso however, because of the magnitude of the physical training activities likely to be effective in lowering insulin resistance on a chronic basis, the expected outcomes from the usual types of relatively limited exercise regimen are less likely to have powerful preventive zzso Nevertheless, the combination of exercise and moderate zzso in caloric intake is likely to have a synergistic beneficial zzso zzso interventions in the insulin resistance syndrome are in their early zzso zzso and we look forward to new developments in this zzso zzso zzso agents are greatly needed, and new understanding of the excess risk carried by obesity for many features of the zzso or insulin resistance syndrome suggest the urgency of greater investment in research toward new modes of zzso We look forward with great anticipation to the next zzso zzso and zzso Resistance Conference, where new progress in zzso new understanding of zzso new genetic markers and zzso and new treatment candidates are sure to be zzso
