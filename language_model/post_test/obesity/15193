A disproportionate expansion of white zzso tissue and abnormal recruitment of zzso precursor cells can not only lead to obesity but also impair zzso zzso which are both common causes of insulin resistance and diabetes zzso The development of novel and effective therapeutic strategies to slow the progression of zzso diabetes zzso and their associated complications will require improved understanding of zzso and zzso zzso zzso might have a role in zzso maturation and systemic zzso zzso zzso increases zzso differentiation in zzso and mice that lack zzso activity are lean zzso to reduced white zzso tissue zzso moreover, mice that lack the zzso gene (which encodes zzso are resistant to obesity induced by a high-fat zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso mice reduces obesity and increases insulin sensitivity, which lowers blood zzso zzso Energy metabolism might also be influenced by zzso However, further studies are needed to explore the possibility that zzso could be a novel therapeutic target to reduce obesity and related zzso and to determine whether and how zzso might influence the regulation and function of a related zzso zzso which is also involved in energy zzso
