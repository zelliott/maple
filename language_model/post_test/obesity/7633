Experimental studies have shown that tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression in zzso On the other hand, the induction of zzso production by zzso in zzso and zzso has also been zzso 

To assess the possible zzso between plasma zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso soluble zzso in obese women zzso or not, the criteria of zzso syndrome zzso 

zzso two obese women were included in the zzso zzso syndrome, based on zzso criteria (2005) was diagnosed in 71 subjects zzso age 53 zzso 9 years; body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso waist circumference zzso zzso zzso zzso The remaining 21 formed the zzso zzso zzso age 52 zzso 9 years, body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso waist circumference zzso zzso zzso zzso Fourteen healthy normal weight women served as zzso In all subjects, body composition was assessed by the zzso zzso 

In the zzso zzso but not in the zzso zzso zzso levels were significantly higher than in zzso We did not observe any significant difference in plasma zzso of zzso zzso or zzso between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Only in the zzso zzso and in the combined analysis of all study zzso did plasma zzso zzso correlate significantly with zzso levels (R zzso zzso p zzso zzso R zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso Additionally, in the zzso zzso there was a positive correlation between zzso levels and insulin resistance (R zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso in zzso syndrome should be regarded as a zzso factor indirectly zzso the development of insulin zzso
