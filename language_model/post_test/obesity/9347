To examine the prevalence of under and zzso of energy intake in adolescents and their associated zzso 

zzso study with 96 zzso adolescents zzso zzso and 49 zzso mean age of zzso zzso Weight and height were measured, and body mass index was zzso Body composition was assessed by dual energy X-ray zzso zzso intake was evaluated by a zzso dietary zzso zzso assessment was performed zzso total cholesterol, zzso zzso plasma zzso and zzso zzso reported energy intake zzso zzso zzso zzso rate zzso whereas zzso reported energy zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Energy intake misreporting (under or zzso was identified in zzso of adolescents zzso and zzso of under and zzso zzso zzso adolescents were zzso times more likely to underreport energy intake zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso showed higher rates of insufficient intake of zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and lipids zzso zzso zzso p zzso than plausible zzso zzso intake was also lower in zzso zzso zzso zzso There were no significant differences in body composition and zzso parameters in relation to zzso 

The results obtained demonstrated a high percentage of misreporting of energy intake among zzso especially among obese subjects, which suggests that zzso zzso intake values should be employed in zzso risk analysis in order to contribute to a reduction in errors associated with zzso
