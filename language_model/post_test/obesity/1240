zzso zzso has recently been proposed as the peripheral signal indicating the zzso of nutritional status for zzso zzso To test whether low plasma zzso concentration for a given degree of zzso is associated with zzso dysfunction, we measured plasma zzso concentration and body composition in young zzso women with normal or abnormal zzso zzso 

zzso plasma zzso concentration zzso body composition zzso energy X-ray zzso and zzso status zzso history and hormonal zzso were assessed in 34 zzso women characterized by different levels of physical zzso 

Body fat content and plasma zzso concentration were both reduced in women with impaired zzso function zzso zzso zzso zzso However, after adjusting plasma zzso concentration for percentage body fat, there was no independent association between zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso abnormalities in young zzso women seem to occur as a consequence of the linear decline in zzso and plasma zzso concentration observed in response to inadequate nutritional zzso zzso of zzso below zzso and plasma zzso concentration below 3 zzso are more likely to be associated with impaired zzso zzso
