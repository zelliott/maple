zzso total zzso zzso zzso has proven to be feasible and zzso However, it represents a major technical challenge, since it involves the dissection of the zzso in a confined space such as the zzso pelvis using zzso surgical zzso This difficulty is zzso in patients with zzso tumors and high body mass index zzso in which the surgical margins and the zzso nerves may be zzso zzso robotic surgery aims to overcome these limitations that conspire against the zzso surgical approach of zzso zzso We present an obese zzso zzso 32 zzso 82-year-old man with a history of smoking and prostate cancer that was recently diagnosed with a middle zzso zzso at 9 zzso from the zzso zzso zzso examination evidenced a mobile zzso zzso zzso scan ruled out zzso and at the local staging by zzso the tumor was considered as zzso with free zzso zzso zzso treatment was decided and a hybrid technique was used combining an initial zzso approach followed by the robotic zzso The patient had a full recovery and was discharged three days after surgery without zzso zzso examination revealed a zzso zzso with zzso invasion, free zzso and zzso margins, and 24 negative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed safely in an obese zzso It facilitated dissection maneuvers in a confined space with proper identification and preservation of the zzso nerves, allowing retrieving an intact zzso Prospective zzso trials will define the role of this new zzso
