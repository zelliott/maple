zzso zzso zzso volume, and plasma zzso activity were determined in 135 lean, zzso obese, or distinctly overweight subjects who were zzso or had borderline or established essential zzso zzso output (but not zzso was higher and peripheral resistance lower in obese than in lean subjects, except in borderline zzso zzso volume was increased in obese patients, and more so when corrected for body zzso correction for body weight led to relative volume zzso zzso volume correlated directly with cardiac output in the entire population, as well as in the zzso zzso volume correlated zzso with total peripheral resistance in all subjects and in each zzso Both correlations remained significant when an approximation was used to correct influences of obesity on total blood zzso zzso zzso was higher in obese than in lean zzso Thus, despite the expanded zzso volume in zzso the zzso relationship between systemic zzso and zzso volumes remains zzso Relatively low peripheral resistance in obesity may decrease the risk of systemic vascular zzso Nevertheless, since circulating volume is increased, the greater zzso return adds an additional load to a left zzso that is already burdened by a high zzso caused by zzso zzso
