To report our experience with zzso partial zzso zzso in obese patients compared with a contemporary cohort of zzso zzso 

We defined obesity as a body mass index zzso zzso 30 zzso From June 2004 to September 2009, 97 patients underwent zzso at our institution, of whom 49 were obese zzso 1) and 48 were zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso zzso We compared zzso operative data, zzso and pathological outcomes between these two zzso 

The average zzso for the obese group was zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso Median tumor size was zzso versus zzso zzso for obese and zzso groups, zzso zzso patients had a larger median estimated blood loss zzso zzso zzso zzso and a trend toward a longer median operative time zzso zzso zzso minutes, zzso and median warm zzso time zzso zzso zzso minutes, zzso but this did not achieve statistical zzso An zzso complication occurred in one patient in each zzso The zzso complication rate was not statistically significant between the two groups zzso zzso zzso zzso The median hospital stay was 2 days for both zzso 

zzso is safe and feasible in obese zzso zzso patients had a higher estimated blood loss and a trend toward greater operative time and warm zzso time, which did not achieve statistical zzso
