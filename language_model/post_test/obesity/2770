Although both general and abdominal zzso are well-established risk factors for coronary heart disease, their associations with stroke are less well zzso particularly in generally lean Asian zzso 

We evaluated associations of body mass index zzso zzso ratio zzso waist circumference zzso and zzso ratio zzso with stroke risk in the Shanghai Women's Health zzso a zzso prospective cohort study of 74 zzso Chinese women aged 40 to 70 years with zzso measurement taken at recruitment in 1996 to zzso For this analysis, we included 67 zzso women with no prior history of stroke, coronary heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, cardiac surgery, or cancer at zzso zzso stroke was zzso by zzso home visits and linkage with vital statistics zzso 

Cut points for the highest zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso among this cohort were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso During a mean follow-up of zzso years, zzso incident stroke cases were zzso All selected zzso zzso were positively and significantly associated with risk of total, zzso and zzso stroke in a zzso manner (all probability values for trend zzso The zzso hazard ratios zzso confidence zzso for total stroke comparing the highest versus lowest zzso of these zzso were zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso levels of general or abdominal zzso consistently predict increased risk of stroke in predominantly zzso Chinese zzso
