Of the surgery patients, zzso underwent gastric zzso zzso gastric zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso received conventional obesity zzso 

Annual hospital days zzso years 1 to 20; data capture zzso median follow-up 15 zzso and zzso care zzso visits (years zzso data capture zzso median follow-up 9 zzso were retrieved from the National Patient zzso and drug costs from the zzso Drug Register (years zzso data capture zzso median follow-up 6 zzso zzso linkage was complete for more than zzso of patients zzso of zzso Mean differences were adjusted for baseline age, sex, smoking, diabetes status, body mass index, inclusion period, and (for the zzso care zzso hospital days the year before the index zzso 

In the 20 years following their zzso zzso surgery patients used a total of 54 mean cumulative hospital days compared with 40 used by those in the control group zzso difference, 15; zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso During the years 2 through 6, surgery patients had an accumulated annual mean of zzso hospital days vs zzso days among control patients zzso difference, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso From year 7 to 20, both groups had a mean annual zzso hospital days zzso difference, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso Surgery patients had a mean annual zzso zzso care zzso visits during the years 2 through 6 vs zzso among the controls zzso difference, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso but from year 7, the 2 groups did not differ zzso vs zzso mean annual zzso adjusted difference, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso From year 7 to 20, the surgery group incurred a mean annual drug cost of US zzso the control patients, zzso zzso difference, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso
