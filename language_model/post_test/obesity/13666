zzso and type 2 diabetes zzso are disease states associated with hallmark features such as insulin resistance and an impaired ability to zzso zzso It has recently been reported that an optimal exercise intensity for fat zzso zzso zzso we zzso that continuous exercise training at this specific intensity can lead to greater improvements in fat zzso and insulin sensitivity than a zzso zzso training zzso 

In a zzso crossover design, eight zzso obese, but otherwise healthy male participants performed two zzso blocks of endurance training, either at a predetermined intensity zzso zzso fat zzso zzso or at zzso intervals of zzso zzso zzso zzso During the week preceding the exercise training and 48 h after the final exercise zzso an zzso V zzso test, zzso exercise, and zzso of body composition were zzso Diet was controlled the day before all trials zzso zzso zzso fat, and zzso zzso approximately 2900 zzso zzso were compared using zzso zzso analyses of zzso 

It was shown that fat zzso rates were increased by zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso but not after zzso and the zzso insulin sensitivity index was increased by zzso after zzso zzso zzso These changes occurred despite no change in body weight, body mass index zzso waist to hip ratio zzso percent body fat zzso or V zzso 

A continuous exercise training protocol that can elicit high rates of fat zzso increases the contribution of fat to zzso zzso during exercise and can significantly increase insulin sensitivity compared with a zzso zzso zzso
