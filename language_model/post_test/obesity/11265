Increased body mass index zzso is associated with a higher risk of zzso zzso disease zzso 

To investigate whether zzso affects zzso pump inhibitor zzso when used in a single dose in patients with zzso 

Post hoc analyses by patient zzso were performed on data from two zzso zzso zzso crossover studies comparing the zzso of zzso 20 zzso and zzso 40 zzso in zzso patients with a history of nocturnal zzso The primary zzso was the mean percentage of time with zzso zzso between lean and zzso patients zzso zzso and zzso 

24 h baseline zzso pH values were not different between zzso zzso The zzso effects of both zzso pump zzso were not significantly different between zzso groups, and no evidence was found for an interaction between zzso and zzso As compared with zzso zzso showed a significantly greater effect on the zzso response for both zzso zzso 

zzso in zzso patients does not appear to affect the zzso efficacy of a single dose of zzso and zzso These data do not support adapting the dosage of zzso and zzso according to zzso in zzso patients when administered as an on-demand therapy zzso
