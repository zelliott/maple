Weight excess is associated with increased zzso zzso Data in overt obesity suggest a role for altered zzso zzso Whether body mass index zzso is also relevant to zzso function in non-obese subjects is zzso 

We studied the relation between zzso and zzso zzso in 102 healthy, non-obese zzso zzso zzso subjects zzso zzso 43 zzso mean age 39 zzso zzso in a zzso analysis of subjects evaluated as prospective kidney donors or as healthy volunteers in zzso zzso zzso 

Mean zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso pressure zzso 93 zzso 11 zzso zzso zzso zzso rate zzso zzso zzso 111 zzso 19 zzso zzso effective zzso plasma flow zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 108 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On zzso analysis, zzso correlated zzso with zzso zzso body surface area zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and positively with zzso zzso zzso P zzso and age zzso zzso P zzso On zzso analysis both zzso and age were independent zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso all P zzso Age was the only predictor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso function zzso for height zzso zzso correlated zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On zzso analysis both zzso zzso and age zzso were independent zzso for zzso (both P zzso Age was the only predictor for zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and age, both zzso were by definition zzso 

The impact of zzso on zzso function is not limited to overt zzso as in subjects with zzso zzso zzso a higher zzso is associated with higher zzso that is, a higher zzso relative to zzso This suggests an altered zzso balance and higher zzso pressure zzso a potentially zzso zzso zzso zzso that may zzso enhanced zzso zzso when other factors, such as hypertension or diabetes are zzso
