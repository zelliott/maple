The risk of obesity in adulthood is subject to programming beginning at zzso In animal models, exposure to maternal obesity and high fat diets influences the risk of obesity in the zzso Among other long-term changes, offspring from obese rats develop zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene expression in the liver at zzso However, the precise underlying mechanisms leading to zzso zzso in the offspring remains zzso Using a rat model of zzso zzso we previously demonstrated that exposure to maternal obesity from zzso to birth, is sufficient to program increased obesity risk in the zzso zzso of obese rat zzso gain greater body weight and fat mass when fed high fat diet zzso as compared to lean zzso zzso disruptions of zzso zzso rhythm are known to zzso impact metabolically active zzso such as liver, we examined the hypothesis that maternal obesity leads to zzso of core clock components and thus energy metabolism in offspring zzso zzso from lean and obese zzso were examined at zzso day 35, following a short (2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes were strongly suppressed in offspring exposed to both maternal obesity and zzso Using a mathematical model, we identified two distinct biological mechanisms that zzso zzso zzso expression: zzso decreased zzso synthesis zzso and zzso increased zzso zzso degradation zzso Moreover, our findings demonstrate that changes in zzso zzso were associated with zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso marks near the zzso zzso start zzso Our findings indicated that offspring from obese rat zzso have zzso zzso to zzso machinery that may contribute to impaired liver metabolism in response to zzso specifically via reduced zzso expression prior to obesity zzso
