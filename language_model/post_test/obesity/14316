zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso and progression of cardiovascular zzso Plasma zzso is elevated in centrally obese men, and we hypothesized that the zzso of zzso are disturbed in these zzso 

We developed a zzso model to determine very zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso parameters in centrally obese men and investigated the associations with zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was determined using stable isotope techniques and zzso zzso in 39 centrally obese and 12 zzso zzso 

Compared with zzso subjects, centrally obese subjects had increased plasma zzso concentration (160 zzso 5 zzso zzso 103 zzso 9 zzso P zzso reflecting increased zzso of both zzso and zzso These related to increased production rate zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and reduced fractional zzso rate zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso In centrally obese men, zzso concentration was significantly zzso zzso associated with zzso concentration and zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso concentration was significantly zzso zzso associated with the zzso of both zzso and zzso the zzso and the zzso of zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso In multiple zzso analysis, both zzso and zzso zzso were significantly associated with zzso zzso 

In centrally obese men, elevated zzso and zzso zzso are a consequence of elevated production and decreased zzso of zzso and reduced zzso of zzso zzso These defects are associated with disturbances in zzso and zzso zzso
