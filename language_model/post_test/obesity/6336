Recent prospective data suggest that intake of rapidly zzso and absorbed carbohydrates with a high dietary zzso load is associated with an increased risk of zzso heart zzso 

We examined whether a high dietary zzso load was associated with elevated zzso zzso and whether this association was modified by body mass index zzso in zzso 

In zzso apparently healthy women, we measured plasma zzso zzso and determined average dietary zzso loads with a validated zzso zzso zzso Using multiple zzso models, we evaluated the association between dietary zzso load and plasma zzso after adjusting for zzso treatment zzso smoking zzso zzso physical activity zzso parental history of zzso zzso history of hypertension, diabetes, and high zzso zzso hormone use; alcohol zzso and other dietary zzso 

We found a strong and statistically significant positive association between dietary zzso load and plasma zzso The median zzso concentration for the lowest zzso of dietary zzso load was zzso zzso and for the highest zzso was zzso zzso corresponding zzso geometric means were zzso and zzso zzso respectively zzso for trend zzso This association was significantly modified by zzso Among women with a zzso zzso 25, the zzso geometric mean zzso concentration in the lowest zzso was zzso zzso and in the highest zzso was zzso zzso however, among women with a zzso zzso the corresponding means were zzso and zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso for zzso 

zzso zzso load is significantly and positively associated with plasma zzso in healthy middle-aged women, independent of conventional risk factors for zzso heart zzso zzso of the zzso process may be a mechanism zzso a high intake of rapidly zzso and absorbed carbohydrates increases the risk of zzso heart disease, especially in overweight women prone to insulin zzso
