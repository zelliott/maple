zzso zzso weight gain and maternal obesity have both been associated with increased zzso of obesity and zzso disorder in offspring in both humans and animal zzso The objectives of this study were to determine zzso whether mild zzso food restriction during the third zzso zzso would alter food intake and growth parameters of zzso zzso whether effects of zzso depended on diet zzso fat zzso vs zzso zzso whether effects of excessive zzso weight gain zzso would become magnified across generations, and zzso whether diet and zzso would alter zzso gene expression in adult zzso Three generations of female zzso mice were fed zzso or zzso diet, zzso at 11 weeks of age and assigned to ad zzso feeding or zzso zzso zzso were fed the same diet as their zzso zzso showed zzso maternal zzso zzso was positively correlated with offspring zzso zzso zzso offspring weighed less zzso at weaning zzso but gained more during the 8 weeks after weaning than zzso offspring zzso resulting in higher final body weights zzso zzso zzso zzso males from zzso mothers had higher zzso zzso but subsequent zzso and final zzso were less zzso compared to males from ad zzso zzso zzso In the zzso group, zzso also resulted in decreased zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso compared to offspring from ad zzso zzso zzso In generation 3, zzso expression of zzso zzso was lower in zzso males from zzso mothers compared to zzso males from ad zzso mothers zzso In conclusion, gender and maternal zzso had independent effects on growth and zzso and zzso gene expression was dependent on both gender and maternal zzso in zzso zzso Even mild food restriction of obese mothers during pregnancy may have beneficial effects in reducing the risk or degree of obesity in zzso
