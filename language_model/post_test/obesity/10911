zzso acid zzso is available as a herbal supplement, and promoted as a weight loss zzso It is hypothesized that zzso can increase fat zzso by zzso zzso zzso an zzso which plays a crucial role in energy metabolism during de zzso zzso The indirect zzso of the zzso pool of zzso by zzso and the subsequent reduction in zzso zzso A and zzso alters steps in the zzso acid cycle that promote fat zzso The objective of this study was to determine the effect of zzso on marker zzso of altered zzso as well as on respiratory zzso zzso and energy expenditure zzso in humans, following an overnight fast and during a bout of zzso zzso OF zzso We hypothesized that supplementation with zzso would result in an increase in fat zzso and zzso rate, reflected by an increase in zzso and zzso and/or a decrease in zzso Furthermore, during moderately intense exercise, we hypothesized that zzso supplementation would increase the rate of zzso conversion to zzso in the liver, with a subsequent reduction of circulating zzso and an zzso of circulating zzso bodies due to the increased partial zzso of fatty acids zzso in zzso Studies have examined the fat regulating action of zzso on steps of the zzso acid cycle in zzso showing reductions in body weight and food zzso No studies have investigated the effects of zzso supplementation in conjunction with a typical daily dietary composition zzso is zzso zzso zzso on zzso processes which could influence body weight regulation in zzso 

This was a double blind, zzso controlled, randomized, crossover study involving three days of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The effects of zzso supplementation on zzso parameters with or without moderately intense exercise was studied over four laboratory zzso 

zzso adult male subjects zzso zzso 10, age: zzso zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso 

Two of the four visits involved no exercise zzso zzso with and without zzso treatment, while the remaining two visits included a moderately intense exercise bout zzso zzso 30 zzso at zzso zzso zzso fitness zzso and 15 zzso at zzso zzso with and without zzso zzso zzso (by indirect zzso and zzso were measured for 150 zzso following an overnight zzso Blood samples were collected for the determination of zzso insulin, zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

In a zzso state and following 3 d of zzso treatment, zzso was not significantly lowered during rest zzso zzso nor during exercise zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso Treatment with zzso did not affect zzso either during rest or during moderately intense zzso Furthermore, the blood zzso measured were not significantly different between treatment groups under the zzso conditions of this zzso 

These results do not support the hypothesis that zzso alters the short-term rate of fat zzso in the zzso state during rest or moderate exercise, with doses likely to be achieved in humans while subjects maintain a typical Western diet zzso zzso total calories as zzso
