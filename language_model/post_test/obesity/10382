To test the a zzso hypothesis that obesity is a predictor of risk for reporting zzso zzso 

A zzso cohort study was conducted with zzso zzso men and women 65 to 97 years zzso A nutrition risk screen was administered baseline between 1994 and 1999 and again 3 to 4 years zzso zzso analyses identified baseline variables associated with subsequent reporting of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso models were created to identify baseline variables that were significant independent zzso of reporting zzso zzso 

At zzso zzso of the cohort had zzso or zzso zzso There were zzso zzso zzso respondents at follow-up zzso zzso zzso at follow-up differed little from zzso except for greater baseline age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso years, p zzso and reporting of any functional limitations zzso zzso zzso p zzso At zzso those who reported zzso status zzso zzso zzso were significantly zzso zzso older zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and more likely to report functional limitations zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses identified 16 baseline variables that were eliminated zzso until five significant independent zzso zzso zzso or zzso 75 years zzso zzso to zzso ratio, zzso confidence zzso zzso or zzso 35 zzso zzso to zzso poor appetite zzso zzso to zzso low income zzso zzso to zzso and any functional limitation zzso zzso to zzso 

zzso remained a significant independent predictor for reporting zzso status and should be considered in screening of older populations and in the planning, zzso and evaluation of services for zzso older zzso
