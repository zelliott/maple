zzso is a major risk factor for the development and progression of breast zzso zzso a zzso mainly produced by zzso plays a crucial role in zzso zzso and is elevated in zzso and insulin zzso The zzso zzso inhibit zzso gene expression through zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and exert zzso and zzso effects on breast zzso In this study, we investigated the ability of zzso zzso to counteract zzso zzso effects on breast cancer growth in either in zzso or in zzso zzso The results show that zzso of zzso prevented the development of zzso zzso tumor zzso and inhibited the increased zzso zzso and proliferation observed on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso gene expression and its receptors in breast zzso zzso repression of zzso gene involved the recruitment of nuclear zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso hormone receptors zzso on the zzso responsive element site in the zzso gene expression regulatory region in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso zzso inhibited zzso signaling zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso effect on zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso may have potential therapeutic benefits in the treatment of breast zzso
