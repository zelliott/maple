Local tissue reaction was examined after subcutaneous zzso for 8 zzso of small pieces of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in 11 extremely obese zzso zzso gave a stronger chronic inflammatory reaction in 7 out of 11 patients, and a stronger foreign body giant cell reaction in all of them: zzso is therefore perhaps more suitable than zzso as a reinforcement band in gastric surgery for zzso At zzso due to complications after gastric zzso the tissue reaction in the zzso which covered the band, was examined in 9 zzso No major difference in tissue reaction in the zzso compared to that in subcutaneous fat was zzso None of the zzso was caused by too strong a tissue reaction to the reinforcement band zzso zzso in 8 patients and zzso zzso in one zzso
