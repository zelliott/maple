The zzso is a key central controller of energy zzso and is the source and/or site of action of many zzso involved in this zzso The aim of this study was to isolate zzso genes zzso expressed between lean and obese zzso zzso a zzso animal model of obesity and type 2 zzso zzso display zzso was used to compare zzso gene expression profiles of lean and healthy, obese and zzso and obese, diabetic zzso zzso in both the fed and zzso zzso We conducted differential display with 180 separate primer combinations to amplify approximately 9,000 expressed zzso Sixty zzso expressed bands were zzso zzso zzso was performed on 36 of these transcripts to confirm differential gene expression in a larger sample zzso Of these 36 zzso 9 showed zzso to known zzso and 27 were considered to be novel zzso Gene expression profiles for two of these genes are presented zzso In conclusion, differential display zzso was successfully used to isolate several transcripts that may be involved in the central regulation of energy zzso We are currently conducting numerous studies to further investigate the role of these genes in the development of obesity in zzso zzso
