zzso is an zzso product of the zzso gene thought to be involved in the regulation of zzso zzso for zzso have been found in multiple regions in the zzso In particular, zzso receptors seem to be of fundamental importance for the biological effects of zzso However, the association of zzso with cerebral function in humans has not been zzso zzso in order to assess the possible functional relationships between zzso and cerebral activity in humans, simultaneous serum zzso and regional cerebral blood flow zzso zzso were made in 10 obese zzso zzso zzso zzso and 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso women during exposure to zzso The zzso zzso were performed by zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso A strong inverse association was observed between the zzso and zzso of zzso during the exposure to food in the obese zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso 10), but not in the zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This suggests that the association of zzso with cerebral activity could be different in obese and zzso zzso depressed activity of zzso zzso in response to the high peripheral zzso concentration could be zzso to occur in obese women during exposure to zzso
