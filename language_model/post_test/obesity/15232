There are no agreed criteria for zzso zzso of the knee in population zzso The zzso scoring system of zzso and Lawrence has been the system most used in the past and although other methods have been developed, comparisons have not been zzso Therefore these grading systems were compared in zzso from a general population zzso 

zzso zzso zzso of 1954 knees from zzso women aged zzso years from the zzso population study were read by a variety of methods, including quantitative measures of minimum joint space, qualitative measures of zzso and of joint space, and a qualitative zzso and Lawrence global zzso All qualitative methods used zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was tested on a zzso of 100 films using three observers and two zzso zzso were zzso at the tenth and second zzso to define zzso zzso ratios were calculated for each method for the association of zzso with knee pain, zzso and with each of the other zzso 

Most methods had high zzso and zzso zzso except for zzso of lateral joint zzso The best zzso of knee pain were the presence of zzso and the zzso and Lawrence zzso zzso measuring narrowing performed less well, with zzso of lateral joint space being particularly zzso Similar results were achieved in the comparison with obesity and in the comparisons between zzso 

These data suggest that the presence or absence of a zzso zzso read by a single observer with an zzso is the best method of defining zzso of the knee for zzso studies in zzso Assessment of narrowing may be better used in evaluating zzso
