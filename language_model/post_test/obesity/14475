zzso zzso zzso oxidized zzso zzso leading to foam cell formation, and appears to be a key zzso zzso Increased expression of zzso has been attributed to zzso and to defective zzso insulin signaling in insulin zzso zzso zzso is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in type 2 zzso Here, we report the identification of a soluble form of zzso zzso in plasma and zzso that zzso would be elevated in patients with type 2 diabetes and insulin zzso 

zzso in plasma was demonstrated by zzso and Western zzso We established zzso zzso to determine zzso in plasma and measured zzso in obese type 2 diabetic patients, obese zzso relatives, and obese and lean control zzso zzso was markedly elevated in type 2 diabetic patients compared with both lean zzso and obese zzso to zzso control zzso There was a strong, inverse correlation between zzso and zzso zzso disposal and a direct correlation with zzso plasma zzso zzso insulin, and body mass zzso 

Our study demonstrates zzso in plasma for the first zzso zzso is highly related to risk factors of accelerated zzso in type 2 diabetes such as insulin resistance and zzso control, and we propose that zzso might represent a marker of the zzso syndrome and a potential surrogate marker of zzso
