To validate the assessment of total body water zzso and zzso water zzso by zzso zzso zzso 

Twenty-five overweight but otherwise healthy subjects and 20 lean zzso 

zzso 

zzso and zzso were determined by dilution zzso zzso equations from the literature were used to calculate zzso and zzso from measured zzso at 100 and 50 zzso or 1 and 5 zzso zzso In 18 of the obese subjects, zzso was also measured with the zzso placed at zzso zzso 

In lean and obese subjects, significant correlations were observed between the zzso index zzso at high zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso in lean and r zzso zzso P zzso in obese subjects) and at low zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and r zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso placement of zzso slightly improved the correlation between the zzso index and zzso (from r zzso zzso to r zzso zzso at 50 zzso and from r zzso zzso to r zzso zzso at 100 zzso and zzso (from r zzso zzso to r zzso zzso at 1 zzso and from r zzso zzso to r zzso zzso at 5 zzso The association of zzso and zzso with zzso was different for obese and lean zzso in obese subjects a given amount of zzso or zzso corresponded with a lower zzso An equation consisting only of the zzso index could predict zzso and zzso with small mean errors in lean zzso and zzso zzso zzso and obese subjects zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a more specific zzso including other subject zzso resulted in larger prediction errors in obese subjects, illustrating the population specificity of prediction zzso zzso an association was observed of the prediction bias of zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso respectively, and with body water distribution zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso respectively, P zzso zzso and zzso were also associated with weight zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso respectively, P zzso and body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso respectively, P zzso 

It appeared from this study that the accuracy of zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso technique is dependent on the absolute amount of zzso and zzso A higher amount of zzso and zzso in obese subjects may contribute to a difference in prediction error between lean and obese zzso
