Blood zzso zzso zzso are an important risk factor for zzso The basis for this zzso property of zzso and the factors that influence its zzso levels, however, remain poorly zzso 

To investigate the relationship between serum zzso and zzso and zzso parameters in a healthy zzso zzso 

zzso zzso 

177 zzso male, 105 zzso randomly recruited healthy Kuwait Arabs aged zzso y 

zzso parameters in zzso zzso zzso zzso lipids and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso body mass index zzso and zzso zzso 

The distribution of zzso zzso was positively skewed zzso 153 zzso range zzso Women had higher zzso zzso than men zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso and insulin zzso were significantly higher when the men and women were zzso In all subjects, there were significant correlations between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso total cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso and LDL zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated only with zzso in men zzso zzso zzso In women it correlated with age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and LDL zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses confirmed zzso and zzso zzso zzso as the significant zzso of serum zzso On zzso zzso zzso 114 zzso 51 zzso and 6 zzso had single, double and zzso zzso zzso The zzso and their corresponding zzso IV repeat numbers were: F zzso repeats in zzso mean zzso 497 zzso zzso (19 repeats in zzso mean 245 zzso zzso zzso repeats in zzso mean 264 zzso zzso (27 repeats in zzso mean 236 zzso and zzso (35 repeats in zzso mean 235 zzso 

The results from the zzso population studied suggest that: zzso serum zzso zzso and distribution are similar to the pattern in Caucasians and Asians but not African-Americans or zzso zzso serum zzso is zzso influenced by zzso and zzso impact of either factor differs between the zzso zzso there is a high frequency of the zzso zzso zzso contrary to reports in some Caucasian and Asian zzso there is no simple relationship between zzso IV repeat numbers and plasma zzso zzso
