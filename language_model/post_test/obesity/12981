The zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso quickly evolved over the last decade from a new orphan zzso to one of the best characterized nuclear zzso This fast pace in zzso research was triggered by two main zzso zzso that zzso was shown to have a key role in zzso and be a master controller of the zzso gene zzso leading to efficient energy zzso zzso the discovery that its synthetic zzso the zzso are promising insulin zzso drugs, which are currently being developed for the treatment of Type II zzso diabetes zzso More recently this nuclear zzso emerged from a role limited to metabolism zzso and zzso to a power player in general zzso control of numerous cellular zzso with implications in cell cycle control, zzso zzso zzso and zzso This widened role of zzso will certainly initiate a new flurry of research, which will not only refine our current often partial knowledge of zzso but more zzso also establish that this zzso has a zzso role as a primary link adapting zzso tissue and whole body zzso to energy zzso
