The present study investigated the effect of 14 days diet, enriched in butter, vitamin E zzso zzso and green tea, on the major regulators of energy zzso zzso is the product zzso zzso This 16 zzso protein is produced by mature zzso and is zzso in zzso Its plasma levels are strongly correlated with zzso mass in zzso as well as in zzso zzso inhibit food zzso reduces body weight and stimulates energy zzso In order to evaluate the effect of diet enriched in butter, zzso E and green tea on body weight, zzso tissue weight and zzso weight, serum zzso zzso content and serum zzso levels in male zzso rats supplemented for 14 days on the previous zzso This study showed that high fat diet significantly increased body weight and zzso tissue weight, while zzso E and green tea enriched diet significantly lowered body weight and zzso tissue weight, kidney and zzso weights didn't show significant changes in all the experimental zzso While liver weight decreased in diet supplemented with high fat zzso Also, the results showed that high fat diet and zzso E supplemented diet induced significant increase in total cholesterol, zzso zzso level with significant decrease in zzso level as compared to normal control zzso Finally green tea supplemented diet induced significant decrease in total cholesterol, zzso zzso level with insignificant increase in zzso level in control zzso On the other hand, high fat supplemented diet significantly increased serum zzso levels in rats compared to control group, while zzso E and green tea enriched diet significantly lowered serum zzso levels at the end of experimental zzso In conclusion, improving the biological activity of zzso by diet modification may exist as a practical strategy for the treatment of obesity and related disorders and a diet rich in green tea to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease zzso obesity and also protect the liver against free zzso
