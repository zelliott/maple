The aim of this study was to evaluate whether zzso laboratory values can predict impaired zzso tolerance zzso in adolescents who are at risk for developing type 2 diabetes zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso a marker for worsening insulin resistance, predict risk for zzso 

Following a fast of at least 9 zzso laboratory measures, body mass index zzso and demographic information were zzso The subjects then underwent a zzso oral zzso challenge with a zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso adolescents aged zzso zzso with at least two risk factors for developing zzso zzso family history of zzso or zzso zzso and with either a zzso insulin zzso or zzso zzso or a zzso model assessment of insulin resistance zzso or zzso were recruited for the zzso 

Ten subjects zzso had zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and 10 subjects zzso had impaired zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso However, only three zzso subjects with zzso had zzso though all subjects with zzso had a zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Of those subjects with elevated zzso zzso had zzso As a screening test to predict risk for zzso elevated zzso zzso had a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso The positive zzso value was zzso and the negative zzso value was zzso 

zzso with zzso zzso alone would have missed zzso of subjects with zzso in this population of zzso zzso However, a zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso was strongly associated with zzso and may help to identify zzso adolescents who should undergo formal zzso tolerance zzso
