The discovery of zzso receptors led to the development of several compounds targeted against these zzso In particular, zzso zzso zzso have been described to possess key functions in the treatment of obesity and zzso zzso Numerous clinical trials revealed the advantage of strategies designed to block zzso zzso but also evidenced the limitations due to side effects exerted by these zzso Recent studies have highlighted that zzso zzso could have other effects and find applications even in other zzso like zzso fibrosis, chronic inflammatory conditions, diabetes, and zzso Since the suspending sales of the lead compound, zzso and the zzso of all ongoing clinical trials of zzso blockers, alternative strategies could emerge and lead to the development of further basic research studies to redirect these zzso
