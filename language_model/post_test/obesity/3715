zzso rhythm has been shown to be related to zzso metabolism and risk of diabetes, probably through effects on energy zzso Recent zzso association studies identified zzso in zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso associated with zzso zzso 

We tested whether zzso and zzso zzso affected changes in measures of energy expenditure in response to a weight-loss diet intervention in a zzso zzso clinical trial, the zzso zzso zzso Using Novel zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso in overweight or obese adults who were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 weight-loss diets that differed in their proportions of zzso Respiratory zzso zzso and resting zzso rate zzso were zzso 

By 2 y of diet intervention, the A zzso of zzso zzso was significantly associated with a greater reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso and a greater increase in zzso and zzso (both P zzso zzso The G zzso of zzso zzso was significantly associated with a greater increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso but was not related to changes in zzso and zzso In addition, we found significant zzso fat interactions for both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in relation to zzso changes in zzso 

Our data indicate that zzso in the zzso genes zzso and zzso may affect long-term changes in energy zzso and dietary fat intake may modify the genetic zzso This trial was registered at zzso as zzso
