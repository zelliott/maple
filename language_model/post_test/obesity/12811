zzso To examine zzso zzso of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, we used zzso magnetic resonance zzso to study zzso and zzso zzso synthesis in leg muscle of lean and obese zzso rats in zzso during 6 zzso zzso nerve stimulation at 2 zzso zzso The water content of resting muscle was reduced by 21 zzso zzso in obese zzso animals compared with lean animals, whereas the zzso content was increased by 140 zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso water content was reduced by zzso in obese zzso zzso During exercise, although zzso tensions were not significantly different in the two groups, rates of total zzso synthesis zzso per zzso of zzso water) were 48 zzso zzso higher in obese animals, suggesting a 50 zzso zzso reduction in intrinsic zzso zzso Changes in zzso and zzso concentration were significantly greater in obese animals than in lean animals, whereas changes in zzso pH did not zzso zzso These results imply that zzso zzso synthesis during exercise is activated earlier in obese animals than in lean zzso This difference was not fully accounted for by the greater increase in the concentration of the zzso zzso signal zzso Neither the zzso recovery zzso of zzso nor the muscle content of the zzso marker zzso zzso zzso was significantly different in the two zzso The increased zzso zzso synthesis in exercise must therefore be due to altered zzso of zzso zzso by signals other than zzso zzso Thus, the zzso muscle of obese animals may compensate for its decreased efficiency (and zzso increased need for zzso by increased reliance on zzso zzso zzso
