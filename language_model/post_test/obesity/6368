The therapeutic potential of zzso zzso zzso zzso for improving zzso control has largely gone zzso A series of synthetic zzso peptides modified at the zzso were screened in zzso for resistance to zzso zzso IV zzso zzso degradation and potency to stimulate zzso zzso and affinity for the zzso rat zzso zzso In zzso experiments indicated that zzso possessed the greatest resistance to zzso degradation, combined with minimal effects on efficacy at the zzso Thus, zzso was selected for further testing in the zzso rat zzso and zzso in conscious zzso and zzso zzso When injected zzso in normal zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rats, both zzso and zzso significantly reduced zzso excursions during a concurrent oral zzso tolerance test via stimulation of insulin zzso The latter zzso displayed greater in zzso effectiveness, likely because of resistance to zzso zzso zzso despite reduced zzso in diabetic models at zzso zzso zzso and zzso with improved plasma stability still improve zzso tolerance when given in zzso doses, and thus may prove useful in the treatment of diabetic zzso
