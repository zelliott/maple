In the past decade, the prevalence of zzso diabetes, and zzso syndrome has increased zzso zzso national spending on direct costs related to these conditions exceeds $90 billion for overweight and zzso $90 billion for diabetes, and $250 billion for cardiovascular disease zzso Spending on prescription drugs that are used to modify zzso risk zzso is both a major component of all spending on prescription drugs and a leading cause of the increase in such zzso Also, spending on zzso agents is projected to become the largest single component of all spending on prescription drugs in the near zzso As the use of zzso agents continues to increase, there is a growing need to evaluate the relative and comparative zzso of these zzso As new zzso agents appear, physicians and health plans may begin zzso products in this category not only on the basis of their use in achieving zzso control, but also in the context of their effect on global zzso factor zzso 

To describe the effect of overall zzso on clinical outcomes and costs in patients with zzso 

zzso syndrome is defined as a zzso of risk factors that identify those at increased risk of zzso and zzso Although the exact definition and clinical use of the term zzso zzso are zzso the clinical community is united in identifying its individual risk factors as important contributors to the development of zzso zzso Two of the most important points of consensus are that diabetes significantly increases the risk of zzso and that the zzso risk associated with zzso syndrome is greater than the sum of its measured risk zzso zzso it is increasingly recognized that the risk of zzso is greater in patients with diabetes and other zzso factors than in those with diabetes zzso Diabetes treatment goals extend beyond zzso control to include other risk factor zzso such as blood pressure control, zzso management, weight management, and smoking zzso However, a significant percentage of patients do not reach their treatment zzso To improve the quality of diabetes care, treatment zzso have been developed to provide specific recommendations for each line of treatment and to suggest prompt zzso Also, new zzso agents, such as zzso therapies, have the potential to address the zzso needs associated with conventional zzso agents, including the improvement of zzso control with either weight maintenance or weight loss and the modification of zzso zzso Economic analyses demonstrate that zzso modification in patients with diabetes can reduce the costs of zzso Among chronic complications of diabetes, zzso treatment generates the greatest expenses, particularly in the early stages of disease zzso Health plan spending related to diabetes can be affected by a number of patient zzso including age, zzso control, zzso and zzso It has also been shown that diabetes spending increases substantially in the presence of various zzso factors zzso zzso hypertension, and zzso independent of the presence of other chronic zzso zzso differences among zzso agents have made apparent the need for models in zzso zzso zzso models have been developed and validated that simulate the treatment benefits not just of zzso control, but of comprehensive diabetes zzso These models can assist in demonstrating the importance of zzso modification in patients with zzso 

Growing evidence indicates that the evaluation of diabetes treatment strategies should incorporate considerations of their effect on global zzso zzso disease is one of the major factors in diabetes costs and resource use, both medical and zzso Various economic analyses indicate that global zzso should be reduced to control costs in this zzso Newer zzso agents with a favorable overall zzso profile may offer a cost-effective approach to managing zzso
