The purpose of this study was to describe the complications of immediate breast zzso to compare their rates with respect to the surgical procedure and to patient's zzso in order to improve surgical indications and patient zzso We carried out a retrospective study of zzso immediate breast reconstructions zzso zzso over a 12-year period zzso zzso zzso zzso with implant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso implant zzso Mean age was 48 and the median follow-up was seven years zzso The overall complication rate was zzso zzso and there were 10 reconstruction zzso The most frequent complications were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso skin necrosis zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The complication rate for immediate breast reconstruction with implant alone zzso was lower than that associated with zzso zzso with or without implant zzso but the difference was not significant zzso zzso The risk factors for complications were smoking zzso zzso zzso zzso obesity zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Smoking was found as the only risk factor of reconstruction failure zzso zzso zzso zzso were more frequent when implants were used alone zzso as well as when used along with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also higher in the zzso group than in the zzso group zzso zzso In our opinion, zzso zzso zzso zzso with or without an implant is a good compromise between complication risk and necessity of good zzso result zzso These results have led us to delay or zzso reconstruction in the case of obesity or heavy zzso In the case of probable zzso zzso we prefer to delay the breast zzso
