This long-term study investigates the influence of body mass index, blood pressure, smoking habits, impaired zzso metabolism and history of any disease on the mortality of Swiss males holding life insurance cover with high sums zzso 

In a prospective study zzso including zzso Swiss insured males holding life insurance cover with high sums assured, the prevalence of overweight and obesity was compared with data from the general zzso The relationship between zzso and zzso mortality was assessed using a Cox zzso hazard model adjusted for age and calendar year, thereby controlling for mortality improvement over zzso zzso models were used to investigate the impact of multiple cardiovascular risk factors on zzso and cardiovascular zzso The evolution of hazard ratios was assessed by dividing the observation period into two periods zzso vs zzso 

The prevalence of overweight was zzso and of obesity zzso The prevalence of both increased over zzso The association between zzso and zzso mortality showed a zzso curve with the zzso at zzso zzso Compared with this optimal range, a relative risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso was found for a zzso in the range of zzso zzso representing the lowest category of obese zzso In the multivariable model, obese subjects had a hazard ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso compared against those with normal zzso The hazard ratios for zzso mortality associated with zzso stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension were zzso zzso and zzso respectively, all of them being statistically zzso The results for cardiovascular mortality were more zzso however, with wider confidence zzso Comparing the two zzso zzso the hazard ratios for obese vs non-obese subjects were zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso in period 1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso in period zzso Similarly, the hazard ratio for combined stages 1 and 2 hypertension vs the other categories of zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for periods 1 and 2, zzso 

In this cohort of Swiss insured males holding life insurance cover with high sums assured, prevalence trends of elevated zzso are similar to those in the general zzso The relative mortality risks associated with cardiovascular risk factors are higher than in the general population and, in the case of elevated zzso and high blood pressure, might exhibit an increase over zzso
