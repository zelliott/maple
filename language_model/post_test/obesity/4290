zzso exercise testing zzso in patients with zzso heart failure zzso is important for determining zzso prognosis and helping guide timing of heart zzso Although approximately zzso to zzso of patients with zzso are obese zzso mass index zzso zzso the impact of zzso on zzso results is not well zzso The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between zzso and zzso zzso including peak oxygen zzso zzso at zzso zzso oxygen pulse, and zzso dioxide production zzso 

zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enrolled in the Heart Failure and A Controlled Trial zzso Outcomes of Exercise Training trial who had baseline zzso recorded were included in this zzso zzso were divided into strata based on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso normal weight zzso zzso zzso overweight zzso zzso zzso obese I zzso zzso zzso obese II zzso zzso zzso and obese III zzso or zzso 40 zzso 

zzso III, but not zzso obese zzso or obese II was associated with decreased peak zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to normal weight zzso zzso zzso category was zzso related to zzso dioxide production zzso ratio zzso zzso On multivariable analysis, zzso was a significant independent predictor of peak zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso slope zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso in patients with chronic zzso zzso 

Body mass index is significantly associated with key zzso fitness variables in patients with zzso The influence of zzso on the zzso value of zzso in zzso requires further evaluation in zzso zzso
