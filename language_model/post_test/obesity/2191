zzso is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular zzso Data from the zzso Study have reported a higher zzso of heart failure in obese individuals compared with a normal zzso The body initially zzso with the abundance of fuel present in an obese milieu by storing it in zzso zzso However, when the storage capacity is zzso the excess energy is taken up and stored zzso as fat in vital zzso such as the zzso Indeed, zzso zzso overload is present in hearts of obese patients, as well as in hearts of animal models of zzso and is associated with a distinct gene expression profile and cardiac zzso By imposing a zzso stress on the heart, obesity causes it to zzso and ultimately to zzso Conventional measures to treat obesity include diet, exercise, and zzso More recently, weight loss surgery zzso has achieved increasing prominence because of its ability to reduce the zzso load, zzso zzso zzso and improve overall zzso The effects of zzso on systemic zzso zzso and zzso parameters are well described and include an early zzso of serum zzso and insulin levels as well as reduction in blood zzso zzso is also associated with reverse cardiac zzso zzso of left zzso zzso and improved left zzso and right zzso zzso By targeting the source of the excess energy, we zzso that zzso improves zzso function by limiting zzso zzso availability to the metabolically overloaded zzso These changes have also been found to be associated with increased levels of zzso and improved insulin zzso Taken together, the sustained beneficial effects of zzso on left zzso mass and function highlight the need to better understand the mechanism by which obesity regulates cardiovascular zzso
