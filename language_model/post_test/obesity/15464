Growth hormone zzso zzso either spontaneous or evoked by provocative zzso is markedly blunted in zzso In fact obese patients display, compared to normal weight subjects, a reduced zzso frequency of zzso episodes and daily production rate of the zzso Furthermore, in these patients zzso zzso is impaired in response to all traditional pharmacological stimuli acting at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acute zzso zzso and to direct zzso stimulation by zzso growth hormone releasing hormone zzso zzso thought to inhibit zzso zzso zzso release zzso zzso zzso zzso consistently improve, though do not zzso the zzso response to zzso in zzso The synthetic growth hormone releasing peptides zzso zzso and zzso elicit in obese patients zzso responses greater than those evoked by zzso but still lower than those observed in lean zzso The combined administration of zzso and zzso represents the most powerful zzso releasing stimulus known in zzso but once again it is less effective in these patients than in lean zzso As for the peripheral limb of the zzso growth factor I zzso zzso high free zzso low zzso proteins 1 zzso and 2 zzso normal or high zzso and increased zzso binding protein zzso circulating levels have been described in zzso Recent evidence suggests that zzso the product of zzso specific zzso zzso exerts a stimulating effect on zzso release in zzso should the same hold true in man, the coexistence of high zzso and low zzso serum levels in human obesity would fit in well with the concept of a zzso resistance in this zzso zzso the influence of zzso and nutritional factors, an impaired zzso response to zzso and a failure of zzso load to inhibit spontaneous and zzso zzso release are well documented in obese zzso zzso drugs able to block zzso and thus to lower serum free fatty acids zzso significantly improve zzso zzso in zzso zzso restriction and weight loss are followed by the restoration of a normal spontaneous and zzso zzso zzso On the whole, zzso zzso and peripheral factors appear to be involved in the zzso zzso of zzso A zzso zzso a zzso zzso or a functional failure of the zzso have been proposed as contributing zzso A lack of the putative zzso zzso for zzso receptors is another challenging zzso On the peripheral side, the elevated plasma levels of zzso and free zzso may play a major zzso Whatever the cause, the zzso of zzso zzso in obesity appears to be of secondary, probably zzso nature since it is completely reversed by the zzso of body zzso In spite of this, treatment with zzso zzso has been shown to improve the body composition and the zzso efficacy of lean body mass in obese patients undergoing therapeutic severe caloric zzso zzso and conceivably zzso might therefore have a place in the therapy of zzso
