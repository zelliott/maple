The aims of this study were to clarify the risk factors for stroke, and to investigate the effect of zzso zzso cholesterol zzso lowering with zzso on the risk of stroke, in Japanese zzso zzso patients enrolled in the zzso zzso 

zzso Cox zzso hazard model was used to determine the baseline risk factors for zzso The proportion of treatment effect zzso explained by zzso zzso levels was zzso 

In zzso patients at risk, a total of 99 strokes were observed during the zzso follow-up zzso zzso relationships were observed between stroke and traditional risk factors such as male sex, advanced age, low zzso zzso cholesterol zzso high zzso zzso hypertension, diabetes, zzso and zzso In the zzso group, hazard ratio zzso for stroke adjusted by zzso zzso level was lower than the zzso value versus control zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a negative zzso of zzso and suggesting that the risk reduction could not be explained by zzso lowering zzso 

Male sex, aging, hypertension, diabetes, low zzso high zzso zzso and smoking were determined as risk factors for stroke in Japanese patients with zzso and the observed risk reduction could not be explained by zzso zzso effect alone, suggesting zzso zzso
