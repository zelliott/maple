A cumulative risk approach was used to examine the zzso effect of familial risk factors on relations between zzso sleep quantity zzso and quality zzso and zzso and zzso body mass index zzso 

The sample included 124 boys and 104 girls with a mean age of zzso years zzso zzso zzso Children wore zzso for 1 week, and their height and weight were assessed in the zzso 

After controlling for potential zzso multiple zzso analyses indicated that sleep minutes predicted children's zzso and that both sleep minutes and efficiency zzso with family risk in the prediction of zzso The association between poor sleep and zzso was especially evident for children exposed to higher levels of family zzso 

zzso suggest that not all children who exhibit poor sleep are at equal risk for higher zzso and that familial and contextual conditions need to be considered in this zzso
