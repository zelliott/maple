We evaluated the effects of 12-month treatment with zzso 15 zzso daily compared with zzso on zzso quality of life zzso in obese type II diabetes zzso We examined the associations between the changes in zzso and in weight, zzso control, and zzso zzso We also explored the zzso value of zzso and its changes early during zzso 

A zzso clinical zzso The subjects were enrolled in a zzso zzso zzso period with a modestly zzso diet zzso zzso daily zzso and then zzso to receive either zzso 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso once daily with the zzso diet for 12 zzso 

zzso zzso zzso 36 zzso and age 54 zzso type II diabetes patients zzso with zzso zzso 

The main outcome measures included body weight and zzso (the RAND zzso Health zzso zzso 

The mean weight loss was greater in the zzso group zzso zzso than in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso The baseline zzso was relatively zzso There were no significant differences between the treatment groups in zzso control or in any of the zzso scales during the zzso The scores on physical functioning zzso and health change zzso since last year improved in both groups and this improvement was related to weight zzso When zzso changes were examined in categories of weight loss, the scores on zzso and HC increased zzso weight loss, but the scores on vitality zzso and general health zzso increased only zzso weight zzso zzso in zzso was associated with increases in the scores of zzso zzso zzso mental health, and zzso In the zzso group, the increase in zzso blood pressure was associated with the decrease in the scores of zzso physical role zzso emotional role functioning zzso social functioning zzso and bodily zzso High baseline scores on zzso and zzso and low scores on V predicted weight loss at 12 zzso Also, increasing scores on zzso and V during the first 3 months predicted weight loss at 12 zzso The sum of four zzso zzso variables zzso zzso and zzso baseline zzso and zzso zzso change in zzso and zzso zzso change in zzso and zzso predicted weight zzso In the group with sum 0, the zzso weight change at 12 months was zzso and with sum 4 it was zzso of baseline zzso 

Despite the superior weight loss, zzso 15 zzso daily did not produce zzso benefits over zzso when measured with the generic zzso in obese type II diabetes zzso zzso and HC since last year improved zzso weight loss, zzso weight loss was needed to achieve a cluster of zzso zzso The decrease in zzso was associated with many zzso zzso Poor baseline zzso and the improvement observed in the first months of treatment may prove to be useful in predicting success in long-term weight zzso
