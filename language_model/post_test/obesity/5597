zzso is frequently associated with an increase in the early inflammation marker zzso protein zzso insulin resistance and changes in zzso zzso Increased zzso is known as an independent cardiovascular risk zzso Since the zzso zzso E and zzso components of HDL are associated with reduced cardiovascular risk and since zzso has in zzso zzso effect, we have investigated the relationships between zzso zzso (in zzso and non zzso containing zzso and zzso in obese zzso 

The following parameters from 34 healthy obese zzso women (age zzso zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso in total zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso tissue zzso and its soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blood pressure, zzso blood pressure, waist and hip zzso insulin, zzso zzso a marker of insulin sensitivity, and the ratio zzso in zzso and zzso were zzso 

zzso was positively correlated with zzso zzso waist circumference zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso correlated with zzso zzso and E zzso zzso Two multiple zzso models including parameters related to zzso with a zzso were run zzso to assess their independent contribution to zzso zzso In the first model (including zzso zzso zzso insulin, zzso zzso E zzso zzso was the best predictor of zzso zzso together with zzso zzso and zzso zzso The second model took into account zzso zzso ratio with the parameters included in the first zzso In this second model, zzso zzso was the best predictor of zzso zzso explaining zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso is strongly correlated with zzso and could have an zzso effect in zzso in obese zzso This correlation could be limited to zzso zzso depending on their zzso and zzso relative zzso
