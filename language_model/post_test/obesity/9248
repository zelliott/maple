Prior studies suggest that obesity is zzso associated with tumor marker concentration and may reduce diagnostic zzso This study was undertaken to evaluate the association between body mass index zzso and serum zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cancer zzso 

We analyzed the association between zzso and zzso concentration in a group of zzso patients who underwent surgical treatment for zzso zzso from 1995 to zzso zzso linear zzso analysis was applied to adjust for zzso zzso factors to analyze main outcome zzso The association of zzso with plasma volume, zzso zzso and total circulating zzso mass was assessed by determining P values for zzso We also developed a zzso formula to calculate the effect of obesity on the serum zzso zzso 

Increased zzso was zzso correlated with higher plasma volume zzso zzso for zzso and lower adjusted zzso zzso after controlling for potentially zzso factors zzso zzso zzso for trend in stage II and III zzso Our theoretical model suggests that a zzso value of zzso zzso in patients of normal weight zzso to zzso zzso in obese zzso 

The zzso effect from increased plasma volume may account for the decreased zzso zzso observed in patients with higher zzso 

zzso might be one of the factors that affect zzso value, leading to loss of sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy in the zzso zzso The zzso status of patients should be taken into account during assessment of serum zzso during the surveillance of zzso zzso
