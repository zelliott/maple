To assess the association between menopause status and central zzso measured using two different zzso of waist circumference and zzso ratio, while controlling for body mass index and other zzso zzso 

zzso study of a representative zzso sample of zzso women from zzso zzso Southern zzso Medical students performed standardized interviews and zzso zzso under zzso zzso status was zzso as zzso for those with no change in zzso frequency or zzso menopause transition for those who had these changes; and zzso after 12 months of zzso or bilateral zzso zzso was defined by body mass index zzso equal or greater than 30 zzso whereas central zzso was defined as a waist circumference equal or greater than 80 or 88 zzso and a zzso equal or greater than zzso or zzso 

The zzso assessment showed that compared with zzso women, zzso women were taller, had a thinner waist zzso and had a lower zzso zzso zzso women had five times the chance of having central zzso than zzso women, even after controlling for zzso and other zzso zzso Women in the menopause transition had an increased zzso but there was no independent association with central zzso 

zzso women are at greater risk of central zzso as detected by both waist circumference and zzso zzso
