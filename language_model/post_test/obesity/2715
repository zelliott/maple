zzso or central obesity is generally associated with increases in zzso insulin levels, insulin resistance, and zzso intolerance and has been identified as a target for new therapeutic strategies, including early change in zzso Early zzso markers for identifying zzso patients will be useful for prevention zzso The aim of this study is to investigate whether or not zzso level is a useful index of zzso and/or insulin resistance in zzso and zzso obese zzso At the same time, the relationship between zzso zzso and features of the zzso syndrome were zzso 

229 women were eligible for this zzso zzso was defined by using a modification of the zzso III zzso All patients were zzso obese and overweight, 25 to 69 years of zzso zzso were divided into groups of zzso women zzso and zzso women zzso Various zzso and fat distribution zzso zzso sex hormones, zzso zzso zzso hormones, serum levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso profile, zzso acid and serum insulin, and blood pressure were zzso 

No significant difference was found in mean zzso levels between zzso and zzso obese women in this study zzso In zzso obese women, zzso correlated zzso with zzso waist zzso zzso zzso zzso acid levels and zzso In zzso obese women, zzso correlated zzso with zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso insulin, zzso and zzso and positively with zzso zzso had a significant inverse association with zzso parameters only in zzso women, also after adjusting for zzso age and zzso 

zzso may influence the levels of zzso sex zzso especially after zzso zzso zzso are correlated with features of the zzso syndrome, particularly in zzso obese zzso These results suggest that zzso may be an index of insulin resistance in zzso obese zzso
