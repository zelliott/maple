Studies of fat cells from patients with newly zzso zzso zzso diabetes zzso zzso have revealed severe abnormalities in insulin action on zzso transport and zzso To determine whether these defects can be reversed if good zzso control is reached by dietary treatment, eight moderately obese zzso subjects were studied at diagnosis and again when the patients had been in good zzso control induced by low-energy dieting for at least 2 zzso zzso of zzso and zzso plasma zzso less than 7 zzso Average body weight decreased by 8 zzso zzso less than zzso zzso plasma zzso decreased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso serum insulin zzso were zzso zzso insulin binding at zzso concentration (15 zzso 37 degrees zzso was not changed significantly zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso per 30 zzso surface zzso The zzso zzso zzso transport zzso zzso concentration 5 zzso increased from 25 zzso 12 to 44 zzso 14 zzso X 90 zzso X 10 zzso surface area zzso less than zzso The zzso zzso zzso transport rate increased from 35 zzso 20 to 78 zzso 26 zzso zzso zzso less than zzso The percentage insulin response above zzso levels increased from 31 zzso 40 to 89 zzso zzso zzso less than zzso The insulin sensitivity zzso stimulating insulin zzso was also improved zzso less than zzso zzso conversion rates to total lipids increased 34 zzso 62 and 65 zzso zzso in zzso cells and zzso zzso cells, respectively zzso greater than P greater than zzso zzso greater than P greater than zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
