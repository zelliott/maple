To examine how change in level of physical activity after middle age influences mortality and to compare it with the effect of smoking zzso 

zzso based cohort study with follow-up over 35 zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso men aged 50 in zzso who were zzso at ages 60, 70, 77, and 82 zzso 

Total (all zzso zzso 

The absolute mortality rate was zzso zzso and zzso per 1000 person years in the groups with low, zzso and high physical activity, zzso The relative rate reduction attributable to high physical activity was zzso for low and zzso for medium physical zzso Men who increased their physical activity level between the ages of 50 and 60 continued to have a higher mortality rate during the first five years of follow-up zzso hazard ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso compared with unchanged high physical zzso After 10 years of follow-up their increased physical activity was associated with reduced mortality to the level of men with unchanged high physical activity zzso zzso to zzso The reduction in mortality associated with increased physical activity zzso zzso to zzso compared with unchanged low physical zzso was similar to that associated with smoking zzso zzso zzso to zzso compared with continued zzso 

Increased physical activity in middle age is eventually followed by a reduction in mortality to the same level as seen among men with constantly high physical zzso This reduction is comparable with that associated with smoking zzso
