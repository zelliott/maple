zzso resistance has been hypothesized to unify the zzso of hypertension, zzso zzso zzso increased levels of zzso and decreased HDL cholesterol, and central and overall zzso We tested this hypothesis with factor analysis, a statistical technique that should identify one factor if a single process zzso the zzso of these risk zzso From zzso zzso subjects of the zzso zzso zzso we collected clinical data, zzso and zzso zzso zzso and insulin levels, and zzso zzso zzso We performed factor analyses separately for men and women in the entire population and among zzso with features of the insulin resistance zzso zzso ranged in age from 26 to 82 years zzso age zzso zzso were women, zzso had impaired zzso zzso zzso had hypertension, zzso were obese, and zzso were zzso defined by elevated zzso insulin zzso zzso the zzso of these risk variables were three zzso zzso and zzso zzso insulin levels, zzso zzso and HDL cholesterol levels, zzso and zzso ratio were associated with one zzso zzso and zzso levels of zzso and insulin were associated with a second zzso zzso blood pressure, zzso blood pressure, and zzso were associated with a third zzso zzso were similar for men and women and for all zzso These results were consistent with more than one independent zzso process underlying risk variable zzso a central zzso syndrome zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso intolerance and hypertension were linked to the central syndrome through shared correlations with insulin levels and zzso zzso resistance zzso by zzso alone did not appear to zzso all features of the insulin resistance zzso
