High mass accuracy zzso zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso was applied to zzso profiling studies on plasma samples derived from two strains of rat (the zzso zzso obese strain and the normal wild zzso Using a zzso zzso trap zzso zzso mass zzso zzso profiling software was applied to locate components of biological significance that could account for the differences between the two strains of rat and a formula prediction software tool was used to help identify individual zzso The primary factor discriminating between the two populations was the concentration of zzso zzso In the zzso zzso obese strain, the dominant zzso signals and zzso zzso were in agreement with zzso components such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso and these were found in relatively higher zzso compared to the normal wild zzso zzso were identified using high mass accuracy zzso data, formula prediction software and by agreement with published mass zzso through zzso databases, rather than using a conventional approach with authentic zzso This application shows that the use of high mass accuracy zzso zzso zzso together with a software tool can be used effectively to detect and zzso unknown zzso in complex zzso and represents a promising approach for future profiling zzso
