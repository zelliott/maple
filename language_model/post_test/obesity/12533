The environmental zzso hypothesis proposes that exposure to zzso zzso during zzso zzso contributes to zzso and the development of zzso zzso of environmental zzso zzso such as zzso zzso on zzso tissue development has been poorly zzso 

zzso zzso were incubated with different doses of zzso zzso zzso male mice received an zzso injection of vehicle, zzso or zzso zzso zzso Gene expression of zzso regulators was zzso zzso mice were zzso by zzso with vehicle or zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso from day 12 of gestation until day 7 of zzso The body weight, liver weight, fat mass, and serum lipids and zzso levels were measured in offspring at zzso day zzso 

Low concentration of zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, and expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as its target genes required for zzso zzso zzso key regulators of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso exposure to zzso increased body weight, fat mass, and serum total cholesterol and zzso levels in zzso 

zzso may be expected to increase the zzso of obesity and can act as a potential chemical zzso for obesity and zzso zzso
