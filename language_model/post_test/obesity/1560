Childhood obesity is associated with type 2 diabetes zzso and zzso fatty liver disease zzso Recent studies have found associations between vitamin D zzso zzso insulin resistance zzso and zzso among overweight zzso To further explore mechanisms zzso these effects, we fed young (age 25 zzso zzso rats with a low-fat diet zzso alone or with vitamin D depletion zzso A second group of rats was exposed to a zzso diet zzso zzso corn zzso that is more typically consumed by overweight children, and was either replete zzso or deficient in vitamin D zzso Liver zzso was assessed using the zzso zzso zzso Clinical Research Network zzso scoring system and expression of genes involved in inflammatory pathways were measured in liver and visceral zzso tissue after 10 zzso In zzso groups, zzso D levels were reduced to zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso animals exhibited significantly greater zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso inflammation as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso were higher in zzso versus the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso stress marker zzso zzso zzso were higher in zzso versus zzso animals zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses showed significant associations between zzso score and liver zzso levels of zzso 2, 4, and 9, zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso activated zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso through zzso possibly by way of zzso exposure in a zzso rat zzso In addition it causes zzso higher zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso of zzso inflammatory and zzso stress zzso
