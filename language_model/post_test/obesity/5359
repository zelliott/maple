Recent studies have concluded that an energy expenditure by an acute exercise session has no immediate effect on zzso levels while some showed a decline in zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate any possible effects of training status of the subjects on acute zzso relationship in obese zzso 

Fourteen obese sedentary females were enrolled to the study and effects of acute incremental exercise on serum zzso levels were determined at rest and at zzso exercise zzso Then, they participated to a zzso endurance zzso training zzso performed in the laboratory on a computer controlled cycle zzso and their zzso levels were re-evaluated and the zzso exercise relationships obtained under different training levels in the same group of subjects were zzso The body compositions were determined by zzso zzso Pre and post training blood samples were taken at rest and at the zzso exercise zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso in duplicate by zzso Data were evaluated zzso paired zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso levels were not acutely affected by the incremental exercise either before zzso zzso and zzso zzso or after zzso zzso and zzso zzso endurance zzso The marked decrease in zzso levels following training was closely correlated with fat mass loss zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This study indicates that an increase in energy expenditure by acute exercise has no significant acute effect on zzso level regardless of the training status of the subjects and decrease in zzso levels after a zzso endurance zzso training zzso are closely associated with the fat mass zzso
