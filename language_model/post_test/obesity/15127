The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a zzso zzso diet on later obesity and explore the underlying zzso zzso male rats were weaned at 3 weeks of age, fed standard zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso diets for 3 weeks, and then fed the standard diet for a zzso zzso period zzso Finally, the zzso rats were divided into zzso control and high-fat diet zzso groups, and the zzso ones into zzso control and zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso rats were fed the standard diet, while the zzso control and zzso ones were fed a high-fat diet for 6 weeks to induce zzso During the three feeding zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and its responsive proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso protein 3 were persistently zzso in the zzso group zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso versus the zzso group, and these effects were significantly more pronounced in the zzso group zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso than the zzso group by a later high-fat zzso causing more fat and body weight in zzso However, zzso zzso serum zzso insulin and lipids were not significantly affected until the body weight and fat content changed at 15 weeks of zzso The results suggest that the zzso diet after weaning promotes rat zzso obesity induced by high-fat diet, which might be achieved by programming expressions of genes involved in zzso zzso
