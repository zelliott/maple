To determine whether a secular trend toward increased weight gain was present in children examined 11 years apart in the zzso Heart Study and, if present, the association of this trend with the cardiovascular risk status of the zzso 

Two zzso zzso zzso zzso white, zzso zzso were zzso One cohort was examined first in 1973 at 7 to 9 years of age and was zzso in 1981 zzso zzso zzso The second was examined first in 1984 at the same age and zzso in 1992 zzso zzso zzso zzso made at each assessment included age, zzso race, zzso weight, blood pressure, and zzso The two zzso were then zzso 

The two zzso were comparable at their first zzso However, at follow-up 8 years later the more recent cohort was 5 to 7 zzso heavier without any difference in linear zzso this increased zzso was associated with adverse changes in lipids and zzso the zzso zzso concentration was zzso to zzso zzso (6 to 13 zzso lower, zzso values were zzso to zzso zzso (8 to 36 zzso higher, and there were small increases in total cholesterol and zzso zzso zzso in white zzso zzso analyses showed that in the more recent cohort these changes were related more to a change in zzso than to zzso Although blood pressure was generally lower in the recent zzso increasing zzso was associated with higher blood zzso 

There is a secular trend toward increased zzso in children examined in the zzso Heart zzso This trend is associated with worsening cardiovascular risk, particularly with regard to zzso
