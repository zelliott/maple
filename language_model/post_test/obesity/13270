zzso zzso and obesity play a key and zzso roles in the zzso of zzso zzso syndrome zzso contributing in different ways to the clinical expression of the zzso Weight loss is zzso but the additional administration of zzso drugs, such as zzso and zzso may produce further benefits, due to their different spectrum of zzso The effects of long-term zzso and zzso an zzso drug, added alone or in combination with a low-calorie diet, on body weight and fat distribution, zzso zzso parameters and clinical status in obese women with zzso were zzso 

Forty obese women with zzso were enrolled in the zzso After a zzso diet, according to zzso design, the patients were allocated to treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso twice daily), zzso zzso zzso twice zzso or zzso zzso zzso twice zzso + zzso zzso zzso twice zzso for the following 6 months, while continuing zzso zzso At baseline and at the end of the study, sex hormone, zzso zzso insulin and insulin sensitivity zzso were zzso At the same time, clinical parameters such as zzso total zzso visceral zzso and subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso 

We found that, in obese zzso women, following a zzso diet the addition of zzso zzso or the combined zzso + zzso treatment had some specific additional zzso effects with respect to the low-calorie diet zzso In particular, zzso treatment seemed to add a significant effect in decreasing visceral fat, zzso zzso total and low density zzso zzso cholesterol and in improving zzso zzso zzso had significant benefits on the zzso zzso The two drugs showed an additive effect in reducing testosterone zzso and a synergistic effect in increasing high density zzso zzso cholesterol and zzso zzso Improvement of insulin sensitivity and zzso appeared to depend on zzso diet, without any further significant effect of the pharmacological treatments, either alone or in zzso 

We conclude that, in obese zzso women, following a zzso diet the addition of zzso zzso or the combined zzso + zzso treatment appears to have a more zzso outcome on body fat distribution, zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, our data emphasize the dominant role of zzso dieting in improving insulin resistance and zzso zzso this study provides a rationale for specifically targeting different zzso options for zzso according to the required zzso
