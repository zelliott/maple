The aim of our study is to zzso the effects of zzso or zzso fish oil, and of the latter plus zzso on zzso metabolism in female zzso zzso 

Female zzso mice were fed zzso experimental diets containing zzso oil zzso zzso zzso fish oil zzso zzso fish oil zzso or zzso fish oil plus zzso zzso zzso zzso for 8 zzso At the end of the experiments, we measured levels of plasma zzso zzso zzso and cholesterol, as well as the zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso 

The final body weight of zzso and zzso groups was significantly lower than that of the zzso group, and that of the zzso group was the zzso All three fish oil treatments significantly reduced plasma insulin zzso zzso zzso levels significantly decreased in all three of these groups compared with the zzso zzso Plasma zzso increased in both the zzso zzso groups, but the increase was suppressed in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso mice were filled with numerous fat zzso but fat zzso was inhibited in both zzso and zzso mice and was significantly prevented by zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were decreased by about half in zzso and zzso mice compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels also markedly decreased in both zzso and zzso mice, but there was no additional decrease in zzso fed zzso zzso treatment significantly induced zzso expression of zzso and zzso but not of zzso 

These data suggest that fish oil inhibited body weight gain and exhibited an zzso effect through the zzso of zzso synthesis in female zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment markedly inhibited body weight gain by the induction of fatty acid zzso Plasma zzso levels did not increase in mice fed zzso fish oil with zzso although white zzso tissue zzso weight significantly zzso We considered that zzso sensitivity increased more in mice fed zzso fish oil with zzso than in mice fed zzso fish oil zzso
