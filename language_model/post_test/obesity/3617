zzso of zzso in lean adults without zzso disease and without eating disorders has not been zzso zzso We hypothesized that some of the established associations of these zzso proteins with zzso and zzso measures of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso function, as well as zzso differ in healthy and low weight adults as compared to zzso zzso Eighty-one subjects with a body zzso below zzso and without zzso or eating disorders, as well as fifty zzso patients, were recruited for the zzso zzso zzso of seven zzso zzso zzso zzso fatty zzso protein zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso protein zzso were measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had significantly higher levels of zzso and zzso as well as lower levels of zzso zzso and zzso as compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly higher in lean women as compared to men zzso In lean subjects, zzso insulin independently predicted zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso protein was independently associated with circulating zzso and zzso Moreover, lean body mass was an independent predictor of zzso fat mass predicted zzso levels, whereas zzso was independently correlated to age and zzso In addition, high density zzso cholesterol predicted zzso Our results support the notion that several of these zzso are regulated in a different manner in lean adults as compared to zzso subjects and patients with eating zzso
