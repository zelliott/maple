The aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso in the measurement of body composition in overweight and obese children and their parents by comparison to zzso X-ray zzso zzso 

zzso zzso year old overweight and obese children (6 boys, 11 zzso and 17 parents (5 fathers, 12 zzso were evaluated for body composition with zzso and zzso zzso of percent body fat zzso fat mass zzso and fat free mass zzso derived from zzso and zzso were zzso zzso of zzso were determined by zzso correlations between zzso and zzso paired zzso to assess mean differences, as well as biases and limits of agreement using the zzso Altman zzso 

zzso produced estimates of body composition that were highly correlated with zzso in overweight and obese children and zzso For children, the correlations for zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso For parents, the correlations for zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, mean differences between zzso and zzso were significant in children but not in zzso zzso tests of agreement showed moderate to large zzso differences in body composition variables between zzso and zzso 

zzso is strongly related to zzso in the measurement of body composition in both overweight and obese zzso children and parents, but the two measures may not be used zzso Although zzso may lack the precision to assess small changes in body composition in overweight and obese individuals, it is appropriate for zzso zzso
