zzso zzso is associated with cardiovascular risk factors and increased cardiovascular zzso zzso hormone zzso levels in the normal range are associated with a higher risk of fatal coronary artery zzso We zzso that zzso levels in the normal range are associated with an increase in visceral zzso tissue zzso in patients with vascular zzso 

In zzso patients with vascular diseases, visceral fat thickness was zzso with zzso The association between zzso and zzso was zzso using linear zzso zzso zzso are expressed as beta zzso zzso zzso with zzso confidence zzso zzso were made for age, sex, current smoking and zzso Separate analyses were performed per zzso of zzso 

zzso for the relation between zzso and zzso zzso per zzso of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso in the highest zzso of age zzso zzso zzso when adjusted for age, gender and current smoking and remained statistical significant after further adjustment for weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso change, the zzso for zzso and zzso tissue was larger than for other measures of zzso 

In conclusion, higher zzso plasma levels in the normal range are associated with more zzso in patients with manifest vascular disease above the age of 66 zzso No association was found between plasma zzso levels and weight or zzso The relation between zzso levels and zzso may provide an explanation for the increased cardiovascular risk associated with elevated zzso plasma zzso within the normal zzso
