A deficit of zzso of close to 300 zzso develops in the first 2 zzso of zzso but little further zzso of zzso occurs, despite high levels of zzso and the delivery of zzso zzso that are not zzso in the zzso zzso Our purpose was to evaluate how zzso could have primarily zzso rather than zzso properties in this zzso To evaluate the role of zzso delivery of zzso four zzso subjects received an acute infusion of zzso to induce a zzso To assess the role of zzso delivery of zzso five zzso subjects were given an infusion containing zzso The zzso induced by an infusion of zzso caused only a small rise in the rate of zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso in contrast, when zzso replaced zzso in the zzso zzso zzso rose to zzso zzso zzso zzso despite little zzso of zzso zzso pH zzso and similar rates of zzso of zzso The zzso zzso concentration zzso was 19 zzso 3 with zzso and 6 zzso 2 with zzso We conclude that the infusion of zzso led to an increase in zzso zzso likely reflecting an increased rate of zzso zzso zzso With a low zzso delivery of zzso zzso acts as a zzso rather than a zzso zzso
