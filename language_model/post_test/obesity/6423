The effect of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied in mice kept on a high fat diet zzso zzso male zzso mice were fed the zzso zzso zzso for up to 12 weeks and were daily injected zzso with the inhibitor zzso zzso or with zzso After 12 weeks of the zzso the body weights of both groups were comparable, but the weight of the isolated subcutaneous zzso or zzso zzso fat deposits was significantly lower in the zzso group than in the control group zzso zzso 11 versus 251 zzso 66 zzso respectively, for SC fat zzso 90 zzso 24 versus 217 zzso 30 zzso respectively, for zzso fat zzso The number of zzso was somewhat higher and the diameter was somewhat smaller (but not zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso tissue of the zzso mice contained more collagen than did that of the zzso mice (Sirius zzso area of 42 zzso zzso versus 22 zzso zzso respectively, for SC fat zzso 21 zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso respectively, for zzso fat zzso a distinct zzso cap was formed around the zzso zzso In zzso zzso with zzso or zzso gels confirmed a reduced zzso activity in SC and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Thus, in this model, growth and development of zzso tissue appears to be limited by the formation of a zzso zzso cap around the zzso zzso These data suggest a functional role for zzso in the development of zzso zzso
