zzso resistance was studied by comparing insulin response and insulin binding in four groups of zzso zzso metabolism in isolated fat cells from male zzso rats weighing 340 g was less responsive to a zzso dose of insulin than zzso metabolism in fat cells from rats weighing 200 zzso zzso of zzso in rats weighing 200 g resulted in a marked decrease in the insulin responsiveness of fat zzso zzso zzso zzso of 340 g rats had the opposite effect and restored the insulin responsiveness of fat zzso The responsiveness in the four groups was correlated to the rate of zzso conversion to fatty acids in fat zzso The binding of zzso was the same in both 340 and 200 g zzso The zzso zzso zzso rats and the diabetic rats zzso in spite of their great difference in insulin zzso the highest binding of zzso to fat zzso zzso binding was not correlated to the plasma insulin level which however was reflected in the zzso zzso activity in the zzso zzso In conclusion, these results indicate that variations in insulin responsiveness in fat cells are due to zzso in cellular metabolism rather than in insulin zzso
