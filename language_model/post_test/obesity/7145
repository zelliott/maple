The zzso zzso of zzso syndrome zzso suggests zzso of the underlying zzso The aim of the present study was to examine the common genetic background that contributes to the zzso between the two main features zzso resistance, central zzso and different MSX component zzso 

In all, zzso individuals from 90 families were investigated in a zzso family path study as part of the zzso zzso Prevention Study zzso 162 grandparents, zzso years, 173 parents, zzso years and 157 children, zzso zzso zzso zzso was estimated and common familial zzso and zzso influences on insulin resistance zzso or central obesity zzso waist zzso zzso respectively, and different MSX traits were compared in a zzso zzso correlation zzso 

zzso of MSX zzso to zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso in adults and zzso zzso and zzso zzso in children and zzso zzso MSX zzso was found to be highly zzso zzso 16 zzso of component trait zzso zzso zzso was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso was zzso As much as zzso and zzso of the shared zzso between different MSX component traits zzso profile, blood zzso and zzso or zzso respectively, may be zzso With the exception of zzso the shared genetic zzso between MSX component traits and zzso was higher than the genetic zzso shared with zzso 

A common genetic background contributes to the zzso of different MSX component traits and central obesity or insulin zzso Common genetic influences zzso central obesity as a major characteristic linking these zzso
