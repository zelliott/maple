The purpose of this study was to determine whether neural and/or muscular factors contributed to the inferior zzso motor performances of obese zzso zzso were 10 non-obese zzso zzso and 11 obese zzso zzso males matched for age zzso zzso level of maturity zzso stages IV and zzso lean body mass, and zzso Peak zzso zzso was measured during zzso voluntary zzso zzso and zzso zzso knee extension zzso Peak zzso zzso zzso time to peak zzso zzso and zzso time zzso of the knee zzso were zzso by zzso electrical zzso The zzso zzso technique was used to determine the extent of motor unit zzso zzso zzso during zzso voluntary IS zzso zzso zzso zzso area zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso taken at the zzso All strength and area zzso were made on the right side of the zzso zzso subjects had significantly zzso less than zzso lower zzso voluntary IS and zzso zzso strength zzso for body weight, and significantly lower % zzso during IS zzso There were no significant differences zzso greater than zzso between groups for absolute or zzso (for the product of muscle zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso knee zzso zzso or zzso and zzso These results suggest that reduced zzso and a lower strength per mass ratio zzso to excess zzso are probably important contributing factors to the poorer motor performances of the obese, especially for complex motor tasks involving large muscle groups and the support or moving of body zzso
