zzso syndrome zzso defined as central zzso zzso insulin resistance, hypertension, zzso and zzso zzso has been associated with inflammatory zzso and cardiovascular zzso This study was carried out on three groups of zzso lean controls, moderately obese with zzso zzso and zzso obese with zzso zzso The main objectives were: zzso to analyze the plasma levels of total and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and insulin levels under zzso conditions and in response to a standard mixed zzso and zzso to zzso the relationship between the plasma levels of these gut peptides and zzso syndrome zzso Plasma levels of the gut hormones were measured by zzso at time 0 just before the meal and at 30, 60 and 120 zzso after a meal zzso Traditional zzso profile and zzso C zzso protein zzso the strongest zzso of inflammation were also determined in zzso and zzso When compared to zzso zzso exhibited much higher zzso parameters such as waist zzso higher fat mass and higher plasma levels of low density zzso zzso and zzso Both these obese groups revealed significantly higher values of body mass index zzso fat mass, total cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin, insulin resistance zzso calculated from zzso model assessment zzso and zzso compared to the values recorded in lean zzso zzso zzso level was lower, while zzso zzso zzso was higher in zzso than in zzso Plasma total and zzso zzso levels were significantly lower in zzso compared to lean zzso In zzso women the zzso zzso levels were lower compared to lean controls and zzso whilst zzso in both zzso and zzso it was much lower than in lean zzso The zzso plasma levels of total and zzso zzso and their zzso decrease were significantly smaller in both obese groups compared to lean zzso Plasma zzso levels correlated positively with zzso waist zzso fat mass, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso active zzso whilst it zzso correlated with plasma zzso and total zzso Moreover, plasma zzso zzso zzso correlated positively with fat zzso zzso total zzso correlated positively with zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso We conclude that zzso features of obesity are closely related to zzso and zzso zzso of zzso of zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that determination of gut hormones controlling food intake might be considered as a valuable tool to assess the progression of zzso to zzso of zzso
