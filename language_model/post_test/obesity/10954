To determine whether the zzso action of zzso zzso zzso attributed to insulin zzso also involves protection of beta cells from zzso we treated zzso zzso zzso zzso rats with 200 zzso per day of zzso Their zzso fatty acids and zzso fell to zzso zzso and 111 zzso respectively, compared with zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Their zzso zzso content was zzso below zzso In zzso of control rats, beta cells were reduced by zzso and the zzso architecture was zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso of their zzso were altered, and they were unresponsive to zzso In treated rats, the loss of beta cells was zzso as were the loss of beta cell zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the impairment of zzso insulin zzso We conclude that the zzso effect of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso rats involves prevention of zzso and zzso of beta cells, as well as improvement in insulin zzso
