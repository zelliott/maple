In this article we report the zzso role of the acute phase protein zzso We found that the transgenic zzso mice develop spontaneous obesity under standard nutritional conditions, with high levels of zzso zzso and LDL and low levels of zzso and HDL in zzso zzso zzso mice are skinny under standard nutritional zzso We also found that expression of zzso is induced in zzso zzso cells in response to zzso with olive oil and this induction is zzso zzso We demonstrated that incubation of zzso zzso with a low concentration as 1 zzso of zzso zzso results in accelerated zzso incorporation in zzso zzso zzso growth is sensitive to the zzso inhibitor zzso Finally, patients with severe obesity present higher blood levels of zzso than non-obese control zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso could be a zzso of fat tissue development, released by the zzso and induced by the presence of food into the zzso
