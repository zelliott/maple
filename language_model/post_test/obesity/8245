zzso zzso are short zzso zzso that regulate multiple biological processes including zzso and fat zzso We sought to identify zzso that correlate with zzso and to zzso their upstream regulation and downstream zzso 

zzso expression profiling of 233 zzso was performed on subcutaneous abdominal zzso tissue zzso from 29 zzso zzso Indian zzso zzso of the expression levels of eight zzso with zzso was assessed by quantitative reverse zzso zzso zzso in zzso samples from 80 zzso zzso Indians with a zzso of zzso zzso The upstream regulation of one of these zzso zzso was tested by treating cultured human zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso targets of zzso were validated using zzso zzso and zzso zzso The downstream effects of zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso 

zzso levels of zzso were positively correlated with zzso zzso in zzso and zzso insulin zzso while the levels of zzso and zzso were zzso correlated with zzso other zzso did not show significant associations in the 80 zzso zzso was zzso by zzso and zzso treatment in cultured human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso several proteins involved in fat zzso mimicking zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso directly zzso the zzso zzso 1 zzso and the zzso factor zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso is known to promote insulin sensitivity, and zzso is crucial for zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso may contribute to the development of the insulin resistance that typically accompanies zzso by affecting zzso zzso pathways and by directly zzso zzso and zzso
