zzso is an zzso zzso which has also been implicated in bone zzso zzso we designed a study to investigate the possible role of zzso gene variation in both obesity and bone mineral zzso We included zzso individuals from the zzso zzso Study zzso young subjects and zzso older zzso a zzso zzso zzso study on the zzso between zzso status, body zzso muscle function, and bone metabolism in men, in an association study with zzso zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso Linear zzso was performed to investigate the possible association of these zzso with several zzso and zzso zzso After zzso zzso Danish men, zzso young subjects and zzso older subjects, we found that zzso was associated with several zzso measures in both the young and elderly zzso zzso was only associated with zzso in the elderly zzso When studying the combined zzso we could confirm the associations of zzso with several zzso zzso We were unable to identify any association between zzso zzso and zzso zzso Together, these results illustrate zzso role in the development of zzso zzso gives the most consistent results in the current study and these should be confirmed in other zzso Research into its possible functional effect might also be zzso A role for zzso zzso in determining bone mineral density seems unlikely from our zzso
