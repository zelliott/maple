To examine long-term effects of leisure time physical activity zzso and occupational physical activity zzso on later zzso and to examine the effect of body weight on later physical zzso in men with and without juvenile onset zzso 

zzso zzso study of obese and zzso men, who were identified as zzso of median age of 19 y in zzso and later examined at general health surveys in zzso and in zzso 

Copenhagen and adjacent regions, zzso 

In all, zzso juvenile obese men with a zzso or zzso zzso zzso to zzso overweight by an originally used national zzso at draft board examination, and, as a zzso control group, zzso men selected as a zzso random sample of the approximately zzso men examined at the draft board and thus representing the study zzso 

zzso defined as zzso or zzso zzso and physical zzso at the last zzso 

In the zzso zzso there were strong concurrent inverse associations between zzso and prevalence of obesity in both groups, whereas there was no relation to zzso In zzso zzso analyses of obesity at the last survey, including both zzso and zzso as well as age, zzso at draft board examination, zzso at first zzso length of education, smoking and drinking habits, there were no significant effects of zzso and zzso on the risk of development of obesity in the zzso group or maintenance of obesity in the obese zzso Similar analyses of physical zzso at the last follow-up as outcome showed a significant direct effect of zzso at first zzso with a significant trend in the zzso group, but not in the obese group and no effects on zzso 

There is no long-term influence of physical activity on development and maintenance of obesity in men, whereas greater body weight increases risk of later physical zzso during leisure zzso
