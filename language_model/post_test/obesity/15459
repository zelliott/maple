Three aspects of obesity and physical activity are zzso whether the obese are zzso how the activity level can be zzso and which are the effects of an increase in physical activity in combination with a reduction of energy zzso 

The focus is on an objective approach that is, activity associated energy expenditure as measured with doubly zzso zzso 

zzso associated energy expenditure increases with body mass index while the average physical activity level does not zzso The majority of obese subjects is moderately zzso An increase in the activity level of obese subjects is limited by the ability to perform exercise of higher zzso Training programs obese subjects can cope with are until now not rewarded by weight zzso A possible loss in fat mass is compensated by a gain in zzso zzso 

zzso subjects can only reach a significant weight loss with an energy restricted zzso zzso energy restriction will already result in very significant weight loss when one zzso with the zzso An increase in physical activity is necessary to compensate for the reduction in activity induced energy expenditure and should be facilitated by the lower body zzso
