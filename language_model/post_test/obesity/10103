The zzso zzso syndrome zzso is characterized by zzso zzso chronic zzso and zzso and is associated with insulin resistance and zzso zzso the product of the zzso zzso is an zzso zzso that signals the magnitude of energy stores to the brain and has been recently shown to have important effects on the zzso axis of zzso To assess the potential contribution of zzso to the zzso of zzso we measured zzso levels in 24 obese women with zzso and 12 zzso and zzso controls and determined whether zzso in zzso produced by administration of the zzso agent zzso had an effect on serum zzso zzso zzso zzso at baseline were not different in women with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and controls zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso remained unchanged after treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated strongly with body mass index in both controls zzso zzso zzso P zzso and women with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso levels were not associated with baseline insulin, testosterone, zzso zzso zzso zzso testosterone, zzso zzso zzso or zzso Finally, despite significantly reduced insulin, zzso testosterone, and zzso levels after zzso treatment of women with zzso their zzso levels remained zzso We conclude that circulating zzso levels in patients with zzso do not differ from those in zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, increased circulating insulin due to insulin resistance does not appear to alter circulating zzso levels in women with zzso
