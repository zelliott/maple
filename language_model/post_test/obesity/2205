zzso a zzso hormone produced mainly by zzso has diverse effects in both the brain and peripheral zzso including suppression of zzso Other than zzso zzso transport across the zzso barrier, the role of the zzso zzso zzso remains zzso We recently generated a zzso mouse strain lacking zzso zzso zzso zzso and showed that there is an increased zzso of zzso by brain zzso after its delivery by in zzso brain zzso Here, we tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso partial resistance to zzso zzso These zzso mice had similar body weight and percent fat as their zzso zzso when fed with zzso zzso but blood zzso of zzso were significantly zzso In response to a high-fat diet, zzso mice had a greater gain of body weight and fat than zzso zzso As shown by zzso chamber zzso the zzso mice had higher oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and heat zzso although food intake was similar to that of the zzso mice and locomotor activity was even zzso This indicates that the partial resistance to zzso obesity was zzso by higher zzso activity in the zzso zzso Since zzso zzso zzso knockout mice show obesity and diabetes, the results suggest that zzso zzso signaling shows opposite effects from that of zzso zzso zzso with a zzso role in zzso zzso
