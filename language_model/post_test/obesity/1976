This paper reviews evidence supporting the notion that genetic factors may have an influence on the determination of body fat distribution, particularly emphasizing the genetic zzso of visceral zzso tissue zzso zzso The potential contribution of genetic zzso to the development of zzso zzso in visceral obese individuals will also be zzso The contribution of genetic factors to the variation in body fat distribution is supported by studies in which racial differences in body fat distribution were zzso These ethnic differences suggest that body fat distribution may be influenced by some components of the genetic background which are shared among individuals of a given zzso Furthermore, the familial zzso and the resemblance between zzso twins that have been observed for zzso zzso of body fat distribution and for visceral AT zzso measured by zzso zzso also suggest that genetic factors are involved in the determination of body fat zzso zzso zzso may also influence the relationship between visceral AT zzso and the development of zzso zzso In this regard, it has been reported that the zzso of some genes (for example, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is altering the relationship between visceral obesity and plasma zzso zzso In conclusion, results presented in this paper suggest that genetic factors seem to have a significant influence on the propensity to accumulate AT in the visceral depot and that genetic factors also seem to affect the associations commonly reported between visceral obesity and the development of zzso zzso
