zzso molecules released by dysfunctional zzso cells are markers of an early zzso zzso zzso of the zzso arteries zzso zzso zzso - zzso is used to detect an impairment of zzso zzso whereas the examination of zzso thickness complex zzso of the common carotid arteries detects the earliest structural changes of the zzso The aim of the study was to define the correlations between zzso markers of zzso dysfunction zzso zzso zzso zzso function zzso and early zzso changes zzso in children and adolescents with obesity and zzso 

The study group consisted of 85 patients aged zzso of whom 22 obese children, 31 zzso children and 32 obese zzso children were zzso The control group included 26 healthy zzso zzso zzso were determined by an zzso method zzso zzso zzso was assessed via the measurement of zzso zzso of the zzso artery by ultrasound zzso Packard Sonos zzso according to the method worked out by zzso whereas zzso was evaluated by means of zzso zzso 

Linear correlation analysis proved a significant positive correlation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and a marked negative correlation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the whole study zzso Analysis carried out in particular groups showed significant correlations only in the group of obese zzso zzso zzso concentration correlated markedly positively with zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration correlated significantly positively with zzso zzso zzso In zzso models, zzso correlated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso correlated zzso with zzso zzso 

The association between zzso molecules zzso zzso with impaired zzso activity and the early zzso structural changes in the common carotid arteries were found in obese zzso children and zzso The coexistence of both risk factors may zzso these young patients to closely related disturbances connected with early zzso
