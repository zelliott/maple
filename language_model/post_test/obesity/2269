To determine the association between excess weight and processes of care and outcomes for critically ill zzso 

Prospective cohort zzso 

Three medical intensive care units at two zzso 

Five hundred zzso mechanically zzso adult patients admitted between February 1, 2006 and January 31, zzso 

zzso 

After adjusting weight based on the recorded fluid balance before enrollment, zzso of subjects were zzso into different body mass index categories than without this zzso We used a competing risk analysis with events of interest considered death during hospitalization and successful liberation from mechanical zzso We found no statistically significant difference between body mass index categories zzso zzso zzso 25 to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the competing risks analyses when the results were zzso or adjusted for severity of illness and zzso When the analyses were adjusted for the use of continuous infusions of zzso and/or zzso and zzso parameters zzso volume per ideal body weight, positive zzso pressure, and airway zzso subjects with an overweight zzso body mass index had significantly lower hazard ratios for dying while hospitalized zzso hazard ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and those with an obese zzso body mass index had significantly higher hazard ratios for successful zzso zzso hazard ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso An analysis of longer-term mortality found lower adjusted hazard ratios for subjects with overweight zzso hazard ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso and obese zzso hazard ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso body mass zzso 

zzso of provided care may affect the observed association between excess weight and outcomes for critically ill adults and should be considered when making zzso about observed zzso It is unknown if disparities in processes of care are due to clinically justified reasons for variation, bias against heavier patients, or other zzso
