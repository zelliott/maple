Assessing energy requirements is a fundamental activity in clinical zzso zzso A study was designed to determine whether published linear zzso equations were accurate for predicting resting energy expenditure zzso in zzso Hispanic children with obesity zzso 7 to 15 zzso zzso was measured using indirect zzso body composition was estimated with zzso air displacement zzso zzso was predicted using four zzso Institute of Medicine for zzso children zzso zzso for overweight and obese children zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the prediction was calculated as the absolute value of the difference between the measured and predicted zzso divided by the measured zzso expressed as a zzso zzso values within zzso to zzso of measured were defined as zzso Participants zzso zzso zzso were mean age zzso years, had zzso body fat, and had a body mass index of zzso zzso body mass index zzso Measured zzso was zzso zzso predicted zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and, zzso zzso zzso Measured zzso adjusted for body weight averaged zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso Published equations predicted zzso within zzso accuracy for only zzso to zzso of 58 participants, except for zzso which did not achieve accuracy for any zzso The most frequently accurate values were obtained using zzso which predicted zzso within zzso accuracy for zzso zzso of zzso Published equations did not accurately predict zzso for youth in the study zzso Further studies are warranted to formulate accurate energy prediction equations for this zzso
