zzso causes of obesity include the zzso zzso syndrome and zzso zzso In these disorders, zzso cause dysfunction of the primary zzso an zzso involved in zzso and zzso sensing and zzso zzso syndrome is an zzso disorder caused solely by zzso in zzso By contrast, zzso syndrome is caused by zzso in at least 14 genes involved in primary zzso zzso Despite equivalent levels of zzso patients with zzso syndrome are more likely than those with zzso syndrome to develop childhood type 2 diabetes zzso zzso suggesting that zzso might have a specific role in zzso function and/or peripheral insulin signaling zzso How zzso in genes that zzso proteins involved in primary zzso function lead to the clinical zzso of these syndromes is being revealed by work in zzso mouse zzso With the aid of these models, insights are being obtained into the zzso mechanisms that zzso zzso insulin resistance and zzso Research into zzso including zzso syndrome and zzso syndrome, should lead not only to improved treatments for individuals with these genetic disorders, but also to improved understanding of the cellular pathways involved in other common causes of obesity and zzso
