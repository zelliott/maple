The zzso zzso activity, the zzso rate of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso level in zzso tissue were determined in zzso and zzso specimens obtained from 14 obese healthy subjects before and after one week of zzso During zzso there was a significant increase in both the tissue level of zzso zzso and the rate of zzso whereas the apparent values of zzso of the low and high zzso forms of zzso decreased zzso by about 50 and 30 zzso zzso The zzso concentration of zzso zzso at zzso of the low zzso zzso corresponded to the tissue level of the zzso zzso but not before, zzso there was a positive correlation between zzso of the low zzso zzso and the zzso zzso level zzso zzso zzso The metabolism in the zzso from the two fat zzso exhibited similar variations during zzso The findings suggest that the low zzso form of zzso is inhibited during zzso This may be one factor responsible for the zzso increase in the zzso zzso levels and the rate of zzso in zzso zzso
