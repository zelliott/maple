The present study is to evaluate the roles of zzso infection, host factors and their interactions in the development of zzso fatty liver in zzso province of China, a highly zzso endemic zzso 

From June 2007 to May 2008, zzso zzso fatty liver patients and zzso controls were zzso diagnosed in this zzso zzso zzso Their zzso zzso zzso behavioral factors and zzso markers were zzso and factors associated with fatty liver were determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso of fatty liver were zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso or zzso zzso zzso for low alcohol consumption, zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for reduced high density zzso cholesterol zzso zzso zzso for elevated zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for hypertension, and zzso zzso for zzso Furthermore, synergistic interactions on the additive model were observed between zzso infection and zzso zzso reduced zzso and zzso with regard to the risk of fatty zzso 

zzso fatty liver in zzso province of China is closely associated with zzso infection, low alcohol consumption, zzso and other features of the zzso zzso In addition, zzso infection was synergistic with zzso zzso reduced zzso and zzso as far as the risk of fatty liver zzso
