Since the increasing prevalence of obesity is one of the major health problems of the modern era, understanding the mechanisms of zzso detection of dietary fat is critical for the prevention and treatment of zzso We have conducted the present study on zzso zzso the zzso desert zzso which is a unique zzso natural animal model of zzso Our results show that obese animals exhibit a strong preference for zzso solutions in a zzso zzso Interestingly, the expression of zzso a zzso in taste buds cells zzso isolated from zzso zzso was decreased at zzso level, but remained zzso at protein level, in obese zzso We further studied the effects of zzso acid zzso a zzso fatty acid, on the increases in free zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso LA induced increases in zzso largely via zzso from zzso pool, followed by the opening of zzso zzso zzso channels in the zzso of these zzso The action of this fatty acid on the increases in zzso was higher in obese animals than that in zzso However, the release of zzso from zzso stores, studied also by employing zzso was lower in zzso of obese animals than control zzso In this study, we show, for the first time, that increased zzso intake and altered zzso signaling in zzso are associated with obesity in zzso zzso
