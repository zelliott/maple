The clinical utility of identifying pediatric zzso syndrome zzso is zzso This study sought to determine the status of pediatric zzso as a risk factor for adult zzso zzso zzso zzso thickness zzso and type 2 diabetes zzso zzso and compare and contrast this prediction with its individual zzso 

Using data from the zzso zzso zzso zzso Heart and zzso zzso in Young Finns studies, we examined the utility of 4 zzso definitions of youth zzso and their components in predicting adult high zzso and zzso among zzso participants aged 9 to 18 years at baseline zzso to 1988) who were then examined 14 to 27 years later zzso when aged 24 to 41 zzso Youth with zzso were at 2 to 3 times the risk of having high zzso and zzso as adults compared with those free of zzso at zzso zzso estimates with the use of high body mass index were similar to those of zzso zzso in predicting adult zzso Comparisons of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and net zzso index suggested that prediction of adult zzso high zzso and zzso in adulthood with the use of youth zzso was either equivalent or inferior to zzso based on high body mass index or overweight and zzso 

Youth with zzso are at increased risk of meaningful adult zzso however, the simplicity of screening for high zzso or overweight and obesity in the pediatric setting offers a zzso equally accurate alternative to identifying youth at risk of developing adult zzso high zzso or zzso
