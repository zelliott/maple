Patients with type 2 diabetes have reduced gene expression of heat shock protein zzso 72, which zzso with reduced insulin zzso Heat therapy, which activates zzso improves clinical parameters in these zzso zzso of several inflammatory signaling proteins such as zzso zzso terminal zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso can induce insulin resistance, but zzso 72 can block the induction of these molecules in zzso zzso we examined whether zzso of zzso can protect against the development of insulin zzso First, we show that obese, insulin resistant humans have reduced zzso protein expression and increased zzso zzso in skeletal zzso We next used heat shock therapy, transgenic zzso and zzso means to zzso zzso either specifically in skeletal muscle or globally in zzso zzso we show that regardless of the means used to achieve an zzso in zzso zzso protection against zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and insulin resistance was zzso This protection was tightly associated with the prevention of zzso zzso These findings identify an essential role for zzso in blocking inflammation and preventing insulin resistance in the context of genetic obesity or high-fat zzso
