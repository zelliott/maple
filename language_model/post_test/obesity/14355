An analysis was performed of the compressed breast thickness recorded in 146 zzso patient dose surveys each consisting of 50 or more women carried out between 1993 and zzso The results show a steady and statistically significant increase in compressed breast thickness with time, which is also present when individual independent screening zzso and equipment manufacturers are zzso This increase seems most likely to be associated with an increase in the proportion of women in the breast screening age range classified as overweight and obese, which has occurred over the same time zzso The associated trends in mean zzso dose per image were calculated for the zzso units used at the time of the surveys, using the most recently published conversion zzso The increase in average radiation dose that might have been expected as a result of the increase in average compressed breast thickness was not actually found in practice, possibly because of advances in equipment design and dose zzso strategies made during the 11-year zzso Other implications of an increasing average compressed breast thickness are zzso
