To examine the hypothesis of an influence of zzso on growth factors and on zzso markers of bone turnover of zzso overweight zzso 

395 zzso children, zzso years of age, were selected and the relationships between circulating serum levels of zzso and zzso growth factor I zzso insulin growth factor binding zzso zzso and some zzso markers of bone turnover zzso zzso zzso zzso of type I zzso zzso and zzso zzso of type I zzso zzso were zzso The subjects were subdivided into normal weight zzso zzso zzso zzso and weight excess zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso differences between the two groups were found for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with higher values in zzso and for OC zzso zzso with higher values in zzso A significant reduction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso serum values and an increase of those of OC zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not of zzso were registered in 103 zzso who showed a drop in weight excess during a zzso reduction zzso No variations were observed in 26 zzso zzso In a zzso analysis in which zzso corrected by zzso and sex, was the independent zzso a significant negative correlation was found with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso and height zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso There was no correlation with zzso zzso and zzso The results demonstrate that nutritional status and zzso levels are involved in the regulation of growth factors and zzso markers of bone zzso
