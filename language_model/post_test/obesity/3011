The zzso milieu has been investigated in male zzso lean zzso mice and zzso obese mice of the same strain zzso The lean zzso in winter, mobilized insufficient fat zzso to inadequate zzso to permit survival zzso 3 days and was unable to achieve any degree of conservation of vital protein zzso By contrast, in summer, the same animals survived 7 days and showed evidence of greater and more sustained fat zzso and zzso and the ability to conserve zzso The insulin, zzso and zzso zzso ratios changed in both groups in a direction consistent with conversion to a zzso state, and hence were probably largely responsible for the zzso of zzso and stimulation of zzso and zzso The seasonal difference in response is zzso The zzso mice, generally employed as a model for zzso zzso and zzso showed these features but also adapted to zzso in a fashion permitting prolonged survival during this zzso In a fashion analogous to that known to occur in man, these animals developed fall in zzso rise in circulating zzso zzso and marked protein zzso zzso fall in zzso was associated with a fall in zzso the latter from normal zzso Thus the initial markedly zzso zzso zzso ratio diminished, but nevertheless remained higher than at any time in the lean zzso zzso contents of insulin showed markedly different changes with zzso in zzso compared with lean zzso The ability of the obese mouse to adapt to prolonged zzso in a fashion largely analogous to that of man renders it a useful model for the study of metabolism in this state, with the potential of zzso of findings to zzso
