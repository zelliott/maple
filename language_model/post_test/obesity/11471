Previous studies have suggested that obesity enhances the inflammatory response, producing zzso involved in the induction and/or maintenance of increased zzso zzso The objectives of this study were to evaluate the correlation between inflammation zzso zzso zzso and the degree of obesity and to assess zzso expression on zzso surface membrane of obese zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in the peripheral zzso blood was evaluated by using a new zzso zzso expression was assessed by means of flow zzso and markers of inflammation were measured in 65 zzso 30 obese zzso mass index zzso zzso 41 zzso zzso zzso and 35 zzso zzso zzso 24 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlations and zzso zzso test were zzso 

A highly significant difference was noted in the degree of zzso zzso and markers of inflammation between the study zzso zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso rate zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and white blood cell count zzso zzso zzso p zzso The degree of zzso zzso correlated with zzso zzso rate zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso and white blood cell count zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso zzso zzso is probably zzso through increased zzso of adhesive zzso in the circulation and not necessarily through zzso or zzso exposure on zzso zzso
