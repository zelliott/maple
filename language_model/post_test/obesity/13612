Few studies have directly compared zzso and zzso effects on zzso The aim was to observe the possible effects of zzso and zzso on zzso control, insulin sensitivity, plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso zzso in overweight and obese diabetic patients intolerant to zzso 

Six hundred and zzso consecutive overweight and obese type 2 diabetic patients were evaluated and 56 patients were intolerant to zzso at maximum zzso We added zzso to zzso in these intolerant patients zzso and we compared them with 61 patients treated with zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso We evaluated body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso plasma insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso and R at baseline and after 3 and 6 zzso Furthermore, we calculated insulin resistance index zzso using zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso results were lower than baseline values in zzso and M zzso zzso zzso and zzso values were significantly lower in zzso group compared to M group at 6 zzso Plasma zzso zzso zzso and R were significantly improved in zzso group compared to M group at 6 zzso 

No zzso change was observed, probably because zzso was added to zzso that could mitigate the body increase of zzso zzso improved zzso control and insulin zzso parameters when added to intolerant zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso may be the drug of choice for the treatment of overweight and obese type 2 diabetic zzso
