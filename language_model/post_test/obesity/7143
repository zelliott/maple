To determine the relationship between insulin resistance zzso and zzso zzso independent of obesity in male zzso we evaluated body fat, zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso insulin, and the zzso model assessment of insulin resistance zzso zzso of insulin sensitivity zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso and the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index zzso and lifestyle parameters in 256 male zzso We divided the study group into the following four zzso based on the median value of zzso and zzso non-obese with zzso non-obese with zzso obese with zzso and obese with zzso In order to estimate zzso zzso we measured zzso ankle pulse wave zzso zzso Despite having a high body mass index zzso zzso adolescents showed a significantly lower zzso insulin and zzso but had higher IS zzso than zzso zzso After an adjustment for age, zzso zzso ratio, mean blood pressure, heart rate, total cholesterol level, zzso zzso zzso zzso level, physical activity, and television and computer zzso multiple zzso models showed that zzso was independently correlated with zzso and IS zzso In conclusion, our results demonstrate an association between zzso and zzso independent of weight, suggesting that zzso is a risk factor for the development of early zzso zzso that decrease zzso in addition to weight reduction may be necessary to alter the early development of cardiovascular zzso
