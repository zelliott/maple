zzso fatty liver disease may be evident in women with zzso zzso syndrome zzso both conditions being associated with obesity and insulin zzso However, few studies have accounted for the high prevalence of obesity in zzso 

The aim of this study was to determine whether zzso is independently associated with zzso zzso compared with healthy controls of similar age and body mass index zzso and whether zzso is associated with zzso 

We conducted a zzso zzso study at two zzso referral zzso 

zzso women with zzso diagnosed by the Rotterdam criteria zzso 28 zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso 33 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 22 healthy controls zzso 29 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso resonance zzso zzso zzso and skeletal muscle zzso whole body magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso were assessed between zzso and controls using zzso tests, and between zzso zzso zzso zzso with normal zzso zzso and controls using analysis of zzso 

After statistical adjustment for zzso zzso had significantly higher liver fat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso controls zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, after adjustment for zzso model assessment for insulin resistance, internal and visceral zzso tissue volumes, liver fat remained significantly greater in zzso compared to zzso and zzso 

These data suggest that zzso is associated with zzso zzso independent of obesity and insulin zzso
