zzso studies have shown that zzso within the mahogany locus suppress the zzso zzso including zzso of the zzso zzso Here we identify the mahogany gene and its zzso this study, to our knowledge, represents the first zzso cloning of a zzso gene in the zzso zzso of the mahogany gene is zzso however, in zzso zzso analysis emphasizes the importance of its expression in the zzso zzso nucleus, a region that is intimately involved in the regulation of body weight and zzso We present new genetic studies that indicate that the mahogany locus does not suppress the obese zzso of the zzso zzso zzso or those of the zzso obese models zzso tub and zzso However, mahogany can suppress zzso zzso the mechanism of which is likely to have implications for therapeutic intervention in common human zzso The zzso sequence of the mahogany protein suggests that it is a large, zzso zzso zzso with a short zzso tail containing a site that is zzso between zzso zzso and zzso We propose two potential, alternative modes of action for zzso one draws parallels with the mechanism of action of zzso zzso receptors such as zzso growth factor and transforming growth zzso and the other suggests that mahogany itself is a zzso zzso
