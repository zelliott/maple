The objective of this study was to characterize immune function in the zzso zzso zzso and to determine the effects of feeding zzso zzso acid zzso zzso on immune zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso rats were fed for 8 weeks nutritionally complete diets with different zzso zzso zzso control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to determine zzso zzso fatty acid composition and cell zzso or zzso with zzso to determine their ability to produce zzso zzso zzso and zzso oxide zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso rats had a higher proportion of total zzso fatty acids and zzso zzso zzso fatty acids zzso and lower zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso Feeding zzso increased the content of zzso zzso into zzso but there were lower proportions of each zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso rats produced more amounts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rats fed the zzso diet produced less zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso of zzso rats produced less zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso than lean rats, except zzso rats fed the zzso diet zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso zzso zzso were incorporated into the membrane zzso of the zzso zzso zzso but to a lesser extent than lean zzso zzso of obese rats responded in a zzso manner and had reduced zzso function and feeding the zzso and zzso zzso zzso may improve some of these abnormalities by distinct zzso
