The zzso zzso hypothesis suggests that greater maternal obesity during pregnancy results in increased offspring zzso in later zzso If true, this would result in the obesity epidemic progressing across generations irrespective of environmental or genetic zzso It is therefore important to robustly test this zzso 

We explored this hypothesis by comparing the associations of maternal and paternal zzso body mass index zzso with offspring dual energy X-ray zzso zzso fat mass measured at 9 to 11 y zzso zzso zzso and by using maternal zzso zzso controlling for offspring zzso zzso as an instrument for maternal zzso Both maternal and paternal zzso were positively associated with offspring fat mass, but the maternal association effect size was larger than that in the paternal association in all models: mean difference in offspring zzso and zzso fat mass zzso per 1 standard zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso for maternal zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for paternal zzso zzso for difference in effect zzso The stronger maternal association was robust to sensitivity analyses assuming levels of zzso up to zzso When maternal zzso controlling for offspring zzso was used as an instrument for the effect of maternal zzso the mean difference in offspring fat mass zzso per 1 standard zzso maternal zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso with no strong statistical evidence that this differed from the zzso ordinary least squares analyses zzso zzso zzso 

Neither our parental comparisons nor the use of zzso zzso as an instrumental zzso suggest that greater maternal zzso during offspring development has a marked effect on offspring fat mass at age zzso zzso zzso zzso related to greater maternal zzso is unlikely to have driven the recent obesity zzso
