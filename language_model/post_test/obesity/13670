We have recently reported that zzso zzso zzso women have disproportionately more zzso zzso tissue zzso than their zzso zzso Mediating mechanisms for zzso zzso remain zzso however, some evidence suggests a possible zzso zzso The objective of this study was to determine whether the zzso relationship found in zzso women exists in African-American zzso women and to determine whether catecholamines play a zzso zzso 

zzso included 44 zzso and 47 AA zzso zzso zzso physical activity by doubly labeled water zzso time equivalent zzso body composition zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso urinary catecholamines were zzso 

zzso measures zzso revealed zzso zzso and AA women had significantly higher zzso than their zzso counterparts zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In AA women and zzso women, zzso urinary zzso was significantly higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso AA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Multiple zzso analysis for modeling zzso indicated that race, parity, zzso zzso and zzso were all significant and independent contributors to the model zzso zzso race zzso zzso zzso parity zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso urinary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Independent of the potential zzso age, race, percent body fat, zzso zzso zzso urinary zzso physical activity, and zzso zzso zzso and AA women had more zzso than their zzso zzso Of the zzso zzso was found to be significantly lower in zzso women and higher in zzso zzso however, did not explain racial or parity differences in zzso
