zzso is a zzso trait that has a substantial genetic zzso Animal models confirm a role for zzso zzso and human studies suggest that as much as one-third of the zzso zzso may be due to zzso gene zzso To evaluate potential zzso interactions among five regions, on zzso 7, 10, and 20, that have previously been linked to obesity zzso we conducted zzso correlation analyses based on zzso shared identical by descent zzso for independent obese affected sibling pairs zzso and we determined zzso zzso linkage zzso scores in zzso zzso The correlation analyses were also conducted zzso by race, through use of zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses for a qualitative trait zzso mass index zzso and zzso models for quantitative traits were used to further refine evidence of gene zzso Both the zzso zzso probability and the zzso zzso score revealed that there were strong positive correlations between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso through zzso and zzso analyses with three obesity thresholds zzso zzso across African American and European American zzso zzso analyses for zzso found that the zzso score at zzso rises from zzso in the baseline analysis to zzso zzso zzso when families were weighted by evidence for linkage at zzso zzso through use of zzso weights zzso and to zzso zzso zzso when zzso weights zzso were zzso For percentage fat mass, zzso analysis based on a zzso zzso model yielded significant evidence for interaction between zzso (75 zzso and the zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with a zzso additive model zzso zzso zzso The results from multiple methods and correlated zzso are consistent in suggesting that zzso interactions between zzso in these regions play a role in extreme human zzso
