To search whether there are differences in serum levels of zzso in subjects with zzso syndrome zzso as compared to the healthy zzso 

zzso levels of zzso were measured by zzso in 22 subjects with zzso zzso group: 9 males and 13 zzso average age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in 17 healthy controls of about the same age zzso group: 8 males and 9 zzso average age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All subjects of zzso group had zzso and also other criteria of zzso zzso zzso insulin resistance, possible disorders of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in all of zzso zzso levels in serum were compared between the groups and also within the pooled zzso plus zzso group the zzso between serum levels of zzso and zzso serum zzso insulin zzso by zzso zzso and smoking were zzso For statistical processing one way zzso or its zzso parallel zzso one-way zzso as well as zzso and correlation analysis were zzso 

zzso with zzso syndrome had significantly higher zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and insulin zzso zzso higher were also the values of both indexes of insulin resistance such as zzso and zzso In contrast, however, zzso group had significantly lower zzso level than zzso zzso There was no difference between the average age of both zzso In pooled zzso plus zzso group inverse correlations were found between serum levels of zzso on one side and zzso and zzso insulin level on the other, while the level of zzso between smokers (which was declared by zzso subjects) and zzso did not show any influence on serum levels of zzso 

Low level of zzso in obese individuals may be considered as a marker predicting a possibility of the development of zzso zzso It is suggested that early regulation of serum zzso levels in obese subjects by treatment of zzso especially in young ones, could result in a lowering the risk of mainly cardiovascular diseases associated with zzso
