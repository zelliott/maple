An imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure will lead to a change in body weight zzso and body composition zzso and lean zzso A quantitative understanding of the processes involved, which currently remains zzso will be useful in determining the zzso and treatment of obesity and other conditions resulting from prolonged energy zzso Here, we show that a mathematical model of the zzso flux balances can capture the long-term dynamics of human weight change; all previous models are special cases of this zzso We show that the generic dynamic behavior of body composition for a clamped diet can be divided into two zzso In the first class, the body composition and mass are determined zzso In the second class, the body composition can exist at an infinite number of possible zzso Surprisingly, zzso of dietary energy intake or energy expenditure can give identical responses in both model classes, and existing data are insufficient to distinguish between these two zzso Nevertheless, this distinction has important implications for the efficacy of clinical interventions that alter body composition and zzso
