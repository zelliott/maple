zzso surgery in zzso obese type 2 diabetic zzso patients is associated with high rates of diabetes zzso We investigated the mechanisms of the zzso effect of the zzso zzso zzso with sleeve zzso zzso in normal weight zzso overweight zzso and obese zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients zzso zzso zzso with long-standing zzso 10 zzso treated diabetes zzso zzso zzso who were zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso based on zzso underwent zzso zzso sensitivity and parameters of zzso function were measured from an zzso zzso zzso Test zzso and zzso 

At a median of zzso months zzso weight loss averaged zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso subjects, respectively zzso zzso zzso sensitivity was fully restored zzso zzso vs 208 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso rate decreased zzso zzso vs 146 zzso zzso zzso zzso and total insulin output increased zzso zzso vs 39 zzso zzso zzso all p zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity doubled zzso zzso vs 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The only zzso predicting zzso of diabetes was a lower baseline insulin sensitivity zzso 

zzso induced changes on zzso by mechanisms in part distinct from weight loss, principally involving restoration of insulin sensitivity and improvement of zzso zzso
