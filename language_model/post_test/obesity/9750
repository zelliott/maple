We evaluated the association between four zzso in the zzso gene with circulating levels of zzso protein zzso type 2 diabetes zzso zzso and risk score of coronary heart zzso 

We studied 402 individuals and classified them into four groups: healthy, obese, zzso obese, and zzso without zzso from Guerrero, zzso zzso Blood levels of zzso zzso cholesterol, zzso and zzso were zzso zzso was performed by zzso and the risk score for coronary heart disease was determined by the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso of zzso zzso was associated with increased body mass index and zzso patients with zzso We found that the zzso 2 zzso was associated with increased levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso 7 zzso with higher body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso The risk score for coronary heart disease was associated with increased levels of zzso but not with any zzso or zzso 

The association between the zzso zzso of zzso zzso with obesity and the zzso 7 with zzso may explain how obesity and genetic predisposition increase the risk of diseases such as zzso in the population of zzso zzso
