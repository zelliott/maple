zzso is a recognized risk factor for both the development and progression of chronic kidney disease zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso rate zzso is thus important in these zzso We tested the performances of two zzso zzso estimates, the zzso of Diet in Renal Disease zzso and the zzso zzso Disease zzso zzso zzso zzso in an obese zzso 

Patients with body mass index zzso 30 zzso were zzso The reference method for measured zzso zzso was zzso zzso method, two blood samples at 120 and 240 zzso Both zzso and zzso results were zzso zzso zzso was measured using the zzso compensated zzso zzso Mean bias zzso precision zzso around the zzso and accuracy within zzso zzso of zzso within zzso of zzso were calculated for both zzso 

The population included zzso patients zzso zzso from two different zzso Mean age was 55 zzso 14 years, and mean zzso was 36 zzso 7 zzso Mean zzso was 56 zzso 26 zzso zzso (71 zzso 35 zzso without zzso In the total population, mean bias was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and accuracy zzso was 80 and zzso for the zzso and zzso equations zzso zzso zzso In patients with zzso 60 zzso zzso mean bias was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and accuracy zzso was 81 and zzso zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso equation did not outperform the zzso study equation in this population of obese zzso
