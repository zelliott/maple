zzso the zzso of complex traits such as obesity allows the identification of zzso genes for zzso Here, we show that the zzso mouse strain carries genetic zzso that zzso resistance to obesity induced by zzso or a high-fat diet zzso We set out to identify the zzso and genetic bases underlying this zzso When compared with zzso zzso mice zzso zzso zzso mice exhibited decreased food zzso increased zzso capacity, and improved fat zzso each of which can potentially modify zzso Interestingly, analysis of F1 zzso zzso of B6 zzso zzso zzso zzso mice revealed that obesity resistance in zzso zzso mice principally relied upon improved fat zzso This was mechanistically explained by increased zzso zzso zzso zzso content in zzso along with increased zzso and fatty acid zzso We conducted a zzso scan and defined a quantitative trait locus zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso 2 not only associated with the obesity resistance zzso but also supported increased zzso content in zzso zzso In zzso our study provides evidence that zzso control of zzso zzso rates directly zzso the balance of zzso handling and is sufficient to regulate fat mass in the absence of zzso in food intake and energy zzso zzso zzso Liu, zzso Li, zzso zzso Schwartz, and zzso zzso
