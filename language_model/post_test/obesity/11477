zzso is a pure zzso in human breast and zzso cancer cells that also reduces bone loss and plasma zzso levels in the zzso This study aimed to assess the ability of zzso alone or with zzso zzso to prevent obesity and related zzso abnormalities induced by an zzso diet and zzso 

Female rats were fed a zzso high-fat zzso diet, were left intact or zzso zzso and were treated with zzso zzso or both for 20 zzso zzso of energy balance and zzso of zzso metabolism and insulin sensitivity were zzso 

The zzso diet zzso zzso and zzso both increased energy intake and gain, as well as energetic zzso Both zzso and zzso prevented zzso and zzso energy gain mainly by decreasing fat deposition, without being zzso The modest zzso increase in liver zzso of intact rats was prevented by its combination with zzso zzso but not zzso decreased zzso The zzso diet and zzso reduced insulin sensitivity, an effect that was attenuated by zzso and zzso by zzso and zzso Treatment with zzso zzso or their combination abolished the zzso and zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso activity that accompanied fat zzso 

zzso is an effective agent to prevent zzso and zzso obesity and its associated cardiovascular risk factors such as insulin zzso The addition of zzso prevents zzso zzso zzso and further ameliorates insulin zzso The beneficial zzso effects of such combined steroid therapy may, therefore, eventually prove to be clinically zzso
