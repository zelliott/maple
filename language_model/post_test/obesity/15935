Association of obesity with zzso and cardiovascular complications depends on the zzso tissue zzso The role of zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue in zzso of insulin resistance is still not zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between insulin resistance and contribution of visceral and subcutaneous fat in a group of women with a wide range of body zzso 

62 women (age zzso zzso among which 32 were non-obese and 30 obese zzso 30 zzso were zzso The amount of visceral and subcutaneous fat was evaluated using computerized zzso total body fat evaluated using zzso and the degree of insulin resistance was evaluated using zzso disposal zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso women had lower insulin sensitivity than non-obese zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso and higher absolute amount of visceral zzso However, the relative amount of visceral fat zzso to total body fat or subcutaneous zzso was not different between the two zzso In the entire study group, the magnitude of insulin sensitivity did correlate with absolute amount of total and visceral fat, but no correlation with relative amount of visceral fat was zzso 

The results suggest that the absolute amount of fat, either total or zzso is a stronger predictor of the degree of insulin resistance than the relative contribution of visceral zzso
