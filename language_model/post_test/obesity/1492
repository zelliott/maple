zzso serum zzso has been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease zzso However, serum zzso is also related with several potential zzso related to zzso such as zzso zzso zzso has been proposed as a method to address challenges to zzso from zzso and reverse zzso It zzso zzso to estimate zzso relationships between a gene product and zzso zzso In this report, we demonstrate its use in assessing direct zzso relations between serum zzso levels and zzso risk factors, including zzso cholesterol, measures of vascular function and blood zzso 

Study subjects included zzso zzso zzso Study subjects were zzso at the zzso zzso which is strongly associated with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso levels were zzso associated with levels of several cardiovascular disease risk factors, including body mass index zzso LDL zzso and total cholesterol zzso In contrast, zzso zzso a known cause of elevated zzso levels, was not significantly associated with any of these traditional zzso risk zzso We did observe an association between zzso and zzso artery diameter zzso and cold zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings imply that the observed association of serum zzso levels with body mass index and cholesterol are likely due to zzso and suggest that previously established zzso benefits of increased zzso may in part be zzso by the early regulation of vascular structure and zzso
