zzso zzso disease zzso in the zzso segment is found in nearly a half of patients with zzso The aim of this study was to estimate the influence of obesity and fat distribution on the occurrence of zzso zzso in middle-aged zzso 

This zzso study included 204 middle-aged men zzso zzso years; range zzso zzso 102 patients with zzso zzso and 102 healthy controls without zzso zzso zzso was diagnosed by zzso index zzso and zzso Body mass index zzso was zzso zzso normal weight, overweight, and zzso zzso of body fat were grouped according to zzso zzso The relationship between zzso and zzso zzso was estimated by zzso zzso zzso
