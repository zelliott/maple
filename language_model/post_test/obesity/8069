Human zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth hormone zzso zzso act as zzso zzso in response to maternal insulin resistance, which occurs in zzso zzso zzso obesity can exacerbate this zzso suggesting that zzso zzso or zzso factors that regulate their production might be zzso The human zzso zzso zzso and zzso flank the zzso zzso A significant decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso levels was observed in transgenic mice containing the zzso genes in a model of high fat diet zzso maternal zzso Similarly, a decrease in zzso zzso levels was detected in term zzso from obese zzso mass index zzso zzso 35 zzso versus lean zzso zzso zzso zzso A specific decrease in zzso factor zzso protein zzso zzso zzso levels was also seen with zzso zzso is required for mouse zzso development and is zzso like zzso and zzso in zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso gene downstream zzso regions, which by virtue of their position zzso flank the zzso zzso was reduced in zzso zzso from mice on a zzso and in obese zzso a corresponding decrease in zzso zzso II associated with zzso promoters was also zzso zzso of decreased zzso zzso zzso levels in human zzso tumor cells treated with zzso zzso is consistent with a direct zzso These data provide evidence for zzso zzso in acute zzso obesity in mouse pregnancy and chronic obesity in human pregnancy and zzso zzso a factor associated with zzso regulation and zzso zzso
