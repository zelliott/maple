zzso nations are currently experiencing an obesity epidemic, the causes of which are not fully zzso One possible mechanism of enhanced energy efficiency that has received almost no attention is a reduction in the zzso cost of zzso which could be achieved by a modest lowering of body core zzso We evaluated the potential of this zzso mechanism in a canine model of the zzso zzso 

We compared the zzso temperature of lean dogs and obese dogs by zzso conducting zzso zzso in zzso dogs of many breeds varying greatly in body size, zzso conducting zzso zzso in individual dogs over zzso years and zzso tracking zzso temperature of lean and obese dogs at zzso intervals for 48 consecutive hours in the zzso 

We found that larger dogs have lower zzso temperatures than smaller dogs and that, for the same body mass, obese dogs have lower zzso temperatures than lean zzso The results were consistent in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

These findings document an association between obesity and reduced body temperature in dogs and support the hypothesis that obesity in this and other species of zzso may result from an increase in zzso efficiency achieved by a regulated lowering of body zzso
