The induction of general zzso zzso zzso is associated with variable period of zzso zzso patients have reduced oxygen supply during period of zzso zzso and subsequent zzso during period of zzso are strong stimuli of cerebral blood flow and zzso pressure zzso 

The objective of our study was to determine the patient position with safe zzso period zzso which will minimize the risk of zzso as an optimal positioning for induction of zzso in obese zzso zzso 

zzso patients zzso zzso zzso were randomly placed to one of two positions for induction of zzso group I zzso consisted of patients assuming 30 degree reverse zzso zzso group II zzso was in zzso zzso After the zzso oxygen zzso of zzso measured by pulse zzso zzso patients were allowed to remain zzso The time required for zzso to decline from zzso to zzso was recorded as zzso The lowest zzso after restoration of ventilation and recovery time to zzso zzso were also zzso zzso Time needed for zzso to decline to zzso was: zzso zzso zzso zzso in group I, and zzso zzso zzso zzso in group zzso There was significant difference between groups (I zzso zzso p zzso zzso of patients in the reverse zzso position dropped the least and took the shortest time to restore to zzso The recovery time was much longer in group II, zzso zzso zzso (I zzso zzso p zzso 

30 degree reverse zzso position provides longer zzso when compared with zzso zzso This extra time may zzso adverse zzso resulting from zzso during induction of obese zzso zzso
