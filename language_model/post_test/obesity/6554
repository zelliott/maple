zzso of zzso intact zzso with 200 zzso zzso with zzso lateral zzso area zzso stimulation significantly inhibited insulin zzso both in normal and obese zzso zzso zzso lean zzso and zzso obese zzso rats all responded in a similar manner, suggesting a general effect unrelated to zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso of zzso was inhibited in Sprague zzso lean zzso and obese zzso rats by zzso zzso and zzso even though zzso stimulation took place from zzso zzso Thus, the duration of zzso was greater than the period of zzso zzso indicating that this zzso can induce prolonged changes in the responsiveness of the zzso The data presented in this study demonstrate that zzso zzso in the absence of zzso factors, results in a direct zzso suppression of insulin zzso which is relatively long zzso This effect may illustrate a basic control mechanism by the zzso to regulate the zzso zzso
