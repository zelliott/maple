Few zzso studies have assessed relationships between body weight and motor skills in young zzso Our objective was to estimate the association between obesity and motor skills at 4 years and 5-6 years of age in the United zzso We used repeated zzso assessments of the national sample from the Early Childhood zzso zzso zzso zzso of preschool 4-year-old children zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso weight, and fine and gross motor skills were assessed zzso via direct standardized zzso We used zzso and continuous measures of body weight status, including obesity zzso Mass Index zzso zzso 95th zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and linear models estimated the association between obesity and gross and fine motor skills in very young children adjusting for individual, social, and economic characteristics and parental zzso 

The prevalence of obesity was about zzso The relationship between motor skills and obesity varied across types of zzso For zzso obese boys and girls had significantly lower scores, zzso lower in obese preschoolers and zzso lower in obese zzso than normal weight counterparts, p zzso zzso girls could jump zzso inches shorter than normal weight peers zzso zzso Other gross motor skills and fine motor skills of young children were not consistently related to zzso zzso and zzso 

Based on objective assessment of children's motor skills and body weight and a full adjustment for zzso zzso we find no reduction in overall coordination and fine motor skills in obese young zzso Motor skills are adversely associated with childhood obesity only for skills most directly related to body zzso
