I have developed a zzso mouse strain for the zzso zzso at the zzso locus in an zzso zzso strain, zzso zzso females are extremely obese and significantly heavier than zzso zzso The objectives of this study were to determine the genetic basis of obesity in zzso mice, and to determine whether or not their high body weight was due to the presence of zzso zzso zzso I performed quantitative trait locus zzso analyses for body weight and body mass index in two types of zzso mice zzso zzso zzso mice carrying the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mice without the zzso zzso produced by crossing zzso females and zzso zzso The results of the zzso analysis of zzso zzso mice were very similar to those obtained for zzso zzso zzso It was unlikely that the high body weight of zzso mice was due to the presence of specific zzso When both zzso zzso were merged and zzso four significant body weight zzso were identified on zzso 6, 9, and 17 (2 zzso and four significant obesity zzso were identified on zzso 1, 6, 9, and zzso Although the presence of zzso zzso zzso was not confirmed, a zzso basis of obesity in zzso females was thus zzso
