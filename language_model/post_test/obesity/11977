We zzso that composite zzso surgical complications are lower in obese patients who undergo minimally invasive valve surgery for zzso and zzso zzso valve disease, when compared with the standard median zzso zzso 

We zzso reviewed zzso heart operations done at our institution between January 3, 2005 and January 10, 2010, and identified 160 consecutive obese patients, defined as patients with a body mass index of greater than 30 zzso who underwent isolated zzso and zzso zzso valve zzso The outcomes of those who had minimally invasive valve surgery were compared with a matched control group who had valve surgery through a median zzso zzso 

Of the 160 patients, 64 underwent the minimally invasive approach and 96 had a median zzso The mean age was zzso zzso 11 years for the minimally invasive group, and zzso zzso zzso for the median zzso group zzso zzso zzso Composite zzso complications occurred in 15 zzso versus 49 zzso patients zzso zzso zzso in the minimally invasive group versus median zzso zzso The difference was driven by a lower zzso of acute zzso failure zzso vs 6 patients zzso p zzso zzso prolonged zzso (12 zzso vs 33 zzso p zzso zzso zzso (3 zzso vs 15 zzso p zzso zzso deep wound infections zzso vs 4 zzso p zzso zzso and death zzso vs 8 zzso p zzso zzso zzso All patients in the minimally invasive group were alive at 30 zzso 

zzso invasive surgery for isolated valve zzso in obese patients has a lower morbidity and mortality when compared with the standard median zzso zzso
