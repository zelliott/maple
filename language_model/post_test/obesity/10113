We have studied mechanisms by which zzso zzso which reduces body weight via zzso and zzso actions, zzso zzso depletion in zzso and zzso Here we show that zzso alters in pancreatic zzso the zzso of the genes zzso zzso of free fatty acid metabolism and zzso zzso zzso In animals infused with a zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso the levels of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso rose zzso to zzso whereas zzso zzso an zzso of zzso declined in zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rose zzso All in zzso changes occurred in zzso in normal zzso cultured with zzso zzso indicating direct zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso by more than zzso in zzso zzso and subcutaneous fat tissue of normal, but not of zzso obese zzso By directly regulating the expression of zzso of free fatty acid metabolism and of zzso zzso controls zzso zzso content of certain zzso as well as zzso
