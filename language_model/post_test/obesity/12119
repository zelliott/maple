In zzso zzso insulin zzso was greater in zzso zzso zzso zzso rats than in the corresponding zzso This zzso of insulin was reversed to normal by acute zzso with zzso A short-lived (30 zzso electrical stimulation of the zzso nerve preceding a zzso load zzso the in zzso zzso insulin release in adult animals zzso zzso and more so in obese zzso zzso than in lean zzso This suggested the existence of enhanced sensitivity and/or responsiveness of the B cells of obese animals to the zzso zzso That the zzso tone was increased in adult obese zzso zzso rats was zzso by the observation that acute zzso of these animals resulted in a significant decrease in zzso insulin zzso whereas no such effect was seen in lean zzso Also, zzso zzso from adult obese zzso rats zzso insulin during a stimulation by zzso when compared with controls, an zzso that was restored toward normal by superimposed infusion of zzso It is concluded that a) the increased insulin zzso of zzso zzso zzso rats is an early zzso that is zzso by the zzso zzso and b) increased zzso of insulin in adult obese zzso rats continues to be partly zzso zzso although a decreased sympathetic tone and other unknown defects could conceivably play a role as zzso
