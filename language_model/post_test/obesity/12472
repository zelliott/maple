Studies investigating the acute effects of zzso have demonstrated actions on the zzso system and appetite regulatory zzso There are limited data to support that these effects are sustained in the long zzso We therefore studied the effects of chronic treatment with zzso on zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso activity and active zzso (an zzso zzso in obese patients with Type 2 diabetes zzso 

Eight subjects zzso male, age zzso zzso zzso years, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso , zzso 69 zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso with zzso Type 2 diabetes were studied for 6 h following a standard mixed zzso before and after at least 3 months of zzso zzso zzso dose zzso g zzso 

The area under the curve zzso zzso ) for active zzso zzso 1 was significantly higher on zzso zzso zzso zzso 640 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ; zzso The areas under the zzso for zzso zzso activity and zzso were not significantly different zzso and zzso with zzso 

Three months or more of zzso zzso in obese patients with Type 2 diabetes was associated with increased zzso active zzso zzso 1 zzso The effects of zzso on the zzso axis may represent yet another important mechanism underlying its zzso zzso
