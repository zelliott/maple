Recent studies indicate that obesity may play a key role in modulating genetic zzso to type 2 diabetes zzso This study examines the main effects of both zzso and zzso interactions among genetic zzso in Taiwanese obese and zzso individuals to test the hypothesis that zzso genes may contribute to the zzso of zzso independently and/or through such complex zzso We zzso 11 single zzso zzso for 10 obesity candidate genes including zzso zzso surface, zzso zzso surface, zzso fat mass and obesity associated zzso zzso zzso binding protein beta zzso 3 zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso protein 1, zzso protein 2, and zzso protein zzso There were zzso patients diagnosed with zzso and 186 zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses showed significant main effects of the zzso and zzso genes on the risk of zzso among the zzso group zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Further, interactions involving zzso and zzso were suggested among the zzso population using the generalized zzso zzso reduction method zzso zzso zzso In addition, interactions among zzso fat mass and obesity associated zzso zzso and zzso protein 3 genes were found in a significant zzso generalized zzso zzso reduction model among the obese population zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that the single zzso zzso from the obesity candidate genes may contribute to the risk of zzso independently and/or in an interactive manner according to the presence or absence of zzso
