Total sedentary zzso of zzso zzso time is associated with zzso abnormal zzso zzso and the zzso zzso In addition to the effects of total sedentary time, the manner in which it is accumulated may also be zzso We examined the association of breaks in zzso measured sedentary time with biological markers of zzso zzso

Independent of total sedentary time and zzso intensity activity time, increased breaks in sedentary time were zzso associated with waist circumference zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso and zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso
