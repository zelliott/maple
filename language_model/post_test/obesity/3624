zzso Organic zzso zzso accumulate in zzso tissue and some are described to possess zzso zzso zzso zzso it is important to evaluate their effects on key zzso pathways in zzso tissue zzso to further evaluate their potential role in zzso zzso such as zzso 

THE zzso IS zzso zzso evaluate gene expression levels of obesity marker zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Factor zzso zzso and the nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in paired subcutaneous zzso and visceral zzso AT of obese subjects zzso zzso 50) and to relate these values to serum zzso of zzso and zzso zzso evaluate the association of expression levels of marker genes in AT and serum with POP zzso in zzso 

zzso and zzso levels in serum were positively correlated to respectively expression levels of zzso in SAT and zzso in zzso Our study shows more significant correlations between gene expression of obesity marker genes and POP zzso in zzso compared to zzso Since zzso is more important than SAT in zzso associated with zzso this suggests that zzso are able to influence the association between obesity and the development of associated zzso Moreover, this finding reveals the importance of zzso when investigating the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso negative correlations with zzso zzso zzso zzso were found in non zzso zzso zzso serum zzso correlated with several zzso in women whereas in men no correlations were zzso This strengthens the potential importance of gender differences in obesity and within the zzso zzso
