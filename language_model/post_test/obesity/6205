zzso zzso of the liver is associated with early dysfunction or poor function of the graft after zzso however, it can be zzso accurately only through a liver biopsy that sometimes may not be available and whose result is anyway known when the recipient has already been zzso It would, therefore, be helpful to be able to predict the degree of zzso on the basis of zzso readily available zzso 

Data from 374 deceased liver donors from whom a liver biopsy had been taken were analyzed with the receiver operating characteristic area zzso under the curve zzso to identify variables that could predict the degree of zzso zzso classified zzso absent to mild zzso and moderate to severe zzso 

zzso was associated significantly with donor age, increased body mass index zzso presence of type II diabetes, zzso features, heavy alcohol consumption, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso blood zzso The combination of zzso zzso of zzso presence of type II diabetes, history of heavy alcohol consumption, and zzso signs of zzso could identify zzso accurately with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in liver donors can be estimated based on clinical and zzso zzso
