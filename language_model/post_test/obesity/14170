Although previous studies have documented a variety of zzso zzso abnormalities in zzso zzso zzso which represent an increased risk for zzso zzso have not been studied very well in these zzso The aim of the present study was to evaluate zzso duration and P zzso zzso in obese subjects, and to investigate the relationship between zzso zzso and the clinical and zzso zzso 

The study population consisted of 52 obese and 30 normal weight control zzso zzso duration and zzso zzso were calculated on the zzso zzso As zzso zzso left zzso diameter zzso left zzso zzso and zzso diameters zzso and zzso left zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso zzso thickness zzso left zzso zzso wall thickness zzso and left zzso mass zzso of the obese and the control subjects were measured by means of zzso zzso 

There were statistically significant differences between obese and controls as regards to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso zzso P wave zzso was similar in both zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso in the obese patients was related to any the clinical and zzso parameters including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

Our data suggest that obesity affects zzso zzso and zzso and changes in P zzso may be closely related to the clinical and the zzso parameters such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
