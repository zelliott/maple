It is known that green tea has the ability to prevent zzso but the underlying molecular mechanism is not fully understood to zzso A preventive mechanism of green tea on obesity in zzso mice fed a high-fat zzso diet was investigated by evaluating the expression levels of zzso proteins in zzso white zzso tissue by using protein zzso An increase in the expression level of zzso growth factor binding protein zzso by green tea was found in the white zzso zzso of both control and zzso zzso mice by protein array and confirmed by Western zzso Moreover, the expression level was zzso correlated with zzso tissue zzso In zzso zzso treatment with green tea and its major zzso zzso zzso induced the expression of zzso in a zzso manner by Western zzso In conclusion, zzso in zzso tissue is a novel zzso target for the prevention of obesity by green zzso
