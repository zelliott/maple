To evaluate the relationship between the development of obesity and the zzso of zzso by the zzso we examined the effects of zzso zzso zzso and 10 zzso zzso on the zzso of zzso and insulin by isolated zzso zzso from genetically obese zzso and lean zzso zzso rats at 9, 18, and 54 weeks of zzso zzso of zzso and insulin in the zzso were measured by zzso zzso zzso of obese rats zzso greater amounts of zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso and 10 zzso zzso than did those of lean rats at all zzso The zzso of zzso by obese rats was particularly marked at 18 weeks of age, when they showed the most rapid increase in body fat zzso This zzso became obscure at 54 weeks of age, when obese rats showed the maximum body zzso The pattern of zzso release resembled that of insulin in all zzso However, the relative amount of zzso to insulin zzso following stimulation with zzso zzso zzso and 10 zzso zzso in obese rats exceeded that in lean rats at all zzso zzso in the zzso zzso to insulin zzso ratios between obese and lean rats were significant when zzso were zzso with zzso at 18 weeks zzso zzso zzso zzso lean, zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso at 54 weeks zzso zzso and zzso at 54 weeks zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
