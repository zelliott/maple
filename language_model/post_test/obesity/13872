To examine genetic zzso linked to a long-term burden and trend of obesity traits, such as body mass index zzso from childhood to zzso 

: zzso study using serial zzso of zzso from zzso 

A total of zzso zzso white siblings (representing 521 full and 39 half zzso from zzso families enrolled in the zzso Heart zzso 

A total of zzso zzso markers with an average spacing of zzso zzso spanning the 22 zzso zzso were zzso A zzso growth curve was developed using a random effects model based on serial zzso of zzso from childhood to zzso The serial changes in zzso were measured in terms of long-term burden zzso under the curve zzso divided by follow-up zzso and the long-term trend zzso zzso calculated as total zzso zzso 

zzso estimates of long-term measures were zzso for total zzso and zzso for incremental zzso In a zzso zzso linkage analysis with zzso linkage to the long-term measures of zzso was observed on zzso 1, 5, 7, 12, 13 and zzso For total zzso zzso scores were zzso at 110 zzso on zzso 12, zzso at 26 zzso and zzso at 52 zzso on zzso 7, and zzso at 126 zzso on zzso zzso For incremental zzso zzso scores were zzso at 26 zzso zzso at 97 zzso and zzso at 110 zzso on zzso 12, zzso at 69 zzso on zzso 7, zzso at 91 zzso and zzso at 150 zzso on zzso 1, zzso at 119 zzso on zzso 5, zzso at 54 zzso on zzso 13 and zzso at 7 zzso on zzso zzso Several important zzso candidate genes are located in the regions or near the markers showing positive zzso 

zzso evidence found in this study indicates that regions on these zzso might harbor genetic zzso that affect the propensity to develop obesity from zzso
