zzso regulates expression and production of zzso in zzso but whether this is also true in humans remains zzso To test the effects of acute zzso on expression of zzso zzso in humans, zzso needle zzso of abdominal subcutaneous zzso tissue were performed at baseline and immediately following a zzso zzso zzso zzso clamp in 16 zzso Indians zzso zzso zzso was zzso by reverse transcription, zzso amplification and expressed relative to zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were higher in women than men zzso zzso zzso v zzso zzso zzso relative units, P zzso zzso at zzso zzso levels were directly related to percentage body fat zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso and zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and were zzso correlated to zzso disposal at zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso 40 zzso during the clamp zzso zzso zzso 51, P zzso zzso Acute zzso zzso insulin concentration zzso zzso 950 zzso increased zzso zzso levels in 13 of 16 individuals an average of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso relative units, P zzso zzso Changes in zzso zzso were directly related to zzso disposal rates during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso These results suggest that the expression of zzso zzso is regulated by insulin in humans, as it is in zzso
