Class zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso composed of a regulatory and a zzso zzso and are essential for the zzso actions of zzso In addition to zzso and zzso zzso zzso such as fat, muscle, and liver express the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso To define the role of these zzso we have created mice with a deletion of zzso and zzso by using zzso zzso These mice are viable, grow zzso and maintain normal blood zzso levels but have lower zzso insulin zzso zzso of an insulin tolerance test indicate that zzso knockout mice have enhanced insulin sensitivity in zzso and there is an increase in zzso zzso transport in isolated zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso and zzso In muscle, loss of zzso results in reduced levels of zzso insulin zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso but enhanced levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas in zzso levels of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso Despite this, zzso of the knockout mice are smaller and have increased zzso zzso with altered zzso zzso zzso When treated with gold zzso zzso knockout mice become zzso like their zzso zzso However, they accumulate less fat and become mildly less zzso and markedly less zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso and zzso play an important role in insulin signaling and action, especially in zzso and zzso zzso
