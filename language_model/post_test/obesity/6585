The authors investigated 38 obese patients with a zzso above zzso The patients were divided into four zzso The first three groups were on a strict reducing diet, which differed as to the energy values zzso zzso to zzso zzso and the amount of protein zzso g N to zzso g N) per 24 zzso The fourth group zzso In the course of 16 days zzso balances were made and the energy output at rest was assessed by indirect zzso In all groups the body weight declined markedly on average by zzso to zzso zzso The energy consumption at rest declined only during the complete zzso The zzso patients were in a negative nitrogen zzso The nitrogen balance was positive in the patients who were given zzso g N and zzso g zzso zzso In all groups the fat zzso increased and the sugar zzso zzso The protein zzso declined markedly only in the zzso zzso It may be summarized that the low-energy protein diet is, as compared with the fast, a more zzso way to achieve weight reduction, in particular because despite weight reduction a positive nitrogen balance is zzso
