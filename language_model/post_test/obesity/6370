The hormone zzso has been suggested to link obesity to type 2 diabetes by modulating steps in the zzso zzso and inducing insulin zzso Thus, the zzso gene represents a potential candidate for the zzso of insulin resistance and type 2 zzso In this study, we analyzed the coding sequence of the three zzso of the zzso zzso together with its zzso regulatory region and 3' untranslated region zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso in 58 type 2 diabetic subjects, 59 obese subjects, and 60 normal zzso Only one sequence zzso was detected in the zzso zzso zzso of this zzso revealed the presence of a single zzso substitution zzso in the zzso of zzso 3 zzso zzso Because zzso zzso have been shown to affect gene zzso we examined the frequency of this zzso in 591 subjects zzso obese subjects, zzso diabetic subjects, and 186 control subjects) by zzso amplification and zzso zzso No significant association was found between the zzso zzso zzso and diabetes and zzso zzso of clinical and zzso parameters between zzso zzso carriers and zzso again showed no significant zzso In conclusion, our data suggest that genetic defects of the zzso gene are unlikely to play a role in the zzso of these common disorders in our zzso
