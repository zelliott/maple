The obese zzso rat is an animal model of human zzso zzso These rats exhibit numerous zzso and zzso zzso zzso of obese rats has been shown to reduce or reverse several of these zzso thereby zzso that zzso may contribute to the expression of obesity in this zzso Furthermore, it has been shown that the zzso rhythm of plasma zzso is disturbed in obese zzso rats resulting in elevated morning plasma zzso zzso in obese rats as compared to lean zzso In a effort to better zzso the mechanism of the elevated morning levels of plasma zzso the zzso clearance rate of zzso was determined in the morning for lean and obese male zzso rats (12 to 20 zzso Additionally, the zzso and urinary zzso of labeled zzso and/or its zzso were zzso The zzso clearance rate of zzso was significantly greater in obese rats than in their lean zzso Both the zzso clearance rate and the volume of compartments significantly correlated with body zzso No correlation was found between body weight and the elimination rate zzso The increased zzso clearance rate of obese rats appeared to be due to an increase in the zzso distribution of zzso and not to an zzso in the zzso responsible for zzso zzso It appears that the zzso clearance rate of zzso in obese zzso rats does not contribute to elevated morning zzso of plasma zzso previously observed in these zzso It suggests that the adrenal zzso zzso rate must actually be greater than one would expect from the plasma zzso zzso zzso
