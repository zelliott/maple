Lung volumes and other zzso variables were measured in 10 women with a mean age of 28 years, a mean height of zzso zzso and weights which were 50 to 140 per cent above the zzso zzso were made during the last zzso of pregnancy and after the second month zzso Mean values of lung volumes in zzso during these two time periods were: vital capacity zzso zzso and zzso zzso reserve volume zzso zzso and zzso functional residual capacity zzso zzso and zzso and forced zzso volume at one second zzso zzso and zzso Mean blood gas values were as zzso zzso zzso during both times; zzso zzso and 35 zzso standard zzso 22 and zzso zzso base zzso zzso and zzso zzso breathing air, 85 and 86 and breathing 100 per cent zzso zzso and 515 zzso zzso 162 and 167 zzso We conclude that, with the exception of zzso pregnant obese women who are 50 to 140 per cent overweight develop respiratory changes similar to those seen in zzso zzso These findings suggest that obesity of this magnitude does not zzso changes in ventilation induced by pregnancy as generally zzso Why in this obese population the decrease in zzso during pregnancy did not occur to the same degree as that seen in zzso zzso cannot be defined from our zzso Evidence is presented for a zzso imbalance in obese subjects which is not corrected during zzso
