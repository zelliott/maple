zzso chronic inflammation has been proposed to play a major role in the zzso of zzso zzso chronic inflammation is also closely associated with zzso an established zzso factor in the development of zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between two markers of zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso and blood pressure zzso and other zzso variables in obese zzso 

From a large cardiovascular study based in the general population, we selected subjects with a body mass index zzso or zzso zzso free of major cardiovascular diseases, not taking zzso or zzso drugs zzso zzso zzso women zzso zzso median zzso to 95th zzso age zzso 62 years zzso The cardiovascular study included zzso of traditional and new risk factors, including ankle zzso zzso index, a measure of zzso zzso zzso was determined by a zzso zzso 

In partial zzso rank correlation analysis, adjusted for age and sex, we found no significant relationships between either zzso or zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso pulse pressure, or ankle zzso index zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso However, zzso and zzso were found to be significantly related to heart rate zzso zzso P zzso 

In this study of generally healthy obese subjects from the general population, we found no significant relationships between markers of inflammation and zzso zzso or zzso zzso showing that obese subjects with higher levels of inflammatory markers do not have higher zzso levels than their obese counterparts with lower levels of inflammatory zzso
