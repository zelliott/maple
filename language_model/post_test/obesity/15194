zzso and zzso syndrome are associated with zzso dysfunction and zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that regulates metabolism and zzso zzso through stimulation of nuclear hormone receptors and other zzso zzso We report that the zzso gene encodes two zzso zzso zzso and zzso which counterbalance the zzso actions of zzso Mice genetically lacking zzso and zzso are resistant to high-fat zzso obesity and exhibit enhanced zzso fatty acid metabolism and elevated zzso capacity of zzso zzso Among the many targets of these zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso involved in fatty acid zzso and zzso a component of the zzso complex that controls nuclear hormone zzso activity, are zzso by zzso and zzso respectively, and are elevated in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with these targets as contributors to the zzso actions of zzso and zzso previous studies have implicated zzso zzso and zzso in zzso syndrome and zzso Our findings identify zzso and zzso as integral components of a regulatory circuit that functions under conditions of zzso stress to control systemic energy zzso and the overall zzso capacity of insulin target zzso Thus, these zzso provide potential targets for zzso intervention in obesity and zzso zzso
