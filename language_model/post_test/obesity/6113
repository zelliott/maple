According to the thrifty zzso hypothesis, the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes and obesity is a consequence of genetic zzso that have undergone positive selection during historical periods of erratic food zzso The recent expansion in the number of validated type 2 zzso and zzso zzso coupled with access to empirical data, enables us to look for evidence in support (or zzso of the thrifty zzso hypothesis using proven zzso 

We employed a range of tests to obtain complementary views of the evidence for zzso we determined whether the risk zzso at associated zzso zzso zzso is derived or zzso calculated the integrated zzso score zzso and assessed the population differentiation statistic fixation index zzso zzso for 17 type 2 diabetes and 13 obesity zzso 

We found no evidence for significant differences for the zzso zzso zzso None of the studied zzso showed strong evidence for selection based on the zzso zzso We find a high F zzso for zzso at zzso the largest type 2 diabetes effect size found to zzso 

Our results provide some evidence for selection at specific zzso but there are no consistent patterns of selection that provide conclusive confirmation of the thrifty zzso zzso Discovery of more signals and more zzso zzso for type 2 diabetes and obesity is likely to allow more detailed examination of these zzso
