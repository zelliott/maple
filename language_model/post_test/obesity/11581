Body composition zzso and lean zzso and bone mineral density were measured in 246 healthy zzso women, aged zzso years, residing in zzso zzso Body composition was measured using zzso zzso zzso and values for fat and lean compartments zzso into zzso Additionally, each woman was classified into one of nine different cells based on her location within a 3 zzso 3 table which reflects the joint distribution of both fat and lean zzso Bone mineral density of the zzso zzso including the zzso neck and zzso was measured using dual zzso zzso The mean zzso neck bone mineral density values increased significantly and zzso for each zzso of muscle mass zzso zzso and zzso zzso p less than zzso zzso bone mineral density increased significantly but not zzso as the fat compartment progressed from the lowest to the highest zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Bone mineral density of the zzso zzso was similar and significantly greater in the high zzso fat and high zzso fat body composition zzso compared with bone mineral density in the seven other zzso However, women in the high zzso fat zzso had substantially lower mean weight zzso zzso 91 zzso p less than zzso and mean zzso index zzso zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso than women in the high zzso fat zzso Bone mineral density values were similar and significantly lower in the following body composition zzso low zzso fat, low zzso fat, and low zzso zzso Similar findings were observed at the zzso zzso Low muscle is a risk factor for low bone mineral density in young adult women while higher fat is protective only when associated with substantial zzso
