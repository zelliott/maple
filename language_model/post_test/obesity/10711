We have investigated the zzso significance of the decline in serum zzso zzso occurring during zzso feeding by measurement of changes in cardiovascular zzso The zzso zzso the zzso between the Q wave of the zzso and the onset of zzso sounds at zzso pressure at the zzso artery, is the sum of the zzso period and zzso time, and has proven to be a sensitive and effective measure of the effect of zzso hormones on the cardiovascular zzso Fifteen zzso obese volunteers underwent successive 2 zzso periods of zzso feeding zzso calories per day) zzso with periods of at least 2 zzso of zzso on a zzso diet zzso zzso In a later phase subjects received oral supplementation of zzso zzso in addition to the diet to prevent the fall in serum zzso In the last study phase, subjects on the diet received supplementation with oral zzso zzso which prevented the fall in serum zzso and resulted in a slight increase in serum zzso During the first 2 zzso period of zzso zzso there was a statistically significant increase in zzso and a decrease in pulse rate, compatible with a zzso state relative to initial zzso When oral zzso supplementation was given, the rise in zzso and fall in pulse rate were zzso Likewise, with oral T4 zzso the changes in zzso and pulse were zzso Thus, the fall in serum zzso occurring during zzso feeding is associated with changes in the cardiovascular system which are zzso similar to those observed during zzso The present data, taken with other data in the literature, suggest that the decline in serum zzso during zzso feeding may be an zzso mechanism to conserve energy during caloric zzso
