Men had greater zzso zzso was associated with zzso whereas neither sex nor zzso alone was associated with zzso when adjusted for zzso For women, but not men, zzso was associated with waist zzso 

Sex is associated with zzso in patients with type 1 diabetes, a relationship accounted for by zzso consistent with a role for visceral zzso in this zzso Whether this observation is caused by a direct effect of sex hormones on the kidney and zzso or the effect of sex hormones on body fat distribution leading to differences in zzso remains to be zzso
