Many experimental designs in the behavioral sciences and zzso yield for each subject a response curve defined by number of correlated zzso The common zzso and zzso statistical tests assume independent zzso and cannot be used in this zzso After reviewing contemporary approaches to this problem, procedures for the cases of two independent samples and two matched samples of response zzso are zzso Each curve is zzso by an zzso zzso In the case of two independent samples the zzso zzso are compared by a zzso median test while in the case of matched samples a zzso sign test is zzso The methods are illustrated by real data zzso
