Twenty-two cohort publications were identified, reporting results in ten zzso and twelve zzso zzso Compared to individuals with zzso zzso levels, obese patients undergoing zzso had lower zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and long-term mortality zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso obese patients had lower short-term zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and similar long-term zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mortality risk compared to normal weight zzso zzso were similar in overweight patients for both zzso 

Compared to non-obese individuals, overweight and obese patients have similar or lower zzso and long-term mortality rates zzso zzso Further research is needed to confirm the zzso of these findings and delineate potential underlying zzso
