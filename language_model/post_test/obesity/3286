Our studies showed that there are important changes in body composition in children in response to dieting and zzso Similarly, we showed changes in body composition in response to zzso zzso which would be expected to restore more normal zzso but in its early zzso changes in body composition are complicated by the use of high doses of drugs, notably zzso Some of the changes in body composition can be predicted from changes in weight but the majority zzso Relatively simple zzso like the four zzso as a means of determining body fat are surprisingly accurate, except in extremely obese zzso Similarly, the zzso of fat free body mass are zzso However, this measurement does not discriminate changes within fat free body mass in the proportions of body cell mass versus zzso zzso Similarly, none of these zzso provide any information regarding the composition of body cell mass with regard to its zzso and protein content (as reflected by total body zzso The main drawback with total body nitrogen zzso is the radiation zzso Thus, we have had to limit the inclusion of total body nitrogen zzso It has been estimated that two total body nitrogen zzso provide a zzso dose of radiation roughly equivalent to that experienced by an individual living in a large North American city, that means 30 to 50 zzso per each total body nitrogen zzso It becomes ethically possible then to carry out nitrogen zzso where it can be argued that their measurement is essential in monitoring the safety and well being of the zzso or alternatively if the zzso life expectancy is zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
