The zzso syndrome consists of a constellation of zzso zzso abnormalities such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, zzso hypertension and visceral zzso For many years zzso have noted the striking resemblance between this disease state and that associated with zzso zzso However, in the zzso syndrome plasma cortisol levels tend to be normal or lower than in normal zzso zzso there is strong evidence that zzso action zzso zzso disease, largely from zzso obesity models where removing zzso reverses obesity and its zzso zzso The apparent paradox of similar zzso defects - despite the opposing plasma zzso profiles of zzso and idiopathic zzso syndrome - remained intriguing until the discovery that zzso zzso zzso was elevated in zzso tissue of obese zzso and zzso The zzso that mediates this zzso conversion of zzso zzso in zzso to cortisol zzso in zzso locally within zzso is zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso In order to determine whether elevated tissue zzso zzso contributed to obesity and zzso disease, transgenic mice zzso zzso zzso in zzso tissue or liver were zzso zzso zzso zzso transgenic mice exhibited elevated zzso and portal, but not systemic zzso levels, abdominal zzso zzso insulin resistance, zzso and zzso In contrast, transgenic zzso of zzso zzso in liver yielded an attenuated zzso syndrome with mild insulin resistance, zzso hypertension and fatty liver, but not obesity or zzso zzso Together with early data using zzso zzso zzso zzso to insulin zzso humans, this zzso the notion that the zzso may be a good therapeutic target in the treatment of the zzso zzso Further, a transgenic model of therapeutic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso mice, exhibited improved zzso zzso a zzso zzso profile, reduced weight gain and visceral fat zzso with chronic high-fat zzso Recent evidence further suggests that high zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso may be an zzso zzso that zzso zzso disease resistance in genetically predisposed mouse zzso This mechanism could zzso make up a genetic component of innate obesity resistance in zzso The efficacy of zzso zzso zzso has recently been extended to include increased energy expenditure and reduction of zzso and therefore may be of significant therapeutic value in the zzso syndrome, with complementary effects upon liver zzso zzso muscle, zzso and zzso zzso
