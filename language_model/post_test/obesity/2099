Based on the analysis of fat distribution by zzso zzso zzso scans, the zzso scheme for obesity should include visceral fat obesity in which fat zzso is zzso in the zzso zzso zzso subjects with visceral fat zzso more frequently demonstrate impairment of zzso and zzso metabolism than those with subcutaneous fat zzso We have shown that visceral fat obesity is present in almost zzso of obese patients with zzso heart zzso Even in non-obese subjects, visceral fat zzso is correlated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso Forty percent of non-obese subjects with coronary artery disease zzso had increased visceral zzso In non-obese subjects, visceral fat area assessed by abdominal CT at the level of the zzso zzso with zzso risk factors, whereas in obese subjects the visceral fat area to subcutaneous fat area ratio provides a more significant zzso From clinical and basic zzso aging, sex hormones, excess intake of zzso and lack of physical exercise have been suggested to be zzso for visceral fat zzso Since zzso fat zzso and zzso zzso has been shown to have high activities of both zzso and zzso its zzso can induce high levels of free fatty zzso a product of zzso in portal circulation which go into the zzso Excess free fatty acids may cause the enhancement of zzso synthesis and zzso as well as insulin resistance, resulting in zzso zzso intolerance and hypertension and finally zzso Thus we propose a disease entity, visceral fat syndrome, which may increase zzso to zzso due to multiple risk factors induced by visceral fat zzso
