zzso of this study was to verify the existence of a correlation between the insular hormones and the zzso zzso factor zzso We studied 70 subjects (20 control, 20 obese, 20 non zzso diabetic obese, 10 zzso diabetic subjects) submitted to a zzso test (1 zzso zzso Blood samples were collected at zzso 0, 3, 6, 12, 15, 30, 60, zzso 150 minutes to zzso insulin, zzso serum zzso and zzso zzso The results to point out are: the zzso zzso values are significantly higher zzso zzso in non zzso obese patients than in zzso the obese subjects also present a significant difference zzso zzso After zzso injection no variations have been found in the zzso values until the 15th zzso then the controls, the obese and, above all, the non zzso diabetic obese subjects showed a significant increase of the zzso values between zzso and zzso zzso values 38 zzso 4 zzso zzso values 85 zzso 7 zzso zzso As these high values appear only after the induction of zzso in our experiment and are not present in the zzso diabetic subjects, it's probable that insulin, rather than zzso zzso directly or zzso the zzso zzso If this hypothesis is confirmed, the correlation between insulin and zzso should deserve attention from a therapeutic point of view in subjects with zzso zzso
