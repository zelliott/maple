zzso hormone zzso energy expenditure zzso and is critical for zzso zzso To define the zzso role played by zzso hormone in the dissipation of calories from diet, zzso mice were studied for 60 d in a comprehensive lab animal monitoring zzso zzso decreased caloric intake and body fat while zzso genes in the skeletal muscle but not brown zzso tissue zzso programs, without affecting daily zzso Only at zzso (30 zzso did zzso mice exhibit slower rate of zzso indicating a zzso response to zzso that depends on ambient zzso A byproduct of this mechanism is that at room temperature zzso zzso zzso mice are protected against zzso zzso zzso only at zzso did zzso mice become obese when placed on a high-fat diet zzso This is in contrast to zzso controls, which on a zzso gained more body weight and fat at any temperature while zzso the brown zzso tissue and accelerating daily zzso but not the skeletal muscle zzso zzso In the liver of zzso controls, zzso caused an approximately zzso increase in zzso content and expression of key zzso zzso whereas zzso to 30 C cut zzso content by half and zzso gene zzso However, in zzso mice, zzso changes in liver persisted at 30 C, resulting in marked liver zzso zzso to zzso dramatically improves zzso zzso but this was not affected by zzso In conclusion, zzso mice are metabolically sensitive to environmental temperature, zzso a mechanism that defines resistance to zzso obesity and zzso zzso zzso
