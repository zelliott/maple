zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited liquid food intake in obese and lean male mice after zzso and zzso zzso of food zzso zzso decreased meal size without changing the duration of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso of food intake was relatively zzso The largest dose of zzso tested (40 zzso had no effect on water intake in lean mice and it merely changed the pattern of intake in obese zzso zzso mice were as sensitive as lean mice to the zzso effect of zzso after zzso zzso and zzso zzso of food zzso Since zzso decreased meal size in obese mice and since obese mice were normally sensitive to zzso zzso could be the circulating zzso factor that Coleman zzso zzso was deficient in obese zzso The results, however, only indicate that zzso could be the deficient zzso Other experiments are required to prove the zzso
