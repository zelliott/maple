To examine the relationship between zzso and clusters of cardiovascular risk factors in middle-aged zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso 

zzso District Health Center, and the Community health Center of the city of zzso in central zzso 

zzso men and women aged 36, 41, 46, and 51 years zzso zzso zzso in the town of zzso and a zzso control population of 177 subjects aged 40 and 45 years in the city of zzso 

zzso of obesity zzso mass zzso zzso zzso abdominal zzso zzso zzso zzso for men zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a low level of zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso in men and zzso zzso in zzso and abnormal zzso metabolism (impaired zzso tolerance or zzso diabetes as defined by World Health Organization zzso according to statistical zzso of the zzso plasma insulin zzso 

Among the zzso there was a zzso to zzso higher risk of having a zzso of the zzso associated cardiovascular risk factors compared with that of the zzso Among the zzso subjects in the highest zzso of zzso plasma insulin there was a zzso to zzso increase in risk associated with having two or more insulin zzso cardiovascular risk factors compared with the subjects in the lowest zzso There was a positive correlation between a high number of zzso risk factors and high levels of zzso plasma zzso 

In clinical practice, knowledge of the close relationship between zzso cluster status and zzso plasma insulin levels offers a tool to evaluate the occurrence of zzso in middle-aged zzso men and zzso
