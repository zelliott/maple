zzso X-ray zzso zzso is widely used for bone mineral density and body composition zzso However, zzso is known to overestimate muscle mass in obese zzso We used zzso CT zzso to derive a correction factor to enhance accuracy of zzso zzso of specific strength zzso per unit zzso One hundred and zzso adults zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were enrolled in this zzso study and divided into groups based on body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso groups did not differ in age, knee zzso strength zzso thigh lean mass by zzso or zzso zzso area zzso by zzso zzso strength zzso correlated with an zzso estimate of zzso strength zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso p zzso in the lowest to highest zzso groups in men and women, zzso zzso correlations were achieved through correcting for zzso age, and sex in zzso zzso strength zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the lowest to highest zzso groups in men and zzso zzso zzso in women, p zzso zzso of knee zzso strength by zzso in men with zzso 30 and all zzso groups in women greatly improved using a correction factor for zzso estimates of thigh lean zzso
