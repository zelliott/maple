The relation of zzso zzso of zzso protein 3 zzso with zzso syndrome zzso has been evaluated only in one previous study with contradictory zzso The aim of our study was to investigate the association of zzso zzso of zzso gene with zzso 

A population of 817 obese Caucasian patients was analyzed in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso was zzso To estimate the prevalence of zzso , the definitions of the zzso were zzso 

Five hundred and zzso patients zzso had the zzso zzso zzso group), whereas 223 patients zzso had the zzso zzso zzso zzso was not zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was similar in patients with zzso zzso wild zzso and zzso zzso zzso and without zzso zzso wild zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio of zzso wild zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso Total cholesterol and low density zzso zzso cholesterol zzso were lower in zzso group than zzso group in patients with zzso No differences in other parameters were detected between zzso in the same group of zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is not major risk factor for the zzso However, in zzso group of zzso zzso gene in patients with zzso total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were lower than zzso zzso
