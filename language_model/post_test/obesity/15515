To explore the role of zzso on zzso associated with zzso we examined the relation between zzso zzso rate zzso and plasma zzso insulin, or insulin resistance in zzso zzso zzso rats in the dynamic and zzso zzso (2 and 14 zzso after zzso zzso zzso rats gained body weight zzso at fivefold higher rates in the dynamic phase compared with zzso control zzso rats, and zzso gain reached a plateau in the zzso zzso zzso fat pad mass was increased zzso in zzso rats compared with sham rats in both zzso zzso levels were zzso higher in zzso rats of the dynamic phase and even higher in the zzso zzso zzso levels were twofold higher in zzso rats than in sham rats in both zzso In the dynamic phase, zzso rats had zzso higher plasma zzso zzso levels and zzso higher zzso whereas zzso plasma zzso zzso values, an indicator of insulin resistance, were zzso zzso values became significantly higher in zzso rats in the zzso phase, but zzso was not further zzso zzso was significantly associated with zzso independent of zzso zzso was highly correlated with zzso fat mass, and zzso fatty acids zzso These results suggest that zzso itself plays a critical role in zzso probably through increased zzso flux from enlarged zzso zzso zzso resistance is not associated with the overproduction of zzso in this animal model for zzso
