There is a great need for identification of zzso that could improve the prediction of early zzso zzso We undertook this study to determine whether circulating levels of zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso and zzso protein zzso can serve as useful markers of zzso knee zzso zzso in a normal human zzso 

zzso data were obtained from the cohort of the zzso zzso a prospective zzso study of healthy, middle-aged British zzso The zzso status of the subjects was assessed using the zzso zzso grade as determined on zzso obtained at baseline zzso zzso zzso and at 10 years and 15 years zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso at 5, 8, and 15 years, using zzso commercial zzso A zzso grade zzso in either knee was used as the outcome zzso zzso analyses included analysis of zzso for repeated zzso and zzso zzso models, together with zzso modeling of zzso zzso 

During 15 years of zzso the prevalence of zzso zzso zzso increased from zzso to zzso zzso zzso versus zzso The body mass index zzso and circulating levels of zzso and zzso were consistently and significantly higher in subjects diagnosed as having zzso When multiple zzso zzso was applied to the data, the variables of older age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso higher zzso at baseline zzso zzso zzso and increased levels of zzso at year 5 zzso zzso zzso were determined to be independent zzso of the appearance of zzso at year zzso The results were fully confirmed using zzso modeling of repeated zzso of the data obtained at 3 zzso The odds ratio for zzso in subjects whose zzso levels were in the fourth zzso of increasing levels zzso the first zzso was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso 

This followup study showed that individuals were more likely to be diagnosed as having zzso if they had a higher zzso and increased circulating levels of zzso These results should stimulate more work on zzso as a potential therapeutic zzso
