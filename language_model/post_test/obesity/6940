Using the Princeton School District Family Study zzso our specific aim was to estimate the prevalence of suspected familial zzso and zzso to provide empirical risk estimates for the proportion of zzso first-degree relatives who were similarly affected, and to estimate the contributions of diseases, drugs and caloric intake to relative obesity and zzso We studied zzso zzso 125 whites and 52 blacks from a random recall group, 147 whites and 55 blacks from a zzso recall zzso zzso familial obesity and zzso were arbitrarily identified in those zzso with at least two first-degree relatives in the same zzso index zzso as the zzso top or bottom zzso zzso familial obesity was observed in zzso percent and 6 percent respectively of random and zzso recall group zzso zzso familial zzso was identified in zzso percent and zzso percent of random and zzso recall whites and in zzso percent of randomly recalled zzso zzso twice as many as expected white first-degree relatives of top zzso index zzso zzso themselves had top zzso zzso zzso approximately three times as many as expected first-degree relatives of bottom zzso zzso index zzso themselves had bottom zzso zzso zzso zzso percent and 31 percent of top zzso zzso index white zzso from random and zzso recall groups came from families where at least two other first-degree relatives were similarly zzso 18 percent and 20 percent of white random and zzso recall group zzso with bottom zzso zzso zzso had suspected familial zzso Nearly all subjects with familial obesity or zzso had no overt zzso or pharmacological explanations for their body zzso zzso zzso of hypertension was common in zzso with suspected familial obesity and was absent in zzso with suspected familial zzso zzso zzso zzso of both obesity and zzso is useful zzso therapeutic intervention to reduce zzso to be most effective, should be zzso in the many zzso which share familial zzso
