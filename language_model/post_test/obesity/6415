The effect of obesity on regional skeletal muscle and zzso tissue zzso acid metabolism is not zzso We evaluated systemic and regional zzso and abdominal subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso acid zzso by use of a combination of stable isotope zzso and zzso balance methods, in five lean women zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso and five women with abdominal obesity zzso zzso zzso waist zzso zzso who were matched on zzso mass zzso All subjects were studied at 22 h of zzso to ensure that the subjects were in net protein breakdown during this early phase of zzso zzso rate of appearance in plasma (an index of whole body zzso expressed per unit of zzso was not significantly different between lean and obese groups zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the rate of zzso release from zzso and zzso zzso in obese women zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso was lower than in lean women zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso of total whole body zzso release into plasma was derived from zzso tissue in lean and obese zzso The results of this study demonstrate that the rate of release of zzso acids per unit of zzso and zzso tissue at 22 h of zzso is lower in women with abdominal obesity than in lean women, which may help obese women decrease body protein losses during zzso In addition, zzso tissue is a zzso important site for zzso in both lean and obese zzso
