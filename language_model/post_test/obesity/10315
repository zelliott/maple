One of the mechanisms involved in the progression of diabetic zzso the most common cause of zzso zzso failure, is zzso phenomenon associated with the increase of zzso factors such as vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso an zzso of zzso In the present study, we examined the therapeutic efficacy of zzso zzso acid zzso a small zzso zzso with zzso activity, using diabetic zzso mice, a model of obese type 2 zzso zzso in kidney weight, zzso volume, zzso zzso urinary zzso zzso total zzso zzso zzso type IV zzso zzso zzso area zzso and zzso zzso zzso observed in control zzso mice were significantly suppressed by daily zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso for 8 zzso zzso in zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso factor transforming growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but not tumor necrosis zzso were also inhibited by zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, decreases of zzso zzso and protein levels in zzso mice were recovered by zzso In addition, treatment of zzso mice with zzso did not affect body weight, blood zzso serum insulin, or food zzso zzso significantly suppressed the increase of zzso induced by high zzso in cultured zzso and also suppressed the increase of zzso and zzso induced by high zzso in cultured zzso zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential use of zzso as a novel therapeutic agent for zzso zzso in type 2 zzso
