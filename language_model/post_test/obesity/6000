This study aims to evaluate the zzso of zzso Sleep zzso zzso in severely obese Asians and to study the impact of weight loss on zzso 

We report the results of routine zzso zzso in 350 Asian patients undergoing zzso surgery in our zzso zzso were repeated in 75 randomly selected patients with moderate to severe zzso after target weight loss with the zzso placed adjustable gastric band zzso 

The prevalence of zzso in obese Asians is zzso zzso zzso was found in zzso of patients and severe zzso was found in zzso Severe zzso was significantly more in the Chinese zzso compared to the zzso zzso or Indians zzso zzso zzso zzso We identified other risk factors for severe zzso zzso sex, higher body mass index and the presence of zzso but were unable to select identifying parameters for very low zzso likelihood of severe zzso such that routine sleep studies prior to zzso surgery could be zzso zzso zzso Index zzso showed improvement of 50% at 20 zzso excess weight loss with the cure of zzso in preoperatively severe cases zzso zzso zzso to moderate cases reported similar improvements although a direct correlation could not be zzso zzso events, zzso episodes, work of breathing and zzso assessment of zzso scores and quality of life zzso showed improving trends, albeit not statistically zzso Similar improvements were seen in sleep architecture with increased rapid eye movement zzso and stage 3 zzso 

The zzso of zzso in Asians undergoing zzso surgery is zzso zzso sleep studies in Asian patients are zzso Weight loss brought about a significant improvement in zzso and continuous positive airway pressure zzso zzso placement should be considered a broadly effective therapy for sleep zzso in the severely obese zzso
