To determine the variation in zzso isolation procedure and to assess the number and function of zzso from subcutaneous and zzso zzso tissue of obese zzso 

The zzso number per gram of zzso tissue in the zzso and zzso zzso stores of 27 obese subjects with a zzso of 44 zzso 10 zzso and an age of 40 zzso 9 years was zzso 

The assessment of the zzso number was found to be labor intensive and error zzso Our data indicated that the number of zzso vascular cells zzso isolated from the zzso tissue by zzso zzso was dependent on the duration of zzso treatment and the size and the origin of the zzso In addition, the fat zzso and zzso production by differentiated zzso were dependent on the number of adherent zzso zzso in the culture plate and the presence of proteins derived from serum and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Using our standardized isolation and differentiation zzso we found that the number of zzso zzso zzso production, and fat zzso still varied considerably among zzso Interestingly, within individuals, the number of zzso zzso and the zzso production by zzso zzso from both the subcutaneous and the zzso fat zzso were zzso whereas fat zzso was zzso In obese to severely obese subjects, differences in zzso and age could not explain differences in zzso zzso zzso production, and fat zzso
