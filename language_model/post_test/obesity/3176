zzso zzso gene and zzso Y gene may potentially influence zzso metabolism and overall energy zzso zzso we examined associations of these genes with zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso A total of zzso white individuals from 212 Polish families with zzso of essential hypertension were zzso for cardiovascular risk zzso Each subject was zzso for functional zzso of zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso and zzso Y zzso Of 3 common zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to offspring with elevated levels of total cholesterol zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not associated with any of the zzso zzso in zzso tests or zzso zzso However, in the presence of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was associated with zzso odds ratio zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso of elevated LDL in zzso subjects, independent of age, zzso body mass index, adjusted blood pressures, zzso therapy, and use of zzso zzso and zzso zzso there was a significant zzso association among zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso with elevated LDL zzso zzso but not in zzso subjects with normal LDL zzso This study revealed an association of zzso with zzso zzso gene zzso and provided evidence for zzso interaction between zzso zzso gene and zzso Y gene in determination of zzso in patients with essential zzso
