The effects of a very zzso zzso high-fat zzso dietary regimen on zzso syndrome were compared with those of an zzso zzso zzso low-fat zzso regimen in dietary obese zzso 

Male zzso rats, made obese by 8 weeks ad zzso consumption of an zzso diet, developed features of the zzso syndrome zzso lean control zzso rats, including greater zzso zzso and zzso fat masses, elevated plasma cholesterol levels, impaired zzso zzso and zzso and zzso insulin zzso Half of the obese rats zzso were then fed a popular zzso diet zzso 9 and 10 at zzso and Weeks 11 to 14 at zzso zzso and one-half zzso were zzso an zzso diet zzso 9 to 14 at zzso zzso 

Energy zzso of zzso zzso and HC rats were less than C rats throughout Weeks 9 to zzso Compared with HC rats, zzso rats exhibited impaired insulin and zzso responses to an zzso zzso load at Week 10 and lower plasma zzso levels but retarded loss of zzso zzso and total body fat at Week zzso zzso zzso and C rats no longer differed in body weight, plasma cholesterol, zzso zzso or zzso insulin resistance at Week zzso Progressive decreases in zzso insulin resistance in obese groups paralleled zzso reductions in zzso zzso and total body zzso 

When energy intake was zzso the zzso diet provided no advantage in weight loss or in improving those components of the zzso syndrome induced by dietary obesity and may delay loss of zzso and visceral fat as compared with an zzso zzso
