To investigate whether zzso zzso and their changes during weight loss in obese children are associated with parameters of zzso and insulin zzso 

Total plasma zzso insulin and zzso were measured during oral zzso tolerance testing before and after zzso weight loss over 6 zzso 

zzso rehabilitation program in a pediatric zzso 

zzso obese children (age zzso zzso and 11 normal weight controls (age zzso zzso 

Changes in zzso zzso during weight loss and correlation analysis of changes in zzso and changes in parameters of zzso and insulin zzso After data collection, zzso analysis of obese patients with high, medium and low estimated insulin sensitivity zzso insulin sensitivity index zzso was zzso 

Weight loss increased the area under the curve zzso of zzso by zzso zzso The increase in zzso zzso correlated significantly with improved estimated insulin sensitivity zzso zzso zzso The independent predicting effect of zzso was confirmed in zzso zzso In children with low zzso zzso reached the level of control values after weight zzso In children with high zzso zzso increased markedly above control zzso 

Changes in zzso are independently associated with changes in zzso and insulin zzso The increase in plasma zzso above control levels was limited to obese children with high zzso
