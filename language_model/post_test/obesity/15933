To explore the relationship between the placement of fast-food outlets and zzso socioeconomic variables by determining if indicators of lower socioeconomic status were zzso of exposure to fast zzso 

A descriptive analysis of the fast-food environment in a Canadian urban center, using secondary analysis of census data and zzso Information Systems zzso 

zzso Alberta, zzso 

Neighborhoods were classified as High, zzso or Low Access based on the number of fast-food opportunities available to zzso zzso socioeconomic data zzso education, zzso immigration status, and housing zzso from the 2001 Statistics Canada federal census were zzso 

A zzso function analysis was used to determine if any association existed between neighborhood demographic characteristics and accessibility of fast-food zzso 

zzso differences were found between the three levels of fast-food accessibility across the socioeconomic zzso with successively greater percentages of unemployment, low income, and renters in neighborhoods with increasingly greater access to fast-food zzso A high score on several of these variables was zzso of greater access to fast-food zzso 

Although a zzso zzso is not possible, these results suggest that the distribution of fast-food outlets relative to zzso socioeconomic status requires further attention in the process of explaining the increased rates of obesity observed in relatively deprived zzso
