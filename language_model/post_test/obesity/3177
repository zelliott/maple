zzso zzso type 1 zzso is a candidate gene for hypertension, diabetes, and obesity through altered zzso zzso This study explored the association of zzso gene zzso with diabetes, hypertension, and obesity in a zzso population study of American Indians zzso zzso In zzso mixed models assuming an additive effect of zzso a zzso upstream zzso zzso was associated with blood pressure zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso per copy of the A zzso zzso zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso per copy of the A zzso zzso mean zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso per copy of the A zzso zzso and hypertension zzso zzso per copy of the A zzso zzso However, birth date modified these associations zzso for zzso zzso blood pressure zzso zzso blood pressure zzso mean zzso blood pressure zzso such that the magnitude and direction of association between zzso and blood pressure changed with zzso Finally, in models controlling for potential zzso by population stratification, we observed evidence of zzso effects for blood pressure zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso per copy of the A zzso zzso zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso per copy of the A zzso zzso mean zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso per copy of the A zzso zzso and for hypertension zzso zzso per copy of the A zzso zzso No association was observed for zzso zzso with diabetes were similar in magnitude as reported previously but were not statistically zzso These data demonstrate association between genetic zzso at zzso with hypertension, but these effects are modified by environmental zzso
