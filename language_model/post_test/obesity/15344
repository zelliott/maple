The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the fall in circulating insulin concentration associated with moderate weight loss determines the associated decrease in plasma zzso zzso For this purpose, 12 healthy, zzso obese women were studied before and after an average weight loss of zzso zzso zzso of initial body zzso Plasma zzso zzso fell from a mean zzso value of 35 zzso 3 to 17 zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso in association with the loss of zzso However, there was no correlation between the decline in zzso concentration and the associated fall in weight, body mass index, fat mass, or percent body zzso Furthermore, no correlation was seen among changes in zzso plasma zzso or insulin zzso the zzso integrated plasma zzso response to breakfast and lunch, or the estimate of zzso zzso zzso The only measured variable that correlated with the fall in plasma zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso P zzso was the decline in the zzso integrated plasma insulin response after weight loss (from 304 zzso 44 to 232 zzso 36 zzso h zzso zzso P zzso Finally, zzso zzso analysis, using various estimates of degree of zzso insulin resistance, integrated zzso response, and integrated insulin response as dependent zzso indicated that only the insulin response was independently related to the decrease in zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso The fall in integrated insulin response accounted for zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso after weight loss, and this was true no matter what the estimate of change in degree of zzso In addition to offering an explanation for the zzso in zzso loss zzso zzso these data provide further evidence of the importance of ambient insulin zzso in the regulation of plasma zzso zzso
