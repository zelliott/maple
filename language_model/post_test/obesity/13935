To explore the activity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso tissue and blood of lean and moderately obese subjects and to study whether there is a link between these hydrogen zzso zzso and blood markers of zzso zzso 

Nine obese male subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and nine controls zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to 40-year-old subjects were included in the zzso zzso and zzso activities were measured on zzso of abdominal subcutaneous zzso tissue by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of soluble zzso zzso zzso products, and zzso agents were measured in zzso whereas zzso zzso were determined in blood zzso 

The high zzso activity found in zzso tissue was diminished by one-half in obese subjects zzso initial zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no change in zzso activity, either under its zzso zzso or zzso zzso Plasma levels of zzso zzso products and zzso vitamins remained zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso whereas circulating zzso insulin, and zzso were zzso 

Although they already exhibited several signs of zzso disorders, the obese men did not exhibit the increase in blood markers of zzso stress or the decrease in zzso defenses reported to occur in very obese or diabetic zzso The reduced zzso and the unchanged zzso activities found in obesity suggest that these hydrogen zzso zzso expressed in zzso are probably not involved in the onset of the zzso stress found in severe obesity and/or in its zzso
