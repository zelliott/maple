Male zzso rat zzso were either fed by continuous zzso infusion of a milk formula to match the growth rate of their normally reared siblings, or overfed by continuous infusion of a zzso formula from d 4 through d 18 zzso The early zzso accelerated growth and the overfed rats remained significantly heavier than normally reared siblings as zzso Early zzso with this procedure led to an adult obesity at 14 zzso characterized by significantly larger zzso and zzso fat zzso resulting from an increase of both fat cell size and number, and by an increase in zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso rearing per se, without zzso resulted in adult rats that weighed the same as normally reared siblings but had significantly larger zzso fat zzso because of more zzso These findings suggest that the quantity of food consumed during early growth and development, and the quality of early nutrition and/or the early rearing environment affect zzso tissue development and have long-term consequences that persist in the zzso
