zzso syndrome zzso is an zzso zzso intellectual disability zzso disorder caused by zzso in the zzso gene and zzso by variable cognitive zzso a distinct facial zzso zzso and zzso Female carriers are usually not affected or only mildly affected, and so far only two females with de zzso zzso or deletions in zzso have been zzso 

We performed zzso zzso analysis and screening for zzso deletions and zzso by quantitative real-time zzso and multiplex zzso dependent probe amplification zzso in female patients with variable ID and a distinct appearance of sparse hair, remarkable facial features, zzso zzso and teeth zzso We detected two zzso zzso and two zzso of zzso 4 and zzso Furthermore, two female patients with zzso deletions and a similar zzso were identified by routine molecular zzso Recently, two patients with a clinical diagnosis of zzso syndrome in early infancy had been found to zzso zzso in zzso and their zzso in advanced ages is now zzso Further studies revealed skewed zzso in blood zzso while it was normal in zzso thus indicating functional zzso 

Our findings indicate that de zzso defects in zzso in females result in a zzso zzso which might have been zzso so far and which comprises variable zzso a characteristic facial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mainly of fingers IV and zzso dental anomalies, and linear skin zzso It shows overlap with zzso but also additional distinct features, thus adding a new facet to this zzso
