Recent zzso guidelines have focused on the early identification and risk zzso of patients on zzso zzso is associated with zzso in multiple inflammatory regulators similar to changes seen in zzso suggesting a potential interaction between the presence of obesity and the severity of illness in zzso 

We performed a retrospective chart review of patients admitted with a primary billing diagnosis of zzso at a single United States university hospital from 2007 to zzso Seven hundred and zzso charts were identified meeting inclusion zzso zzso was defined as a body mass index zzso The data recorded included age, race, sex, vital signs, laboratory values, length of stay, zzso weight, zzso and survival to zzso A modified zzso II score was calculated to estimate disease zzso The primary outcome variable was zzso zzso 

zzso had higher average zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of illness and zzso conditions including cancer were similar across zzso zzso Increased zzso of diabetes zzso type 2 was associated with increasing zzso zzso and was associated with decreased zzso with an odds ratio of zzso compared with zzso zzso After adjusting for age, zzso race, severity of illness, length of stay, and zzso conditions, the trend of decreased mortality for increased zzso was no longer statistically zzso however diabetes continued to be strongly protective zzso ratio zzso zzso 

This retrospective analysis suggests obesity may be protective against mortality in septic zzso The protective effect of obesity may be dependent on diabetes, possibly through an unidentified hormonal zzso Further prospective studies are necessary to elaborate the specific mechanism of this protective zzso
