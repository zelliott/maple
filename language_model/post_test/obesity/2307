There is an established link between zzso functioning zzso and cardiovascular disease zzso zzso and it is known that those with diabetes predominantly die of zzso However, few studies have determined the combined impact of diabetes and impaired zzso on zzso zzso We investigated whether this combination carries a higher zzso risk than either component zzso 

The Australian zzso zzso and zzso zzso study included zzso adults aged zzso 25 years from 42 randomly selected areas of zzso At baseline zzso diabetes status was defined using the World Health Organization criteria and zzso was assessed using the zzso zzso 

Overall, after zzso years of zzso 57 persons with diabetes and 105 without diabetes had died from zzso In individuals with and without diabetes, zzso measures were significant zzso of increased zzso zzso The zzso mortality risks among those with diabetes or impaired physical health component summary zzso alone were similar zzso zzso hazard ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso impaired zzso zzso zzso zzso while those with both diabetes and impaired zzso had a much higher zzso mortality zzso zzso compared with those without diabetes and normal zzso (after adjustment for multiple zzso Similar results were found for the mental health component zzso 

This study demonstrates that the combination of diabetes and impaired zzso is associated with substantially higher zzso zzso This suggests that, among those with diabetes, impaired zzso is likely to be important in the identification of individuals at increased risk of zzso zzso
