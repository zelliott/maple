zzso was used to study the zzso binding of zzso zzso and zzso zzso an zzso acid zzso zzso drug, to human plasma protein in eight normal zzso The percent free of the R was greater than that of the S for most subjects, but the ratio of percent zzso R to S ranged from zzso to zzso In extensive studies with a single representative zzso the percent zzso of the individual zzso was independent of concentration up to 26 zzso although the binding of the S zzso zzso zzso zzso was greater than that of the R zzso zzso zzso whereas that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso At zzso zzso of the zzso the percent free of both zzso and zzso increased to zzso at 100 zzso A zzso binding model with zzso binding described the data well for zzso zzso and zzso zzso resulting zzso values were zzso X zzso zzso X zzso and zzso X zzso zzso zzso The binding of each zzso in the presence of varying amounts of its zzso was described best by a simple competitive zzso model where mutual displacement occurred as zzso increased beyond 26 zzso The binding of zzso zzso in elderly and obese volunteers and patients with liver disease was not significantly different from normal subjects, but binding was less in zzso patients and patients with zzso zzso zzso decreased the binding of zzso zzso
