To evaluate the relationship between plasma zzso concentration and body fat content in zzso 

20 zzso female zzso that were 10 months old at the start of the zzso 

Dogs were kept under regulated feeding and exercise conditions for 21 weeks, resulting in a wide range of body zzso body condition scores zzso and subcutaneous zzso Plasma zzso concentration was measured by use of a canine zzso zzso test to evaluate its correlation to body fat content estimated by the zzso oxide dilution zzso Plasma zzso of zzso cholesterol, zzso zzso and zzso fatty acids zzso were also zzso 

Body fat content (9 to zzso of body zzso was positively and closely correlated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 20; P zzso to plasma zzso concentration zzso to zzso zzso compared with other variables zzso zzso cholesterol, zzso and zzso r zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The positive relationship between plasma zzso concentration and body fat content in dogs was similar to correlations reported for humans and zzso suggesting that plasma zzso is a quantitative marker of zzso in zzso
