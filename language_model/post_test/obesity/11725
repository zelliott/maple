The prevalence of obesity is increasing in many European countries and in the United zzso This report examines the mortality and morbidity associated with being overweight and obese in the zzso Prospective Study and the relative effects of weight in middle age and self reported weight at 18 zzso 

All men aged 45 to 59 years from the town of zzso South Wales and outlying villages were identified and zzso men were examined for the first time between 1979 and zzso Men were asked to recall their weight at 18 years of age (when the majority had been examined for National zzso so that weight then, weight at zzso and the difference could be related to their 14 year follow up from zzso A total of zzso men could recall their weight at 18 zzso By 14 years of follow up from screening 465 men had died and 382 had had coronary zzso 

Mean body mass index in men who reported their weight at 18 years was zzso zzso zzso zzso and only 41 of these men zzso were classified as obese zzso 30 zzso The index did not predict all cause mortality when examined by zzso For major zzso heart disease zzso or fatal zzso heart disease) the relative odds was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the top fifth of the distribution zzso mass zzso zzso zzso compared with the bottom fifth zzso mass index zzso zzso In men with an zzso 30 zzso however, the relative odds were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for all cause mortality and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for major zzso heart disease, adjusted for age, smoking habit and social zzso When men were recruited to the study, from 1979 to zzso the mean body mass index had increased to zzso zzso zzso a mean increase of zzso zzso or zzso 2 zzso 299 men zzso were classified as obese and showed significantly increased relative odds of both all cause mortality zzso 53 zzso zzso zzso zzso and major zzso heart disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso adjusted for age, smoking habit and social class relative to the non-obese zzso The effect of gain in weight from 18 years to recruitment was also zzso all cause mortality showed highest mortality in the fifth of the distribution who experienced weight loss or minimal weight zzso For major zzso heart disease an inconsistent, weak trend was zzso the relative odds rising to a maximum of zzso zzso zzso in the top fifth of weight gain compared with the bottom zzso Weight gain showed strong associations with potential cardiovascular risk factors measured at zzso insulin, zzso zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure and high density zzso 

Body mass at 18 years of age of 30 zzso or more zzso increased risk for all cause mortality and major zzso heart disease during 14 years of follow up of men aged 45 to 59 zzso By the baseline examination the prevalence of obesity zzso mass zzso had increased from zzso to zzso obese men also showed an excess risk of major zzso heart disease and overall zzso but these risks were lower than those predicted from 18 years of zzso Weight gain was strongly associated with smoking zzso the greatest weight gain being among zzso and the least among light zzso Weight gain from 18 years of age to baseline examination showed little relation with subsequent mortality and risk of major zzso heart disease when adjusted for age, smoking habit and social zzso The lowest mortality rate occurred in the zzso of men who gained a mean weight of zzso zzso Weight gain is closely associated with some adverse cardiovascular risk zzso in particular with insulin, zzso zzso and zzso blood zzso
