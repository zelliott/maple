To determine if elevated plasma zzso typically involved in the formation of zzso zzso zzso an increased risk for cardiovascular disease zzso and zzso in children as it does in zzso Although zzso zzso is frequently reported in children, the role of zzso zzso and its response to physical zzso lifestyle are less clear in this zzso 

In a zzso controlled zzso physical zzso lifestyle intervention, zzso zzso concentration was measured in 21 children zzso zzso years; zzso zzso zzso including 15 in the obese group and 6 in the normal weight group, with body mass index zzso for age and sex zzso and zzso zzso 

The relationships between zzso zzso and other risk factors for zzso such as markers of insulin resistance and zzso zzso along with body composition (as measured by zzso X-ray zzso were assessed before and after the zzso zzso zzso concentration was higher in the obese group compared with the normal weight group zzso zzso and was correlated with other risk factors for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and insulin emerged as the major predictor of zzso zzso The intervention reduced zzso concentration zzso zzso 

Our data zzso zzso elevated zzso zzso zzso in obese zzso children compared with normal lean zzso zzso a relationship between zzso zzso and other zzso risk zzso and zzso physical zzso reduction in zzso zzso in obese zzso
