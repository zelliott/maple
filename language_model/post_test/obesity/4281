zzso and insulin are important zzso hormones acting on the zzso However, most obese humans and animals have reduced zzso responses to zzso and zzso Increased zzso zzso zzso stress has been shown to cause insulin resistance in the zzso of obese zzso In the present study, we investigated a role of zzso stress in the development of central zzso and insulin zzso zzso zzso administration of the zzso stress zzso zzso zzso increased food intake and body zzso Furthermore, zzso or zzso administration of zzso inhibited the zzso and zzso effects of zzso and zzso zzso administration of zzso by itself activated zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso but prevented a further zzso of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso and zzso We also found that the expression of the zzso stress markers such as zzso of the zzso zzso zzso spliced form of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso increased in the zzso of zzso obese zzso zzso Furthermore, treatment of chemical zzso zzso zzso acid significantly improved central zzso resistance in zzso zzso These findings suggest that increased zzso zzso stress in obese animals may induce central zzso and insulin zzso
