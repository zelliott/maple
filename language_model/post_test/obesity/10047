zzso zzso is associated with a number of changes in the zzso axis zzso by low serum zzso and T4 levels and, zzso low or normal zzso This response is, at least partly, caused by suppression of zzso gene expression in zzso of the zzso zzso nucleus zzso and reduced zzso zzso zzso Because the fall in zzso hormone levels can be blunted in mice by the systemic administration of zzso we raised the possibility that zzso may have an important role in the neuroendocrine regulation of the zzso zzso through effects on zzso zzso producing zzso Adult male, zzso rats were either fed zzso zzso for 3 days, or zzso and administered zzso at a dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso every 6 zzso zzso animals showed significant reduction in plasma total and free T4 and zzso levels compared with controls, that were restored toward normal by the administration of zzso zzso free zzso but not percent free zzso increased during zzso further suggesting a reduction in plasma zzso levels that did not return to fed levels after zzso zzso By zzso analysis of in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was markedly suppressed in the zzso animals but was restored to normal by zzso administration zzso zzso fast zzso zzso zzso units zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso in adjacent zzso in the lateral zzso that do not have a zzso function remained unchanged by any of the experimental zzso These findings indicate that zzso has a selective, central action to zzso the zzso axis by regulating zzso gene expression in the zzso but does not have peripheral effects on zzso zzso We propose that the fall in circulating zzso levels during zzso zzso the set point for feedback zzso by zzso hormones on the zzso of zzso zzso thereby allowing adaptation to zzso
