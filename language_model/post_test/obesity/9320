To review the effectiveness and safety of surgical intervention for zzso sleep zzso in zzso zzso 

The muscle zzso and obesity associated with zzso syndrome zzso result in a high rate of zzso sleep zzso zzso The use of growth hormone therapy in these patients has been associated with sudden death, raising concerns that such treatment may exacerbate zzso sleep zzso As a result, it has been suggested that children with zzso be evaluated for zzso and indications for zzso prior to instituting growth hormone zzso The true effectiveness of surgical intervention in these cases, however, remains in zzso 

zzso review of patients with a diagnosis of zzso who underwent zzso or zzso from January 2001 to July 2009 at a zzso zzso care children's zzso Patients underwent zzso and zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso index zzso zzso index zzso and median oxygen zzso and oxygen zzso zzso were zzso 

Five patients were identified during the study zzso Three patients underwent zzso 1 patient zzso alone, and another zzso with zzso zzso While median zzso was found to have decreased from zzso to zzso no statistically significant change could be demonstrated zzso Mean zzso and zzso zzso zzso also improved, but without reaching statistical zzso No zzso complications were zzso 

Our series, and other small case series, have demonstrated that complete resolution of sleep zzso in zzso patients is difficult to obtain with upper airway surgery zzso It is suggested that children with zzso being considered for growth hormone therapy undergo assessment for zzso by zzso Patients identified with zzso should be referred for management by zzso and/or continuous positive airway pressure zzso and then zzso for residual airway obstruction prior to instituting hormonal zzso
