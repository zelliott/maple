Diabetes zzso is a group of debilitating and costly diseases with multiple serious zzso Lower urinary tract complications or diabetic zzso are among the most common complications of diabetes zzso zzso widely recognized complications such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso develops in individuals with types 1 and 2 diabetes, and little is known about the natural history of these common and troublesome zzso Animal models have the potential to reveal mechanisms and aid in the development of treatment zzso 

We present a review of available animal models of diabetes zzso relative to their use in the study of diabetic zzso 

Large and small animal models of diabetes zzso are zzso While large animals such as dogs and zzso may closely mirror the human disease in size and zzso the time between diabetic complication onset and development, and associated zzso expenditures can make acquiring data on statistically valid sample sizes zzso zzso In contrast, small animal models zzso and zzso have much lower expenditures for a larger number of animals and compressed observation time due to a shorter life zzso Also, mice are readily manipulated genetically to facilitate the isolation of the effect of single genes zzso and knockout zzso Type 1 diabetes zzso can be induced chemically with zzso which is selectively toxic to pancreatic beta zzso Type 2 diabetes zzso models have been developed by selective breeding for zzso with or without associated zzso zzso zzso has been noted in several well zzso predictable animal models of diabetes zzso 

zzso zzso including diabetic zzso dysfunction, has been more frequently studied in small animals with type I zzso The recent availability of transgenic models provides a new opportunity for further studies of diabetic zzso in mouse models of types I and II diabetes zzso
