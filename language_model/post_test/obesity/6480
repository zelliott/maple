To investigate the influence of obesity on the regulation of zzso zzso metabolism following protein zzso C zzso zzso in obese zzso and lean zzso zzso zzso 

zzso hearts obtained from zzso lean and obese zzso rats were zzso with 200 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for different time periods prior to the evaluation of zzso and zzso zzso For zzso studies isolated hearts from 48 h starved zzso rats were zzso with an zzso buffer containing increased zzso zzso zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined by Western zzso zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated by measuring the zzso release of zzso and zzso from zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso of zzso zzso from the zzso to the zzso within 10 zzso This zzso was zzso lower in the heart from obese rats when compared to lean zzso zzso also induced a significant zzso of zzso zzso from the zzso to the zzso fraction within 60 zzso in lean but not in obese zzso Rates of zzso cardiac zzso zzso and zzso in obese rats were approximately zzso lower than those of lean zzso zzso with increasing zzso of zzso zzso zzso led to a significant decrease of cardiac zzso zzso in lean but not in obese zzso 

Our results show that in the heart of the genetically obese zzso zzso the impairment in zzso zzso is in line with a diminished zzso of zzso as well as with the lack of zzso effect on zzso zzso
