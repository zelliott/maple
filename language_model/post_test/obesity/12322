The aim of this study is to determine the serum levels of zzso in patients with zzso zzso syndrome zzso and to understand its correlations with other zzso and hormonal zzso zzso patients with zzso and 30 women without zzso disease were included in this zzso zzso zzso levels were similar in patients with zzso and control zzso zzso levels were higher in normal weight zzso when compared with obese zzso but it did not reach statistical zzso zzso levels correlated zzso with zzso blood zzso total cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels in zzso zzso zzso levels increased both in obese zzso and in obese zzso Plasma zzso levels had no correlation with zzso model zzso resistance and zzso insulin levels, but the negative correlation between plasma zzso levels and zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso and LDL levels may indicate a role for zzso in cardiovascular disease independent of insulin zzso
