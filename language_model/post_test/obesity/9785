Clinical correlation studies have clearly shown that obesity is associated with breast cancer risk and patient zzso Although several potential mechanisms linking obesity and zzso have been proposed, the detailed molecular mechanism of zzso breast zzso has not yet been critically zzso In this study, we evaluated the effects of obesity on zzso tumor initiation and progression using mice with genetic and zzso obesity bearing zzso tumor zzso and mouse zzso tumor zzso transgenic mice that were fed a high-fat zzso We show that obesity promoted zzso tumor growth and development in these animal zzso Moreover, the expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in zzso tumors of obese mice, suggesting that the zzso signaling zzso is activated by zzso in the tumors of obese zzso More importantly, zzso zzso zzso and zzso that target members of the zzso suppressed zzso and prolonged survival more effectively in obese mice than in zzso zzso Here, we not only identified a specific signaling zzso that contributes to zzso zzso in obese mice but also a strategy for treating zzso breast zzso
