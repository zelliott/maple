zzso is a major risk factor for several musculoskeletal conditions that are characterized by an imbalance of tissue zzso Adult stem cells are closely associated with the zzso and potential repair of several zzso derived zzso such as fat, bone and zzso We hypothesized that obesity would alter the frequency, zzso zzso and zzso of adult stem cells from a variety of zzso 

Bone zzso zzso stem cells zzso subcutaneous zzso stem cells zzso and zzso fat zzso stem cells zzso zzso were isolated from lean and high-fat zzso obese mice, and their cellular properties were zzso To test the hypothesis that changes in stem cell properties were due to the increased systemic levels of free fatty acids zzso we further investigated the effects of zzso on lean stem cells in zzso 

zzso mice showed a trend toward increased prevalence of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso While no significant differences in cell proliferation were observed in zzso the differentiation potential of all types of stem cells was altered by zzso zzso from obese mice demonstrated decreased zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells showed increased zzso and zzso zzso but decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso also showed decreased zzso and increased zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso consistent with decreased zzso zzso zzso treatment of lean stem cells significantly altered their zzso but did not completely zzso the properties of obese stem zzso 

These findings support the hypothesis that obesity alters the properties of adult stem cells in a manner that depends on the cell zzso These effects may be regulated in part by increased levels of zzso but may involve other zzso zzso These findings contribute to our understanding of zzso tissue zzso with zzso as well as the development of zzso stem cell therapies for obese zzso
