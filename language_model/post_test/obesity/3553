zzso of soluble zzso zzso are of potential interest as treatment for cardiovascular diseases but to our knowledge they have never been proposed to treat zzso zzso We evaluated the effects of the soluble zzso zzso zzso BAY zzso on zzso dysfunction and zzso zzso in a mouse model of obesity associated zzso zzso 

zzso male mice fed for 10 weeks with standard zzso or a high fat diet were treated with 1 zzso BAY zzso per day for 2 weeks via zzso zzso evaluations were done and responses to zzso agents in isolated zzso were zzso 

zzso mice showed an irregular zzso pattern characterized by significant increases in zzso and zzso zzso which were zzso by BAY zzso zzso zzso and zzso produced concentration dependent zzso in isolated zzso zzso which were markedly greater in obese than in lean zzso BAY zzso zzso zzso zzso in the obese zzso A zzso increase in zzso oxygen species generation in the zzso tissue of obese mice was observed, which was unaffected by BAY zzso Treatment with BAY zzso generated a tenfold increase in zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of obese mice without affecting the zzso level in the lean zzso zzso expression of the soluble zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was decreased zzso in the zzso tissue of obese mice but restored by BAY zzso 

zzso BAY zzso therapy increased zzso zzso zzso and rescued expression of the soluble zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso resulting in great zzso of zzso zzso
