This study identified the journals with the highest yield of clinical obesity research articles and surveyed the scatter of such studies across zzso The study exemplifies an approach to establish a journal collection that is likely to contain most new knowledge about a zzso 

All original studies that were cited in 40 systematic reviews about obesity topics zzso zzso were compiled and journal titles in which they were published were zzso The journals were ranked by the number of included zzso The zzso journals for clinical obesity and the scatter across journal titles were zzso A subset of these journals was created in zzso zzso to test search recall and precision for high-quality studies of obesity treatment zzso is, articles that pass predetermined methodology criteria, including random allocation of participants to comparison groups, assessment of clinical zzso and at least zzso zzso

zzso journals captured only a small proportion of the literature on clinical obesity zzso Those wishing to keep up in this field will need to develop more inclusive strategies than reading these specialty zzso A journal subset based on these findings may be useful when searching large electronic databases to increase search zzso
