As indicated by in zzso studies, both zzso and zzso in zzso depend on the cellular zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso protein 1 zzso in the white zzso tissue of the zzso transgenic mice reduced obesity induced by genetic or dietary zzso Furthermore, respiratory zzso lowered the cellular energy charge in zzso while the synthesis of fatty acids zzso was inhibited and their zzso zzso zzso the complex zzso changes triggered by zzso zzso were associated with the zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso a zzso master switch, in zzso zzso of several typical treatments that reduce zzso such as administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso dietary zzso zzso zzso or zzso can be compared with a zzso of the zzso zzso These situations generally lead to the zzso of zzso zzso and suppression of the cellular energy charge and zzso synthesis in zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso is zzso Moreover, it has been shown that zzso in zzso can be activated by zzso hormones zzso and zzso and also by zzso zzso Thus, it is evident that metabolism of zzso tissue itself is important for the control of body fat content and that the cellular energy charge and zzso are involved in the control of zzso metabolism in zzso The zzso link between synthesis and zzso of zzso in zzso represents a prospective target for the new treatment strategies aimed at reducing zzso
