There is debate as to whether zzso type III domain containing 5 zzso and its protein product zzso are therapeutic targets for zzso zzso Thus, we sought to examine zzso zzso within skeletal muscle of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rats versus zzso Long Evans zzso zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso expression would be greater in obese zzso versus lean zzso zzso 

zzso muscle of zzso old zzso and zzso rats were zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso Body composition and circulating zzso of the zzso and zzso rats were also correlated with skeletal muscle zzso zzso expression patterns in order to examine potential relationships that may zzso 

zzso rats exhibited twice the amount of zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso rats zzso zzso positive correlations existed between zzso muscle zzso zzso expression patterns versus fat mass zzso zzso as well as plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were also highly correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso In subsequent culture experiments, low and high zzso doses of zzso had no effect on zzso zzso or zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso Paradoxically, circulating zzso zzso tended to be higher in a second cohort of zzso versus zzso rats zzso 

These results reveal a positive association between total body zzso and skeletal muscle zzso gene zzso Of interest, circulating zzso levels tended to be lower in zzso zzso Further research is needed to examine whether other zzso zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and/or inhibit zzso zzso from zzso
