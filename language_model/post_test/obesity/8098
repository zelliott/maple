The purpose of this study was to evaluate zzso mechanics in obese subjects using zzso tracking zzso zzso 

63 obese individuals, including 28 who underwent zzso surgery for weight loss zzso 51 zzso 9 zzso and 35 managed conservatively zzso 43 zzso 7 zzso ) were zzso Changes in strain zzso and strain rate zzso measured by zzso Mean follow-up was 23 zzso 10 zzso 

The surgery group had a significant weight loss zzso 37 zzso 10 zzso , P zzso but no change was noted in the zzso group zzso 42 zzso 7 zzso , P zzso zzso For the surgery group, S and zzso in early zzso zzso improved significantly in the zzso left zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and right zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso whereas no changes were seen in zzso ejection fraction zzso In the zzso group, there was no change in zzso zzso or body zzso For all patients, weight changes correlated significantly with changes in zzso S zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

The improvement of S after zzso surgery suggests that weight loss could improve zzso performance, despite the lack of change in zzso
