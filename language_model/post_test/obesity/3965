zzso and depression are two major diseases which are associated with many other health problems such as hypertension, zzso diabetes zzso coronary heart disease, stroke, zzso zzso heart failure in patients with zzso hypertension, low bone mineral density and increased zzso Both diseases share common health complications but there are inconsistent findings concerning the relationship between obesity and zzso In this work we used the structural equation modeling zzso technique to examine the relation between body mass index zzso as a proxy for zzso and depression using the Canadian Community Health Survey, zzso zzso 

In this zzso model we zzso that 1) zzso and depression are directly zzso 2) zzso is directly affected by the physical activity and, zzso is directly influenced by zzso zzso was also used to assess the relation between zzso and depression separately for males and zzso 

The results indicate that higher zzso is associated with more severe form of zzso On the other hand, the more severe form of depression may result in less weight zzso However, the association between depression and zzso is gender zzso In zzso the higher zzso may result in a more severe form of depression while in females the relation may not be the zzso Also, there was a negative relationship between physical activity and zzso 

In general, use of zzso method showed that the two major diseases, obesity and depression, are associated but the form of the relation is different among males and zzso More research is necessary to further understand the complexity of the relationship between obesity and zzso It also demonstrated that zzso is a feasible technique for modeling the relation between obesity and zzso
