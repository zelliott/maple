The main objective of this study was to investigate the potential impact of body zzso zzso pollution on the zzso change in zzso induced by body weight zzso Fat mass zzso zzso mass zzso and sleeping zzso rate zzso were measured in obese individuals before and after a zzso zzso The measured values of zzso were then compared to those predicted from a reference equation established from zzso and zzso in control zzso Plasma zzso zzso total zzso and free zzso zzso were also measured in obese subjects before and after weight zzso After weight loss, the measured decrease in zzso was greater than that predicted by changes in zzso and zzso Increased plasma OC concentration was the factor explaining the greatest proportion of the difference between predicted and measured zzso changes induced by body weight zzso OC pollution seems to be a new factor affecting the control of zzso in some obese individuals experiencing body weight zzso
