We examined mechanisms leading to the impairment of zzso oxide zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso zzso in response to acutely administered zzso in rats with the zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso on blood pressure and NO and zzso in the zzso wall were studied in four groups of zzso zzso lean control, zzso obese, fed zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced by administration of zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso receiving zzso zzso in the drinking water for zzso zzso with slightly elevated zzso 

zzso effect of zzso on NO and zzso production in the zzso wall was impaired in obese and zzso groups but not in the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso effect of zzso was impaired in obese and zzso but not in the zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso of insulin zzso zzso zzso in the zzso wall, and this effect was impaired in obese and zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was abolished by zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas its effect on NO was zzso In addition, zzso zzso at zzso and zzso was enhanced in obese and zzso but not in zzso zzso 

These results indicate that: zzso long-term zzso zzso resistance to acute vascular zzso effect of zzso in zzso syndrome, zzso zzso stimulates zzso in zzso and zzso manner, and this effect is impaired in obesity due to excessive zzso zzso of zzso
