zzso obesity appears to be an emerging zzso affecting zzso outcome after abdominal zzso However, total visceral fat remains time consuming to zzso and there is still a lack of data about its value as an independent risk factor in zzso zzso 

The aim of this study was to validate the simple measurement of zzso fat surface as a surrogate of visceral zzso and to test the value of zzso fat surface as a risk factor for morbidity in zzso surgery and to compare it with the zzso value of other obesity parameters such as zzso and zzso zzso 

This is a prospective zzso cohort zzso 

The study was conducted at a zzso university zzso 

Two hundred zzso consecutive patients zzso zzso undergoing zzso zzso surgery with a mean age of zzso years zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

We assessed complications as the primary outcome zzso Secondary outcome measures were the conversion rates, duration of operation, and length of hospital zzso 

zzso fat surface was validated as a surrogate of visceral fat and a strong correlation between the 2 was confirmed zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso The overall zzso complication rate was zzso zzso with zzso moderate complications zzso I and zzso and zzso severe complications zzso zzso with a mortality rate of zzso zzso analysis confirmed zzso fat surface as an independent risk factor for zzso complications zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso ratio were not statistically associated with zzso complications zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

This study was limited by its sample zzso 

zzso fat surface is an excellent and zzso indicator of visceral fat zzso Furthermore, zzso fat surface is an independent risk factor for zzso outcome in zzso surgery that appears to be of higher zzso value than zzso and zzso zzso
