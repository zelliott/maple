It is not clear why some zzso women with zzso zzso syndrome zzso and obesity resume zzso and others remain zzso after weight zzso The objective of this study was to compare the changes in body fat distribution and specifically zzso fat zzso and subcutaneous abdominal fat zzso between a group of zzso women with zzso and obesity who resume zzso zzso to those who remain zzso zzso during a lifestyle zzso 

In a prospective pilot cohort study, zzso women with zzso underwent a 6 month lifestyle program in a zzso fertility zzso Body fat distribution was assessed by zzso zzso X-ray zzso zzso and single slice abdominal CT scan at zzso after 3 months and after 6 zzso zzso changes over time were zzso using generalized zzso equations zzso zzso zzso 

In 32 zzso women with zzso zzso 28 zzso 4 years; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso there were no significant baseline differences in zzso and zzso assessment between 14 zzso participants and 18 zzso zzso zzso women lost more weight zzso versus zzso and abdominal fat on zzso zzso versus zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso of zzso was associated with early and consistent loss of zzso zzso versus zzso at 3 months and zzso versus zzso at 6 zzso Loss of zzso between the zzso women and the zzso women was similar at 3 months zzso versus zzso but did not change any further in zzso women zzso as it did in zzso women zzso at 6 zzso 

In zzso women with zzso and obesity undergoing a lifestyle program, zzso women lose more body weight and abdominal fat on zzso than zzso zzso In addition, this study shows that early and consistent loss of zzso is associated with resumption of zzso Future studies should address the mechanisms behind these changes and should assess interventions aimed at loss of zzso to facilitate resumption of zzso
