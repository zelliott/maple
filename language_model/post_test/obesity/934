The zzso rat is a zzso strain that, if zzso for the zzso zzso is obese with a very zzso zzso zzso and is insulin zzso The male zzso rats develop zzso zzso of the major arteries and zzso zzso zzso and lean male rats were induced through mild food restriction to run zzso zzso 6,000 zzso from 6 zzso to 6 zzso of zzso Food zzso especially when coupled with running, lowered all classes of lipids in the whole serum of zzso zzso The principal changes in zzso zzso were in the very zzso zzso zzso Food restriction caused a significant drop in zzso insulin levels of zzso rats and decreased zzso zzso Both effects were more marked in the running zzso There was a significant decrease in zzso zzso frequency in the zzso zzso rats and an absence of zzso in the running zzso The results indicate that intensive physical activity can largely correct the zzso abnormalities and insulin resistance of this zzso strain, and these changes are associated with zzso of the disease zzso However, moderate food restriction has similar effects, and the greater effects seen with intensive running may simply reflect an effectively more severe zzso restriction in the presence of the zzso
