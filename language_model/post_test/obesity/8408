zzso increases the risk of death from many adverse health outcomes and has also been linked with cancer zzso The impact of obesity on outcomes of advanced zzso lung cancer patients is zzso 

The authors evaluated the association of body mass index zzso and outcomes in zzso eligible patients enrolled in three consecutive zzso trials conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology zzso zzso was zzso as zzso zzso zzso normal weight zzso zzso to zzso overweight zzso 25 to zzso and obese zzso zzso zzso In addition to analyzing overall and zzso survival, reasons for treatment zzso were also assessed by zzso zzso 

Of the patients zzso zzso were zzso zzso were normal weight, zzso of patients were classified as overweight, and zzso were zzso zzso hazards existed for obese patients relative to the other three groups of patients, with a change in overall survival hazard occurring at approximately 16 zzso In multivariable Cox models, obese patients had superior outcomes earlier on study compared with zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but later experienced increased hazard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating a time effect while undergoing zzso 

Data from these three trials suggest differential outcomes associated with zzso and additional studies of the mechanisms underlying this zzso as well as dietary and lifestyle interventions, are warranted to help zzso zzso
