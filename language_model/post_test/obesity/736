Since its identification as the zzso for zzso zzso drugs, zzso zzso zzso zzso has been the focus of pharmaceutical drug discovery programs directed toward finding better drugs for the treatment of diabetes, as well as the object of basic research aimed at understanding its role in the regulation of zzso We now understand a great deal about the crucial role that zzso plays in zzso differentiation and development, and are rapidly gaining knowledge about the role of the zzso in the regulation of zzso However, many crucial aspects of the molecular mechanism by which zzso of zzso activity affects insulin resistance and zzso zzso are still not clearly zzso Here the authors review the current status of zzso research, with an emphasis on its role in the causes and treatment of type 2 zzso
