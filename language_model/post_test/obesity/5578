Six lean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and seven overweight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso young men zzso years old) were studied to investigate the acute effect of a zzso meal on zzso levels and its relation to energy expenditure as well as to zzso zzso and fat zzso 

Study participants were given a zzso meal zzso as zzso zzso as carbohydrates and zzso as zzso covering zzso of their estimated daily energy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso free fatty acids and zzso levels were measured before meal intake and during the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, energy expenditure zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were measured in zzso and fed zzso 

zzso zzso was found to be positively correlated with circulating insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and body fat in zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso During the measured zzso period no statistically significant changes were found in zzso levels as compared with zzso values in either lean or overweight men, nor differences in zzso changes between both zzso After load zzso zzso zzso was lower in overweight individuals zzso zzso while no significant differences were observed in protein zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso associated with zzso zzso values, being significantly lower in the overweight as compared with lean men zzso zzso This study demonstrates that the acute zzso fuel zzso zzso is altered in overweight men with a lower zzso zzso and a strong zzso of zzso zzso which could be attributed to some zzso zzso 

These data also suggest that short-term zzso zzso responses may explain the long-term body zzso if they are sustained over long zzso
