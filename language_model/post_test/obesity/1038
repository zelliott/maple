zzso acid zzso is a zzso fatty acid zzso which zzso regulates zzso zzso Here we evaluate the ability of zzso to prevent zzso and genetically determined zzso and insulin zzso In zzso rats fed a high fat diet, zzso administration completely prevented zzso insulin resistance and zzso In genetically obese zzso zzso rats zzso treatment reduced the zzso zzso tissue mass and improved insulin zzso All three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were activated by zzso in the ranking order zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso target genes in zzso tissue was unaffected by zzso treatment, whereas the zzso expression of zzso genes zzso zzso involved in fatty acid zzso zzso and zzso was zzso This was accompanied by increased zzso zzso zzso and a decreased fatty zzso body ratio in zzso These findings indicate that zzso mechanisms play a pivotal role, but zzso the involvement of zzso pathways is zzso Taken together, our results suggest that a zzso increase in zzso fatty acid zzso and zzso drains fatty acids from blood and zzso zzso and that this contributes significantly to the beneficial effects of zzso on fat mass zzso and peripheral insulin zzso
