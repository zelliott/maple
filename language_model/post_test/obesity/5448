The zzso factor zzso has been implicated in resistance to zzso obesity and insulin zzso To investigate the possible role for zzso in obesity and related zzso we performed two association studies for obesity using unrelated zzso materials by zzso the zzso zzso zzso In the first study zzso obese and zzso zzso zzso subjects matched for age and zzso the zzso showed association with zzso odds ratio zzso zzso to zzso p zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso p zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was higher in carriers of the zzso and zzso zzso in normal weight zzso p value zzso zzso zzso but not in obese subjects zzso zzso zzso In the replication study zzso obese and 231 zzso zzso subjects with the zzso zzso exhibited an increased risk for zzso odds ratio zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso zzso carriers of the zzso had lower zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso levels zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with obese carriers of the zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso is a weak but consistent candidate gene for obesity and zzso
