Although there appears to be no outright benefit of zzso versus open surgery for acute zzso in the general population, it has been suggested that in obese patients a zzso approach may offer more conclusive zzso The aim of this pooled analysis of comparative studies was to evaluate clinical outcome following zzso and open zzso in the obese zzso 

A systematic literature search of zzso zzso Web of Science and the Cochrane Library databases was zzso zzso outcomes were length of operation zzso and length of hospital stay zzso Secondary outcomes were presence of zzso zzso wound and zzso zzso zzso mean differences were calculated to assess the size of the effect of zzso zzso on continuous variables and zzso odds ratio were calculated for discrete zzso 

zzso zzso were included in this analysis, zzso zzso and zzso open zzso Analysis of primary outcome measures revealed a shorter length of zzso stay associated with zzso zzso (weighted mean difference zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso There was no significant difference between the groups for length of operation, zzso zzso zzso or wound zzso 

The results of this pooled analysis indicate that zzso zzso may be beneficial in the obese population with a shorter length of hospital stay, and a similar zzso of zzso zzso
