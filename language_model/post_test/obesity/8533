Mice lacking zzso zzso 1 zzso a key zzso in zzso zzso have increased energy expenditure and therefore are resistant to zzso Because ambient temperature can significantly affect energy expenditure in mice, we undertook these studies to determine the effects of different ambient temperatures on energy zzso food zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso mice had increased energy expenditure irrespective of changes in the ambient zzso Although core temperature was normal, surface temperature was increased in zzso mice, most likely reflecting an active mechanism to zzso heat from increased zzso zzso mice had increased food intake at zzso and this zzso became more pronounced upon exposure to zzso When zzso in a cold environment, zzso mice developed hypothermia, which was associated with zzso These results suggest that the zzso in zzso mice is a secondary mechanism that compensates for the increased zzso of fuel zzso Our findings offer insights into the mechanisms of zzso and increased energy expenditure in a zzso model of obesity zzso
