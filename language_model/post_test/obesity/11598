The ability to predict prolonged length of stay zzso is essential to control escalating hospital zzso zzso mortality is a poor predictor of zzso morbidity as defined by hospitalization zzso 14 days after coronary artery bypass graft surgery zzso appears to be responsible for increasing zzso The purpose of this study was to measure zzso zzso indicators of increased LOS with an eventual plan to offer alternative cost-benefit therapeutic zzso 

Nine hundred zzso consecutive patients zzso zzso zzso undergoing zzso were zzso studied by means of the Cox zzso hazards zzso zzso zzso excluding death, were analyzed and zzso as to importance, and point totals were calculated for each zzso Scores were 12 for zzso heart failure and zzso balloon assist zzso 10, zzso 2; 6, zzso balloon assist device only; 5, zzso heart failure only; 3, zzso 6, zzso 75 years; 3, age zzso years; and 2, zzso zzso 

zzso index score directly correlated with an exponential increase in zzso These data substantiate the hypothesis that a mathematical model can predict LOS in zzso patients and may offer rational alternative strategies in delivering cost-effective health zzso
