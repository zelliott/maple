zzso tissue surrounding coronary arteries may contribute to the development of coronary zzso given its zzso and potential for local production of inflammatory zzso We compared various zzso for zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso and zzso fat using cardiac zzso Additionally, we estimated their relationship with obesity and zzso syndrome in patients suspected of coronary artery disease zzso 

EAT and zzso fat zzso were performed on cardiac zzso CT scans in 60 patients zzso zzso zzso referred for coronary zzso EAT was measured as thickness on the right zzso free wall, as area at the base of the zzso and as zzso zzso fat was assessed as thickness and zzso area surrounding the three main coronary zzso Linear zzso analysis was used to assess the relation of EAT and zzso fat with obesity and zzso syndrome zzso zzso 

zzso EAT zzso showed good zzso with low zzso of variation zzso varying between zzso and zzso zzso of EAT and zzso fat thickness and area were moderately zzso zzso zzso The amount of EAT and zzso fat zzso standard zzso was related with obesity zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of EAT using cardiac CT is highly zzso compared to more simple zzso as EAT and zzso fat thickness and zzso The quantity of EAT and zzso fat is related with the presence of obesity and zzso syndrome in patients suspected of zzso
