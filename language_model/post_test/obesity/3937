zzso drives the diabetes zzso However, it is not known which obesity index best explains variations in type 2 diabetes zzso prevalence across zzso 

We analyzed three zzso studies from San Antonio, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mexico City zzso zzso zzso and Spain zzso zzso zzso (age range, 35 to 64 zzso We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso to assess performance for identifying diabetic subjects and zzso zzso analysis to examine differences in diabetes zzso 

zzso for waist circumference and zzso were similar in white subjects, but the zzso for waist circumference was greater in zzso subjects zzso men, zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and women, zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Mexican-American men, zzso zzso zzso p zzso and women, zzso zzso zzso p zzso The zzso for zzso ratio tended to be greater than that for waist zzso but statistical significance was demonstrated only in Mexican women zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Mexican-American women zzso zzso zzso p zzso and Spanish women zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso No obesity index was consistently superior to the others for explaining differences in diabetes prevalence among zzso 

In white and zzso men, waist circumference may be the preferred marker for identifying diabetic subjects on account of its zzso in women, zzso ratio may be zzso zzso in diabetes prevalence among these populations cannot be attributed to a single measure of zzso
