There is little information on whether zzso zzso analysis zzso accurately predicts changes in body composition associated with energy zzso exercise, or zzso 

We had 2 zzso to determine the zzso of the zzso zzso system in 1) zzso body composition in obese and zzso women, with a zzso design, and 2) assessing changes in body composition in obese women in response to 12 zzso of energy zzso exercise training, or zzso 

zzso were 98 moderately obese women zzso zzso zzso body fat, zzso zzso zzso y of zzso and 27 zzso control subjects zzso zzso zzso body fat, zzso zzso zzso y of zzso zzso subjects were randomly divided into 1 of 4 groups, with zzso mass, fat mass, and percentage body fat estimated with zzso and underwater weighing before and after 12 zzso of zzso The 4 groups were diet only zzso zzso exercise only zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso of maximum heart zzso both exercise and diet, and control (no diet or zzso 

No significant difference was found between underwater weighing and zzso in zzso the zzso mass of the obese and zzso women (all subjects combined, r zzso zzso P zzso SEE zzso zzso zzso or in zzso decreases in fat mass during 12 zzso of energy zzso exercise, or both in obese subjects zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso system accurately assessed zzso mass in obese and zzso women, and changes in fat mass with diet alone or when combined with zzso
