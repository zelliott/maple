The action of zzso on human zzso zzso and subcutaneous zzso was zzso We also determined whether regional differences in the zzso were linked to variations in zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso effects of different zzso of zzso zzso zzso beta zzso beta 3- and alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso beta zzso and beta zzso zzso and selective beta zzso beta zzso and beta zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were studied in zzso isolated from the three zzso tissue regions in the same zzso In addition, the effect of the alpha zzso zzso zzso was studied on zzso zzso zzso 

Thirteen otherwise healthy obese subjects zzso zzso four zzso 

The zzso zzso response did not differ between zzso and zzso zzso but was 50% higher than in subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso sensitivity and intrinsic activity (in relation to zzso were higher in the two visceral fat cells than in the subcutaneous fat zzso The intrinsic activity of zzso increased close to that of zzso when zzso was added to the incubation zzso zzso sensitivity was five times higher in the two visceral fat cells than in the subcutaneous fat zzso For zzso zzso sensitivity and intrinsic activity did not differ between zzso and zzso zzso but was higher in these two regions when compared to subcutaneous zzso For zzso and zzso no significant regional differences were zzso 

beta zzso action is enhanced and alpha zzso action is decreased in both zzso and zzso zzso as compared to subcutaneous zzso However, the two visceral fat zzso show no difference in zzso zzso The difference in beta 3- and alpha zzso function might explain why zzso induced zzso is increased in the two visceral fat zzso as compared to the subcutaneous fat zzso
