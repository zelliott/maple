Despite the zzso effects of obesity on coronary heart disease zzso and heart failure, obesity is found to be paradoxically associated with improved survival in secondary care of zzso and heart zzso This zzso zzso is an area of active research, and it might be the result of an inaccurate working definition of zzso which is traditionally defined in terms of zzso We reviewed the recent literature on the paradox and examined different zzso zzso and their association with prognosis in cardiovascular zzso 

In zzso obesity is associated with improved prognosis when defined by high zzso and body fat, independent of zzso mass zzso High waist circumference seems to be associated with worse prognosis in some studies, but is associated with protection and an obesity paradox in those with poor zzso fitness zzso In patients with heart failure, zzso body fat and waist zzso and possibly zzso have been associated with improved zzso Despite these findings, intentional weight loss remains zzso In both zzso and heart failure, zzso seems to significantly impact the relationship between zzso and subsequent zzso and an obesity paradox is only present with low zzso 

Body zzso including waist zzso body fat and zzso have a role in clinical zzso zzso should be placed on improving zzso regardless of weight zzso zzso weight loss, particularly while maintaining zzso should be encouraged in obese zzso
