The effects of a high protein diet on insulin zzso and zzso metabolism have been quite zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of long-term zzso high animal protein intake on insulin zzso in zzso obese zzso 

After the experimental period (24 weeks), the high-fat zzso obese rats that were fed zzso zzso diets zzso had lower body weight gain zzso zzso and lower visceral fat zzso zzso than normal protein zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso was also reduced significantly zzso zzso as well as serum insulin levels at 5 zzso and 10 zzso by intravenous insulin releasing zzso In addition, insulin zzso and pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso protein expression were both markedly lower in zzso rats zzso zzso while zzso zzso in zzso rats had no difference from zzso zzso 

These results suggest that long-term zzso high animal protein intake reduces the acute insulin response in obese rats and the decrease of insulin is associated with both reduced weight gain and zzso of zzso zzso zzso might be a negative feedback for the balance of energy metabolism secondary to changes of body weight and visceral zzso
