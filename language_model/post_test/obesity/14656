The zzso diet zzso is an zzso therapy for medically zzso childhood zzso that also slows weight zzso We tested the hypothesis that the zzso slows weight gain via zzso involved in energy zzso We found that juvenile zzso fed a zzso had slower weight gain than those fed a standard diet zzso zzso fed a zzso had higher serum zzso levels and lower insulin levels compared with those fed an zzso We investigated the increase in zzso further because this change was the only one consistent with slower weight zzso Although rats fed the zzso experienced slower weight gain when calorie zzso they had serum zzso levels similar to those fed the zzso ad zzso Furthermore, zzso deficient zzso and zzso zzso deficient zzso mice did not show slower weight gain on the zzso All animals on the zzso had elevated serum zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso is insufficient and a functioning zzso signaling system appears necessary for the zzso to slow weight zzso The increase in zzso may contribute to the zzso effects of the zzso
