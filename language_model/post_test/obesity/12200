Adult female rats were adapted to a zzso self-selection regimen which allowed them ad zzso access to separate sources of zzso zzso and zzso The rats were then given either zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso knife cuts through the zzso zzso zzso or sham zzso and their zzso selection was studied for 60 zzso Following surgery the zzso zzso and zzso rats zzso and became obese compared with zzso The zzso of the three groups were similar, although the zzso group gained more weight than did the zzso and zzso zzso All groups zzso primarily by increasing their zzso zzso The zzso and zzso groups, in addition, increased their protein intake such that their percent protein intake remain zzso The zzso group failed to increase its absolute protein intake and thus decreased its percent protein zzso Except for a transient increase, fat consumption was not affected by the zzso or knife zzso During the 2nd zzso zzso zzso zzso the total caloric zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso groups returned to near normal zzso zzso with misplaced zzso zzso displayed minimal zzso and failed to zzso controls but yet showed the same altered zzso selection pattern as did rats with zzso zzso zzso zzso of resting insulin levels at the end of the experiment revealed zzso in the zzso and zzso groups but normal insulin values in the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso knife cuts produce similar zzso syndromes associated with zzso zzso but that they zzso affect protein selection and resting insulin zzso
