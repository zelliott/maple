The objective of the current study was to examine the potential impact of a C right zzso G substitution at position zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso promoter on obesity and estimates of insulin, zzso and zzso metabolism as well as circulating hormones, including zzso cortisol in zzso unrelated Swedish men born in zzso 

The subjects were zzso by using zzso amplification of the promoter region of the zzso gene followed by zzso with the restriction zzso zzso 

The zzso were zzso for zzso C and zzso for zzso zzso The observed zzso zzso were zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso had significantly zzso higher zzso cortisol levels after zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be significantly zzso higher in zzso than in zzso zzso The latter group had also a borderline significantly zzso higher mean zzso blood zzso These results were all adjusted for the potential zzso effect of body mass index zzso and zzso ratio zzso Other zzso such as zzso zzso abdominal zzso diameter, total testosterone, zzso growth factor I, serum zzso zzso insulin and serum lipids were not different across the zzso zzso zzso 

In conclusion, we have shown that an C zzso G zzso at position zzso of the zzso gene is associated with a zzso cortisol response to zzso elevated zzso levels and perhaps increased zzso blood zzso The zzso could involve an altered density of the zzso that zzso the zzso systems in those with genetic vulnerability in the zzso zzso gene zzso
