Major contributions to the understanding of human brain function have come from detailed clinical reports of responses evoked by electrical stimulation and specific brain regions during zzso procedures in awake zzso In this study, zzso evoked responses and zzso unit recordings were obtained zzso in 3 awake patients undergoing bilateral zzso of deep brain stimulation zzso in the lateral zzso The zzso evoked responses exhibited a clear anatomical zzso zzso was most reliably evoked by stimulation directed zzso within or adjacent to the zzso nucleus of the zzso zzso was most reliably evoked by stimulation directed at the center of the lateral zzso and zzso were most reliably evoked by stimulation at the border of the lateral zzso and zzso zzso Regarding the unit recordings, the firing rates of individual zzso did not have an anatomical distribution, but a small zzso of zzso located at the border of the lateral zzso and zzso zzso exhibited a fast rhythmically bursting behavior with an zzso frequency of zzso zzso and an zzso frequency of zzso zzso Based on animal studies, the lateral zzso area and surrounding zzso zzso are zzso involved with a variety of zzso zzso and sensory zzso The lateral zzso is situated to play a dynamic and complex role in human behavior and this report further shows that to be zzso In addition, this report should serve as a valuable resource for future zzso work in which accurate targeting within this region is zzso
