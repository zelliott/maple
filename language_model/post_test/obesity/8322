The zzso zzso zzso gamma 2 zzso gene has been zzso studied with relation to obesity and zzso zzso Indeed, a large number of studies assessing the association between the zzso zzso zzso zzso and body mass index zzso have been published with some controversial zzso In this zzso the effects of zzso zzso of the zzso gene on zzso were zzso 

zzso published data were collected and we included our own novel data from a study in the elderly participants zzso zzso of a Mediterranean zzso the zzso zzso zzso de zzso Project zzso zzso zzso A total of 75 independent studies with zzso subjects zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso carrier subjects of the Ala zzso were zzso 

The zzso revealed a higher zzso with an overall zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso for zzso carriers of the Ala zzso of the zzso gene in comparison to zzso The analysis also showed that there was zzso zzso for zzso zzso but funnel plots did not suggest apparent publication zzso Furthermore, the association between the zzso zzso of the zzso gene and increased zzso was stronger in zzso Thus, carriers of the Ala zzso had significantly higher zzso than zzso in a zzso of zzso Caucasian male subjects zzso mean difference zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso P for zzso zzso zzso 

This updated zzso showed that carriers of the zzso zzso of the zzso gene had a higher average zzso
