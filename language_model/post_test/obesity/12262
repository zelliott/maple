zzso characterized by increased mass of zzso tissue leads to systemic zzso zzso restriction zzso improves parameters associated with immune response and zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso with a high fat diet zzso regulates local and systemic inflammation and zzso stress damage in a high fat diet induced obesity zzso zzso We investigated effect of zzso on inflammation and zzso stress-related markers in liver and zzso zzso as well as zzso in zzso zzso lowered liver zzso levels, total cholesterol levels, and the plasma zzso ratio to normal levels and improved zzso zzso zzso also improved fatty liver and zzso zzso size and zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso and decreased the expression levels of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso factor, and zzso zzso in the zzso Moreover, zzso suppressed the expression levels of zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso tissue in the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may have beneficial effects on inflammation and zzso stress as well as zzso profiles in the zzso diet induced zzso Moreover, zzso may be a good way to increase compliance in obese patients and to prevent obesity induced complications without changes in dietary zzso
