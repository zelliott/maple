To determine if individuals who are overall obese but have low zzso ratios have zzso zzso profiles, blood pressures, and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso 

The Manitoba Heart Health zzso surveyed a representative sample of residents of the Canadian province of zzso 

zzso total of zzso adults aged 18 to 74 years were zzso zzso of whom underwent clinical zzso 

Blood pressure, zzso plasma zzso total cholesterol, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were compared across categories of body mass index zzso and zzso ratio zzso 

zzso with zzso obesity tend to occupy positions between those of the zzso and the centrally obese in terms of the effect on blood pressure, plasma zzso and zzso In multiple linear zzso models involving age, zzso and zzso as independent variables and one of the zzso variables as dependent zzso both zzso and zzso are significant independent zzso of most zzso zzso Where both are zzso zzso tends to be the stronger zzso with a larger standardized zzso zzso 

zzso obesity is not metabolically zzso zzso as an overall measure of obesity is as important as, and sometimes more important than, zzso in predicting zzso zzso The recognition of the zzso significance of the zzso as a zzso measure of obesity should not divert attention from the zzso risk status of zzso obese individuals who require continued health education to reduce zzso
