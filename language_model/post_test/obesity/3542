zzso tissue zzso of obese mice and humans accumulates immune cells, which zzso zzso that can promote insulin zzso AT zzso zzso are thought to originate from zzso zzso which zzso the tissue from the zzso Here, we show that a major fraction of zzso unexpectedly undergo cell division locally within zzso as detected by zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso within the visceral AT zzso but not those in other zzso (including liver and zzso displayed increased proliferation in zzso zzso depletion of blood zzso had no impact on zzso content, whereas their proliferation in zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso protein 1 zzso induced zzso cell division in AT zzso whereas zzso zzso in zzso decreased zzso zzso These results reveal that, in addition to blood zzso zzso in zzso proliferation driven by zzso is an important process by which zzso accumulate in the zzso in zzso
