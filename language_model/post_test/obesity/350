Previous studies have suggested that zzso zzso and zzso may be linked with a higher risk for obesity or with increased zzso measures of zzso We selected zzso in these candidate genes based on their prior associations with obesity risk or obesity zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso were zzso by zzso zzso in a Belgian sample of zzso obese subjects zzso mass index zzso 30 zzso and 323 lean controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso waist zzso and zzso ratio zzso were assessed by standard methods while a computerized zzso was used to measure visceral zzso subcutaneous zzso and total zzso abdominal fat zzso zzso of the rare zzso was not significantly different between cases and controls for the three zzso that were tested, while only zzso was associated with zzso in obese zzso Our data thus indicate that zzso zzso and zzso are not major contributing factors for zzso
