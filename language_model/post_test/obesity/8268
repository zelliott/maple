To detail recent developments linking modifiable youth risk factors with zzso markers of cardiovascular disease such as carotid artery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and large artery zzso zzso artery zzso zzso left zzso zzso and coronary artery zzso in zzso 

zzso data from prospective cohort studies beginning in youth with follow-up into adulthood have shown that the modifiable youth risk factors of elevated blood zzso blood pressure, and zzso smoking zzso and zzso zzso disorders, physical zzso low zzso zzso and diet associate with zzso markers of cardiovascular disease in zzso The data suggest that, in some instances, those who amend their trajectory by not maintaining these risk factors into adulthood experience reductions in zzso markers to levels associated with never having had the risk zzso 

Though avoidance of risk factors in youth is ideal, there is still a window for intervention where long-lasting cardiovascular effects might be zzso zzso changes in the rates of active and passive smoking, zzso increased physical activity, zzso zzso modified diet, and socioeconomic position in the transition from youth to adulthood might be important in zzso an zzso trajectory from high risk in youth to low risk in zzso
