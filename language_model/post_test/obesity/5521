We investigate the effectiveness of a community-based zzso program for reducing blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors in sedentary Japanese middle-aged zzso Among an initial cohort of 210 middle-aged sedentary women, 195 subjects completed a community-based zzso zzso program for reducing cardiovascular risk zzso Blood pressure, body weight and the serum zzso profile were measured both at baseline and at the end of the zzso zzso zzso The program consisted of mild zzso exercise and a mild zzso zzso After the zzso program, both zzso and zzso blood pressure were significantly reduced, especially in subjects who were zzso at zzso zzso changes in body weight and the serum zzso profile were also found after the zzso zzso Multiple linear zzso analysis revealed that, in obese subjects, the decrease in zzso blood pressure was correlated with both the initial zzso blood pressure and the change in estimated maximum oxygen zzso In addition, the decrease in zzso blood pressure was correlated with the initial zzso blood pressure and the change in body zzso On the other hand, in non-obese subjects, the decrease in blood pressure was correlated with the initial blood pressure and the change in salt zzso A community-based zzso program that consisted of mild zzso exercise and a mild zzso diet was considered to be practically effective for reducing multiple cardiovascular risk zzso zzso who already have one or more mild cardiovascular risk factors still could be good candidates for a community-based zzso zzso
