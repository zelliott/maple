To investigate the association between regional fat mass zzso and insulin resistance and zzso in obese women and zzso 

Body composition was measured by zzso X-ray zzso zzso in 109 obese women and 113 obese zzso zzso resistance was measured by zzso insulin sensitivity was estimated by zzso clearance rate zzso and insulin zzso by zzso zzso lipids were zzso 

In women, leg zzso was zzso zzso associated with zzso and zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso was positively zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso ratio was zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso and zzso zzso positively zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso No associations were found in zzso In women, multiple zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso zzso ratio was the only explanatory zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but zzso status was also of importance zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso has a zzso influence on insulin resistance and zzso in obese women, but not demonstrated in this cohort of obese zzso
