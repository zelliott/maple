To determine the effects of obesity on zzso plasma zzso levels and assess the effects of feeding on plasma zzso and zzso gene expression in subcutaneous zzso tissue in zzso zzso 

Blood and subcutaneous zzso tissue needle biopsy samples were obtained after an overnight fast and 1, 2 and 3 h following a mixed meal zzso zzso 

zzso female zzso eight lean with a mean age of zzso zzso zzso zzso and mean body mass index of zzso zzso zzso zzso and ten obese subjects with a mean age of zzso zzso zzso zzso and body mass index of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Apart from obesity the only significant difference between groups was a zzso fold higher zzso plasma zzso concentration in obese subjects compared to leans zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso levels were not significantly higher in the obese zzso Plasma zzso correlated with zzso and visceral fat weight in lean subjects zzso No significant association between plasma zzso and zzso was evident in obese zzso In addition, there was no association between plasma zzso and the zzso zzso ratio (an index of insulin zzso Following a mixed zzso zzso plasma insulin levels were significantly increased, with a zzso significant reduction in plasma zzso levels in both zzso Despite the large increase in plasma insulin, there were no zzso changes in either plasma zzso zzso or subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso zzso levels in either lean or obese zzso 

The data indicate that plasma zzso levels are correlated with the degree of zzso especially in lean subjects, and confirm that circulating zzso levels are greater in obese subjects than lean zzso The present study also failed to show a significant association between plasma zzso and insulin sensitivity in lean and obese zzso Furthermore, plasma zzso and subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso gene expression are not under short term regulation following feeding in zzso lean or obese female zzso
