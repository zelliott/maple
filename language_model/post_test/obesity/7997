In a conventional survival analysis of a sample of the zzso population in zzso the association between mortality and obesity is compared with the analogous risk from the presence of an obese person in a zzso The two factors have similar risk profiles, with a hazard ratio of zzso for zzso obesity and zzso for zzso familial obesity in one zzso If zzso zzso cannot directly affect personal zzso and if shared factors determine both personal and familial zzso the mortality risk of family and actual personal obesity is similarly zzso This false positive in the estimated risk arises from correlations among obesity and zzso zzso zzso or genetic zzso
