zzso of lung zzso is known to influence the extent of zzso and exercise intolerance among patients with chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso with similar degrees of airway zzso Lung volume components are consistently affected by body mass index zzso in health and in zzso 

To explore the complex interactions between zzso lung zzso zzso and exercise performance in zzso 

We compared zzso intensity ratings and zzso responses zzso pattern, operating lung volumes, and gas zzso during zzso incremental cycle exercise in zzso groups of 18 obese zzso zzso zzso zzso 35 zzso 4 zzso and 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 22 zzso 2 zzso patients with moderate to severe zzso 

Groups were well matched for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso capacity zzso zzso but resting lung zzso zzso lung volume zzso was significantly reduced in association with increasing zzso zzso zzso In the obese patients, peak zzso oxygen zzso was increased zzso zzso and zzso ratings at a standardized ventilation were decreased zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso Ratings of zzso intensity at a standardized ventilation during exercise correlated well with the concurrent dynamic zzso lung capacity (TLC) ratio zzso zzso zzso P zzso and with the resting zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso 

The combined mechanical effects of obesity and COPD reduced operating lung volumes at rest and throughout exercise with favorable influences on zzso perception and peak oxygen zzso during cycle zzso
