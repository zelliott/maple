Evidence regarding the relative contributions of physical activity zzso and driving behavior on weight status is zzso This study examined the associations between driving and PA behavior and weight status among Canadian zzso 

A random zzso of zzso adults zzso zzso zzso completed a zzso and a self-administered zzso Weekly physical activity time, daily driving time, zzso motor vehicle access, and demographic characteristics were zzso zzso zzso was used to estimate associations between driving minutes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso motor vehicle access, sufficient PA (210 zzso of zzso PA or 90 zzso of zzso zzso and the likelihood of being 1) zzso zzso healthy weight and 2) obese only zzso zzso 

Compared with driving zzso 209 zzso driving 840 to zzso zzso significantly zzso zzso increased the likelihood of being zzso zzso zzso Insufficient PA was positively associated with being zzso zzso zzso Each zzso of driving was associated with a zzso reduction in the odds of achieving sufficient zzso A zzso increase zzso zzso in the likelihood of overweight was found among insufficiently active individuals who drove 210 to zzso zzso compared with sufficiently active individuals who drove zzso 209 zzso 

zzso that decrease driving time and increase PA participation may be important for reducing weight among Canadian zzso
