To estimate whether body mass index zzso affects the evaluation of zzso zzso or the zzso bone during zzso ultrasound examination for zzso risk zzso 

Six hundred zzso women with singleton zzso undergoing zzso zzso zzso ultrasound examinations were zzso Weight categories were defined as normal zzso mass index zzso less than zzso overweight zzso and obese (at or above zzso zzso zzso for trend, Student zzso test, one-way analysis of zzso and zzso correlation were used for statistical analysis where appropriate to estimate the effect of zzso on zzso ultrasound zzso zzso was considered statistically zzso 

zzso zzso was significantly associated with an inadequate zzso assessment zzso compared with zzso zzso increased ultrasound examination time zzso minutes compared with zzso minutes, zzso and an increased need to perform a zzso ultrasound examination zzso compared with zzso zzso Prior abdominal surgery was not significantly associated with zzso assessment zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso the need to perform zzso ultrasound examination zzso compared with zzso zzso or longer examination time zzso minutes compared with zzso minutes, zzso 

In singleton zzso increased zzso is not associated with zzso zzso of zzso translucency, but it is associated with a longer time to perform the zzso ultrasound examination for zzso risk assessment, increased need for zzso ultrasound examination for zzso zzso and a lower likelihood of obtaining an adequate zzso zzso Previous abdominal surgery did not affect the ability to zzso the zzso zzso
