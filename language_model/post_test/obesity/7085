zzso is associated with an impaired immune response, an increased zzso to bacterial infection, and a chronic increase in zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso However, few studies have examined the effect of obesity on the immune response to viral zzso Because infection with influenza is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, we investigated the effect of obesity on early immune responses to influenza virus zzso zzso obese and lean control zzso mice were infected with influenza zzso and lung pathology and immune responses were examined at d 0 zzso 3, and 6, zzso Following infection, zzso obese mice had a significantly higher mortality rate than the lean controls and elevated lung zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso production in the lungs of the infected mice was markedly different between obese and lean zzso zzso and beta were only minimally expressed in the infected lungs of obese mice and there was a notable delay in expression of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Additionally, obese mice had a substantial reduction in zzso cell zzso These data indicate that obesity zzso the ability of the immune system to appropriately respond to influenza infection and suggests that obesity may lead to increased morbidity and mortality from viral zzso
