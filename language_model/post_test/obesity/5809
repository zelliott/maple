The aim of this study was to measure serum zzso zzso in women with zzso zzso syndrome zzso and to assess possible correlations between zzso and the hormonal or zzso parameters of this zzso 

zzso zzso levels were evaluated in 20 women with zzso and 22 women without zzso whose age and body mass index zzso matched the zzso The levels of zzso blood zzso zzso insulin, zzso and sex steroid hormones were evaluated in both zzso The zzso model assessment zzso score was also zzso The serum zzso levels were zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso levels were significantly lower in obese women than in zzso women, and they were also significantly lower in zzso patients with zzso scores greater than zzso compared with those with zzso scores lower than zzso When the subjects were divided in two groups based on serum zzso levels zzso 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso of patients with zzso were included in the lower zzso group zzso zzso In addition, zzso levels were increased, dependent on the zzso levels in women with zzso 

zzso is regarded as a possible link between zzso and insulin resistance zzso From this data, the zzso of zzso are implicated in the levels of zzso in women with zzso It is suggested that zzso may play an important role in the zzso of zzso
