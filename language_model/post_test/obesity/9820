This study compares waist circumference zzso measured using the World Health Organization zzso and National Institutes of Health zzso protocols to determine if the results differ significantly, and whether equations can be developed to allow comparison between zzso taken at the two different measurement zzso 

zzso zzso zzso using the WHO and zzso protocols were obtained for zzso respondents aged 3 to 79 from zzso 2 of the Canadian Health zzso zzso Linear zzso was used to identify factors associated with the difference between the zzso and WHO zzso Separate prediction equations by sex were generated using zzso zzso as the outcome and zzso and age as independent zzso zzso and specificity were calculated to examine whether health risk based on the zzso and on zzso predicted zzso agreed with estimates based on zzso actual measured zzso 

For adults and children, zzso significantly exceeded zzso zzso zzso for boys, zzso zzso for girls, zzso zzso for men and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso values were statistically similar to measured zzso zzso zzso to zzso and specificity zzso to zzso values for health risk category based on the zzso predicted values were very high, meaning that respondents would be appropriately classified when compared with actual measured zzso 

The prediction equations proposed in this study can be applied to historical zzso to compare estimates based on zzso data measured using the WHO and zzso zzso
