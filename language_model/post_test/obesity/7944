To determine the ability of air displacement zzso zzso to predict visceral zzso tissue zzso volume in zzso 

Fifty-five zzso zzso zzso white children 13 to 14 years old were zzso zzso measures were collected for body mass, zzso zzso and zzso ratio zzso and body fat percentage was estimated from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis, and zzso zzso volume was determined using magnetic resonance imaging, using a multiple slice protocol at levels zzso to zzso 

Boys had significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso less zzso volume than girls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso explained the greatest proportion of the zzso in zzso volume compared with the other zzso zzso Multiple zzso analysis indicated that zzso volume was best predicted by zzso body fat percentage in boys zzso zzso zzso zzso of the estimate zzso zzso zzso SEE zzso of variation zzso zzso and by zzso and zzso in girls zzso zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso SEE zzso of variation zzso zzso 

Compared with the other zzso measures, zzso explains the greatest proportion of the zzso in zzso volume in children 13 to 14 years zzso For boys, zzso is the tool of choice to predict zzso volume, yet using the more simply collected measures of zzso and zzso is recommended for zzso However, large zzso of the estimates zzso suggesting that if precision is needed, there is no surrogate for direct imaging of zzso
