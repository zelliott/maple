Numerous studies have shown zzso major gene inheritance of body mass index zzso in white zzso few have examined the inheritance of zzso in the African-American population where obesity is more zzso nor in African populations where obesity is comparatively zzso To evaluate the inheritance of obesity in two different populations of African origin, we used segregation analysis to determine the transmission of zzso in 95 African-American families and 400 Nigerian zzso zzso were selected from participants in the zzso International Collaborative Study on zzso in zzso Using class D zzso models, results from the segregation analysis of the African-American data showed evidence of a major gene effect on zzso The Nigerian results were zzso similar, with comparable estimates for the zzso zzso and means and strong evidence for a major effect in the transmission of zzso The high zzso zzso frequency estimate of zzso is consistent with estimates in other studies, but the mode of transmission appeared zzso which differs from studies involving predominantly white zzso In the Nigerian analysis, however, the probability of a high zzso zzso parent zzso a low zzso zzso to zzso offspring was significantly different from the zzso expectation of zero zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that additional complexities exist in the major gene inheritance of zzso in this zzso The strong similarity of the zzso zzso and means obtained from the African-American and Nigerian samples suggests that a common zzso major gene effect may contribute to the variation in zzso in both zzso
