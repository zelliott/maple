Recent studies have demonstrated the restoration of a normal 24 h zzso profile induced by a reduction of zzso after weight loss, suggesting a zzso relationship between plasma insulin and zzso zzso We aimed to clarify if an zzso reduction in plasma insulin could affect zzso zzso in zzso 

We have studied the insulin response to an oral zzso tolerance test zzso and the zzso response to zzso before and after prolonged treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plasma levels and the zzso zzso ratio were also zzso 

Twelve obese women zzso zzso zzso Body mass index zzso zzso zzso and six lean normal women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was determined by the zzso zzso insulin, zzso zzso and zzso were zzso by the zzso zzso For zzso comparison between zzso and zzso we have considered zzso zzso the zzso weight of zzso zzso are expressed as mean zzso zzso 

We observed a significant decrease in zzso concentration of both insulin zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso No modifications in the insulin zzso response to the zzso were zzso A significant increase of the zzso zzso peak response zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso zzso 151 vs zzso zzso 339 zzso zzso P zzso was found after zzso zzso A negative correlation was found between zzso insulin and zzso peak values, both before zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and after zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso No modifications were found in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso affected neither the insulin response to zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso ratio in a group of six lean zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced the zzso response to zzso when expressed as both peak and zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso insulin zzso and zzso the zzso response to zzso in obese zzso In the absence of modifications in zzso and zzso plasma levels and their zzso ratio, we propose that insulin may exert a negative feedback on zzso zzso
