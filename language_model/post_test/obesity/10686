The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been associated with zzso zzso There is no data on the effect of zzso in South African children or zzso 

To investigate the role of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in obesity and other components of the zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso 

Sixty four obese and 64 lean mixed ancestry zzso 

Western zzso South zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso is independently associated with obesity in children of mixed ancestry from South zzso 

The T zzso frequency of the zzso differed significantly between obese and controls, zzso and increased the risk of being obese, p zzso zzso Furthermore, the estimated effect of the T zzso was an increase of zzso zzso in waist zzso zzso zzso in weight and a corresponding zzso zzso in zzso zzso carrying both the zzso and the T zzso of zzso were more associated with obesity zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso whilst those carrying the C zzso of zzso in the presence of zzso were likely to be lean with odds ratio of obesity zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso zzso may contribute to different zzso zzso all of which are associated with insulin resistance in mixed ancestry children of South zzso However, a larger study is required to confirm findings of this zzso
