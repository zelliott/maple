zzso are commonly prescribed to avert cardiovascular disease in zzso Little information, however, exists about the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso treatment on zzso 

Our objective was to evaluate the influence of zzso therapy on body mass index zzso zzso zzso and zzso mortality risk in zzso 

We gathered prospective zzso data from Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in Washington, DC, and Palo Alto, California, on type 2 diabetic male veterans zzso zzso zzso mean age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso who underwent an exercise tolerance test during the period of 1986 to zzso 

There were zzso deaths during a mean follow-up period of zzso years zzso 826 zzso with an average annual mortality of zzso events per 1000 zzso of zzso zzso Cox zzso hazard analysis revealed that mortality risk was zzso lower zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso for individuals treated with statins compared with those not on zzso There was a paradoxical zzso association, with the highest mortality in those with a zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso compared with obese subjects zzso of zzso zzso However, this paradoxical association was evident only in those not treated with statins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso vs those on statins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso When zzso therapy and fitness status were combined, mortality risk was zzso higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso not treated with statins compared with the zzso treated with zzso zzso risk declined progressively with increased fitness to zzso lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the most highly fit individuals zzso zzso zzso treated and not treated with zzso zzso 

zzso therapy was associated with increased survival in diabetic veterans, which was further enhanced when fitness and zzso therapy were zzso In addition, zzso therapy eliminated the increased mortality risk associated with zzso zzso zzso The presence of a paradoxical zzso risk association, which is modulated by zzso therapy has novel clinically relevant zzso
