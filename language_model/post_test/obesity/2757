zzso play a key role in the energy metabolism in skeletal zzso A new concept has emerged suggesting that impaired zzso zzso capacity in skeletal muscle may be the underlying zzso that causes insulin zzso According to current knowledge, the causes and the underlying molecular mechanisms at the origin of decreased zzso zzso capacity in skeletal muscle still remain to be zzso The present review focuses on recent data investigating these issues in the area of zzso disorders and describes the potential causes, mechanisms and consequences of zzso dysfunction in the skeletal zzso
