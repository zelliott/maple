To investigate the association between maternal body mass index zzso and zzso ultrasound detection of zzso zzso 

zzso register zzso 

North of England zzso 

All zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with a zzso anomaly notified to the Northern zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso Cases with zzso and zzso anomalies zzso zzso zzso or without information on zzso scanning zzso zzso 4) were zzso 

zzso odds ratios zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso for zzso detection according to maternal zzso categories were estimated using zzso zzso 

For all anomalies combined, cases were defined as zzso if any zzso anomaly was suspected zzso zzso zzso anomalies were defined as detected if an anomaly of the correct system was zzso 

zzso detection of any anomaly occurred in zzso of zzso zzso cases with normal zzso The odds of detection were significantly decreased in obese zzso zzso 30 zzso women compared with women of recommended zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso system anomalies were suspected zzso in 109 of 945 zzso zzso The odds of detecting a cardiovascular anomaly were significantly greater in zzso women zzso zzso zzso than in women of recommended zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was no association between zzso and detection in any other organ system or between zzso and termination of pregnancy for fetal zzso 

zzso ultrasound detection of a zzso anomaly is decreased in obese pregnant zzso This has implications for the scanning and zzso of obese zzso
