zzso is a severe complication of coronary artery bypass graft surgery zzso The purpose of the present study was to determine zzso and zzso variables that predict zzso and to determine the impact of this complication on long-term zzso 

Data on 20 zzso and zzso variables were collected zzso on zzso consecutive patients who underwent zzso between January 1987 and January zzso zzso patients zzso developed zzso zzso and a total of 24 patients zzso zzso zzso analysis identified 4 of the 20 variables as highly significant independent zzso for the development of zzso obesity zzso zzso zzso New York Heart Association zzso heart failure class zzso zzso zzso previous heart surgery zzso zzso zzso and duration of zzso bypass zzso zzso zzso A comprehensive review of the literature identified 13 other studies that evaluated 48 factors as zzso of zzso these data were critically analyzed and compared with the results from this zzso In this series, zzso zzso mortality during the first 90 days after surgery for the patients with zzso was zzso compared with zzso for the patients without zzso zzso mortality between 1 and 2 years after surgery remained high for the zzso group zzso relative to the zzso group zzso These differences were not eliminated by adjusting for important variables that influenced late survival in this zzso 

The present study and a review of the literature suggest that obesity and duration of surgery are the most important zzso of zzso Furthermore, although the early increase in mortality has been well zzso the present study documents for the first time that zzso has a significant negative influence on long-term survival independent of the patient's zzso zzso
