zzso X-ray zzso zzso has become a common measurement of human body zzso However, obese subjects have been zzso largely due to weight and scan area zzso Newer zzso instruments allow for heavier subjects to be supported by the zzso zzso but the imaging area is still smaller than the body size of some obese zzso In this study, we determined the zzso of an automated zzso methodology by comparing to the standard zzso scans in a cohort of obese zzso zzso subjects whose zzso zzso completed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The resulting scans were analyzed in three ways: the standard zzso zzso total body estimated from the left side, and from the right zzso Fat mass, zzso lean mass, bone mineral content zzso and percent fat derived from each half scan were compared to the zzso zzso Total fat mass, zzso lean mass, or percent fat was comparable for the zzso scans, left, and right side scans zzso within individuals zzso for the zzso The zzso estimate using the right side scan was slightly but statistically higher than the zzso zzso zzso 30 g or zzso zzso while the left side scan zzso estimate was lower than the zzso zzso by the same zzso No significant magnitude bias was found for any of the composition zzso We conclude that the new zzso zzso analysis in obese subjects appears to be closely comparable to zzso analysis for fat mass, zzso lean mass, and percent zzso
