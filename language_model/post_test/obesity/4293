The combined effect of blood pressure zzso and body weight on risk of kidney disease has not been previously zzso To improve risk zzso in zzso individuals zzso zzso 120 to zzso to 89 zzso zzso we examined the interaction between zzso and body weight on the risk of zzso zzso disease or chronic kidney disease zzso zzso 

zzso cohort zzso 

zzso adults participating in the first Health Study in zzso zzso participation zzso were linked to the Norwegian Renal zzso and zzso of Death zzso 

zzso and body weight were measured by using standard procedures, and other relevant zzso were obtained from an extensive zzso 

zzso ratios for treated zzso zzso disease and zzso death were zzso 

Mean zzso zzso and body mass index zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso had treated hypertension at zzso zzso During a median follow-up of 21 years zzso zzso zzso men zzso and 319 women zzso initiated zzso replacement therapy zzso zzso zzso or died of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso risk of these kidney outcomes increased continuously with no lower threshold for zzso The risk associated with body weight started to increase from a zzso of zzso zzso In participants with zzso less than zzso zzso zzso risk did not increase with increasing zzso In zzso participants, zzso adjusted hazard ratios in the zzso categories zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso or greater were zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso 59 to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso compared with zzso less than zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso to zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso risks in zzso participants were zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso respectively zzso zzso for zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were not zzso zzso a secondary analysis was performed that excluded all individuals who experienced outcomes in the 5 years after the study zzso 

Participants with zzso are not at increased risk of serious kidney outcomes if zzso is less than zzso zzso However, the risk of kidney disease increases substantially if zzso is present in obese zzso
