zzso nutrition during the period of early organ development can zzso the zzso ability to zzso excess fat as young adults when exposed to an zzso zzso This study examined the hypothesis that exposing offspring to zzso restriction zzso with early zzso would result in zzso and zzso adaptations that subsequently lead to increased zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso sheep were fed either 50 or zzso of total zzso energy requirements from 30 to 80 days gestation and zzso zzso At zzso offspring were made obese, and at zzso year of age zzso were zzso zzso zzso and molecular zzso of zzso zzso metabolism and zzso function were zzso Although zzso zzso zzso was not affected by obesity per se, it was nearly doubled in obese offspring born to zzso zzso This adaptation was accompanied by elevated gene expression for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso which may be indicative of changes in the rate of zzso fatty acid zzso In contrast, maternal diet had no influence on the zzso effect of obesity on gene expression for a range of proteins involved in zzso metabolism and energy balance including zzso zzso receptors and zzso protein zzso Similarly, although gene expressions for the insulin and zzso receptors were suppressed by obesity they were not influenced by the prenatal nutritional zzso In conclusion, excess zzso zzso zzso with juvenile obesity is promoted by zzso nutrition zzso with early development of the fetal zzso
