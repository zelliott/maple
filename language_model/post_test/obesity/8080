This study was conducted to determine the mechanisms implicated in the beneficial effects of apple zzso zzso against zzso obesity in zzso rats, described in a previous study from our zzso zzso of high-fat zzso diet with zzso prevented zzso increase by zzso of zzso zzso zzso supplemented with zzso exhibited improved zzso tolerance while zzso isolated from these rats showed an enhanced zzso response to zzso zzso intake led to reduced zzso zzso and zzso regulatory element binding zzso factor 1 zzso zzso levels and increased zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso binding protein 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso 1 alpha zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso In addition, we found different zzso patterns of zzso zzso zzso and zzso promoters in zzso from zzso rats compared to high-fat zzso fed zzso The administration of zzso protects against body weight gain and fat deposition and improves zzso tolerance in zzso We propose that zzso exerts the zzso effects through the regulation of genes involved in zzso zzso and fatty acid zzso in a process that could be zzso in part by zzso zzso
