zzso zzso by protein zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso modification in the regulation of protein zzso zzso contains a highly zzso zzso zzso binding domain, but the zzso function of zzso with respect to zzso is zzso The zzso zzso is proposed to be regulated through direct zzso zzso of zzso zzso factors, and zzso signaling is known to be required for zzso regulation of energy zzso 

To identify the potential role of zzso zzso zzso by zzso in the regulation of zzso signaling and energy zzso 

We identified that zzso mice are zzso lean, and have significantly reduced serum zzso zzso This lean zzso is accompanied by resistance to zzso obesity and an increased sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso in zzso zzso where it binds and zzso zzso through its zzso binding zzso In zzso studies further clarified that the zzso binding domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in decreased zzso and prolonged zzso zzso of zzso zzso which was associated with increased expression of zzso zzso following zzso zzso 

These data zzso a molecular zzso that directly links zzso zzso of zzso by zzso to the regulation of zzso zzso suggesting a potential role for zzso antagonism in the treatment of obesity and zzso zzso
