To ascertain the risk of acute zzso zzso invasive cardiac procedures, and mortality among patients with newly diagnosed angina over five zzso 

zzso cohort study of patients with primary care data linked to secondary care and mortality zzso 

40 primary care practices in zzso 

1785 patients with a diagnosis of angina as their first manifestation of zzso heart disease, 1 January 1998 to 31 December zzso 

zzso hazard ratios for acute zzso zzso coronary artery bypass zzso zzso zzso coronary zzso death from zzso heart disease, and all cause zzso adjusted for zzso lifestyle risk factors, and zzso at cohort zzso 

Mean age was zzso zzso zzso Male sex was associated with an increased risk of acute zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso death from zzso heart disease zzso zzso to zzso and all cause mortality zzso zzso to zzso zzso age was associated with acute zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso per year of age zzso death from zzso heart disease zzso zzso to zzso per year of age zzso and all cause mortality zzso zzso to zzso per year of age zzso Smoking was associated with subsequent acute zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso death from zzso heart disease zzso zzso to zzso and all cause mortality zzso zzso to zzso zzso was associated with death from zzso heart disease zzso zzso to zzso and all cause mortality zzso zzso to zzso Previous stroke was associated with all cause mortality zzso zzso to zzso and chronic kidney disease with death from zzso heart disease zzso zzso to zzso Men were more likely than women to have coronary artery bypass zzso or zzso zzso coronary zzso after a diagnosis of zzso older people were less likely to receive zzso zzso coronary zzso Acute zzso zzso after a diagnosis of angina was associated with an increased risk of death from zzso heart disease and all cause mortality zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso Neither of the invasive cardiac procedures significantly reduced the subsequent risk of all cause zzso 

In this sample of people with incident angina from primary care, there were sex differences in survival and age and sex differences in the provision of zzso after a zzso Acute zzso zzso after a diagnosis of angina was strongly zzso of zzso To zzso adverse zzso optimal preventive treatments should be used in patients with zzso
