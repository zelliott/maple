At 24 and 32 weeks of gestation in 47 relatively overweight zzso zzso pregnant women serum zzso of zzso were zzso zzso zzso sensitivity and lipids were measured at 24 zzso 

zzso levels at 24 weeks, but not at 32 weeks, were significantly higher in women with subsequent zzso zzso factors at 24 weeks did not correlate with zzso zzso 

This preliminary study suggests that in the second zzso zzso levels are higher in women with subsequent zzso
