The pattern of zzso insulin zzso over a zzso period, which included three mixed meals, was evaluated in 14 normal volunteers and 15 obese zzso zzso zzso rates were calculated from plasma zzso levels using individually derived zzso kinetic parameters and a validated open zzso model of peripheral zzso zzso zzso zzso rates were consistently elevated in the obese subjects under zzso conditions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the 4 h after breakfast zzso zzso 15 zzso 63 zzso 5 zzso zzso P less than zzso lunch zzso zzso 16 zzso 67 zzso 5 zzso zzso P less than zzso and dinner (145 zzso 18 zzso 65 zzso 6 zzso zzso P less than zzso In the normal subjects, zzso insulin zzso represented 50 zzso zzso of total zzso insulin production, insulin zzso returned to baseline between meals, and equal quantities of insulin were zzso in the 4 h after breakfast, lunch, and dinner, despite the fact that subjects consumed half the number of calories at breakfast compared to lunch and zzso zzso zzso responses were also similar after the three zzso In contrast, the pattern of insulin zzso in obese subjects was largely normal, albeit set at a higher zzso However, the insulin zzso rate after meals did not return to zzso and the zzso rate immediately before lunch zzso zzso zzso zzso and dinner zzso zzso zzso zzso was considerably higher than the zzso rate immediately before breakfast zzso zzso zzso zzso In these overweight subjects, the zzso response after lunch was lower than after zzso Analysis of individual zzso insulin zzso profiles in the normal subjects revealed that insulin zzso was zzso On average zzso zzso zzso zzso were produced in each zzso zzso The most prevalent zzso distribution of zzso zzso zzso was two zzso after breakfast and three zzso after both lunch and zzso zzso zzso was also zzso during the period without meal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred during the period of overnight sampling and in the zzso period before zzso of the breakfast zzso In the obese subjects, the number and timing of zzso zzso was similar to those of normal volunteers, although the zzso of the zzso was significantly zzso In both groups of subjects, greater than zzso of insulin zzso were zzso with a pulse in zzso concentration in the zzso zzso The zzso rate was significantly lower in the zzso without the meal zzso averaging zzso in both zzso Thus in zzso although zzso of insulin can be zzso the zzso pattern of zzso i s largely zzso which suggests that the functioning beta cell mass is zzso but normal regulatory mechanisms influencing zzso are still zzso
