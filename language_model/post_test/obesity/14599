To investigate the level changes of zzso factors and zzso hormones and their relationship between obese and normal zzso 

The zzso of zzso zzso insulin, testosterone zzso zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso as well as zzso stimulating hormone zzso in blood were measured respectively in 78 cases of 13 years old obesity children and 84 normal children as a control group by the means of zzso zzso The bone ages were evaluated with zzso age standard of hundred percent zzso 

The zzso and insulin zzso were significantly higher in obesity children as compared with the control group zzso zzso The zzso of plasma zzso were significantly lower in obesity children as compared with the control group zzso zzso The zzso of T were significantly lower in obesity boys as compared with the control group zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso were significantly higher in obesity girls as compared with the control group zzso zzso The bone age of the obese children was significantly older than that of the control zzso Along with the bone age of children became older, the concentration of zzso and zzso in blood were significantly zzso There was a positive correlation between zzso and zzso in two groups of either boys and girls and so did between zzso and insulin, zzso zzso zzso zzso In the group of normal boys, the positive correlations between zzso zzso and zzso were shown zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and a negative correlations between zzso and T were shown zzso r zzso zzso P zzso a positive correlation between zzso and zzso was also shown as zzso zzso zzso P zzso In the control group of girls, there were positive correlations between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso Any correlations between zzso zzso T and zzso were not shown in the two obese groups of boys and zzso 

The zzso zzso insulin, zzso zzso and zzso zzso had been changed significantly in blood among those obesity children, and so as their zzso The high level of zzso in obesity children may change the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and affect the development of zzso
