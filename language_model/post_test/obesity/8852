zzso of intramuscular zzso zzso zzso zzso has previously in animal and human models been suggested to play an important role in zzso induced insulin zzso The aim of this study was to examine whether zzso established from type 2 diabetic zzso subjects and lean controls express differences in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso under zzso conditions and during chronic exposure to zzso zzso and zzso acids zzso zzso acute insulin zzso No significant differences were found between diabetic and control zzso neither in the total amount nor among individual zzso species during zzso and acute insulin zzso zzso accumulated during exposure to zzso acid but not during exposure to zzso zzso During PA and zzso exposure, only zzso zzso and total zzso zzso PA exposure increased the zzso whereas zzso was reduced and vice versa during zzso zzso No differences were found in the zzso level between zzso and control subjects, neither in the total amount nor in the individual specific zzso species during fatty acid zzso zzso (24 zzso high zzso but not zzso exposure induced insulin resistance at the level of zzso synthesis in control zzso These results indicate that zzso no primary defects are responsible for zzso zzso in diabetic zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso are partly zzso to changes in the PA level and possibly other saturated fatty zzso and zzso PA induced insulin resistance may be zzso through an increased level of zzso
