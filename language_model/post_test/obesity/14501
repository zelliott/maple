zzso a protein hormone zzso by zzso plays an important role in energy zzso and regulation of body zzso We previously observed that acute feed restriction resulted in a rapid decline in zzso of zzso in obese pony zzso This acute response prompted us to characterize the zzso changes in zzso of zzso zzso and insulin in obese pony zzso during the transition between fed and zzso zzso Nine obese pony zzso of mixed zzso previously maintained on zzso zzso were randomly allotted to 2 zzso zzso consisted of a zzso feed zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso feed restriction zzso zzso zzso zzso or 48 h of alfalfa hay ad zzso a zzso feed zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Blood samples were taken every 15 zzso during restriction and feeding transitions zzso to zzso on d 2 and zzso and every 30 zzso thereafter until zzso of the following days zzso 3 and zzso In the zzso treatment, plasma zzso of zzso declined zzso 6 h after the removal of feed zzso by treatment zzso P zzso and remained low and unresponsive to zzso Similarly, in the zzso group, plasma zzso of zzso were initially low, and did not respond to feeding during the second zzso sampling zzso After feed restriction in each of the 2 treatment zzso plasma insulin decreased and zzso mean zzso pulse frequency, pulse zzso and area under the curve increased zzso zzso zzso reversed these effects on insulin and zzso These data provide evidence that peripheral zzso of insulin and zzso are zzso responsive to feed removal zzso in zzso increase in zzso and replacement zzso in zzso decrease in zzso whereas zzso decreases in response to feed restriction but is slow to recover from a transient nutritional zzso
