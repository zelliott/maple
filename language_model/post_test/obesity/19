The aim of this investigation was to compare the contributions of the zzso of the brown zzso tissue zzso and of its environment to the obesity of the zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso BAT from lean or obese mice were transplanted to a site underneath the kidney capsule of recipient lean or obese zzso The zzso were left in place for 6 to 12 weeks and then examined by zzso methods by electron zzso to examine the zzso of the zzso and by zzso zzso to examine the zzso zzso of the zzso When lean BAT was grafted into obese mice, or when obese BAT was grafted into lean mice, kept at ambient temperatures, the characteristics of the donor BAT zzso zzso zzso size, zzso zzso and zzso zzso transformed zzso but not completely, towards those of BAT in the host zzso However, if lean mice containing obese BAT zzso were zzso at 4 degrees C or obese mice containing lean BAT zzso were zzso at 33 degrees C, the characteristics of the donor BAT transformed completely towards those of the BAT in the host zzso This complete transformation occurred even if the host mice were returned to 23 degrees C after the period of temperature zzso Fluorescent zzso observations indicated that the sympathetic zzso of BAT zzso was only indistinguishable from that of the lean or obese host BAT when the mice received a period of temperature zzso zzso for lean zzso warm for obese zzso We conclude that BAT zzso from lean mice can assume the typical characteristics of BAT in obese hosts and that BAT zzso from obese mice can assume the typical characteristics of BAT in lean hosts provided that both the sympathetic zzso and the zzso of the zzso is the same as in the zzso zzso properties of BAT in genetically obese mice are therefore unlikely to be of paramount importance in determining the obesity of the zzso zzso Our results support the conclusions of other workers in implicating the low activity of the sympathetic zzso of BAT as being zzso important in causing the reduction of zzso zzso
