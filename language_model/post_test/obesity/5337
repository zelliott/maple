zzso zzso zzso rats lack the zzso zzso zzso whereas their lean zzso counterparts bear a fully functional zzso By using zzso and zzso rats, we studied whether the zzso is involved in zzso zzso fever and zzso The body temperature responses to zzso (10 or 100 zzso zzso were measured in zzso rats exposed to a zzso zzso degrees zzso or cool zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso of both zzso responded to zzso with fever at 28 degrees C and with zzso zzso at 22 degrees zzso The fever responses of the zzso and zzso rats were zzso The zzso response of the zzso rats was markedly prolonged compared with that of the zzso zzso The prolonged zzso response to zzso in the zzso rats was accompanied by enhanced zzso signaling in the zzso and an exaggerated rise in the plasma concentration of tumor necrosis factor zzso The zzso rats did not respond to zzso with an increase in the plasma concentration of zzso or zzso hormone, whereas their zzso counterparts zzso The zzso response to zzso zzso zzso zzso was markedly prolonged in the zzso zzso These data show that the zzso is essential for the recovery from zzso zzso zzso mechanisms of the recovery from zzso zzso include zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of both the production and zzso action of zzso and suppression of inflammatory (via zzso signaling in the zzso
