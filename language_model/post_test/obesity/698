zzso zzso is generally considered to play a key role in the zzso zzso 

To examine the relationship between directly measured visceral zzso and the risk for incident hypertension, independent of other zzso zzso and zzso plasma insulin zzso 

zzso prospective cohort study with zzso to 11-year zzso 

King County, zzso 

300 Japanese Americans with a zzso blood pressure less than 140 zzso zzso and a zzso blood pressure less than 90 zzso zzso who were not taking zzso medications, oral zzso medications, or insulin at study zzso 

zzso zzso and thigh fat areas were measured by using zzso zzso Total subcutaneous fat area was calculated as the sum of these fat areas excluding the zzso fat zzso zzso during follow-up was defined as having a zzso blood pressure of 140 zzso zzso or greater, having a zzso blood pressure of 90 zzso zzso or greater, or taking zzso zzso 

There were 92 incident cases of hypertension during the follow-up zzso The zzso fat area was associated with an increased risk for zzso zzso odds ratios of hypertension for zzso of zzso fat area (1 zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for zzso 3 and zzso zzso zzso to zzso for zzso 4 compared with zzso 1 after adjustment for age, sex, zzso plasma insulin level, zzso plasma zzso level, body mass index, zzso blood pressure, alcohol consumption, smoking status, and energy expenditure through exercise zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso The zzso fat area remained a significant risk factor for hypertension, even after adjustment for total subcutaneous fat area, abdominal subcutaneous fat area, or waist zzso however, no measure of these fat areas was associated with risk for hypertension in models that contained the zzso fat zzso 

It is not known whether these results pertain to other ethnic zzso 

Greater visceral zzso increases the risk for hypertension in Japanese zzso
