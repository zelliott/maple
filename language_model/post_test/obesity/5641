Many acquired risk factors may be identified to avoid the scholarly nature of these zzso lists, they may be reclassified with respect to their originality or their mechanism of action and those of current interest, whose data is still often hypothetical but recent, can be zzso The following order may be zzso risk factors which cannot be zzso age (which remains the principal zzso and gender zzso being at higher risk than zzso true acquired risk factors such as cancer, zzso conditions (more specifically, the zzso zzso and hormone replacement therapy zzso zzso which has been updated by the debate about zzso generation zzso and the risk related to zzso substances zzso hormone replacement therapy of the menopause which still has no clinical trials to assess zzso forms with natural hormones administered zzso or zzso Smoking has also been accused of being a risk factor for zzso zzso in the latest clinical zzso zzso factors increase the risk of zzso this is established for zzso still suspected for zzso the abnormalities being the result of complex zzso zzso Other zzso conditions zzso zzso zzso responsible for zzso zzso are not clearly related to increased zzso zzso risk although a preventive effect of statins zzso another I) has just been zzso zzso to these zzso factors, the origin of which, genetic or zzso is difficult to zzso interest has recently been shown in quantitative and functional changes in blood zzso zzso This has been established for zzso disease for zzso but, in addition to this factor which slightly increases the risk of zzso zzso increases of factor VIII independent of inflammatory conditions, of blood group and Von zzso factor, which all influence the level of factor VIII, an increase by zzso of the normal increases the risk of zzso zzso disease by 3 or 4 zzso As for factor VIII, increases in factor IX, factor zzso and resistance to activated C protein zzso of the zzso zzso on the gene for factor zzso are also associated in increased zzso zzso zzso Without knowing into which category to zzso them, previous personal and family history of zzso disease, in the absence of the already mentioned zzso risk factors, must be zzso Finally, amongst the acquired risk factors, the authors also list conditions of blood stasis and vascular zzso with or without zzso zzso prolonged hospital zzso cardiac failure, paralysis, zzso Of these acquired conditions which increase the risk of zzso zzso particular attention has been given over the last few years to forced zzso in uncomfortable positions as in certain forms of zzso Although clinical reports have zzso results, it would seem that the risk is increased and the benefits of supportive elastic stockings have been zzso If the acquired risk is identified and zzso for a patient, it allows evaluation of global risk and the installation of appropriate therapeutic zzso
