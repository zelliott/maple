To substantially increase zzso treatment and effective control of the zzso syndrome zzso and its zzso 

This is a pilot best practice zzso enhancement zzso to reduce the estimated cardiovascular disease zzso risk in 628 zzso patients with or without diabetes or zzso by improving quality of zzso A baseline visit was followed by action to improve adherence to lifestyle advice and drug treatment for zzso risk factors by physicians specifically trained to implement zzso Finally, after 6 months, a zzso form was completed, showing if patients were at zzso risk factor zzso If not, there was an analysis of the reason zzso 

The zzso was effective in improving zzso of evidence-based treatment in 628 zzso zzso There was a substantially greater patient perception of zzso an enhancement in compliance with lifestyle advice and increased prescription of evidence-based medication, leading to a zzso zzso zzso improvement in estimated zzso zzso There was a substantial increase in the number of subjects on target for specific zzso risk zzso 

This is the first study to increase adherence to multiple interventions for all zzso components on an zzso basis, in both primary care and teaching hospital zzso zzso and patient education, distribution of printed guidelines and zzso and completion of a zzso form motivated both physicians and patients to achieve multiple zzso risk factor zzso zzso The absence of a control group is a limitation of this zzso Further work is also needed to establish if the improvements observed are sustained on a long-term zzso
