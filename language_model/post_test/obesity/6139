The present study tested whether children born at high risk zzso compared with low risk zzso for obesity are more likely to have a waist circumference zzso associated with cardiovascular disease risk factors zzso and tested whether zzso status tracks over zzso 

This prospective cohort study involved 71 children, three to eight years, who were divided into two groups, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso based upon maternal zzso body mass index zzso zzso subjects were subdivided into zzso zzso zzso and zzso overweight zzso groups, based on zzso or zzso zzso Children were classified as having or not having a zzso at each year, using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed zzso 

Although zzso children had a significantly greater mean zzso than zzso children at years 5-8 zzso zzso these differences became zzso after adjusting for zzso zzso were more likely to have a zzso status zzso zzso zzso zzso at age 4 years zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 years zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 years zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 years zzso zzso zzso zzso to 8 years zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso and zzso Although zzso of the children tracked zzso status, higher proportions of zzso children zzso zzso into having a zzso compared with zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso were more likely to have or develop a zzso Although the effects of obesity risk on zzso may be secondary to zzso clinically assessing zzso in zzso children may help identify youth at risk for zzso zzso
