Although zzso zzso zzso has been shown to improve the zzso zzso its mode of action is poorly zzso In this study, a zzso ethanol extract of zzso zzso was identified as a potent zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso binding analysis and zzso reporter zzso In cultured primary human skeletal muscle cells, treatment of zzso increased expression of two important zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso and several genes acting in zzso zzso and energy zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso fatty acid zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso obese mice model further indicated that administration of zzso attenuated zzso obesity through the zzso of fatty acid zzso in skeletal zzso These results suggest that a zzso ethanol extract of zzso may have a role as a new functional food material for the prevention and/or treatment of zzso and zzso
