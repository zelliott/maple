The zzso of zzso fatty liver disease zzso and zzso syndrome zzso are very high in obese children, and insulin resistance may be the key point linking them zzso zzso still remain as to whether zzso could be a component of zzso Some researchers reported that zzso was a composition of zzso while the others stated that zzso was an independent predicting factor of zzso Here we analyzed the prevalence of zzso and zzso in 308 obese children who came to our zzso department from June 2003 to September 2006, and we also evaluated the relationship between zzso and zzso in this group of obese zzso 

zzso 308 obese children aged from 9 to 14 years with mean age of zzso zzso zzso years were zzso Two hundred and thirty one were zzso and 77 were zzso Body mass index zzso waist circumference zzso zzso zzso liver zzso ultrasound examination, oral zzso tolerance test zzso and insulin releasing test were performed for all of the zzso The zzso of zzso including simple zzso fatty liver zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso were zzso Three zzso were selected according to the diagnostic criteria: Group 1: zzso zzso children without liver zzso Group zzso zzso and Group zzso zzso The prevalence of zzso components of zzso free insulin, whole body insulin sensitivity index zzso zzso model of insulin resistance zzso were compared among these three zzso 

zzso Among all the obese children, the prevalence of zzso zzso NASH and zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Among all the zzso children, the prevalence of zzso was zzso zzso The prevalence of zzso was zzso zzso in zzso group and zzso zzso in NASH group, which was significantly higher than that of zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso but no significant difference was found between zzso group and NASH group zzso zzso Moreover, there were significantly higher zzso in NASH group concerning every component of zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with that of zzso zzso The zzso of hypertension in zzso was significantly higher than that of zzso zzso And the zzso of zzso was markedly increased in NASH group compared with zzso zzso zzso group had higher free insulin and more severe zzso compared with that of zzso zzso When zzso developed to zzso and zzso free insulin and zzso deteriorated calculated by zzso and zzso However there was no significant difference between zzso and zzso children concerning free insulin and zzso 

The prevalence of zzso and zzso hits high in obese zzso The prevalence of zzso was very high among children with zzso and zzso and zzso shared the common mechanism of zzso The higher prevalence of zzso and higher zzso of zzso components were tightly associated with the development of zzso and severity of zzso
