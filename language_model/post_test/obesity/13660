zzso evidence indicates that abdominal zzso is positively related to cardiovascular disease zzso risk and some other diseases independently of overall zzso However, the association of premature death resulting from these diseases with abdominal zzso has not been widely zzso and findings are zzso 

In a prospective cohort study of zzso women in the zzso Health zzso associations of abdominal zzso with zzso and zzso mortality were zzso During 16 years of zzso zzso deaths were identified, including zzso cardiovascular deaths and zzso cancer zzso After adjustment for body mass index and potential zzso the relative risks across the lowest to the highest waist circumference zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for cancer mortality (all zzso for zzso Among zzso women zzso mass index, zzso to zzso zzso abdominal obesity was significantly associated with elevated zzso zzso Relative risk associated with waist zzso or zzso 88 zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and for zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso After adjustment for waist zzso hip circumference was significantly and zzso associated with zzso zzso 

zzso measures of abdominal zzso were strongly and positively associated with zzso zzso and cancer mortality independently of body mass zzso zzso waist circumference was associated with significantly increased zzso mortality even among zzso zzso
