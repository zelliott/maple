We have recently zzso a new series of zzso derivatives with the aim to discover novel zzso zzso agents characterized by zzso activity comparable to that of zzso but with reduced adverse effects such as anxiety and zzso Within the novel class, the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been selected as lead zzso We found that zzso is a zzso neutral zzso characterized by poor zzso barrier zzso Moreover, zzso chronic treatment determined both zzso effect and cardiovascular risk factor improvement in zzso Diet zzso zzso zzso mice fed with fat diet zzso zzso In fact, the zzso gene expression in Central zzso System zzso and peripheral zzso by real time zzso showed a significant increase of zzso peptides and a decrease of zzso peptides zzso by zzso treatment, compared to control mice fed with the same zzso Moreover, in contrast to zzso treatment, the chronic administration of zzso did not change zzso expression of both zzso zzso and zzso highly related with anxiety and mood zzso Our results suggest that zzso reduces body weight and it can restore the disrupted expression profile of genes linked to the zzso circuit without altering zzso transmission probably avoiding zzso side zzso Therefore the novel zzso neutral zzso could represent a useful candidate agent for the treatment of obesity and its zzso zzso
