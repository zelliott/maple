Mouse studies suggest that zzso a zzso hormone, is required for zzso zzso and prevention of zzso insulin zzso Whether obesity and insulin resistance are associated with low plasma zzso levels in humans is not zzso 

Our objective was to investigate the hypothesis that obesity and indicators of insulin resistance are associated with low zzso levels and determine whether weight loss regulates zzso zzso 

Plasma was obtained from 85 female zzso zzso zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso and 45 male (age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso volunteers for other clinical zzso The impact of zzso gastric bypass was investigated in 19 obese females zzso zzso zzso using samples collected at baseline and zzso months after zzso 

zzso levels correlate zzso with zzso zzso zzso and age zzso zzso zzso zzso levels are higher in males zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso than females zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In all subjects, lower zzso zzso levels were observed in overweight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This effect was gender specific zzso zzso zzso and was observed in males zzso Aging and diagnosis with two or more zzso syndrome risk factors was associated with low zzso levels, irrespective of zzso zzso zzso increased after zzso gastric zzso zzso 3 months after surgery zzso 

Although males exhibit higher zzso levels that are reduced by zzso aging and markers of insulin resistance are associated with low plasma zzso irrespective of zzso
