The purpose of this study was to determine the ability of air displacement zzso zzso to estimate percentage of fat mass zzso in African American zzso zzso was determined in 21 boys and 13 girls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso six published zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were done within 2 h of one another, in random zzso Regardless of zzso zzso was significantly correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso all p zzso zzso using the equation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso agreed most closely with zzso zzso zzso zzso difference p zzso zzso Together, surface area artifact and bone mineral content per unit of zzso zzso mass accounted for zzso of the zzso in the residual between zzso The correlation between zzso and zzso was not significant for those zzso zzso zzso zzso 10; zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso There was a trend toward zzso zzso zzso in girls zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso but not in boys zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso lung volume was zzso higher than measured lung volume zzso zzso zzso determined using predicted lung volume was zzso zzso zzso higher than that using measured lung volume zzso zzso and higher than zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that in zzso to zzso African American children and provided lung volume is measured, zzso using zzso with zzso equation zzso that obtained by zzso Body composition results determined by zzso in children zzso zzso should be interpreted with zzso
