A previous zzso study showed an association of the zzso gene 2 zzso gene with zzso Additionally, experimental investigations in animals and cell culture provided evidence that this gene might be involved in zzso and free fatty acid zzso zzso zzso the aim of this study was to examine the association between the zzso zzso near the zzso gene and zzso and to extend it to other quantitative measures of zzso as well as parameters of zzso and zzso zzso 

We zzso zzso in a group of severely obese white patients zzso zzso zzso with an average zzso of zzso zzso and a control group zzso zzso zzso from Utah, as well as in the zzso zzso Prevention Program in zzso at High Individual zzso zzso study from Austria, which is based on a healthy working population zzso zzso zzso 

We observed no difference in the zzso frequency of zzso of zzso between obese subjects and zzso controls from zzso Furthermore, we did not find evidence of an association with measures of body composition zzso zzso zzso ratio, percentage body fat, amount of visceral and subcutaneous abdominal zzso zzso or zzso metabolism zzso cholesterol, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cholesterol, zzso and zzso in the Utah study population or in the independent zzso zzso 

Our results do not support an association of the zzso gene with the regulation of body weight or parameters related to zzso zzso
