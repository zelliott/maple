To compare insulin sensitivity and pancreatic zzso function measured by the zzso and the zzso zzso with simple estimates of insulin sensitivity and pancreatic zzso function in zzso Study design We measured insulin sensitivity with a zzso clamp and zzso and zzso insulin zzso with a zzso clamp in 156 AA and white zzso Estimates of insulin sensitivity zzso insulin level zzso the ratio of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso model assessment estimate of insulin sensitivity zzso zzso and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index zzso and estimates of pancreatic zzso function zzso the ratio of zzso to zzso zzso and zzso model assessment estimate of pancreatic zzso function zzso zzso were derived from zzso zzso 

In the total group, zzso correlated strongly with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso IS zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso insulin zzso correlated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso estimates of insulin sensitivity and pancreatic zzso function using zzso insulin and zzso levels serve as surrogate measures of insulin sensitivity and zzso in zzso zzso The zzso of these conclusions in children with impaired zzso tolerance and type 2 diabetes zzso remains to be zzso
