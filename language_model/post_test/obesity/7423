To compare the effects of zzso plus zzso or zzso on zzso and zzso parameters in zzso zzso zzso patients with zzso 

Thirty participants received a zzso diet and were zzso to zzso combination of zzso (10 zzso with zzso zzso zzso 3 times a day with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso (20 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso variables were assessed at baseline and 3 months zzso Similar reductions in body weight, body mass index, and waist circumference were recorded in both groups zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso group and zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso group, P zzso vs baseline for zzso zzso zzso cholesterol zzso levels decreased in both treatment groups, but this reduction tended to be more pronounced in the zzso group zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso vs baseline for zzso zzso tended to decrease more in the zzso compared with the zzso group zzso vs zzso P zzso vs baseline for zzso zzso zzso cholesterol zzso levels tended to decrease in zzso group, but remained zzso with zzso zzso zzso B levels were equally reduced in both treatment zzso 

For similar body weight reduction, the combination of zzso with zzso may be more efficient in zzso zzso whereas the combination of zzso with zzso may be more potent in terms of improving zzso and zzso
