To investigate the consequences of longstanding obesity on left zzso mass and structure and to examine the effects of weight loss on these zzso 

Cross zzso survey and controlled intervention zzso 

City of zzso and surrounding zzso zzso 

41 obese patients treated with weight reducing gastric surgery, 31 obese patients treated zzso and 43 non-obese zzso 

Changes in left zzso mass and relative wall zzso 

zzso patients had higher blood pressure, greater left zzso mass, and increased relative wall thickness than did matched non-obese control zzso zzso subjects treated with gastric surgery had a substantial weight loss and a significant reduction in all variables when compared with conventionally treated obese zzso zzso and zzso analysis of pooled data from the two groups of obese subjects showed that changes in relative wall thickness and left zzso mass were more closely related to the change in weight than to the zzso change in blood zzso 

zzso heart abnormalities occurring in conjunction with obesity diminish after weight zzso The zzso in these structural aberrations is better predicted by the weight loss than by the accompanying reduction in blood zzso To prevent or improve abnormalities of heart structure in obese people, weight control should be the primary zzso it should be regarded as at least as important as regulating blood zzso
