Since the discovery of zzso a boom of scientific knowledge became available about the zzso gene and its role and significance in weight zzso Both from animal and human research data, serum zzso can probably be considered as one of the best biological markers to reflect total body fat, and this finding is true over a wide range of body mass indexes zzso and in different zzso in normal weight, zzso and obese zzso in non zzso diabetes zzso zzso patients, zzso women, zzso children and subjects with zzso and growth hormone zzso Gender differences clearly exist, probably related to sex hormone differences, and from fat distribution studies it could be shown that subcutaneous fat is much more related to serum zzso zzso than visceral zzso also zzso zzso zzso expression is significantly higher in subcutaneous fat from human obese zzso zzso is not only correlated to a series of zzso parameters such as insulin, zzso growth factor, zzso and zzso it seems involved as a zzso in some zzso mechanisms zzso of zzso insulin zzso zzso as zzso Weight loss will reduce human zzso zzso whereas the administration of human zzso zzso seems to show only limited zzso
