The zzso risk score estimates 10-year coronary heart disease zzso risk based on zzso age, smoking status, blood pressure, zzso zzso and diabetes zzso zzso It was designed to be independent of weight, and as such it is the ideal model to estimate the impact of zzso surgery on the change in this zzso Our study evaluates the effect of gastric bypass on the prevalence of zzso risk factors and then zzso the zzso risk score to estimate the zzso reduction in 10-year zzso zzso 

zzso 101 consecutive patients who underwent zzso zzso gastric bypass were zzso The 10-year zzso risk was calculated using zzso zzso and laboratory zzso 

The mean body mass index decreased from zzso zzso zzso zzso preoperatively to zzso zzso zzso zzso one year zzso All physical and zzso markers of cardiac risk improved zzso zzso blood pressure fell from 143 zzso 20 zzso to 123 zzso 18 zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure fell from 81 zzso 10 zzso to 71 zzso 11 zzso zzso Total cholesterol declined from 202 to 165 zzso zzso declined from 118 to 97 zzso and zzso increased from 45 to 51 zzso The overall 10-year zzso risk decreased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso representing an absolute risk reduction of zzso or relative risk reduction of zzso This risk reduction was similar in zzso based on zzso zzso risk or on initial zzso 

Using the zzso risk score we show that gastric bypass surgery reduces 10-year coronary risk by more than zzso Additionally, to the increasing evidence of the zzso effect gastric bypass surgery has on zzso risk, we contribute assessment of 10-year risk in subjects at stable weight loss and within the zzso zzso validated zzso
