zzso is a hormone regulating weight in the zzso zzso regulates food intake and zzso zzso zzso are increased in obese individuals suggesting resistance to its zzso However, there is considerable zzso in zzso levels at each level of zzso suggesting that environmental and genetic factors may regulate zzso zzso We examined whether subjects with decreased insulin sensitivity have increased zzso zzso 

We used a zzso to measure serum zzso levels and the zzso zzso clamp (with indirect zzso to measure insulin sensitivity in 87 zzso relatively lean zzso 

zzso levels were significantly correlated with zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso insulin area zzso zzso zzso overall zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso whole body zzso disposal (all zzso zzso After adjustment for body mass index, zzso levels remained significantly correlated with zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso insulin area zzso zzso zzso overall zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso whole body zzso disposal although the magnitude of the associations was considerably zzso zzso levels were significantly related to insulin sensitivity in both less obese and more obese zzso 

We conclude that zzso zzso are related to insulin resistance and insulin zzso in relatively lean zzso men and these associations are to some extent independent of body mass zzso Thus, subjects with insulin resistance may be relatively resistant to the effects of zzso
