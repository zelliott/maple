zzso diversion zzso restores normal zzso tolerance in a few weeks in zzso obese subjects with type 2 diabetes, improving insulin zzso However, there is less known about the effects of zzso on insulin zzso We tested the early effects of zzso on insulin zzso in obese subjects with and without type 2 zzso 

zzso consecutive zzso obese subjects, 9 with type 2 diabetes zzso and 12 with normal zzso zzso zzso were zzso just before and 1 month after zzso by measuring body weight zzso zzso zzso zzso model assessment of insulin resistance zzso acute insulin response zzso to zzso zzso and the zzso index adjusted for insulin resistance zzso 

zzso those with zzso differed from those with zzso in showing higher levels of zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and reduced adjusted zzso index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso One month following zzso in both groups zzso was reduced (by approximately zzso but all subjects were still severely zzso zzso and zzso decreased zzso while zzso weight zzso zzso and adjusted zzso index zzso In the zzso group, zzso zzso returned to zzso zzso zzso did not change in the zzso group, while in the zzso group it showed a significant increase (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso In the zzso group, the zzso percentage variation from baseline was significantly related to changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso suggesting an important relationship exists between impaired zzso and zzso 

zzso is able to restore zzso in zzso even just 1 month after zzso zzso restoration is associated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso
