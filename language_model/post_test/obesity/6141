Internet and computer use are increasingly common zzso sedentary behaviors, which have the potential to impact zzso on health zzso However, little is known about the extent to which adults' Internet and computer use is associated with weight status and time spent in zzso physical zzso 

The objective is to examine associations of zzso Internet and computer use with overweight and zzso zzso physical activity, and other sedentary zzso 

Participants zzso adults living in zzso zzso completed a zzso questionnaire including items on their height and weight, past seven day recall of zzso physical activity, Internet and computer use, and other zzso sedentary zzso zzso Internet and computer use was zzso into no use, low use (less than three hours per week), or high use (three hours or more per zzso 

Participants with low zzso Internet and computer use had the highest levels of educational zzso and zzso and engaged in less other sedentary behaviors when compared to participants with no or high Internet and computer zzso zzso zzso regression, adjusted for zzso age, zzso education, other sedentary behaviors and physical activity, determined that participants with a high zzso Internet and computer use were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso times more likely to be overweight zzso or zzso and zzso zzso and zzso times more likely zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso to be obese zzso or zzso zzso compared to those who reported no Internet and computer use in their zzso Adults with high zzso Internet and computer use were more likely to be overweight or obese even if they were highly active in their leisure time zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso as compared to participants who did not use the Internet or zzso zzso physical activity levels were largely independent of Internet and computer zzso 

These findings suggest that, apart from nutritional and physical activity interventions, it may also be necessary to decrease time spent in sedentary behaviors, such as zzso Internet and computer use, in order to reduce the prevalence of overweight and zzso Future Internet interventions to reduce weight or increase physical activity may need to differentiate between participants with different levels of Internet use in order to increase their zzso zzso studies are required to examine further the potential zzso relationships between the development of overweight and specific sedentary behaviors such as Internet and computer zzso
