The present study aimed to determine the effects of breed and sex on growth patterns and zzso features of zzso zzso exposed to the same environmental zzso Thus, at Day 62 of pregnancy, zzso zzso from an obese breed with zzso resistance zzso zzso were compared to lean zzso zzso zzso Large White zzso zzso zzso zzso There were differential zzso patterns in zzso with zzso resistance, mainly a higher relative weight of the brain resembling zzso zzso zzso of brain growth may be protective for the adequate growth and zzso survival of the zzso individuals, an ancient breed reared in extensive zzso conditions for zzso There were also clear sex-related differences in zzso development and metabolism in the zzso zzso Female zzso zzso were similar in size and weight to male zzso but had a significantly higher relative liver to body weight ratio resembling zzso zzso and a trend for a higher relative zzso to body zzso Moreover, the availability of zzso cholesterol and zzso in female zzso zzso was similar to that of lean zzso zzso Overall, these features may zzso a better zzso survival and development of zzso the sex more critical for the species zzso These findings set the basis for future zzso studies aimed at increasing the knowledge on the interaction between genetic and environmental factors in the early programming of the adult zzso
