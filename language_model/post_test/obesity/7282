zzso fatty liver disease zzso is a potentially progressive liver disease that culminates in zzso zzso occurs more often in individuals with zzso zzso zzso than in those with zzso zzso fatty liver zzso The difference between zzso and NASH is the extent of zzso zzso which is more extensive in zzso Because zzso of zzso cells activates zzso zzso cells zzso we examined the hypothesis that a zzso zzso zzso would reduce progression of zzso in a mouse model of zzso Male zzso mice were fed zzso zzso diets to induce NASH and liver zzso Mice were zzso once daily with either the zzso inhibitor zzso (6 zzso zzso zzso zzso or vehicle only and sacrificed at 4 or 8 zzso Treatment with an zzso diet increased zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso labeling zzso cells, zzso and zzso Treatment of zzso mice with zzso decreased active zzso zzso cells, and zzso content zzso zzso However, zzso levels were similar in zzso mice and zzso zzso zzso findings also confirmed that both groups had comparable liver injury zzso activity zzso Nevertheless, zzso zzso mice demonstrated decreased zzso muscle zzso expression (4 weeks, P zzso 8 weeks, P zzso and had reduced zzso levels of collagen zzso zzso zzso (8 weeks, P zzso zzso content and Sirius red zzso of zzso zzso confirmed decreases in zzso 

zzso zzso zzso suppresses the development of zzso in mice with zzso zzso effects on liver zzso were associated with reductions in zzso zzso but occurred without obvious improvement in liver zzso These findings are consistent with evidence that zzso triggers zzso zzso and liver zzso and suggest that zzso zzso may be useful as an zzso NASH zzso
