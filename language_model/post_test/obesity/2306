zzso zzso zzso zzso which are involved with reward and zzso are modulated by hormones that regulate food intake zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that these hormones are associated with deficits in zzso signaling in zzso 

We assessed the relationships between zzso levels of insulin and zzso and zzso zzso and insulin sensitivity index zzso with the availability of central zzso type 2 zzso zzso We measured zzso availability using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that competes with zzso zzso in lean zzso zzso 8) and obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hormones were collected prior to scanning and zzso was determined by modified oral zzso tolerance zzso 

zzso image analyses revealed associations between each zzso measure and zzso The most extensive findings were negative associations of AG with clusters involving the zzso and inferior zzso zzso Regional zzso analyses also found extensive negative relationships between AG and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso amygdala, and zzso zzso zzso was zzso associated with zzso in the zzso while insulin was zzso In the zzso zzso and zzso were positively associated with zzso zzso The direction of associations of zzso and AG with zzso availability are consistent with their opposite effects on zzso levels zzso and zzso zzso After adjusting for zzso AG maintained a significant relationship in the zzso We zzso that the increased zzso availability in obese subjects reflects relatively reduced zzso levels competing with the zzso 

Our findings provide evidence for an association between the neuroendocrine hormones and zzso brain signaling in obese zzso
