The purpose of this study was to examine the zzso effects of a weight-loss dietary regimen with or without zzso 

Thirty-five overweight men were matched and randomly placed into either a control group zzso N zzso 6) or one of three dietary zzso a zzso group zzso N zzso zzso a diet group that performed zzso exercise three times per week zzso N zzso zzso and a diet group that performed both zzso and strength training three times per week zzso N zzso zzso 

After 12 zzso D, zzso and zzso demonstrated a similar and significant zzso zzso zzso zzso reduction in body mass zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with fat mass zzso 69, 78, and zzso of the total loss in body mass, zzso The zzso group also demonstrated a significant reduction in zzso zzso zzso strength, as determined by zzso testing in the bench press and squat exercise was significantly increased for zzso in both the bench press zzso and squat exercise zzso Absolute peak zzso consumption was significantly elevated in DE zzso and zzso zzso There were no differences in performance during a zzso zzso test for the DE and zzso whereas D demonstrated a significant decline in peak and mean power zzso zzso zzso rate zzso zzso zzso zzso was not significantly different for any of the groups except for the DE zzso There were no significant changes in zzso zzso of serum zzso zzso zzso testosterone, and high density zzso zzso cholesterol for any of the zzso zzso total cholesterol and low density zzso zzso cholesterol were significantly decreased for all dietary zzso zzso zzso were significantly reduced for D and zzso at week 6 and remained lower at week 12 for D, while zzso returned to baseline values for zzso 

These data indicate that a weight-loss dietary regimen in conjunction with zzso and resistance exercise prevents the normal decline in zzso mass and muscular power and zzso body zzso zzso strength, and maximum oxygen consumption compared with weight-loss induced by diet zzso
