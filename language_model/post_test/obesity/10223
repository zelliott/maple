The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a zzso zzso exercise bout on zzso and zzso levels as well as insulin sensitivity, until 48 h zzso in healthy overweight zzso Nine subjects performed an exercise bout at an intensity corresponding to approximately zzso of their zzso oxygen consumption for 45 zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin, zzso and insulin sensitivity were measured prior to exercise, immediately after exercise as well as 24 and 48 h after zzso Data were analyzed using repeated measures zzso while zzso correlations were performed to identify possible relationship among the assessed zzso There were no significant differences for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso post, zzso 24 zzso zzso 48 zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso post, zzso 24 zzso zzso 48 zzso zzso across zzso zzso sensitivity increased and insulin concentration decreased significantly only immediately after zzso Furthermore, no significant correlations were observed among the variables assessed except for the expected between insulin level and insulin zzso These results indicate that a zzso zzso workout does not result in significant changes in zzso and zzso up to 48 h zzso Furthermore, it appears that zzso or zzso is not associated with insulin zzso
