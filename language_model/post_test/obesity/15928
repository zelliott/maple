zzso studies demonstrate the need for further investigation of how the association of built environment with physical activity and zzso may differ by zzso zzso The aim of this study was to use a novel statistical technique to identify possible zzso 

Data from the 2002 Strategies for Metro Atlanta's Regional Transportation and Air Quality zzso study were analyzed to explore relationships between measures of residential density, street zzso land use mix, and zzso characteristics of individuals in predicting walking, overweight and obesity zzso zzso Automatic zzso zzso zzso analyses were used to partition the population into zzso zzso 

zzso were more likely to walk if they lived in neighborhoods with greater residential density, greater street connectivity and greater land use zzso A similar relationship was seen in men for the outcomes of obesity and zzso Male residents of more zzso neighborhoods were less likely to be obese or zzso In contrast, features of zzso were related to higher rates of obesity and overweight in women and non zzso 

These analyses reveal that gender and ethnic zzso display substantially different weight outcomes across different levels of zzso In contrast, walking was consistently higher for all groups in the more zzso zzso This information can contribute to better targeting of interventions, and calls for more detailed investigation of the zzso that affect weight and physical activity across zzso This information supports a more efficient use of scarce resources to promote physical activity and healthy body zzso
