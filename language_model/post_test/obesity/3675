zzso methods of assessing resting energy expenditure zzso could be useful in large populations of overweight and obese individuals during zzso of weight loss and weight-loss maintenance to address weight zzso We compared predicted and measured zzso using the zzso handheld device and a zzso indirect zzso in middle-aged men and women who were overweight and obese zzso mass index zzso zzso and zzso Each subject zzso completed zzso indirect zzso and handheld zzso in random zzso A subset of participants zzso completed each of these assessments at three different time points to examine their zzso zzso We found that zzso estimates of zzso were significantly greater than estimates with the zzso indirect zzso and the predicted zzso using the zzso equation zzso zzso correlations were zzso zzso for repeated recordings with the zzso and zzso zzso for traditional indirect zzso The zzso can overestimate zzso in middle-aged zzso individuals and has moderate zzso zzso zzso zzso is the preferred measurement of zzso in this zzso
