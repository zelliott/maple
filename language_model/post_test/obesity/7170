This study investigated the temperature changes at acupuncture points resulting from a weight reduction zzso A standard method using a digital infrared zzso imaging device was employed to monitor the temperature at 20 acupuncture points in 32 participants treated for obesity at an Oriental obesity zzso There were significant temperature increases at all of the acupuncture points except for zzso zzso and zzso zzso The mean total temperature change at the acupuncture points was significantly correlated with the zzso change zzso zzso zzso p zzso The zzso increase in temperature at acupuncture points may reflect improvements in the circulation of energy zzso However, further study is necessary to understand fully the relationship between the temperature at acupuncture points and weight reduction, including the use of appropriate zzso
