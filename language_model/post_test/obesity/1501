Recent studies have shown zzso a zzso zzso zzso to also exert a zzso effect via zzso of insulin zzso To evaluate the effects of zzso on zzso metabolism and to zzso the underlying zzso we conducted a zzso zzso pilot study on 43 type 2 diabetic patients with obesity zzso zzso zzso The subjects were zzso to either treatment with zzso zzso zzso group, zzso or continuation of their current therapy zzso group, zzso In the T group patients, mean zzso and zzso zzso improved markedly (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso respectively), while zzso zzso zzso body weight, waist zzso and visceral fat and subcutaneous fat as determined by zzso slice abdominal CT, showed no significant zzso zzso analyses of serum zzso acids revealed significantly increased zzso acids zzso and decreased zzso acids zzso in the T group zzso However, no correlation was observed between these changes and zzso According to zzso zzso analysis, baseline zzso was the only variable predicting the decrease of zzso zzso among sex, age, zzso total cholesterol, zzso and zzso The index of insulin resistance, zzso zzso did not improve, and the index of zzso cell function, zzso zzso actually increased zzso These results suggests that, in obese patients with type 2 diabetes, the mechanism underlying improved zzso control with zzso treatment involves enhanced zzso cell activity rather than improved insulin zzso
