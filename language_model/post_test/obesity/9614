In a zzso study to evaluate risk factors for zzso cancer in Italy, use of zzso zzso was associated with a moderately increased risk, whereas obesity appeared to be the most important single risk factor related to cancer of the zzso This report considers the zzso and zzso relative risks with regard to various zzso features of tumors zzso stage, zzso grade, extent of zzso invasion, zzso zzso zzso In both zzso users and obese women, the increase in relative risk was greater for earlier than for more advanced zzso These findings, therefore, provide further support for a specific role of both zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

A previous study by the same authors showed that obesity rather than treatment with zzso estrogen, was the most important single risk factor related to zzso zzso This study investigates the zzso of zzso cancer by analyzing how the obesity risk and the zzso risk vary according to various zzso features of the zzso 173 women aged zzso with a zzso confirmed diagnosis of zzso cancer were observed and compared to 347 control subjects, aged zzso with diseases other than zzso zzso or zzso zzso Complete medical histories were zzso An zzso user was defined as a woman with a history of 3 or more months of regular use of zzso zzso zzso women were defined as those with a zzso index of 25 or zzso zzso zzso were taken by zzso of case subjects and zzso of zzso zzso use was zzso zzso users were younger than zzso zzso of users and zzso of zzso were zzso The estimated relative risk for zzso use was higher in Stage 1 tumors, in well differentiated tumors, in tumors not zzso the zzso and in the absence of zzso zzso zzso Long discontinued use of zzso was associated with a lower relative risk than recent use; however, increased likelihood of earlier cancer in zzso users was evident in both zzso zzso was present in zzso of case subjects, and zzso of zzso obese women were older than zzso zzso risk was increased in the same zzso features than for zzso risk, but the odds ratios were significantly zzso These data, while confirming the results of the previous study, show that obese women have a pattern of risk similar to that of zzso users when related to tumor zzso zzso These results may support the role of both zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso in fact, obesity may increase the risk of zzso cancer through an increase of zzso zzso as a result of various mechanisms linked to obesity zzso Further studies are zzso
