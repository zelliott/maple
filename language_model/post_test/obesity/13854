To ascertain the zzso of body size at 2 y of zzso 

: zzso zzso study of risk factors for weight gain of infants at high or low risk of obesity by virtue of their zzso obesity or zzso 

A total of 40 infants of obese mothers and 38 infants of lean mothers, equally divided among boys and zzso 

zzso of dependent zzso weight, length and zzso thicknesses at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months and percent body fat at 3, 12 and 24 zzso zzso of independent zzso average daily caloric consumption at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 zzso and, at 3 months, zzso sucking behavior during a test zzso total energy expenditure zzso sleeping energy expenditure zzso zzso of zzso energy expenditure zzso and socioeconomic zzso zzso weights and heights were obtained by self-report at the time of zzso zzso correlation and mixed effects linear zzso analyses were zzso 

zzso of body size zzso zzso zzso zzso and percent of body fat were almost identical between zzso and low-risk groups at all zzso Energy intake during six occasions over the 2 zzso sucking behavior, family income and zzso predicted weight gain, controlling for body zzso zzso body mass index was not associated with the child's body size during the first 2 zzso During the first year, there were strong lagged correlations between energy intake and body weight and smaller correlations between protein intake and body zzso 

Energy zzso and not energy zzso was the zzso of body size in these infants at 2 y of age, as it had been at 1 zzso zzso behavior and zzso zzso and family income zzso also contributed to body weight at 2 zzso The novel finding of a lagged correlation between energy intake and body weight early in life suggests that energy intake is programmed for future growth and zzso
