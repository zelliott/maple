This study compared the ability of the zzso zzso zzso model with that of zzso models used in zzso infusion devices to predict the zzso and zzso of zzso in various patient groups zzso pregnant women, young men, normal weight adults, and obese zzso With a zzso model, loss of consciousness zzso and recovery of consciousness zzso corresponded to a narrow range of brain tissue zzso zzso zzso With the zzso models, predicted effect zzso were also within a narrow range at zzso but were outside the range at zzso In individuals of normal weight, zzso of variation zzso of the predicted brain or effect zzso at zzso were in a similar zzso zzso and zzso In obese individuals, however, zzso zzso values for brain or effect zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso This comparison suggests the increased flexibility of zzso models over zzso models, the latter of which rely heavily on the patient group from which the model was zzso The incorporation of zzso models may provide zzso infusions with enhanced ability to predict response in a wide variety of zzso
