zzso a novel zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso has been reported to have zzso actions and induce weight gain in addition to its zzso zzso Interestingly, recent data indicate that zzso is zzso in human zzso which is also known to be accompanied by reduced zzso zzso 

To investigate the influence of weight loss on circulating levels of zzso we recruited eight obese women among patients attending a zzso weight-loss course organized by The Danish Heart zzso We measured body composition including computerized zzso as well as zzso plasma zzso zzso before and after weight zzso 

Plasma zzso zzso increased by zzso following weight loss zzso zzso and the increase in zzso levels was positively correlated with the extent of weight loss zzso zzso zzso P zzso Exposure to zzso zzso zzso did not influence zzso zzso levels either before or after weight zzso Our data further suggest the existence of zzso in a single subject with long-standing obesity but no signs of zzso zzso 

This study provides evidence of a zzso suppression of zzso associated with zzso The feasibility of measuring zzso in the circulation provides a new tool for the investigation of the complex hormonal regulation of appetite and energy zzso
