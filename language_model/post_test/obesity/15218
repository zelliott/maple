zzso zzso is involved in beta zzso function and insulin action zzso Here, we verified the possible preventive effect of zzso in high-fat diet zzso obesity and zzso intolerance and in the disruption of pancreatic zzso zzso zzso Swiss mice were distributed into four groups: mice fed on zzso diet zzso % of saturated fat, zzso zzso zzso mice fed on zzso diet and supplemented with 5 % zzso control zzso and zzso After 19 weeks of diet and zzso treatments, zzso zzso insulin sensitivity and zzso zzso were zzso zzso mice presented higher body weight and fat zzso and were zzso zzso zzso intolerant and insulin zzso Their pancreatic zzso zzso high levels of insulin in the presence of increasing zzso zzso and 30 zzso zzso zzso supplementation improved zzso tolerance and insulin sensitivity with a higher ratio of zzso zzso zzso related to zzso total protein content zzso following insulin administration in the liver without altering body weight and fat deposition in zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso mice released insulin similarly to zzso zzso zzso intake induced zzso zzso increased zzso area and zzso and zzso mass content in the zzso zzso prevented zzso and zzso area, and zzso and zzso mass zzso induced by zzso The total insulin content in zzso zzso was higher than that of zzso zzso and was not altered in zzso zzso In conclusion, for the first time, we showed that zzso enhances liver zzso zzso and prevents zzso zzso zzso adaptations induced by zzso
