To investigate whether zzso breathing and/or plasma zzso levels are associated with insulin resistance independent of obesity or fat distribution in zzso sleep zzso syndrome zzso 

zzso clinical zzso 

zzso and thirteen Japanese patients with zzso aged zzso years were divided into three groups: 30 with mild zzso zzso index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso minimum oxygen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 98 with moderate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 85 with severe zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients undergoing diabetic treatments zzso mild, nine moderate and 10 zzso were excluded from the assessment of insulin resistance and plasma zzso zzso 

Fat distribution zzso according to visceral zzso and subcutaneous zzso fat areas using zzso zzso scanning at the zzso zzso blood pressure, zzso parameters and hormones including insulin and zzso were zzso After full zzso zzso blood was collected between zzso and zzso zzso 

Severe zzso patients were more zzso than mild and moderate zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso and zzso plasma insulin and zzso model assessment of insulin resistance zzso levels were all higher in severe zzso than mild and moderate zzso zzso zzso was correlated not only with obesity zzso mass index zzso V and S zzso but also with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, zzso was correlated positively with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure zzso zzso and free fatty acids zzso and zzso with high density zzso zzso suggesting that insulin resistance is a key component of the zzso syndrome in zzso Plasma zzso levels were not different between mild, moderate and severe zzso zzso Plasma zzso levels were correlated with zzso and V area, but not zzso or zzso zzso zzso multiple zzso analysis, however, revealed that zzso zzso and plasma zzso were independently associated with zzso 

zzso breathing was associated with insulin resistance independent of zzso Although plasma zzso was also an independent zzso of zzso in zzso patients, plasma zzso was more closely related to obesity than to sleep zzso Although treatment of zzso breathing with zzso continuous positive airway pressure reportedly improves insulin sensitivity, our findings suggest that treatment of obesity is also essential in zzso insulin resistance at least through increased plasma zzso levels in zzso
