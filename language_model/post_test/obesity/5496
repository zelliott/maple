The unique worldwide spread of the human species and the remarkably long zzso survival show that our zzso permits excellent adaptation to vastly different zzso Moreover, the main zzso of later age, namely zzso zzso and zzso appear in humans later than in zzso zzso In recent years, excess weight and obesity have become mass phenomena with a pronounced upward trend in all developed zzso However, despite the zzso effects of being overweight, these populations live longer than ever, which in part may be explained by the availability of better medical zzso The prevalence and predicted further spread of obesity can be understood in the light of zzso In all animal species energy metabolism is zzso with energy zzso zzso zzso being the necessary condition of survival during hard zzso For humans, which are no different to other animals in this respect, this genetic programming was necessary for survival because during the course of history, including the recorded history in the more developed Middle East, Europe or China, there was never a long period of uninterrupted food zzso whereas zzso were regular and zzso Therefore fat zzso when food was available, meant survival at times of zzso while the possible zzso effects of zzso in food and being overweight expressed in zzso old age were zzso It is the central, mostly zzso fat (in both humans and zzso that is more medically important than the subcutaneous zzso fat, and the zzso of both types of fat is zzso by high food zzso therefore it is a historic novelty for human zzso In contrast, zzso fat in human females is unique in the animal zzso it is much less metabolically active, it is of much lower zzso significance than central fat, and it is programmed to be mobilized mostly during pregnancy and zzso In view of all this, norms of desired weight should be based on hard mortality and morbidity statistics and not on zzso zzso or fashion zzso By this zzso the upper limit of desirable weight is likely to be body mass index zzso 27 or 28, but specified for different populations zzso race, ethnic zzso moreover, with aging, the zzso effects of obesity diminish and finally zzso zzso of other zzso related to obesity zzso diabetes, hypertension and coronary disease) are also zzso However, total zzso measured by zzso is insufficiently sensitive as a risk factor, and fat distribution zzso versus zzso type, as reflected by waist circumference and zzso zzso plays at least as prominent a zzso Therefore the detailed zzso not yet available, should take into account both general obesity and fat distribution and be specific for different zzso Since long-term weight loss in adults is rarely achievable, public health measures should be aggressively directed at the prevention of obesity from zzso
