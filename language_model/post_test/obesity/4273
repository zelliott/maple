zzso has been zzso associated with risk of completed suicide in several cohort studies, but putative mechanisms for this association and its zzso throughout the United States are zzso We zzso recent zzso state-level data on rates of zzso completed suicide (by zzso firearm ownership, smoking, major depression, income, education, white race, and zzso residence, compiled from federal agencies and surveys, and determined the adjusted zzso correlations of statewide obesity rates with measures of completed and attempted zzso zzso prevalence of obesity was strongly zzso correlated with age adjusted suicide rate zzso zzso zzso The correlation was somewhat stronger for rates of zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso and was of similar magnitude as the positive correlations of firearm prevalence with suicide rate zzso zzso or of obesity with prevalence of diabetes zzso zzso In analyses of fatal and nonfatal suicidal acts, obesity rates were zzso correlated with rates of suicidal acts using firearms zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not other zzso zzso rates were also zzso correlated with the zzso ratios of acts using poisoning zzso zzso Thus, statewide rates of obesity are strongly zzso correlated with rates of completed suicide in multivariable zzso a finding that appears to relate to fewer attempts by zzso and a lower zzso ratio for poisonings, although the mechanism for the inverse correlation with zzso zzso requires further zzso
